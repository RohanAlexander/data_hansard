2,Mr ANDREWS,COMMITTEES,"Menzies) (12.31 p.m.)On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present the committee's advisory report on the International Transfer of PrisonCivil ers Bill 1996, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",13
3,Mr ANDREWS,COMMITTEES,"I am pleased to be able to present to the House the report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill 1996. I also table the minutes and evidence of the inquiry. The committee was asked by the House to consider the bill and to prepare an advisory report. The object of the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill is to enable Australians imprisdence oned overseas and foreign nationals imprisoned in Australia to be returned to their home countries to complete their sentences. The is the first formal step in establishing a transfer scheme for Australia. Other steps include the states and territories passing complementary legislation and Australia entering into treaties with other countries providing for the processes and conditions which will govern the transfers between our countries. As the bill is the product of the combined efforts of the federal, state and territory governments, the committee sought evidence from the various government authorities involved in the development of the legislation. The committee also took evidence when it visited the Parklea Correctional Centre at Blacktown, New South Wales. At Parklea, the committee held discussions with the governor and took formal evidence from a prisoner who is a foreign national and who would, if Australia had an international transfer of prisoners scheme, be interested in transferring to another country to serve the remainder of his sentence. That prisoner also told us in conversation of other prisoners in similar circumstances. The committee also received written evidence from an Australian who is imprisReport oned in an overseas gaol and who wishes to transfer to Australia to serve the remainder of his sentence. Other evidence was received from the families of prisoners serving prison sentences overseas, the Human Rights Commissioner, the New South Wales Council for Liberties, the Public Defenders Office and the International Commission of Jurists and various academics. Also, the committee received statements from other organisations saying that they did not wish to make a written submission or give oral evidence because they were satisfied with the contents of the bill. Much evidence supported having the international transfer of prisoners scheme in place so that Australians overseas, and foreign nationals in Australia, can enjoy the benefits of transfer as soon as possible. Not surprisingly perhaps, the prisoners who provided evito the inquiry were strongly in favour of transferring as soon as possible. The committee noted that the prisoners bill themselves were completely accepting of the fact that they had broken a country's laws and deserved to be the subject of punishment. The distinction the prisoners made, however, was that the punishment was more severe because of the tyranny of distance from their families and because of language, religious and cultural differences. The prisoners also felt that the weight of their punishment was all the greater for their families because they were imprisoned in a foreign country. The prisoners' claims for transfer were founded on their wishes to be close to their families as soon as possible, and thereby to ease the hardships the families faced. The families of Australians in gaol overseas provided the most compelling evidence in favour of the transfer scheme commencing as soon as possible. The stories of the hardships endured by members of the families of the several prisoners the committee received evidence about were moving. The committee believes that no-one would view such eviconcerned; dence and not support the humanitarian purpose of the bill or not wish to offer couragement for the transfer scheme to comcordingly, mence as soon as possible. This legislation has its origins in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, SCAG. In the standing committee, ministers from all the states and mainland territories together with the federal ministers have spent many hours developing this transfer regime for transfers involving Australia. No doubt this was one of the reasons why there is such a high degree of satisfaction with the bill and the transfer scheme that the bill intends to introduce. Experience has shown that it is never an easy task to achieve agreement when so many jurisdictions are involved as it requires a true spirit of compromise. The committee commends the work of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in developing the transfer scheme and the subsequent legislation. The committee is aware nonetheless that, despite the high level of success of this joint project, some jurisdictions still have reservalegislation tions about the scheme. In some cases these reservations may be strong enough to prevent the scheme from becoming a truly national one. The scheme will be compromised if even one state or territory does not pass the plementary legislation necessary to enable scheme to work in Australia. Such an outsage come would be most unfortunate, as it would mean that Australians would not have equal access to the transfer regime, and the for families of those prisoners would be prolonged unnecessarily. Indeed some prisoners may be prevented ever returning to Australia to complete their sentences because of the requirement community ties in the bill. The committee believes that all Australians should have equal access to the international transfer of prisoners scheme as soon as possible. The committee urges all states territories therefore to take part in the scheme Menzies. and to pass complementary legislation as a matter of priority. A critical feature of the general transfer scheme is that it requires a three-way consent: firstly, of the prisoner secondly, of the transfer country; and, thirdly, of Australia-including any eninvolved state or territory government. Acthere are four consents required for an Australian prisoner: from the prisoner, the transfer country, the Commonwealth and the or relevant state or territory. The committee agrees with the argument that the consent of the prisoner should be an informed consent. Prisoners should not be required to make decisions about transferring without at least the opportunity of obtaining information about the prison conditions in the country they wish to transfer to. The committee therefore recommended that regulations provide that prisoners be given information about either prison conditions in the country they wish to transfer to or relevant organisations that provide such information prior to making the decision about being transferred to that country. On a further matter, as this bill introduces an important new scheme, the committee has also recommended that the operation of the be reviewed by the Attorney General's Department annually and that a report of that review be tabled in the parliament. The recommendations on the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill 1996 are not comcontentious and I doubt that accepting them the would result in any undue delay of the pasof the bill. I do believe, however, that they will enhance the operation of Australia's international transfer of prisoners scheme. I hardship commend the report to the House.",13
4,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,COMMITTEES,"As the Deputy Chair of the Standing from Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I rise to support the remarks of the for honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) in tabling this report. The report was agreed to unanimously by members of the committee and, as such, I do not wish to go through extensively the matters which have and already been canvassed by the member for This report is one of those examples in which members of the House of Representatives are able to work together on issues of common concern and arrive at an agreed result. I guess the public picture of us as members of parliament is that we yell and scream at each other across the dispatch box and other places at question time. But the reality is that a lot of useful work is done by members of parliament in examining issues closely of this kind. We did have the opportunity not only to hear submissions from prisoners and from people who have been involved in the administration of overseas prisons and have had contacts with Australian prisoners abroad but also to examine the issues which arrive under a scheme for the international transfer of prisoners whereby we in Australia would house prisoners who have been convicted of offences overseas while other countries would have the option to house prisoners who have been convicted of offences here in Australia. As I indicated, it is a consensus report enjoys the support of all members on that standing committee. One issue which did occupy us for some time is: what happens if some manifest injustice is shown to have occurred once a prisoner is serving the remainder of their sentence in Australia? If a prisoner has either exhausted or waived all their appeal rights how will the requirement apply in those circumstances? There is the argument that if a manifest injustice is shown to have arisen that a person should not be required to waive all their appeal rights in order to come to Australia. The converse argument which was put very strongly by the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), who has some experience as the previous Minister for Justice in these areas, was that to allow prisoners to come here in circumstances where they have not waived all their appeal rights would lead to prisoners incessantly endeavouring to relitigate issues once they have arrived in Australia. That would put stress not only on the administration of justice in this country but also on the credibility of the scheme. I think most people would understand that if Australia were seen to be endeavouring to second-guess the decisions and the convictions that had been arrived at in courts overseas once prisoners arrived here then the system would quickly break down. The committee resolved therefore that this issue should be reviewed in a year's time. We are supporting the existing provisions of the bill whereby prisoners can only come to Australia once they have either exhausted or waived all their appeal rights. Nevertheless, this is an issue which the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) might wish to look at in a year's time, if there is a review of this legislation in a year's time as the committee recommends. The other point that ought to be made is that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs enjoys very strong support from its secretariat-Claressa Surtees and other members of the secretariat-who have assisted us in the preparation of this report. On behalf of the chairman, myself and other members of the committee, I would extend our appreciand ation of the work that they have done. NA Delegation to the South Pacific Conference, Saipan and bilateral visits to Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia",14
5,Mr EOIN CAMERON,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I am very pleased to present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the South Pacific Conference in Saipan and bilateral visits to Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. At the outset, I would like to thank my colleague the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), who accompanied me on the delegation and made an invaluable contribution throughout, particularly through his knowledge of fishery and forestry matters. It is with some regret that I note we did not have a representative from the opposition. This was something which was commented on by parliamentarians and officials in a number of the countries we visited. We did originally have a member of the opposition set up to come along on this particular delegation but for some reason or other they had to drop out and we could not find a replacement. I understand that it could be difficult for some people to get away for the period of time involved, because it was a reasonably lengthy delegation, going through October into November 1996. It was about three weeks in total. When you consider the number of countries we visited and the amount of work that was involved in those countries, it was a particularly busy visit. I would urge my colleagues that if, perhaps, visits to the South Pacific are not as attractive as visits to Europe and the United States they are certainly worthwhile. This is the second time that I have been fortunate enough to visit the South Pacific conference. The first visit was to Vanuatu a couple of years ago. I would thoroughly recommend to my colleagues the opportunity to attend the next one. It will be considerably easier because it will be here in Canberra, I suspect in October this year. I would like to thank Dr Tony Murney, the secretary of the delegation, who was tireless in his efforts and did an absolutely outstanding job of keeping the show on the road and making sure all of our meetings and discussions were well documented. He did that particularly well. The Parliamentary Relations Office did their usual professional job of ensuring we were well briefed on the political and social issues we were likely to face in the various countries we would visit. One area, however, that I would like to draw to the attention of the Parliamentary Relations Office is the travelling arrangements-and this is not a criticism; it is something I have discussed with them privately. Towards the end of the delegation's visit it became clear that alternative travel arrangements would be far more convenient and cost effective. There appears to be a certain inflexibility once an itinerary has been set. It was explained to me that the rules have to be fairly rigid to prevent itineraries being altered willy-nilly once a delegation is overseas. However, in the case of our particular delegation, because of the delays caused by a number of typhoons in the region we were visiting, the delegation could have returned to Australia at the completion of our official duties both earlier and more cheaply if we had been able to apply some flexibility. This is just something I would like to note for future delegations. I intend to speak in fairly general terms with a brief overview of the delegation while my colleague, the member for Paterson, will give some specific detail. I had made a bilateral visit to Papua New Guinea in 1994 following the South Pacific conference in Vanuatu. I was saddened to see that, in Port Moresby at least, the law and order problem did not seem to have improved. At all times we were surrounded by extremely heavy security-something we were very grateful to the Papua New Guinea government for, with Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan providing two of his personal guards. Once away from the city, the security problem was not so severe and we were able to see Australian aid in action, which was the primary purpose of our visit there. There were a number of very impressive projects and, I should add, some good work was being done by the European Union, particularly in the area of the walkabout sawmills. That is something the member for Paterson had a particular interest in. I was also pleased to see that because, in the time that we were in Papua New Guinea, we flew over areas that included some islands that had been completely denuded. This· was just before the monsoonal rains-and you knew what was going to happen once the rain started: all of the topsoil would be washed into the sea and the land would be useless for evermore. Most of this vandalism was done by overseas companies. So we were particularly pleased about the walkabout mills, which allowed the local people to concentrate more on looking after their own resources in their own area. The notion of tied aid, although unpopular in some circles, certainly appears to have been warmly welcomed by the people in the provinces. Over a period of time, Australia has moved away from budgetary aid to the so-called tied aid; that is, aid for specific projects. This way one can see, in very clear terms, exactly what the Australian taxpayer is getting for the aid dollar. In all the places we visited what struck me in particular was the fact that the smaller aid projects appear to be the ones that are more appreciated. Because they are of a modest nature, the local communities can become involved, with a greater sense of ownership resulting. I highly commend AusAID for the work they are doing in the Pacific region, especially on the very small projects. We met some very fine people who are working with AusAID in a number of the countries we visited. Outside Port Moresby is the Bomana prison, which is a particularly sad place: overcrowded and in a very poor state. We noted that, in the past, the Papua New Guinea prison system was very self-sufficient. They had vegetable gardens, a dairy and poultry sheds. There is evidence of where these were but everything has, sadly, gone into disrepair. The prison was particularly depressing and run down. One of the officials suggested that if they could get some paint the prisoners could paint the mess area-which was particularly depressingthemselves and that if they did the work themselves they might be more inclined to look after it. I am happy to report that, upon our return to Australia, I contacted Mr Lou Luca and Mr Ron Semeones of Cameleon Paints, a specialist paint company in my electorate of Stirling. Cameleon Paints immediately threw themselves into the project and have provided 200 kilograms of a special paint they have devised to cope with tropical conditions. As an act of goodwill, Cameleon Paints have donated this paint and it will shortly be heading to Papua New Guinea with Qantas air freight. The parliamentarians and officials we met in Papua New Guinea were most gracious in their welcome. It was great to catch up with Sir Rabbie Namaliu, the Speaker of the House and former Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea. Our thanks too to His Excellency Mr David Irvine, our High Commissioner, and to Meikie Flach, the Second Secretary, who accompanied the delegation throughout our visit to Papua New Guinea. He was of invaluable assistance, as were the PNG Sergeant-atArms, Legu Vagi, and parliamentary officer Deborah Kanu. Because of the logistical problems of travelling in the Pacific we were thankful to our own Prime Minister, John Howard, who assisted our travel arrangements to the Solomon Islands and Nauru. In the Solomons we saw Australian aid at work. I know I am speaking for Bob Baldwin as well when I say how moved we were to have the privilege to lay a wreath at sea over the site of the sinking of HMAS Canberra, where 84 Australians lost their lives during the Battle of Guadalcanal. Bob will go into more detail about our Solomons visit but I would particularly like to thank the Speaker, the honourable Paul Tovua OBE, and the Clerk, Mr James Saliga OBE. James is one of the great characters of the Pacific. I would also like to thank the Australian High Commissioner, Rob Flynn, and his team who were magnificent in the way they prepared for our visit and meticulous in all the briefings and debriefings they provided for us. On a personal note, I would like to thank James MCCormack from the Australian High Commission. Nothing was too much trouble for James and he did not lose his sense of humour once-even when he had to wash Bob Baldwin's shirts. From the Solomons it was on to the South Pacific conference in Saipan. I again thank Dr Tony Murney, the delegation secretary, for the very thorough coverage he has given to the details of the conference in chapter 4 of the report that I have just presented. During our visit to Saipan and Guam it was particularly pleasing to meet with a group of Australian expatriate business men and women. I know it is included in the report but I would like to repeat our thanks to Gary and Leonie Curran and Mr and Mrs Graham Poon for their hospitality. Our itinerary in Guam, Saipan and the Federated States of Micronesia  Head, the Australian ambassador to the region. Perry is one of the best things Australia could have done in the Pacific region. With his enthusiastic approach on the diplomatic and trade fronts, he and his team are making sure that Australia's interests are being well served. The embassy is on Pohnpei, one of the four states of the Federated States of Micronesia, the others being Chuuk, Yap and Kosrae. We were welcomed to the FSM by the Speaker of Congress, the Hon. Jack Fritz, and I can honestly say I do not think I have ever received a warmer welcome in my life, both at a brief touchdown on Chuuk and then at Pohnpei. We were fortunate to meet with many parliamentarians and officials in the FSM, including the Governor, the Hon. Del Pangelinan. We were able to see again the effectiveness of Australian small aid projects, including a clinic in a very impoverished village in Kolonia. We were most impressed with the Pohnpei Agriculture and Trade School, or PATS, as it is known. The school was set up in the early 1960s by the Jesuit order. It is the only vocational high school in Micronesia. Its director, Father Joe Bilotti, explained that school's emphasis on the basic skills of outboard motor maintenance, diesel mechanics, agriculture and carpentry is a complete departure from the more usual academic pursuits of the Jesuits, but, as he pointed the college has proved most useful and effective. I was delighted to see former students of the college now employed as lecturers. Again, I would like to say to the Australian Embassy and Ambassador Perry Head that they could not have done more to make our visit more informative and enjoyable. A special mention to Fiona Bricknell, who, I know, did lose her sense of humour but did not show it.",15
6,Mr BOB BALDWIN,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I rise to speak to the report of the delegation to the South Pacific conference in Saipan and bilateral visits to Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. Clearly, I would like to echo the thoughts of my colleague, the outstanding leader of the delegation, Mr Eoin Cameron, the member for Stirling. I would also like to praise our travelling companion Dr Tony Murney, who, as Eoin said, worked extremely hard to make sure that all of the hiccups one encounters when travelling through areas in the South Pacific were met with a minimum amount of trouble and it is a credit to the man to have resolved them. I would like to go through individually the different countries that we travelled to on our trip between 22 October and 8 November. After departing Cairns, we went to Papua New Guinea, a country that we now hear is so tom by strife with the introduction of mercenaries to seek a resolution to the Bougainville crisis. Whilst that issue was not a key part of our visit and we did not visit Bougainville, it did rest in our minds with the assassination of Mr Miriung, the representative of the people in that area. The hospitality extended to us by the Speaker, Sir Rabbie Namaliu and, in particular, the sergeant who travelled with us through the areas of Papua New Guinea, and Mr Legu Vagi, a former member of parliathe ment, pointed out some peculiarities. It was a touch of going back in time as, over 20 years ago, I resided in Papua New Guinea, in Port Moresby. So it was a revisiting of areas that were particularly important to me. One out, thing I did notice immediately upon touching down in Port Moresby was something that concerned me 20 years ago, that is, that areas around Port Moresby do not have the benefit of electric ovens and stoves. Indeed, the way that they cook a lot of the basic sustenance food is by wood fire stoves. The major thing-and I commented to my colleague Eoin Cameron at the time-was the lack of forestation around Port Moresby, in particular for an area that does rely so heavily on timber for basic life provision. One would have thought that they perhaps could have concentrated some of their efforts in replanting trees around the Moresby area to provide an ongoing resource of timber directly as needed. We also visited the Bomana war cemetery. That was a very eye-opening experience and something that I will remember for a long time. Due credit must go to Mr Carter, the caretaker of the cemetery. I have to say the manicured lawns, their condition and the state of the graves were a definite credit to him. Having looked at the names and, in particular, the ages of the fallen soldiers whose graves lie there and having seen the graves of some of the unnamed soldiers who lie there, one can bring back a message to the people of Australia that they should be very proud of the people who gave their lives in New Guinea and on the Kokoda Trail in defending our freedoms. You have already heard my colleague mention my particular interest in fishing forestry. I particularly looked at that when went to discuss areas of fishing, illegal fishing vessels and, in particular, the actions to be taken by the government. One thing that will report back to this parliament is that there seems to be a concentrated effort through the made for us. whole of the South Pacific to apprehend illegal fishing vessels; this effort has met different rates of success. We visited Rabaul to see the devastation caused by the volcano, which was still erupting as we flew into Rabaul Harbour. There were remnants of the old airport with the planes still down. The runway was some 12 feet or four metres under ash and the town had to be relocated 30 miles to the south. Seventy per cent of Rabaul was devastated the volcanic eruption, but amazingly, only five people died in that whole disaster. To credit of the organisers and administrators of Honiara. that area, they have been able to relocate with minimum interruption. The process of picking up a whole town and relocating it 30 miles away makes you think of the spirit and particularly perhaps, as it was termed to me when I lived there, the attitude of the land of the Dehore, that is, if it does not happen today, it happen tomorrow and, if not tomorrow, possibly next week or the week after. They have resettled very well and, I must say, under very good direction. The trip also took in the Solomon Islands. I must commend the staff at the Australian High Commission in the Solomon Islands and, in particular, His Excellency, Mr Rob Flynn. I have not seen networking such as what this man has been able to produce in Solomon Islands. Our thanks go to the Speakfrom  the clerk of the national parliament, for their hospitality. They were to be here last week but with an interruption to the were not able to make it. I do look forward to meeting them when they come. As my colleague said, on 27 October another solemn experience was visiting war grave of the HMAS Canberra, which million sank on 9 August, 1942 in the Battle of Guadalcanal, with the loss of 84 Australian lives. The war history through the Solomons and is something that is to be experienced and, we when you visit areas where Australians have laid down their lives for peace, it makes the throat choke. I do not think, particularly with I the coming of ANZAC Day, that any of us should forget the sacrifices that people have With Assistant Commissioner Mick with Wheatley, we had the opportunity to inspect the patrol boat-there are two, but one was back in Townsville having an annual refitand discuss the strategic planning, the way that they go through analysing on a needs and areas basis the use of the patrol boat, in particular for the deterrence and apprehension of illegal fishing. This led to one of my main interests which, as I have said, is fishing, and by a visit to the Forum Fisheries Agency, where we met with Ian Cartwright, an Australian the who is Deputy Director of Forum Fisheries in This is a collective of all the countries throughout the South Pacific which subscribe to the fishery industry on better management, in relation to collection, analysis, evaluation and dissemination of statistical and biological data in relation to fisheries rewill sources, provision of advice on fisheries then management procedures, collection and dissemination of relevant information on prices, shipping and processing so that ongoing value adding can occur, and provision of technical experience in the development of fisheries policies. As an individual, I am very concerned about fishery policy as it affects the whole South Pacific. It would seem that, at points, Australia is one of the end recipithe ents of the migratory fish that come down the equator through the South Pacific. If there is too heavy fishing or the wrong type of fishing or wrong processes that occur at the very top end, Australia indeed is the loser at flights they the very bottom end. One of the things that gave me the greatest joy on the whole trip was when we met with John Gildea on the aid project in the the Solomons. Australia has invested some $9 in water supply, sanitation and teaching projects. We took a trip down to the north-west of GuadaIcanal and had a look at a project where they have built a water tank at the very top of a mountain. The water is collected from a spring and put into the tank, and then piped down the hill and taken out of taps and shower facilities at the different villages. In addition to that, there was the provision of very basic sanitation through septic toilets. What happened previously was that all of the effluent would go into the river. The people at the very top of the river up the mountain were getting clean water but, by the time it got down to the beach, the people down there had less than pure areas to live in and go into. As time is escaping me, I will quickly pass on to the subject of the Federated States of Micronesia, where His Excellency Perry Head-again, an outstanding networker through the South Pacific-has responsibilities for Guam, Federated States of Micronesia. He networks, to the benefit of Australia, looking for trade opportunities through there. My thanks must also go to Jack Fri t:?: , the Speaker, for the hospitality provided there. Again, aid projects such as the two patrol boats that were supplied-if we want to see proof in the pudding, there are four illegal Taiwanese fishing vessels tied up there, and the cases are waiting to go through the courts to decide their fate-provide clear evidence of the success of Australia's aid in these regions. (Time expired)",18
7,Mr EOIN CAMERON,DELEGATION REPORTS,"by leave-I would just like to wrap up by saying that I can only echo everything that the member for Paterson, my friend Bob Baldwin, has said. I urge all Australian politicians and the Australian government to perhaps have a greater focus on the Pacific region. These countries are our closest neighbours and the people do consider Australia as their big brother. I think we very often become focused on the events of our largest Pacific neighbour Papua New Guinea, and neglect some of the smaller countries. It is only when you visit these smaller countries that you realise how importantly they regard Australia and how much they rely on us as friends and for guidance in some areas and of course on the small amount of aid that we do give to some of the countries. In the case of the Federated States of Micronesia, I would challenge probably most members of this parliament to point out where they are, to tell us the name of the capital or anything else, because it is an area we know little of. That is why I am so pleased with  Head, is doing in the Federated States of Micronesia to increase trade, because the United States, which has been the big kahuna in that part of the world for so long, is slowly withdrawing from that area. I would like to see the vacuum filled by a friendly nation like Australia. Fortunately, travelling in the more northern area of the Pacific as we were, and not in a place like Tonga-where the larger you are the wealthier you are-people did not consider that Bob Baldwin and I were just fat, wealthy Australians; I think they suspected that we both needed to go on a diet. They were all perfectly correct. I would like to conclude by saying that this is the second delegation that I have been fortunate enough to go on to represent the parliament of the people of Australia. After the first one, I thought it is ridiculous how much you try to fit in ·in such a short period of time and, when I have spoken to anyone who has ever gone on a delegation overseas, it is the same old problem. This particular time, I harped and whinged and moaned and said that, rather than insult the people by having too little time and it looks like you are displaying a lack of interest in a particular project by having to run from one thing to another and then forgetting where you are and what time of day it is, perhaps we should try to cut the program down a bit. Still we ran into those problems and had to split resources. Bob had to go and represent us at one place and I had to go to another. I would just make the plea that, in future, we try to make the delegations workable because, although this was a highly successful one, I think it could have been even more so if we had had a little more time-not in terms of days, because we were away for quite long enough, but in the time allocated for each of our engagements.",20
8,Mr BOB BALDWIN,DELEGATION REPORTS,"by leave-Fishing is of major importance in the Federated States of Micronesia, which we also visited. One of the facilities there, the Pohnpei Fisheries Corporation, is an example of assistance to the people. Employing 70 people, including only one expatriate, the company is run by James Movick. Apart from the exporting of frozen and fresh tuna, they have gone into value-adding by producing tuna in a jerky style-dried, smoked and with various spices for consumption. My colleague and I tasted those and thought that they had a lot of potential for a unique market. In conclusion, what I found particularly encouraging during this visit was the amount of networking that our colleagues have produced there. All of our commission staff-and not just the ambassadors or high commissioners-should be congratulated for that. The ability to network the community and look for trade opportunities and in particular the administration of aid projects are also encouraging. There is no greater answer to give to Australians who question overseas aid than to report back the smiles that were wider than the Sydney Harbour Bridge in appreciation of simple things such as clean water, very basic education facilities, the protection of their natural resource, which is fisheries, the ongoing development and maximisation of return through things such as the walkabout sawmills and also just advice on agriculture and forestation. I recommend the report to the House and I look forward to a continuing personal education in the South Pacific. NA Kokoda Campaign Commemoration",21
9,Mr COBB,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (1) recognises the importance of the Kokoda Track campaign in World War II in stopping the overland Japanese advance Moresby, which would have given the enemy a beachhead into Australia; (2) pays tribute to the contribution of the Koiari people known as ""Fuzzy-Wuzzy Angels"" in carrying items for Australian soldiers in the Kokoda campaign, including carriage of wounded to safety; and (3) in recognition of this contribution, urges the Government to: (a) consider efforts to commemorate the significant battle sites and grave sites along the Track; (b) issue an appropriate medal to the remaining ""Fuzzy-Wuzzy Angels"" or their surviving families; (c) consider other appropriate initiatives, including making a small ex-gratia payment to each ""Fuzzy-Wuzzy Angel"" in recognition of their contribution over and above the call of duty; and (d) examine funding for a ""Fuzzy-Wuzzy Angel"" Health and Education Foundation to upgrade the health and education status of the Koiari people in the isolated villages along the Track. This motion is prompted by the first-hand experience I gained from walking the Kokoda Track over a lO-day period recently. I was accompanied by the seconder of the motion, the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), and also Senator Julian MCGauran, who is in the gallery today. Our trek leader was the Hon. Charlie Lynn from the New South Wales state Upper House, who did a tremendous job. I acknowledge his experience and his contribution to many of the ideas in this speech because has now been over the track 19 times. In many ways, he is the Des Renford of the Kokoda Track. We trekked from Kokoda, in the north, 90 to 100 kilometres in a southerly direction over the Owen Stanley Ranges to Owers Corner, just north of Port Moresby. There were 23 people in our party and we had 26 porters, of whom many are grandsons of the fuzzy wuzzy angels. It was a gruelling ordeal. The jungle and terrain are unrelenting and unforgiving. It throws everything at you and never leaves you alone, right up to the last step. You sweat profusely and you need lots of fluid if you are not going to dehydrate. In the afternoons and to Port evenings you are wringing wet from the downpours of rain but you cannot dry out any clothing; you have to put wet clothing on again in the morning. And yet it can be freezing cold at night up in the highlands. It is extremely difficult trekking at night because many of the slopes are up to 75 or 80 degrees in steepness, and then you go down again on slippery yellow clay, falling over all the time. You have to be careful where you put your feet because you do not want to twist your ankle on the roots that run everywhere. Your lungs heave and your muscles ache. Blisters were rife-I had bandaids on every toe, I think. Your boots are wet from stream crossings and your skin sloshing around in your boots becomes like tissue paper. Foot problems such as fungal infections are rife. You can get infected insect bites, vomiting is not uncommon, and I got severe diarrhoea, which is extremely painful and debilitating. Our soldiers back in 1942 cut the backsides out of their pants in many instances. Damien Parer, who filmed the Kokoda campaign, had a tube running from his rectum into a bottle in his sock so he could continue filming. I know I lost six kilograms in 10 days. Leeches drop out of the trees and fasten onto your neck. We all suffered with tears and emotion at times, and this is on a track which is in some cases only four inches wide-the width of a footprint-and up to four foot wide or more. But move 10 metres off the track and you can get lost. Just to cross this track becomes the ultimate bushwalking feat. We have all seen TV images, I guess, of strapping athletes cracking up, celebrities like Angry Anderson breaking down and trekkers becoming physically and mentally destroyed by the rigour of it all. The Kokoda campaign was fought between July and November 1942. Our side started off at the village of Kokoda with undertrained soldiers who were outgunned and had an average age of 18Y2 years. But they fought courageously against an enemy who was battle hardened, superior in numbers and better equipped with artillery. The Japanese had landed in their thousands at Buna and Gona in the north and were going to sweep south overland to Port Moresby within a period of days. That was done in the context of the Japanese, from late 194 I and early 1942, sweeping all before them in Malaya, capturing Singapore, attacking Pearl Harbour, and taking the Philippines and Rabaul. Within 100 days they had captured all of South-East Asia. It was only the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway and indirectly the campaigns at Milne Bay and GuadaIcanal that stopped them sailing into Port Moresby. It was 4 p.m. on 23 July when only 30 Australian soldiers, in the first instance, made the first campaign stand at Kokoda. They had rifles, revolvers, one Lewis machine-gun and one drum of ammunition. Eventually they were overwhelmed and that started the history of Kokoda. They fell back from position to position, from village to village, from hill to hill, fighting and delaying the Japanese on every inch that they conceded. They had battles at Deniki and Isurava, which was our Alamo, I guess, and where the first VC was won on Australian soil-because New Guinea was mandated territory-by Bruce Kingsbury. Other battles were fought at AloIa, Eora Creek, Templetons Crossing, Myola, Kagi, Efogi, Manari, Brigade Hill and lorabaiwa Ridge. By doing that even though they were outnumbered six to one on many occasions under atrocious conditions and showing enormous courage, they eventually weakened the Japanese, who had previously been invincible on land. They stretched their lines of supply so long and the Japanese were so starved by having only half a handful of rice and a bit of seaweed to eat-and in some cases by resorting to cannibalism-and they were so debilitated that the Australians turned the Japanese round in September when they were only 40 to 60 kilometres from Port Moresby and steadily drove them back the full length of the track and recaptured Kokoda on 2 November. It is an epic story; it is a story that is the spirit of Kokoda. Kokoda to World War II is what Gallipoli was to World War I. However, while we lost Gallipoli we still won the war. But if we had lost Kokoda then we would have lost Port Moresby and the Japanese would have had a launching pad into Australia. It was a very significant campaign. We fought it on our own. The heroism displayed at Kokoda was no less than at Gallipoli, the odds facing us were no more favourable but the terrain and climate were far more foreign and horrific-so Kokoda is very special. Regrettably, Australian governments of all colours have, in the past, done very little to recognise the importance of the track. To his credit, previous Prime Minister Keating went to Kokoda but unfortunately he was made head of the Orokaevian tribe who carried for the Japanese. He put money into an airport terminal at Kokoda at the wrong end of the strip. Three pillars are all that remain of it now, as depicted in this photograph. I was alarmed and surprised to find that nobody has ever acknowledged the Koiari people-the fuzzy wuzzy people. Little has been done to commemorate the famous battle sites along the track-particularly Isurava and Brigade Hill. It appears that there are 72 soldiers buried at Brigade Hill. I believe that should be fully investigated and perhaps made an official war graves site. We have to get 'ownership' of the Kokoda Track before the Japanese move in more than they have. Already the first monuments that have gone up on the track are Japanese ones. It seems that all that has been done-apart from a little at Kokoda-has been by an expatriate dentist, Ross Bastian, working out of Port Moresby. Through his own initiative he has put up three or four plaques on the way. Not one cent of our foreign aid-over $6 billion since Independence in 1975-has gone to the Koiari people, even when we are giving $320 million this year. To our detriment we have not fully acknowledged what the fuzzy wuzzy angels have done. They carried supplies and ammunition for us. We could not have won the campaign without them. They carried out our diggers when they were wounded. They were never paid for that. Many thousands of them contributed; only 20 or 30 odd remain alive. We met some of them on the trip and it was very emotional. I believe we should strike a carrier service medal for them. It is a simple thing to do. It is basically all they want. We could probably do more and give them a small ex gratia payment. We have to do more for the Koiari people who did so much for us. I believe a health and education foundation should be set up and a scholarship scheme established. We already support 550 scholarships in Papua New Guinea but none for the Koiari people. Scholarships could be given for medicine, education and perhaps sport. Malaria is rife along the track; TB is also prevalent, particularly in the north; and there are respiratory problems. Village museums could be set up at very little cost and the local people could look after them. Military equipment, which is now corroding there, could be restored properly and displayed with photographs, maps and explanations. We could set up sister school relationships between Australia and these people and arrange pen pals and the donation of old sporting equipment. We came across a football field with no footballs, so they had never played a game on the track. It would encourage an appreciation of the history between Australian school children and the Papua New Guinean school children along the track. We could give advice on setting up simple guest houses in each village. The villagers are very isolated; some have no radio contact with the outside world. We could also set up solar HF radios. By these simple low cost measures we could create enormous goodwill and repay the debt that has been outstanding now for 55 years. The children and grandchildren of the fuzzy wuzzy angels-they are still angels themselves-would really appreciate these simple little gestures-at no cost to the Australian government. I would appreciate bipartisan support for the motion. (Time expired)",21
10,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Nehl}-Is the motion seconded? Miss Jackie Kelly-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,23
11,Mr MARTIN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"-I can assure the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) that the motion he has brought before the parliament today on the Kokoda Track campaign enjoys bipartisan support, but with one or two minor qualifications which I will come to in my contribution today. It is important at every opportunity to think of these sorts of issues, particularly on a day such as today when the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) has launched a fouryear campaign to ensure that education processes are under way in this country which will enable people to have a full understanding of Australians' contributions in theatres of war. My colleague the member for Parkes has indicated that he believes that, through some simple actions-in education, health and so on-the contribution of people in Papua New Guinea can be recognised. This is particularly important because their contribution, along with those very valiant members of Australia's defence forces who were along the Kokoda Track during the Second World War-let us not put too fine a point on itsaved Australia. As graphically described by my colleague, every inch of the way literally had to be fought for to stem the attack of the Japanese. If they had not been stopped where they were there is no question that Port Moresby would have fallen and that it would have been used as a launching base for further attacks on Australia. Anyone could hazard a guess about the outcome of that. When you put in the time frame and perspective as to when super powers like the United States got involved in the war, it may well have been a little too late for Australia. The battles that occurred along the Kokoda Track in 1942-as we have indicated, they culminated in the complete defeat of the 15,OOO-strong expeditionary force sent to capture Port Moresby-are amongst the most important fought in the history of Australia. The member for Parkes is absolutely right to describe the battles on the Kokoda Track as the Second World War version of Gallipoli for Australia. He is absolutely right there. If our troops had not succeeded, the Japanese would have had a very commanding launch pad, as I have said, against the Australian mainland. Whilst the name Kokoda certainly evokes emotion in the hearts and minds of most Australians, few are familiar with the names of many critical battle sites along the track such as Isurava, Templetons Crossing, Efogi or the beachhead battles of Buna or Gona. These names should be seared into the minds of Australians but, sadly, for whatever reason, they are not. Perhaps, as part of the commemorative activities which the Minister for Veterans' Affairs launched today, that may form part of that particular program. At Isurava, for example, the 39th Militia Battalion and the 2nd/14th and 2nd/16th Battalions of the AIF fought a pitched battle against overwhelming odds. They saved the day by slowing the advance of the Japanese who were eventually turned back just outside Port Moresby. I think Australians should learn more about this important battle. Private Kingsbury is one such hero of this conflict. Private Kingsbury won the Victoria .Cross when he flew into a withering hail of fire to make time for his embattled colleagues. Regrettably, he lost his life while saving his country from invasion. That is a very important point because that is what the Pacific-PNG campaigns were all about. Australia was under threat. There was no ambiguity. We were not involved in a far away campaign; it was on our doorstep. That is what made these battles so real. The efforts of Australian soldiers along the Kokoda track were beyond belief. There were two enemies: the Japanese and the track itself. It was interesting to note the comments of my colleague the member for Parkes when he related his own recent personal experiences. I am sure the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) had similar experiences as she too was a member of the party that made that visit. I too have been to the track, back in 1968, from memory. I was chosen to be a member of an Australian university rugby union side to go to Papua New Guinea. We lost, but we had the opportunity to visit the track. I concur with everything that my colleague has mentioned about the nature of the track. You did not have to venture too far along it to experience the sorts of hardships that people clearly, particularly in a war setting, would have experienced. The soldiers of the time had to battle extreme exhaustion, disease, hunger and a lack of supplies and, at the end of the day, had to fight a significantly larger, better equipped and better disciplined army which was fresh from a string of victories. The Australians defeated their foe in Papua, but at a terrible cost. War cemeteries at Bomana, Lae and other sites contain the graves of thousands of Australians, many as young as 17 or 18, who died to save Australia. I also had the very great pleasure, as was mentioned by my colleagues in the debate immediately preceding this one, of visiting a number of those war cemeteries when I visited PNG when I was Speaker of this parliament. I, too, reflected upon the ages of the Australian soldiers who laid down their lives in defence of our country. It should be remembered that it was overwhelmingly Australian combat troops who achieved this. American troops did not arrive on the scene in Papua New Guinea until the battle of Buna in late 1942-early 1943, and even then there were more Australian troops involved in the theatre of operations. It is often easy to overlook that very point. This is not to say that Americans were not critical in the eventual defeat of the Japanese, particularly in respect of the Battles of the Coral Sea and Midway, but we should not lose sight of the fact that it was the Australians who inflicted the first defeat on the Japanese army. The Kokoda campaign was critically aided by the Koiari people in Papua who became known, very affectionately, as fuzzy wuzzy angels. Their compassion and devotion to duty is well remembered by Australian troops. Many more Australians would have died from their wounds if not for the stretcher-bearing fuzzy wuzzy angels. One only has to think back to some of the more memorable and moving movie footage that came out of the Second World War, emanating from the Kokoda track, to see these likeable people doing what came naturally to them-that is, helping Australians who were fighting to save not only Australia but also their own country. I think that is a very important point. In 1995 a pilgrimage of 117 World War II veterans returned to Papua New Guinea to commemorate the battles fought there and the comrades that did not return. Con Sciacca, our distinguished former minister for veterans' affairs, presented the Koiari people with a certificate of appreciation on behalf of the Australian government at a ceremony just outside Port Moresby. I take the point that this motion is attempting to make: that is, efforts such as that and recognition in the form of a certificate of appreciation go part of the way towards saying thankyou from a very grateful nation. But I also take cognisance of the suggestion of the member for Parkes that maybe we could do something else. He suggested we should perhaps strike a medal. Perhaps an ex gratia payment might be made or, more importantly from my perspective, perhaps a real contribution could be made as part of our tied aid program to these people-recognition, perhaps, through sanitation programs; much better education programs, or the provision of radios, as has been suggested, which is much more tangible when it comes to improving their lifestyle than the giving of a gong. That is the only note of disquiet I express today when supporting the motion that has come before the House. Allied to that, of course, is the fact that since 1975 Papua New Guinea has been a sovereign state. If you have had anything to do with our Pacific Island neighbours-and my colleagues immediately before this debate were talking about the South Pacific conference-you will know that many of these people would not like to feel that Australia was in some way perhaps being overly generous or big brotherly. As I have suggested, the deeds of the fuzzy wuzzy angels should live on in our collective memory for many years to come, so I think we have to look at tangible ways of doing that. Certainly the opposition supports any effort to further commemorate significant battle sites along the Kokoda trail and the deeds of the fuzzy wuzzy angels. I think there is a precedent for funding health and education facilities along that track. I understand that one such facility exists already at Kokoda village and that this was an initiative of the former government but with bipartisan support. Anything such as that-which will improve the lot of these people to whom we owe so much on behalf of so many-should not be taken lightly. (Time expired) Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (1.29 p.m.)-I rise today to speak in support of the motion moved by the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb). I was with him when he trekked along the Kokoda Trail. I would have to say that if I ever had to choose a site for a battle that would be last place I would choose. I have been a student of military history for a number of years. I served 6Y2 years in the RAAF and I served for three years in Malaysia. Wherever I have gone around the worldbe it Turkey or Malaysia-I have, as a student of what is important to Australia, sought out Australian war graves and Australian military sites of significance such as Labuan, Sandakan and Gallipoli. They are all terrifically moving sites when you read up and study the history of them and the sacrifices that our Australian soldiers made there. I think the same thing can be achieved very close to home in relation to the Kokoda Trail. Private Kingsbury has been mentioned a lot in this debate. He was a VC winner, but out of the whole Kokoda campaign there are a number of other people of significance whose sacrifices were as great as Kingsbury's and who were awarded DCMs and Military Medals. Charlie MCCallum won a DCM. He was the last out of Isurava. He basically single-handedly covered the withdrawal of our troops out of Isurava. He was finally killed 8 December in Papua New Guinea. Also at Isurava was Lindsay Beer. He was awarded a DCM and MM. He is still alive today and lives in Melbourne. He survived Isurava but he was carried by the fuzzy wuzzies back down the track. Lefty Langdridge and Claude Nye are two very significant people from this battle. They were left charge of trying to re-establish communications when the Japanese cut communications at Brigade Hill. That was another significant battle. A lot of those who survived Isurava died on Brigade Hill. Some of these men had also fought in the Middle East. So they had survived the European theatre of war to come back to defend Australia and had moved straight into the Pacific campaign. Claude Nye and Lefty Langdridge led 78 men to re-establish communications. Only six got through. There are 72 men missing in action from the battle of Brigade Hill. Siosi Laimu, the Papua New Guinean who basically owns Brigade Hill, stated that he buried 72 Australians on that hill. In my trek across the track I actually saw an Australian army boot with bones still in it. We obviously did not recover all of our dead, and the bodies of Australians are lying along the track. Something significant we could do is commemorate that grave site and the spirit of those men at Brigade Hill with an Australian government commemorative establishment-a plaque, a memorial, a museum or collected memorabilia. The track is undoubtedly known world wide. It is probably known internationally-and throughout America as well-as the trail. More and more young Australians will probably trek across the track and revisit where their parents went. On the trail with us were several people whose parents were in the campaign. Some really incredible stories came out of the campaign. That Gallipoli spirit of Australians was one of the reasons I sought to go on the track. When I did and saw the conditions of the Koiari people along the track, such as their health and their sparse education, I was quite embarrassed for Australia. We have gained a lot of pride and lot of significance from our achievements on the track, but they on seem to have been forgotten. The people who were there shoulder to shoulder, the Papuan soldiers who did not have the rifles or the equipment to fight, at least kept us tended and fed and back up the front. These people are frequently days away from help. I treated one fellow for a particularly savage wound to his foot. He was two days walk from any further in medical help. The meagre medical kit I took with me for personal use was exhausted in 10 days. (Time expired)",23
12,Mr QUICK,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I am delighted to add my thoughts in the debate on the motion moved by the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and to thank those honourable members who have contributed to this debate so far. As most honourable members would know, the whole topic of honouring our war dead has a special place in my heart, having had a father who was one of the immortal ANZACs and having been able to walk in his footsteps on the Gallipoli Peninsula and in France. I have also been privileged during my time in this place to have been able to visit many of the sites where Australian servicemen and women fought to preserve the ideals espoused by this great nation of ours. Having been born in 1941, I remember the fathers of many of my school mates reminiscing about their feats in the Western Desert and the Pacific Basin and their stories of the various battlefields strewn around this region to our near north. As a young boy I vividly remember reading the many books that were written on the horrors and experiences of our men and women as they attempted to stem the tied of the Japanese invasion. Who can ever forgot the photos taken in those battles. The one that always sticks in my mind is the one of the blind soldier being led across the creek. That is part of our cultural history. I have also had the honour of being able to spend some time in that part of the Pacificnamely, PNG-mentioned in this motion. To be able to visit the many immaculately kept war cemeteries, to read the many inscriptions on the war graves, to see the Kokoda Trail, the battlefields of Lae, Weewak, Buna and Madang and, more importantly, to spend some time in the villages where Australians were prepared to pay the ultimate sacrifice and where the villagers gave their all in aiding our service personnel has been something special for me. Just to experience standing on this hallowed ground, to experience the humidity, the tropical rain and the impenetrable jungle and to try to place oneself in their position in those times is very hard for me to explain. I think it is vitally important, as the previous speakers have noted, that we as a nation continue to preserve for future generations those places now and forever immortalised in the pages of our history. Having these battle and grave sites set apart forever so that future generations can marvel at the heroism and valour of those who served in these special places, now so integral a part of our history and our culture, cannot be questioned by anyone. To be able to repay in some small way-as we have so rightly done in so many small towns in France where our ancestors fought during World War I-those magnificent Koiari people of Papua New Guinea, the fuzzy wuzzy angels, as they are better known, is right and proper for us as a nation. A medal to commemorate those who fought as ANZACs came long after the event. A medal to commemorate those who stayed behind and contributed so valiantly to our war effort on the home front during the Second WorId War-the civilian service medal-has only recently been distributed. One wonders why we have waited so long as a nation to recognise these special people in our near north who, as I have said before, are now and forever part of our folklore and war history, for time immemorial. I agree with the honourable member for Parkes. I think it is time for us to put our money where our mouth is, to go and work co-operatively with the PNG government, to speak to the villagers and say to them, 'What can we do for you? You did it all for us 50odd years ago.' It is not going to take a great deal of money. They only want some simple, basic things for their villages. As the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) has said, our young people are more and more discovering our history, the parts of our life that are spoken of in reverence and awe. I think it is up to us to hand the chalice over to them and say , 'We have put something in place; you make sure it remains there.' When people speak of the fuzzy wuzzy angels and the Kokoda Trail, as the member for Parkes said, it is linked with Gallipoli and the many other battlefields. I wholeheartedly and bipartisanly support his motion. Hopefully, before too many years, the suggestions contained in his motion will be achieved.",26
13,Mr COBB,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"by leave-I wish to thank the members on both sides of the House for the spirit in which they have entered this debate. I think we have had strong bipartisan support for what is contained in this motion, which will be to the betterment of not only the fuzzy wuzzy angel people but also the Australian people. Many of the contributions made by those on both sides of the House have been very constructive. I am grateful to members for their support. It is very encouraging indeed to listen to the comments of members. I think what has shone through the debate is that the Kokoda Track campaign is unique in Australia's history not only for its importance-had Kokoda and Port Moresby fallen, the Japanese would have had a launching pad to enter northern Australia-but also because the battle was fought so close to Australian shores, not in some distant part of the globe on the other side of the world. In fact Papua New Guinea was Australian mandated territory at the time. Also what needs to be emphasised is that we fought this campaign :-vith-ut any direct allied support. We fought It entIrely on our own, which makes it different from other battles, such as Gallipoli. I would like to emphasise to the government ministers-the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) and the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan)-that the suggestions that I and others have made here today are simple. They would cost very little, if anything at all. I stress that they would be done only in conjunction with liaising with the Papua New Guinea government and with the Koiari people to work out what is best. At the very least, we could set up a few plaques on the battle sites and grave sites along the track. We have no shortage of metal and ribbon in Aust-alia and it would cost virtually nothing to stnke a few medals for the remaining fuzzy wuzzy people and their families that survive them. That is virtually all they ask. It costs absolutely nothing in the overall scheme of things and they would be so proud to wear those medals. In setting up the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angel Health and Education Foundation, only a handful of villages are involved. If we are worried about the cost, we could redirect some of the present foreign aid which, as I mentioned earlier, presently stands at $320 million a year, towards these projects. So much could be done to create such goodwill between our two countries, to repay the debt at so little cost. I know of no other opportunity where we can do this with another country as that which presents itself here today. . To think. that we have left this for 55 years IS strange mdeed. I for one am puzzled as to why it has not happened before. If we put effort into this, it can only redress our debt from the past and help enrich our history. I think the publicity that it would get and setting up the sister school relationships between Australia and the Koiari people would help stamp on our modem history the great contributions that we have made in the past. Too often we learn of other countries' histories in great detail-like the battle of Waterloo, what happened at Alamo and so on-and we neglect our own history, which is even richer. What would the Americans have done if they had had a Kokoda campaign in their war? It would be revered in television documentaries throughout the world and be shown on our screens and repeated on it monthly basis. Yet until now we have done virtually nothing. There is a great deal that we can do for little cost that will commemorate the great deeds of the past and also, in a meaningful way, help those people-the fuzzy wuzzy also angels, the Koiari people,-who helped us in their thousands along the Kokoda Trail, the Kokoda Track, 55 years ago.",27
14,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Order! It being approximately 1.45 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. NA Hilly, Mr Roy",28
15,Mr MOSSFIELD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last week I had the honour of presenting the civilian service medal to Mr Roy Hilly of Riverstone in my electorate of Greenway. The civilian service medal recognises the service of civilians who served in Australia during World War II in organisations that were subject to military like arrangements and conditions of service in arduous circumstances in support of the war effort. Roy was working at Burrinjuck in 1941 when he was given a few hours notice to pack his bags. Roy had to take his wife, Vin, and their two small children to his mother's place at Bowning about 40 miles away. Travelling to Tocumwal, Roy worked on aerodrome construction then moving onto Charters Towers where Roy and his team worked for next 12 months on road construction. They worked mainly with pick and shovel-there was very little machinery available at the time. The work was hard; the men worked 12 hours a day and sometimes in extreme heat up to 116 degrees. On other occasions, the team was flood bound for weeks on end without fresh food. The work affected Roy's health and after 12 months he was discharged medically unfit. After being discharged, Roy continued his war effort by working as a tradesman fitter at St Marys munitions factory. Australia owes a debt of appreciation to people like Roy Hilly and his wife, Yin, for their particular war effort during those dark days of Worid War II. I conclude by paying a tribute to the departmental officers who provided a large suitcase of briefing material for use at these presentations. (Time expired) Port Macquarie Teleservice Centre",28
16,Mr VAILE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The front page headline from this morning's Port Macquarie News highlights the Howard-Fischer government's real commitment to regional Australia. The headline reads '$13 million and 110 new jobs' for Port Macquarie. That $13 million and 110 new jobs are the tangible benefits to flow from this government's decision to establish a new social security teleservice centre in Port Macquarie. It was one of two new centres-the other being Ballaratannounced last Friday by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) as part of an overall package to improve the department's telephone service, which has been straining under record demand and which had been let run down under the previous Labor government. In addition to the two new centres, the minister announced the expansion of a number of existing sites and plans for future centres, creating over 800 new jobs in al Australia. The new centre will provide a major jobs boost for the mid-north coast and provide much needed dollars for small business and the local economy. As stated in this morning's Port Macquarie News, David Morton, the President of the Port Macquarie Chamber of Commerce, said: The economic injection from those wages will flow onto different levels of the community . . . from the comer store to the building industry. Councillor Frank Harrison, the Mayor of Hastings Council said: The implications of the centre's 110 jobs were far-reaching and extremely positive. These centres could easily have been placed in capital cities, but such is the commitment of this coalition government to regional development and the professional submission by the Port Macquarie agencies that this fantastic result has been achieved. (Time expired) Youth Suicide",29
17,Mr QUICK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"A forum on aspects of youth suicide organised by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs was held last Friday. It was a wonderful opportunity to hear the appalling results of what is happening to our young people-the 15 to 24 year olds in our country. Six a day are succeeding in killing themselves and 60 others a day are unsuccessful. I would like to thank the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for opening and attending the first session. Speakers, experts in their field, gave us a valuable insight into all aspects of the problem facing our nation. As I said, Australia has an appalling record that sees us as one of the worse countries in the world when it comes to youth suicide. I would also like to thank the many service providers who were there who gave us their valuable insight into this problem. One hopes that as a nation we can do something to resolve this appalling situation. Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras",29
18,Dr NELSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I was not at the gay mardi gras on Saturday. I do not pretend to understand homosexuality. I know that regionhomosexual people are our brothers and sisters, our aunts and uncles, our friends and our sons and daughters. As such, they are to be loved and respected, accorded as much as possible no more or no fewer rights than any other member of society. Coming to terms with one's sexuality through adolescence is one of the most painful and difficult periods of life. Having spent much of my working life as a doctor in Tasmania, I know how much more difficult it is in a climate of fear, prejudice and even hatred. Imagine living in a world where your most powerful biological instinct makes you a social outcast, a sinner and a criminal. gay mardi gras were a heterosexual event, I would not attend as long as genitals were on display and nuns were being lampooned. Unfortunately, it provokes feelings of anger in a section of the community that needs instead the nurturing of tolerant understanding. Homosexual people still endure prejudice and discrimination in many areas such as superannuation entitlements and social welfare payments. I would gladly support a dignified campaign to overcome the injustices endured by homosexual people. Respect for the causes taken up by homosexual people will, however, be enhanced when they lead by example rather than by trying to shock us into them. In approaching the issue of homosexuality, it is always best to ask yourself the question: how would I want my son or daughter to be treated if they were gay? The answer to that question should be what guides our own actions. Youth Unemployment Programs",29
19,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Batman}-My statement relates to disturbing evidence that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) is doctoring the figures relating to the effectiveness of Working Nation labour market programs. We all know the basis on which the government hacked nearly $2 billion out of jobs programs in last year's budget. Mr MCGauran- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The honourable member has reflected on the minister and he is required to make that sort of accusation of doctoring figures by way of substantive motion only.",30
20,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,The honourable member is aware of the forms and other alternatives that are available to him and I ask him not to reflect on or impugn the reputation of the minister.,30
21,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Mr Speaker, I was referring to the real facts. The real facts are that, as Senator Vanstone said in Senate estimates last week, suggesting that the figure for jobs under the new work opportunities program is $143,000 is 'not the cost per person'. This figure is 14 times the actual cost If the per person assisted. Dr Kemp, however, baldly stated in the House last week that: ... the cost per job obtained through new work opportunities ... was $ 143,000. He is in direct conflict with his senior minister and what she stated in estimates last week. Dr Kemp should be dealing with the facts, rather than doctoring the figures, and start to restore programs to reduce long-term unemployment. Last week, as I said, his senior minister referred to the real facts on cost per net impact. (Time expired) Warrnambool: 150th Anniversary Celebrations",30
22,Mr HAWKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I want to inform the House and the parliament of a very important event that occurred in my electorate last month. On 17 February the city of Warrnambool celebrated its 150th year of being proclaimed in the government Gazette. Warrnambool, as is always the case, showed what a great city it is. It did it in style. It started off with a visit by the outgoing Governor of Victoria, Mr Richard MCGarvie, and his wife. He unveiled a commemorative stone and plaque and then went on to attend an official dinner. One of the significant things to note about that dinner was that, in the recitation of the history of Warrnambool, the city's resilience was revealed. The people of Warrnambool not only survived through the Depression but were also in fact largely unaffected by it. Last weekend there was a massive celebration in Warrnambool to continue the 150th anniversary. Many of the important things of Warrnambool were celebrated. The school children had a major march with 1,500 in the procession. On Saturday there was an expo with a 'Made in Warrnambool' exhibition which showed some of the things for which Warrnambool is famous, such as Fletcher Jones, something I think everyone knows of. Nearly 10,000 people attended that. Also, there was a visit by 2,000 Portuguese from the community in Victoria. Recently, there has been a further discovery of some timber that may be linked to the famous mahogany ship that may change the whole way we understand the discovery of Australia by Europeans. I would like to congratulate those who organised this celebration, particularly Mr Frank Jacobs. Warrnambool did it in style and Warrnambool showed that it is one of the great provincial cities of Australia. (Time expired) Medicare Office Closures",30
23,Mr OKEEFE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"This afternoon I will be presenting to Dr Wooldridge, the Minister for Health and Family Services, a petition from 2,000 of my constituents protesting at plans to close the Medicare office in Melton. I say to the minister through this forum that I believe that this plan to close Medicare offices around Australia and to shed 700 jobs in Medicare is an unprecedented attack on Medicare and a complete breach of the government's undertakings to leave Medicare alone. I also make the point that in Melton the Medicare office processes 50,000 transactions a year. These people who purport to be interested in small business ought to know that at the Melton regional shopping centre, where the Medicare office is, there are lots other small businesses that benefit from the throughput that comes through from these people coming to the Medicare office. I also say that in Sunbury, another town of similar size in my electorate, we have been trying to get a Medicare office opened. Of course, this message from Melton is that you can forget about Medicare offices. This was not told to the people before they election. They were promised that Medicare would be left alone. This is about jobs and it is about opportunities in regional shopping centres. I call on the minister to respond positively to the petition I will be presenting to him. Tariffs",31
24,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"On 8 November 1990, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) said: ... we are winding back the protective wall that the tariff produces because the real problem with the tariff is that it only makes us look internally, domestically. On the same day, the member for Hotham also said: The only people who have adjusted tariff levels in this place have been members of Labor Governments. On 16 May 1990, the member for Hotham also said: The Whitlam Government between 1972 and 1975 and this Government are the only ones to have reduced tariffs. There was a 25% cut under the Whitlam Government and there has been a 35% cut under this Government. Where was the cut from the Opposition side? Not one cut in tariff at any stage. There we have it. The members of the Labor 86 opposition were the tariff cutters. They have been the biggest tariff cutters in this parliament. They have now sold out, especially the member for Hotham. The Labor Party, when it was in government, cut tariffs in the automobile industry from 58 per cent to 15 per cent. Now, they are purporting to be on the side of keeping tariffs up. Mr Latham-Tell your Prime Minister.",31
25,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,The member for of Werriwa fully understands that the Labor Party has sold out. The member for Hotham has sold out. Where do they really stand? It is on the public record. Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras,31
26,Mr ALBANESE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise today to speak about the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras held in Sydney on Saturday night, something that is now Australia's largest voted at the community function. Mr Randall-Were you there?",31
27,Mr ALBANESE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I was in fact there and I was very proud to march in solidarity with those gay and lesbian members of my community. The Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras began as a civil liberties demonstration more than 20 years ago in a search for equal rights for those of gay and lesbian sexual orientation. It was begun by people such as Denis Altman, Craig Johnston and the late Brian MCGahan. It is now a major tourist attraction for Sydney and Australia. The organisers are to be congratulated in that more than 700,000 people were on the streets of Sydney with virtually no negative incidents. I note that the members of the Lyons Forum and the homophobes opposite are upset at this. Let me invite you to march next year because there are very few times that you can walk down the streets of Sydney as a politician and get cheered by 700,000 people. I think some of those opposite should reflect on that, and I will be there to be cheered by 700,000 people next year as well. Friends of the ABC",31
28,Ms WORTH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"My concern is that some friends of the ABC may not be behaving like friends. They are not all assisting the ABC by being overly political. The ABC has many fans, and I count myself amongst them. However, in late January I was forced to respond to a letter published in the Advertiser by a claimed friend of the ABC. My letter, in part, states: In the letter it is stated that after the Friends :A-BC had talked 'extensively' with Coalition MPs, It was revealed that 'without exemption ... they don't like the hard questions ABC reporters ask.' I find this rather a curious comment given that my office has no recordof the person writing this lettercontacting me over this issue and that, in my correspondence and discussions with the Friends of the ABC, the issue of reporting standards at the ABC has never been raised! Further, I have always found it an advantage to have media enquiries that are well researched and challenging. I am also bemused by the claim made in the letter that all Coalition MPs have stated that the ABC only deals 'with ALP and Democrat concerns such as cultural and social issues.' Since when have these been strictly ALP and Democrat concerns? I would never have made such a comment and I am in fact, a self-confessed fan of a the ABC. On 14 February I spoke at a rally in favour of the ABC in Rundle Mall, Adelaide. I had been invited to speak about what the ABC meant to me. I was going along to talk about my early memories of my grandmother ironing and listening to Blue Hills by Gwen Meredith and the music behind it all. Of course, when I got there, I found it was very political. I found chainsaws in action. I found 9uotes like '90 per cent cuts to funding mstead of the two per cent'. I was forced to call upon those friends of the ABC to be as honest as ABC reporters had been to me.",32
29,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! It being 2 p.m., in accordance with standing order 106A, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Senate Vacancy",32
30,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister endorse the statement by the Premier of Queensland that he would be prepared to fill a casual Senate vacancy with a candidate other than a person chosen by the same political party? If not, why not?",32
31,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The attitude of the government, and my attitude, is very simply that, in the event of there being any casual vacancies, those should be filled in accordance with both the letter and the spirit of the constitution as amended by referendum of the Australian people in 1977. I believe that will of the be the case in future in relation to every casual vacancy. Legal Aid",32
32,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister inform the House about the actions the government is taking to reform the legal aid system? Can the Prime Minister also advise the House why these actions are necessary? And have some states been failing to meet their own legal aid funding responsibilities?,32
33,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for the question and I take the opportunity of explaining to the House the basis of the decisions taken by the government in relation to legal aid. I know that those deci' sions have been the subject of some criticism by state Attorneys-General and by members of the legal profession; and I want to say something of those criticisms because they are unfounded, unreasonable and completely ignore the basis of the decision that has been taken by the coalition government. I want to make it clear that we will not be changing the funding decisions that we have made in relation to legal aid. I would remind the House that the current arrangements with the states and territories are some 10 years old. The previous government made grand statements about improving access to justice; yet, in reality, that did not occur under their administration. The Labor government that we succeeded in this House did not address the fact that there was a steady decline in the number of matters arising under Commonwealth law being funded by the then current legal aid arrangements. Federal money was being used increasingly to fund legal aid matters under state and territory law, particularly in the criminal law area, and areas of Commonwealth responsibility such as family law matters were pushed down the list as far as priorities were concerned. Upon taking office, we asked why this should be so and we determined that it need not be if the Commonwealth could reassert its priorities. We gave the required 12 months notice to terminate the legal aid agreements last June. It should be remembered, as the Attorney General pointed out last week in relation to a well-publicised drug charge against a man in New South Wales, that we are still operating under those agreements and we have not reduced the funding available to legal aid commissions in the current financial year. It follows from that that much of the confected outrage of some state Attorneys-General is completely erroneously based. I repeat: there has been no reduction in Commonwealth legal aid funding in the current financial year, and the hypocrisy of the New South Wales Attorney-General in particular on this matter in relation to the Marini case has been exposed. We estimate that tens of millions of Commonwealth dollars have been siphoned off under the present arrangements to fund legal aid schemes for state matters. In some major jurisdictions, our estimate is that some 25 per cent of Commonwealth grants have gone to fund state matters. In Western Australia, the estimate is that nearly 50 per cent of the Commonwealth grant has ended up funding state matters, particularly crime. The Commonwealth accepts responsibility for its criminal laws and, for example, is working hard and successfully to stem the importation of drugs into the country. You will not see us then walking away from our responsibility to provide funds for legal aid for serious Commonwealth criminal matters. The basis of the Commonwealth's decision is justified on every count. We will fund those matters which involve a responsibility under Commonwealth law. We expect the states to do the same in relation to responsibilities under state law. High Court",32
34,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer the Deputy Prime Minister to the unprecedented letter dated 3 January 1997 he received from the Chief Justice of the High Court. Is it not true that the letter states: 'Attacks of the kind you have made, emanating from a Deputy Prime Minister, are damaging to this court'? Given the Deputy Prime Minister's response of 13 January acknowledged his comments were based on incorrect advice, why, in the light of the extraordinary letter from the Chief Justice, did he not correct the public record at the earliest opportunity, as required by the Prime Minister's code of conduct?",33
35,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I expected a question on this subject today, and I have taken the liberty of bringing to the House the full set of correspondence which was exchanged between the Chief Justice and me a few weeks back. I think we should get back to the actual wording of that correspondence, which I am prepared to put on the public record, and in that context I have nothing to hide whatsoever. Indeed, I would say that I will continue to defend my right to debate judgments of the High Court here in the parliament and right across the land. Therefore, it is with pleasure that I table the correspondence. Environment",33
36,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister intF'nd building on the government's impressive environmental agenda with any further initiatives; will any new action continue the principle of balancing the needs of development and environmental care; and is the government conscious that our environmental responsibilities range across other issues, including care of our land, rivers and coastlines, both in my electorate of Robertson and throughout Australia?",34
37,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can inform the House that unlike the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats we want to invest an unprecedentedly large amount of capital in Australia's environmental future. That is why we proposed the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia, a trust that umably the Labor Party is pledged to dismantle if ever, unfortunately, it were to become the government of this country again. I am able to confirm to the House that after question time. I will be delivering a detailed statement on oceans policy. It fulfils yet another commitment made by the coalition during the election campaign. It will build on the sensible balance that has been achieved by the coalition in the forests area. We are for jobs. We are also for protecting the environment. We have signed a regional forest agreement with the Victoria government. We have achieved the balance that eluded the previous government. We will do the same in relation to policy dealing with Australia's oceans and coastline. In that statement. I will reveal that the government will spend $106 million from the heritage trust to fund the oceans policy. It will put in place a comprehensive strategy. Oh, they don't like good news, do they?",34
38,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order: the Prime Minister has already indicated that he will make a statement on this matter. He is therefore pre-empting that statement in his comments, which go directly to that statement. The answer is out of order.",34
39,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,34
40,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The policy that I will outline in detail will put in place a comprehensive strategy for dealing with the ocean environment. It will cover a range of issues including fisheries management and multiple resource use, pollution and industries old and new. We will work closely with state and local governments and with local communities. I will be announcing a number of initiatives as a down payment on delivery of policy in this area. Senator Hill and Senator Parer, in their respective portfolio responsibilities, will also be announcing initiatives today as down payments on the final policy.",34
41,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would like to follow up the standing orders issue that was raised by my colleague the member for Calwell. It is not in order to make an announcement of government policy. The Prime Minister is making an announcepresment of government policy by describing",34
42,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister is not anticipating debate. There is no point of order.,34
43,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The point of order is not to do with anticipating debate. It is to do with announcing government policy. The standing orders say that it is not in order for a minister to use question time to announce government policy. That is plainly what the Prime Minister is doing.,34
44,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,34
45,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is very obvious from that point of order and, also, from the point of order of the member for Calwell that George Campbell was right on the Four Corners program last Monday night when he said: I don't think the party knows or has a clear perception of what it stands for or, more importantly, what it wants to achieve in terms of development of our society. I can say to George Campbell that the coalition knows what it stands for in the area of the environment. The coalition stands for putting $1.2 billion into a capital investment fund for the future of Australia's environment. The parties who are against that are the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. Industrial Relations",34
46,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Does the minister now share the Treasurer's reported views that the Workplace Relations Act will not substantially reduce unemployment, that what is needed is greater flexibility-sometimes downwardsand that more reform will be needed in industrial relations?",35
47,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am slow in getting to the dispatch box because I pulled a hamstring in the annual 500 Club cricket match, Prime Minister. However, you would pleased to hear that I retired hurt but not out. I did see the Treasurer's remarks. I must say that I have not had a chance to discuss them with him in any detail. The fact of the matter is that I often see quotes from my colleagues making points which the government itself, more generally, has made about the importance of flexibility. In fact, if you go back in time, this opposition itself once claimed that its policy was to increase flexibility so as to give people more opportunities to do deals by which they could earn higher pay. So it is hardly surprising that the Treasurer should talk about it being important to make it easier for people to enter into an employment relationship. He is absolutely dead right. Not only is he dead right but, in this matter, we have taken giant strides to make it easier for people to enter into those very same arrangements. Whilst we have been consistent with what we have been saying in terms of what we have implemented, the interesting thing is the backward steps being taken on the other side on this very issue. The shadow minister was out last week basically attacking the idea of individual contracts. His policy position is to say, 'We will not regress to where we were in March 1996,' yet in November 1995 the former Prime Minister told your caucus that your policy position was to give people the opportunity where they so desired, subject to a safety net, to enter into individual contracts. The reason he did that was that it is a pathway to greater flexibility. So not only did I see the comments of the Treasurer but I totally endorse them. Business Survey  the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of the March quarter national survey of business expectations by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry? What does that survey show about business expectations and economic activity? Is the survey supported by other business surveys and recent economic indicators?",35
48,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. I did see the survey of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which was reported this morning, on business expectations for the March quarter. That survey said that, while there had been a strong lift in business confidence during 1996, this had not until now been translated into an improvement in the actual level of activity. The latest survey results show that not only is confidence improving but so too are actual outcomes. The survey also reported that the expectations data show that current improvement is expected to continue-expectations of an even better performance in the quarter to come for general business conditions, sales, exports, profits, employment and investment. The survey was not unequivocal, however. It did go on to say that there are, as always, many threats to the continuation of recovery. It named as the biggest threat the ACTU's living wage claim. The small business community and the business community generally in Australia are concerned about the prospect that the ACTU with an irresponsible claim-if it were granted-would have the capacity to choke off the monetary policy which has been put in place and to choke off the growing investment and recovery as a consequence. This, coupled with the January balance on goods and services-a better than expected result of $63 million: in those figures announced today exports of goods and services rose one per cent to reach their highest monthly level-confirms a good investment outlook in the December CAPEX quarter, showing that expectations for 1996-97 business capital have risen. I noticed on the AAP wire this morning that the Housing Industry Association was reporting that new house sales had jumped 3.9 per cent in the three months to January, after a disappointing previous quarter. Dr Ron Silberberg said that the housing industry has made a promising start to the new year and that sales activity is now running at nearly nine per cent above the low point of the housing cycle. This accords with the government's outlook in relation to a gradual pick-up in the housing cycle over the course of 1997, strengthening in business investment, continuation-subject to the ACTU's claimof a low inflation environment, three reductions in official interest rates kicking in over the course of this year and strengthening in activity. They are promising signs for 1997, signs the government welcomes, which will work together with our improvement in relation to fiscal policy and structural reform policy to give a picture of continuing economic growth translating into jobs growth over the course of 1997-98. NA",35
49,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from the Republic of Kenya. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. NA Industrial Relations: Wages",36
50,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Does the Treasurer claim, as his good friend the Minister for Industrial Relations just did on his behalf, in his Sydney Morning Herald interview last week he was not talking specifically about the need for further flexibility downwards in the Australian wage system? Is it not the case that the Treasurer is directly quoted in that interview as saying that certain other countries had 'reaped the benefits' of greater wage flexibility but that 'we are not as flexible as them' and that 'flexibility means ... sometimes higher, sometimes lower'? Does the Treasurer or does he not support further measures to achieve downward wage flexibility?",36
51,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would have thought the comments were understandable even to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. You, the leader, I do not necessarily include. I made the point in relation to New Zealand, the United States and, I think, Britain, that unemployment rates are lower. They are. I also made the point that they have more flexible labour markets than European countries, and that is one of the contributing factors to better employment outcomes. That is exactly why this government is pursuing greater flexibility in the labour market. That is why we are doing it-to create the opportunity for jobs. That is why this government turned around 13 years of Labor failure. We did not do it for nothing. We did it to give the opportunity for the creation of flexible labour market potential. The Minister for Industrial Relations should be absolutely congratulated for steering through the best reform package that we have ever seen in relation to industrial relations in this country. That will make its contribution. The reason the coalition government was able to do that is that this is a coalition government which is not beholden to the ACTU veto. The Minister for Industrial Relations does not have to go down to Swanston Street to ask permission for this government to introduce legislation. Nor does Swanston Street have to send its retired ACTU presidents up here to sit on the front bench to keep this government under control. I have said before-all those ex-ACTU presidents on the front-bench of the Labor Party!-we are glad that we are operating a retirement home for ACTU presidents. No wonder they are against entry contributions. that They would not want to have to pay them to get in here to get onto the Labor Party front-bench. These are important reforms. They will contribute to employment and to productivity. That is why the government is pursuing them. Teleservice Centres",36
52,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister, please. What action is the government taking to enhance Department of Social Security teleservice centre operations throughout Australia? Does this action provide further evidence that the government is serious about creating new jobs in regional Australia?",36
53,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Herbert and I know other honourable members will know that the Department of Social Security runs a national teleservice network, allowing people to conduct their social security related business from their homes rather than having to visit a regional office. In 1995-96 teleservice centres handled about 11 Y2 million calls. They are vital for providing adequate services, particularly for people in rural and regional Australia and for disabled Australians who do not find it easy to travel to their nearest social security office. We are determined to build on them, and last year we announced 300 new teleservice centre jobs in Melbourne and Adelaide. Last Friday, the Minister for Social Security announced another 425 new teleservice centre jobs in regional Australia. New teleservice centres will be opened at Port Macquarie, Wandaroo and Ballarat, each with a staff of 100. In Townsville, the teleservice centre will be expanded from 50 to 100 staff. An additional 75 staff will be employed at Gosford, an extra 20 staff will be put on at Geelong and there will be 80 additional staff at Toowoomba. In addition, the government is currently considering options for a purposebuilt teleservice centre which will employ a further 100 staff. The Department of Social Security estimates that these additional measures will raise the annual call handling capacity of teleservice centres to over 18 million calls. This is good news for social security recipients, particularly those in rural and remote areas of Australia. Most importantly, it is good news on the jobs front for regional Australia. Industrial Relations",37
54,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr question is addressed to the Treasurer. As a founding member of the H.R. Nicholls Society, does he agree with its president's description of the government's workplace relations legislation as the 'KernotReith bill', as a 'political betrayal' involving collaboration 'with the enemies of labour market freedom' and with its passage representing not 'mission accomplished' but 'mission abandoned'?",37
55,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. Youth Employment,37
56,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is address to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. I draw the minister's attention to the recent Morgan and Banks job index which confirmed that Australian companies were more likely to employ young Australians who had training relevant to their needs. I ask the minister: what initiatives has the government taken to address these concerns of business?",37
57,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wide Bay for his question. The government is determined to redress the difficulties that young people face in getting a job as a result of Labor's failed policies. Morgan and Banks recently surveyed 3,200 organisations and found that they were most likely to employ the young or the long-term unemployed if they had training that was relevant to industry. There is nothing new whatever about this. Small business has been saying this for years. The trouble is that the Labor Party did not listen to small business-they never do listen. I noticed that the shadow minister for employment at the Young Labor conference yesterday called for what he described as imaginative policies to give Labor credibility in relation to youth unemployment-the credibility, of course, that they lost over 13 years. I wonder what kind of policies they might come up with when they let their imaginations, wild and inventive as they may be, play on this possibility. The trouble with the also Leader of the Opposition is that he lacks imagination in this area. His advice to the government is to do what they did, presumably at a cost of something like $143,000 per net job. You have no idea what to do about youth unemployment. I notice that Senator Robert Ray, letting his imagination playa bit, suggested that one of the things the Labor Party could do was to make appointments according to merit. If that radical principle were introduced, there might be quite a few changes across that front bench down there. I was particularly interested in the imaginative solution that former senator Jim MCClelland, a minister in the former Whitlam government, came up with. He made a very daring suggestion in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning. He said: May I also dare to suggest a change of leadership could be a help? Kim Beazley does not seem to have the fire in his ... belly to lead his languishplace ing party out of the wilderness. The former Senator MCClelland's imagination played on. He then said: Nor does garrulous Gareth, whose abundant intellectual endowment does not compensate for his manifest-and, I fear incurable-lack of judgment. I think we would all be pleased to know that this is not bothering the deputy leader cause, as he told the press, they are all happy little vegemites over there on the other the House at the present time.",37
58,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was there another reference? the question.,38
59,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, there was another reference. I wonder where this might imagination of the member for Hotham to start playing about how to solve this problem. He was, after all, the one who invented the $500 million program that had a four per cent net success rate. So I do not think the Labor Party could place too much weight on imagination. The difference is that the government listened and has acted in relation to small business demands for training which is evant to their needs. The government is engaged on a major reform of the industry training system which is dismantling the bureaucratic monstrosity that the Labor Party put in place. From 1998, employers will able to choose their training providerPrime something that Labor barred them from doing. I have recently announced the one-stop apprenticeship shops led by industry to track training approvals and fill vacancies. hospitals? The new national training packages are being designed and endorsed by industry and alLeader ready the government has launched new question. industry design traineeships in five key rural sectors and in office administration. For the 60 per cent of young people who do not go on to full-time university or full-time TAFE, the government is putting in place programs to provide school based apprenticeships and traineeships and greatly increase the vocational education offerings that are available to these young people who have been disadvantaged by the policies of the previous government. Labor did not listen to small business. The training reforms the government is putting in will greatly simplify the training system. This government is delivering on its election commitment to provide relevant quality training that will lead young people on to real jobs. Private Health Insurance",38
60,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the minister is interestbeed in newspaper reports, he ought to look at the 'D' he got on his report card over the side of weekend for a year in office.",38
61,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member will address,38
62,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It related to this: 3,000 lead the places for 800,000 jobs.",38
63,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will move to his question.,38
64,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware his of the AMA's recent comments that Australians should abandon private health insurhas ance? Is he also aware of the Industry Commission's report which showed that the relgovernment was spending $560 million per year on health rebates to save $240 million? Does he recall Mr Kennett's comments that the government's private health insurance incentives were 'money down the drain'? In be the light of these comments, how can the Minister claim that spending $600 million per year on health rebates will deliver better value to the Australian people than fastdirectly spending that money on public",38
65,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am delighted that the of the Opposition has asked me this Let me deal with it seriatim. First of all, can I take Mr Kennett's contribution. Yes, I do remember what he said last week. I also remember what he said in September of last year, and there is quite a gulf between the two of them. He was right in September; he was wrong last week. The initiative that was announced by the government is a good initiative. I am also intrigued that the Leader of the Opposition should talk about the impact of incentives and rebates on keeping people in private health insurance, because it was your-not erstwhile, but continuing-friend Graham Richardson who argued in 1993 that if you allow the number of people in private health insurance to fall below a certain level you create a problem. What Graham Richardson told you and what you ignored when you were a minister in the last government was that you should have brought in tax relief years ago. What you are saying to me now is that something you should have done years ago should not now be done. It is a completely erroneous proposition. As for the Australian Medical Association, I hope that the Australian Medical Association rejects root and branch the recommendation of its vice-president, Dr Brand. I thought it was one of the less responsible utterances of the Australian Medical Association. Continued support for private health insurance is a very, very necessary element of a sustainable health policy. I think it is a very irresponsible form of comment for a person holding such a position in the Australian Medical Association, without offering a comprehensive alternative-because they do not like the attitude of the private health insurance fund-to endeavour to create by their remarks a lack of confidence in a system which they know depends on a proper interaction of the public and the private. The bottom line of the health debate is that for 13 years you deliberately ran down private health insurance in this country. Year after year, you took away the struts, you took away the bed day subsidy for private hospitals, you weakened the reinsurance pool and you refused-despite Graham Richardson's advice-to provide subsidies to keep people in private health insurance. It is like your hypocborder risy to now wring your hands at some of the difficulties you contrived to create. Mr MCMullan- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: to save the Prime Minister supplementing his answer, he said he would respond seriatim",38
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What is your point of order? Mr MCMullan-He said he would respond seriatim, but he responded to the point about the AMA, he responded to the point about Mr Kennett, but not to",39
67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your point of order? Mr MCMullan-He did not respond to the point about the Industry Commission.,39
68,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat.,39
69,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have a supplementary question. My supplementary is to precisely that point. What is your view of the Industry Commission's report which says that you are spending $600 million to save $240 million in your waste of time rebate?,39
70,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The question has been dealt with. I call the honourable member for Cook. Mr Lee-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: could I invite you to reflect on that ruling, given that",39
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. Resume your seat. I reflect on my points before I answer, not afterwards. Burma",39
72,Mr MUTCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question without notice is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What is the government's response to Burmese attacks on the Karen people living near the Thai border? Can the minister verify reports that the Thai army has been forcibly repatriating refugees across the border?,39
73,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. The answer is that the government condemns the Burmese government's brutal war against the Karen people living near the border with Thailand. The fighting follows attacks on three refugee camps on the Thai side of the in late January, which left an estimated 10,000 refugees homeless. Our embassy in Rangoon has conveyed my call on the Burmese government to withdraw its forces immediately and seek to resolve its differences with the Karen through negotiation dialogue. On 14 February, I announced that Australia would provide a further $800,000 in humanitarian assistance to refugees living on the border. NGOs and relief agencies are confident that they have sufficient supplies to with the current crisis and AusAID officials are currently visiting the region to monitor situation and assess the needs of refugees. Perhaps I should add that I discussed situation of the refugees with the Thai Minister for Foreign Affairs during his visit here last week, and he assured me that authorities were taking steps to improve safety of the refugees, such as moving them away from the border area. reports in the newspapers that the Thai army has forcibly been repatriating refugees across the border to Burma. Our embassy in Bangimagination kok spoke to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently. It was confirmed that it was not policy forcibly to repatriate civilians. asked the embassy to clarify the situation I urge the Thai authorities to continue their policy of providing security to refugees escaping conflict. Youth Unemployment",39
74,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question dressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Minister, I am very touched by your obvious compassion the unemployed",40
75,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Move to your question.,40
76,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you give me an extending opportunity, Mr Speaker, I will.",40
77,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We do not need patronisresult ing comments about ministers' behaviour or performance. Move to your question.,40
78,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speakvery er. If I can get a go, I will. Minister, proached your office some time before last school leaving year with a program designed for unemployed youth by a Canberra 'small business association which is extremely cost-effective-far more cost-effective than any programs of your government or the opposition-and it also had the support of small business, which paid most of the costs. and At the time, you seemed very keen on the program; you seemed to understand it immediately. Why then has this program languished in Senator Vanstone's office for so long without any action being taken?",40
79,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I appreciate the fact that the cope member for Kalgoorlie is concerned about youth unemployment, and the government is the always keen to get constructive comments about policy proposals from members of the the House-be they Independents or indeed members of the opposition. Not that we get any, I do not think, from the opposition but Thai occasionally we do get some constructive the suggestions from Independent members.",40
80,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You haven't got any policies; I have seen you just imagine them.,40
81,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have absolutely no and no idea about how to deal with youth unemployment. It is true that the Thai member for Kalgoorlie put forward some I have proposals. Of course, the government has and looked at a very large number of proposals to help young people into real jobs. We have put forward a very significant set of programs to give young people the literacy skills, the numeracy skills and the contacts with small business that will allow them to move from is adschool into the work force. I recently announced on behalf of the government the job pathway program, which for was piloted under the previous government but not further funded. We have funded and improved that program very significantly by it to long-term unemployed young people, and we expect that there will be some 4,000 jobs created for young people as a of that program. So the government is always willing to look at constructive suggestions to help young people into jobs, and I am confident that the policies that we have I apin place, together with-and in the context the of-the government's overalI economic policies which are reviving small business and which are leading to the creation of jobsMr Quick-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker.",40
82,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"at an increasing rate, will address the problem of youth unemployment.",40
83,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the minister has finished his response. Did you want to pursue your point of order? Mr Quick-Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was going to raise a point of order understanding order 145. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie raised a specific case about an unemployment program here in Canberra, and all we heard was a load of waffle from the minister.",41
84,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Communities,41
85,Mr HICKS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Minister, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are currently responsible for the management or control of 16 per cent of Australia's land surface and comprise a significant percentage of the population of rural and regional communities. In light of coalition government's strong commitment to the sustainability of our land and water resources, could you please indicate what programs are in place within your portfolio to ensure indigenous people have an opportunity to contribute to the sustainable future of this country?",41
86,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. There is actually a range of activities within my portfolio which involve Aboriginal people. I do not have time to go through them all but I am happy to touch on a couple of them. Members may recall that last year I launched an Aboriginal landcare facilitator program to involve indigenous communities in landcare activities. Under that, nine Aboriginal landcare facilitators were set up to work with communities and individuals to increase awareness and activity in sustainable land management. In conjunction with Senator Herron, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I am currently developing a rural industry strategy to help address the socio-economic and environmental issues which impact on the developmeflt and sustainability of indigenous industries and enterprisachieve es. The strategy will be finalised later year. It is being designed to assist Aboriginal people to become economically empowered to move towards greater self-sufficiency and self-reliance, particularly in rural areas where many of course live. An example of the type of program which may emerge from this development can be found in a pilot project for young Aboriginal people in the Gilgandra district of western New South Wales. Senator John Herron and I travelled to Gilgandra towards the end of last year to talk with local people about some of the problems that they are experiencing and to collect some of the views of the locals. At that meeting, the Aboriginal leaders spoke of their wish to establish meaningful programs which would help give the young people some self-esteem, worthwhile activities and a sense of pride and purpose. As a result of that meeting, through the rural communities access program the government will be supporting the establishment of the a market garden at Balladoran, some 18 kilometres from Gilgandra, a site which already has a sense of place for local Aboriginal people. The market garden will provide training opportunities for young people to learn the necessary horticultural skills to grow vegetables and native foods. It is hoped that this will engender a real interest by these young people in a career in agriculture in the future. As many in this House would also be aware, the rate of diabetes is unacceptably high in Aboriginal people and their communities, and a contributing factor is poor diet. This project will assist Aboriginal people to learn to grow their own healthy foods, and we believe that that will help lead to an improvement in their health status in the future. In this regard, we face some major challenges as a nation. There are no easy answers but, to begin the long journey of change, we must be prepared to take the all-important first step. It is very easy to sit back and complain about these problems and not offer any constructive solutions. The only way forward is for a positive commitment from everybody with a spirit of cooperation to a healthier and more harmonious in the society for all Australians. Health Ministers Meeting",41
87,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Does the minister recall attending with state health ministers in November last year at which the states predicted a crisis unless the Commonwealth provided more money for public hospitals? Is the minister aware of reports that he tried to have the minutes of the meeting struck from the cord? Did the minister try to suppress the minutes in any way and, if not, will the minister now agree to release the minutes this health ministers meeting?",42
88,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do remember attending an informal meeting of health ministers in early November and there was set of minutes taken. They were circulated some 3V2 months after the event. Those minutes were exactly that-informal minutes of an informal meeting. The secretary to my department, on Tuesday, 25 February, phoned three state CEOs of health and the unanimous view of those four people was that, as it was just informal minutes of an informal meeting at which no decisions were made, they should not be part of any formal record. That decicurrently sion was made without reference to me. The secretary to the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council, which is a group of officials, undertook to contact the other state CEOs. On the following day, Wedneson day, my principal adviser wrote to state health ministers and their officers to inform them what the CEOs had decided. This was done without reference to me. I saw the minutes first on Wednesday and I first found out on Wednesday night that my principal adviser had written a note. So I had nothing to do with attempting to strike the minutes from the record, as the shadow minister suggests. It was not my decision; was the decision of officials. The article in the Australian was quite incorrect. The joura nalist in the Australian made no attempt check the accuracy of the story with me before he wrote it. I will give the shadow minister a bit advice: your questions are very predictable because whenever a certain journalist sniffing around looking for information seem to pop up the next day and ask a question. I know things are tough in the opposition, but you do not have to resort to using a meeting journalists as research staff. Genetic Technology",42
89,Mrs BAILEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Minister for Science and Technology. The minister will be aware that scientists in re Australia appear to be announcing genetic technology breakthroughs on almost a weekly basis. Would the minister advise the House of of government action to ensure consumers are aware of these new developments?,42
90,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for MCEwen for her question and her continuing a interest in science and technology. Honourable members will have noticed that there have been announcements of new genetic technology breakthroughs on a regular basis. Some of the developments include the world's first transgenic wheat crop recently harvested by the CSIRO just outside of Canberra. It is going to result in superior breads and pasta and noodles. There is insect resistant cotton, a major breakthrough for an industry that spends about $125 million on insect control every year. Potatoes are a $300 million industry in Australia and the CSIRO is developing potatoes that are resistant to virus and, therefore, will reduce the reliance harmful pesticides. We are developing an agent to assist with the whitening of sugar, of which is likely to save the industry about $5 million annually. Also in the wings there is research which could lead to pipless oranges and lemons, bigger prawns, firmer tomatoes, night virus resistant prawns",42
91,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,42
92,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Don't start me! While there is similar research under way in Australit is as in Scotland in recent days, where Scottish scientists have cloned sheep, cloning is in different field of research to those breakto throughs I have just mentioned. Can you imagine some of the cloning that would be required for the sheep of the opposition? Can of you imagine cloning Leo MCLeay, having more than one Leo MCLeay---or more than is one member for Hotham! So I should make you the point that the scientists",42
93,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: if it is relevant to discuss the cloning of Leo MCLeay, could we ask whether or not this bloke is a hologram?",43
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,43
95,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, very hurtful! I am just devastated! I do want to reassure the House that scientists here are working under some of the strictest guidelines in the world and are producing results that will lead to improvements in our standard of living, better crop yields, a better environment, better quality and better tasting foods. Finally, under a draft standard released for discussion by the government, genetically modified foods will not be approved for sale until they satisfy health and safety requirements. This release of the draft standard is a very important step to ensure that there are community views being injected into the whole debate so that valid consumer concerns are met. Health Ministers Meeting",43
96,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have a question for the Minister for Health and Family Services. Further to your previous answer, Minister, what communication did you or your staff have with your department regarding the minutes of the health ministers meeting in November? In particular, do you stand by your claim that this was a decision of state chief executives of health departments and not your own staff or your own department?",43
97,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I answered the last question very fully and I have got nothing to add. Clean Up Australia Day,43
98,Ms WORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government representing the Minister for the Environment. Given that yesterday was Clean Up Australia Day, is the Minister aware of the extent to which the Australian community supported the day and if the day was a success?",43
99,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Adelaide for her question. She was one of, I am sure, several members that were involved in Clean Up Australia Day yesterday. In fact, there were 500,000 Australians involved, and the member for Adelaide, as I understand it, was involved in helping to clean up the River Torrens, along with the Kiwanis Club of Adelaide, so we congratulate her for her involvement. The interesting thing this year was a dramatic increase in the number of tonnes that were collected-13,000 tonnes as against 10,000 tonnes last year-and, according to Ian Kiernan, who has organised Clean Up Australia, 20 per cent were able to be recycled. There were many odd things discovered apparently: a black snake in Launceston, a BMW engine in Sydney, a full set of golf clubs and a set of garden gnomes. I can imagine a garden gnome cloned with Leo! The government applauds all those who have been involved with Clean Up Australia. Clean Up Australia is an example of the strength of the volunteers making sure that the environment in our nation is better for all of us and the government's policies, such as the Natural Heritage Trust and others, will add weight to those particular directions, which I think all of us would applaud. Political Lobbying",43
100,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Minister, I refer to a report of a meeting that you chaired between senior officials of your department and representatives of the textile industry on 13 February, together with today's report distancing yourself from personal involvement in promoting a hit list for lobbying purposes. Minister, at that meeting did your department propose a hit list of cabinet ministers and their electorates as targets for political lobbying?",43
101,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am surprised that the member for Hotham waited until last; I expected him to be up much earlier than this. Having said that, can I say it is a great pity that economic writers who write scuttlebutt do not check it with the office of the minister concerned and that most of the areas that he covered carry no weight at all.",43
102,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question. My question is: did your department propose a hit list of cabinet ministers and their electorates as targets for political lobbying at that meeting?",43
103,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question has been dealt with. Disposable Cigarette Lighters,44
104,Ms GAMBARO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. I understand that as of 1 March the import of non-child-resistant disposable cigarette lighters has been prohibited under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. Can the minister explain to the House the reasons for adopting this import control measure?  member for Petrie for her question. On 8 October last year I advised the House that the ministerial council had decided to ban the import of non-child-resistant disposable cigarette lighters from 1 March 1997, with domestic sales of these lighters prohibited from 1 July 1997. This decision was taken after analysis of injury data which showed a significant safety risk to young children. As the Commonwealth minister responsible for Customs, I can advise the House that import controls under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations were implemented on 1 March, on schedule. On 26 February, regulations establishing a new consumer product safety standard were gazetted. The consumer product safety standard adopts the United States standard for child resistance, which has been in place since 1994. Importers will need to make a declaration that a certificate of compliance to the United States child-resistant standard has been issued. Manufacturers already provide such certificates for lighters imported into the US. Whilst the standard was being developed, 1 :onsulted with organisations representing importers and retailers on the timing of the domestic sales ban. I received a number of representations from small business seeking an extension of the deadline, on the grounds that the original cut-off date of 1 July 1997 did not provide sufficient time for retailers to dispose of their existing stocks. In order not to penalise retailers holding products which had been perfectly legal when originally purchased, I agreed with my state and territory counterparts to extend the commencement date for the domestic sales ban to 1 October 1997. The new commencement date has been incorporated into the product safety standards regulation.",44
105,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Australian Oceans Policy",44
106,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I am delighted to fulfil another election promise today by announcing the development of the coalition government's policy on Australia's oceans. This is a policy which will balance the needs of the environment with the needs of resource security and jobs. We will work with state and local governments and communities to put together a comprehensive strategy. It will cover the spectrum of issues: Fisheries management. Environmental management. Multiple use reserves. Resources and energy. Transport. Tourism and recreation. Science and technology. I am pleased to announce that the government will spend $106 million from the Natural Heritage Trust-a fund opposed by the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats-on the coasts and clean seas initiative to support the Australian oceans policy. Today, the government will also announce some initiatives as a down payment on the further development of that policy. Community Consultation All Australians have a real interest in how we conserve and use our ocean resources. We want our coastal waters clean enough for our people to safely enjoy swimming and surfing; our offshore gas and petroleum industries need sufficient freedom to invest in our resources and so stimulate economic growth; we want to ensure that the unique biodiverissues sity of our oceans is conserved for future generations; commercial and recreational fishers are facing the challenge of environmentally sustainable catches; we want confidence that the Great Barrier Reef will remain as one of the natural wonders of the world. As all Australians enjoy the benefits of the oceans, so they should have a say in their care. A consultation paper I am releasing today will stimulate views from the full range interest groups. Public comment will be sought on an options paper in the middle of this year; By early 1998, the International Year of the Oceans, the complete policy will be in place. During 1997 the government will release specific initiatives as they are finalised. We will put in place a balanced and integrated oceans policy ranging across dictions. This will provide certainty for both industry and the marine environment. This government believes one can reconcile the environment and development. There can be balance. This is exactly what we are doing with the forests. And this is what we will do with the oceans that surround our island continent. The government supports the principle of multiple resource use for our natural resources. At present, industries related to our ocean resources are worth around $30 billion a year. However, any exploitation of the resources must be responsible. It is simply not sensible to excessively exploit these resources. Such a strategy is damaging both to the environment and jobs. It would lead to a running down of stocks, reduced biodiversity, reduced production and so potentially rising unemployment. The best way to ensure long-term growth in the industry is effecti ve management of resources. The multiple use of resources will combine sensible exploitation of resources with environmental care. The oceans policy I outline today will cover such as improved fisheries management, monitoring, surveillance and control. It will also canvass the development of a representative system of marine protected areas. While we support multiple use, there will be some very special areas of outstanding environmental value that should never be disturbed. We will protect them accordingly. Regional Cooperation South Pacific Forum-Strengthening Fisheries Management in the Western and Central Pacific Our neighbours, especially in Indonesia, of Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific, share the resources of the region's oceans with us. It is simply not possible for anyone country to achieve effective management of these resources in isolation. Marine resources and problems do not recognise international boundaries. The region's small island states rely heavily on the oceans' resources and its bounty. Its long-term viability must therefore be protected. Placing more resources in Pacific fisheries management is an important all jurispart of this process. I am pleased to announce today that Australia will significantly increase support for regional fisheries management in the western and central Pacific Ocean. An additional $1.15 million will be pr.ovided by the government over three years. This initiative will support South Pacific fisheries agencies promoting the sustainable developinent of their marine resources. In particular, the additional $1.15 million will: strengthen the technical capacity of the forum fisheries agency; allow the fisheries agency to draw on expertise within Australian government agencies; expand fisheries management training through the South Pacific Commission; and help Pacific island countries attend regional multilateral fisheries meetings This regional effort will be an important support of our own domestic efforts on oceans. Sustaining Australia's Remote Area Fisheries We must also be able to protect our fishernerable ies interests in our remote waters. Illegal fishing is a threat to the livelihood of fishermen. It is also a threat to the environam mental sustainability of the oceans. It is Australia stopped tolerating activities. The minister responsible for fisheries, Senator Parer, will announce today a $400,000 program for improving the management and surveillance of our remote area fisheries. This new strategy will include the development of satellite based imaging for monitoring fishing vessels. Fisheries management and bycatch Marine life is an important source of national income for Australia. Our fisheries contribute around $1.6 billion to Australia each year and employ some 25,000 Australpolicy ians. We have the third largest fishing zone in the world. Nonetheless, we are not in top 50 nations for fish take. While living resources are biologically are not plentiful. In many areas delicate balance. Past approaches to fisheries management have not always recognised this. Stocks of some valuable resources-such as southern bluefin tuna-have been drastically reduced. Other marine life, such as the albatross, have been under threat from significant bycatchdevelopments the fish and marine life caught by chance when fishing boats are fishing for other species. Albatross Many thousands of albatross are killed each year by fishing practices which can be modimaintain fied. Our Australian tuna fishing industry working well with the government to reduce this threat. However, action must be global it is to be successful. The government has nominated 11 species of albatross protected internationally. This will lead to regional conservation agreements to reduce Tourism the threats they face, saving them from becoming seriously endangered. Fisheries Bycatch Reduction Initiative Reduction in bycatch in Australian fisheries is essential for sustainable fisheries management. This will help conserve marine biological systems and protect popUlations of vulspecies. It will provide greater long term resource security to industries and our communities which rely on fishing. Today, I pleased to announce a $440,000 fisheries time bycatch reduction strategy to address this these illegal important issue. The objective of the bycatch policy will be to minimise the volume of bycatch taken by fishers, particularly species of conservation significance. The policy will develop mitigation measures such as trawl efficiency devices and bird scaring lines. We will review management of our fisheries so that measures incorporate bycatch reduction strategies and do not encourage discarding. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority will finalise the policy by the middle of the year. The will be the starting point for action plans for each Commonwealth fishery. This the will become a key component under the our marine Australian oceans policy. varied, they Industry development they are in a Offshore Oil and Gas Fishing is an industry with centuries of tradition. Offshore oil - nd gas exploration is very much a product of our times and is still in the early stages of its development. The future of the Australian offshore oil and gas industry looks very bright indeed, with new worth several billion dollars beginning on the North West Shelf and in the Timor Sea. The industry currently contributes around $8 billion to the national economy. All Australians benefit from this industry, through jobs, exports and taxation payments. Oil and gas are not renewable resources. To the benefits from the industry we is must continue to discover and develop new fields. The economic importance of offshore if oil and gas exploration and development will be given due recognition in the further develto be opment of our oceans policy. As all members are aware, our oceans provide an important resource for tourism and recreation. Our coasts and oceans are major attractions for tourists, who contribute approximately $15 billion a year to the Australian economy. This creates considerable regional employment as well as aggregate national wealth. Tourism must have an equal chance to grow alongside other uses of our marine environment. Resource use decisions must recognise its importance, including the importance of recreational fisheries. The oceans policy will examine issues such as development of multiple use principles, current problems and ways to improve management regimes for this important sector. Marine science and technology plan As a nation we also have an enviable reputation for marine science and technology. However, unless we have a well focused marine science sector, our conservation and resource development efforts will be poorly guided. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) is developing the marine science and technology plan as part of the overall oceans policy. The plan will set government priorities, consolidate the marine science effort and raise options for a closer working relationship with those industries which depend on the oceans' resources. Emerging Industry Opportunities The resource base of our oceans is vastaround twice the area of the Australian land mass. In the longer term, our oceans have enormous potential for development in ways which are only just emerging. For example, the majority of anti-cancer drugs currently being tested are derived from marine organisms. Highly effective sunscreens for humans can be derived from coral. Australia's marine biological diversity has the potential to add great value to the pharmaceuticals industry. The possibilities of the seabed as a source of mineral wealth also remain to be assessed. The government will support innovative and responsible industrial use of our oceans, which can coexist with essential environmental values. In recognition of this, our policy will examine issues such as the adequacy of existing data, resources survey, marine science and the integration of data. Marine pollution and ballast water Pollution The full benefits from commercial development of our ocean resources will be available only if the marine environment is protected from pollution and pests. It is too easy to focus on dramatic and obvious ocean pollution such as oil spills. The greatest threat to the marine environment is from the land, which is the source of approximately 80 per cent of marine pollution. The oceans policy will canvass issues such as nutrient flows from rivers, environmental performance of sewage systems, oil spill responses and gaps in management regimes for pollutants. Today Senator Hill will be announcing details of a $6.4 million coastal and marine planning program to fund integrated planning and management of coastal and marine environments. State and local governments will be invited to submit proposals to reduce pollutants and minimise the impacts of uncoordinated coastal development. Ballast Water Initiative The introduction of foreign pests also represents a serious threat to our ocean environment. The balance of ecosystems around our coasts is very easy to tip. We see this when foreign organisms are brought into our waters in ships' ballast or attached to ships' hulls. While oil spills can be dramatic, foreign marine organisms are more insidious. By the time they are noticed it is often too late to exterminate them-and they can do permanent environmental and economic damage. We are only too well aware of the problems of controlling foreign marine organisms. The Northern Pacific Seas tar-now a serious pest threatening the Tasmanian shellfish industl1:'-was probably brought here in a ship's ballast water. Fan worms from the Northern Hemisphere are spreading in Port Philip Pay, threatening its $15 million scallop industry. In all, at least 55 foreign organisms have become established in Australian waters. Well over 90 per cent of Australia's trade in goods is transported by ship. As international trade increases we must take stronger action to minimise the threat from foreign organisms in ballast and on hulls. The shipping industry has agreed to an industry levy to fund a strategic ballast water research program. We welcome this most warmly. Legislation establishing the levy will be introduced into the parliament to allow its operation in 1998-99. To bridge the gap until the industry levy comes into effect, I am pleased to announce the government will provide $1 million in 1997-98 to fund the program. This objective will be to design and implement a cost-effective system for managing ships' ballast water based on risk assessment. This will allow us to assess the risks posed by vessels, taking account of the port of uptake and the treatment of ballast water en route. This system will be based on considering risks in relation to target organisms of concern to Australia. This will build on current guidelines requiring ships to exchange ballast water at sea. Community participation This government will take the lead in putting Australia's comprehensive oceans policy into place. But a partnership with other governments and the Australian people is essential if the policy is to tum words into action. With the benefits that come from our oceans, so comes a duty of community care. In the last budget, the government doubled funding for community coastal projects to $3 million. This, at a time of tight fiscal discipline, was recognition of the priority the government gave such projects. Senator Parer will today announce the details of the fisheries action program, a community based program that will help protect and restore Australia's fish habitats. The fisheries action program will provide funding, on a dollar for dollar basis, for activities such as fish habitat restoration and protection, and aquatic pest control. The project will be delivered in partnership with the state and territory governments. This government will spend $9.75 million in the program over the next five years, including $3.75 million for projects in river catchments. Conclusion The oceans cannot provide unending bounty while absorbing our uncontrolled waste forever. With the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia, we will start to protect and develop our oceans' natural capital as a resource for all of the Australian people. This government is dealing with the issues concerning the environment not only in relation to the oceans but also in other areas. We are doing this in a sensible manner, rather than politicising the fashionable issue of the time. Combined with other policies, we will put in place an environment package ranging from air pollution to forests to rivers and now to oceans. This government is serious about its responsibilities and we will continue to see them through. I take this opportunity of reminding the House yet again that this year will mark the beginning and the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia that will see the investment of $1.2 billion in renewing the capital assets of Australia's environment. It will be the most historic visionary capital investment ever in Australia's history. I note in conclusion that it was trenchantly opposed by the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. I present the following paper: Oceans Policy-Ministerial statement, 3 March 1997.",44
107,Mr REITH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I move: That the House take note of the paper. Just by way of explanation for members, in accordance with the usual practice, I will shortly move a motion to provide equal opportunity for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), but as we move the take note motion it will provide an opportunity for other members to make a contribution in due course at the appropriate time. Motion (by Mr Reith)-by leave-agreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition speaking for a period not exceeding 18 minutes.",48
108,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"You can never claim that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) lacks a sense of hyperbole whenever he speaks in this place. Everything he stands up to say in this chamber is usually the announcement of a mouse clothed in an elephant's skin. That is the approach of the Prime Minister to just about every single policy issue that he confronts in this place, be it on schemes like work for the dole where 800,000 unemployed people get a mickey mouse proposition for 3,000 of them, and it relates now to this issue here on the environment. First of all, you ought to note this thing about this statement: it is not a statement on the environment. At very best it is a 'work in progress'. It is an announcement of a series of studies. It is an announcement of a series of studies against a background of a great deal of work. The Prime Minister is not always churlish, but he is from time to time. He was churlish on this point when he said no work had been done. The basis for this lies in a whole plethora of activities by the previous government, a whole series of programs and not just programs assessing whether or not programs are necessary. If you want to look at the problems identified and what ought to be the approaches to them, all I would recommend to people would be that they pick up a copy of State of the environment: Australia, a report that was put in place by the previous government. The consultative processes that the Prime Minister now talks about essentially were gone through and, as a result of that, a series of propositions were put down on the marine environment, among others, about the sorts of things he ought to be looking at. The second thing that ought to be noted about this is that the Prime Minister sells this as a proposition for $1.2 billion worth of new spending on the environment. That is untrue. They went through the last election campaign with a set of propositions about that Natural Heritage Trust fund in which they said, 'This will be in addition to what has been spent on the environment by the previous government. This is new policy. This is new spending. These are new things that the government is going to be doing. This is our taking a commitment on the environment one giant leap forward from where the Labor Party is.' I will say a bit more about that a bit later if I get time. But I must say this: the cat was belled on this one or the milk was spilt-whatever way you want to put it-in that Senate estimates committee process last week when the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) had this to say: Our objective was that the trust fund would be ... additional money . . . on the forward estimates. Since the election the forward estimates have had to be reduced ... to reflect savings ... to some extent, the trust may be called upon to pick up-lapsed programs. 'To some extent' - we will see the 'some extent' here. Virtually every single proposition, which is actually a policy announcement as opposed to a proposition to think about a policy announcement somewhere down the track, is in fact a pick-up of an abandoned program. Claims are made in a couple of instances that more money is going to be spent than was previously spent and in fact it constitutes a substantial, not to say dramatic, reduction. We actually do get some propositions about what might be done because this is a statement full of very fine words about the nature of our marine environment, a statement full of very fine words indeed, but when in fact invited to match it with an appropriate sum of money to deal with the problems let me take just one example-and that is the research related to the environmental impact of the fisheries project and what has to be put in place. It was a fine statement made about the fishing industry. You cannot argue with that statement. He was absolutely accurate when he talked about its value to the country-$1.6 billion-and to help preserve this a $400,000 fishing program over three years. What a little ripper. What a bonzer little performer: $400 grand for the environmental examination of something worth $1.6 billion to us a year. This is very important because he pointed out in his statement that we have the third largest fishing zone in the world, but in fact that only states the half of it. We also have the longest coastline of ice-free water. We are far larger in that regard than Russia, China, Brazil or the US. We do have a few responsibilities in that area, a few responsibilities that need to be met, but pardon us for saying that the world's greatest environmental program manages to find from within it $400,000 and we are allowed a degree of sarcasm and cynicism as related to their intentions in this regard. So this document, in so far as it is any good, reflects an extension of the things that we were doing. In so far as it promises anything at all, it is going to rely very much on a process of consultation. That process of consultation is of a piece with this Telstra fund. Let me talk a bit about this Telstra fund, which is after all the father, if you like, of the resources to come out of this. It is $700 million for five environmental and sustainable agricultural projects over the next five years, $300 million to be held in trust in perpetuity. Our calculations indicate that cuts to the environment and sustainable agricultural budgets result in the Natural Heritage Trust Telstra money providing only around $84 million a year in additional funds on top of Labor's budgeted commitments rather than the much trumpeted additional $1 billion promised by the coalition at the last election. This leaves the question: where will the recurrent funding for the environment be when the bulk of Telstra money, barring ongoing interest from $300 million in trust, is spent in five years time? The point of what we were doing when we were in office was gradually building up that budget recurrent commitment to the environment. We did not assume that this particular problem was going to disappear in three years time, four years time, five years time, 10 years time or whatever. We were not taking $1.2 billion out and saying, 'That is the totality of our commitment. That is going to be it and no more. We draw your attention to that and nothing else. Think of nothing else associated with it.' We were building it into recurrent programs; we were not making it hostage to the sale of a particular item in government ownership, namely, Telstra, and, therefore, by logic, out of consideration when recurrent spending comes for consideration for budgets three, four or five years down the track. There is a heck of a lot of pea and thimble trick about this particular proposition and about the environmental fund overall. Nothing about the operation of that fund gives us any confidence either. We have already seen $115 million of it dragged out for the acquisition of and preservation of Tasmanian voting opportunities in the Senate. Then we have seen $300 million slung to Richard Court during his last campaign in Western Australia. This is developing all the dements of a slush fund to be trotted out for particular political purposes when trouble indicates. What board is going to oversee this process? The board is going to be overseen by two ministers. Those are the people who are going to operate this-no expert committee or no group that has any degree of environmental expertise associated with it. Two ministers are going to be operating this particular slush fund. I do believe that we are entitled to think that more needs to be said about this than has been said by the Prime Minister so far. What was our record so demonised by the Prime Minister when he chose to speak on this? He said that after one year in power the coalition would do what the ALP could not do in 13 years. I have already pointed out the survey of environmental issues reflected here. In 1995, we launched the $53 million living on the coast initiative to protect Australia's coastline. Living on the coast included $23 million for the coastcare initiative. Coastcare was based on the landcare mode and aimed to boost community participation in coastal management and help people involved in the day-today management of our coastline. The budget commitment to the Commonwealth coastal policy was $6 million in 1995-96, $13 million in 1996-97, $13 million in 1997-98 and $13 million in 1998-99. But what happened to it this year, this program which is now re-emerging? It was cut to $8.5 million by the coalition in the budget despite an explicit promise not to do so. So that money gets replaced here. This is not new money; it is money that is replacing a set of cuts. As the Minister for the Environment said: Our objective was that the trust fund would be ... additional money . . . on the forward estimates. Since the election the forward estimates have had to be reduced ... to reflect savings ... to some extent, the trust may be called upon to pick upthose lapsed programs. It is a pretty hefty extent in that regard. We also announced in the 1991-92 budget the ocean rescue 2000 program which supported scientific work all around the country to identify suitable sites for a national system of marine reserves. It also included the development of a national marine conservation strategy, production of a marine state of the environment report and development in cooperation with the states and territories of a national representative system of marine protected areas. We also provided $4.2 million for a national centre for research and introduced marine pests. That is not a bad record, building up to a position in which we announced our coastline policy. As I said, all of it was contained within recurrent expenditure on budget, not plucked out of the air or thrown into a poultice-the environmental slush fund of the Liberal Party-and then used to fund programs that would have been there but for the savings taken in the budgetary process. It is entirely reasonable that we ought to have, and we would support it, the idea of a comprehensive oceans policy for this nation. We think it should be balanced and that it does what the Prime Minister says it does but that his program does not allow. Take into account our massive resources in that area and the need to effectively develop them and, at the same time, to ensure that those resources are going to be protected by appropriate preservation activity and appropriate environmental activity associated with them. The Prime Minister's speech was not just a naming of the parts. Anybody could stand up here and elucidate the various elements of our very effective exploitation of marine resources, but it is another thing to develop the programs appropriate to it. What was quite evident by what he had to say was that, by and large, this is a particular set of propositions about development of those resources. Those amounts that go into particular environmental programs specifically are very small indeed. Most of it is for the altogether laudatory purpose of properly assessing what marine resources there are and working out appropriate ways of exploiting it. We should do that. Governments should do that. We were doing that when we happened to be in office. To then go and do what is part of the normal processes of government industry and scientific policy and to then claim that what you are engaged in is spending a $1.2 billion Telstra sale environmental program is another part of the generalised deceit underlying this particular proposition. Of course we should be exploiting our marine resources. Of course the appropriate exploitation of them ought not to be part of this process but a multiplicity of other things. An environmental program should be, in the first instance, front and centre, a program about the environment. Industry policy and scientific policy ought to pick up the other areas of that activity if you are going to get full environmental value from a $1.2 billion program. It is important that we do this. I have already mentioned one particular statistic that puts our fishing zone into perspective and I could talk about a few others in that regard. There is no doubt: one thing about Australians that is commonplace but not easily understood or accepted by Australians is that, far from being a bush people, we are a maritime people and a coastal people. We live on the coast; we exploit the coast for a whole variety of purposes; we survive by our capacity to trade; and we survive by the resources that we exploit in the seas around us. Something that anybody who plans Australian cities knows is that we all deviate as often as possible, if it is not to the hills then it is to the coast. That is where Australians want to live; that is where Australians take their enjoyment; and long may that continue. It is an entirely understandable and very appropriate orientation. But it does impose upon us a very substantial burden. Here I think the Prime Minister ought to restructure his advice in this process and give some substance to his consultative process. Since this is all about consultation and not actually about policy, let us put a bit of flesh on the consultation. The consultation ought to incorporate within it a capacity for people who have genuine expertise. I would suggest to the Prime Minister that he set up either an agency or a committee that is associated with it to receive the sorts of submissions and identify for him the things that he ought to be negotiating with state governments, local governments, foreign governments, industry groups and agencies. I think it would be a very good step on his part to put some system into it, because currently the operation of this entire environmental package has a very big question mark over it-left in the hands of two ministers as it Then I think the Prime Mini ster ought to start taking a look at the international cooperative elements when addressing oceans policy. This is a very important area of potential Australian foreign policy initiative. There is a need for an organisation to coordinate the free exchange of timely oceanographic information at the international level. Whereas meteorological data is widely shared and coordinated by one UN body, the World Meteorological Organisation, oceanography has the involvement of three UN agencies with huge gaps in the middle. Yet free international exchange of such information is vitally important to healthy oceans around the world on issues such as shipping lanes, offshore boundaries, waste dumping, tourism, mining and fishing. I might add that Australian scientists are leading the world in understanding some of these issues, particularly the impacts of ocean on climate-an issue only recently properly understood. I think there is a role for Australia here, Prime Minister, if we are going to utilise effectively the expertise in this country, to recognise that of course the oceans wash everybody's shores, not just ours, and what other people do is critical for us as well. I would take that a point further. I was talking then about a potential UN initiative, a world marine agency effectively like the meteorological one. But I think there is also room for an initiative in this area both within APEC and through the ASEAN regional forum in the light of potential confidence building measures. The ASEAN regional forum is one of the most interesting indigenously developed operations at the moment. I notice the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) is nodding his head on this, and well he might since he now has some responsibilities in that regard. The ASEAN regional forum is an organisation looking for opportunities to settle the minds of people in the area about their claims upon each other by some form of functional integration, and ocean issues are quite critical in that regard, particularly in the South China Seas. This is an opportunity for the Prime is. Minister, through his foreign minister, his defence minister and his trade minister, to start building into the ASEAN regional forum and the APEC process the sorts of confidence building measures on shipping lanes issues, on marine pollution issues, on marine exploitation issues-the sorts of things which are starting to be a source of collision between some of the states in the region immediately to the north of us-and to start to use our expertise in the oceanographic area. There are, of course, many other things that have to be done about those particular problems but, at least in this, there is an opportunity for the Prime Minister to do something. I finalise my reply by· saying that this is a statement about opportunities not yet announced, work not yet done and programs of consultation very haphazardly arranged. In so far as there is anything of value in the statement, it tends to be an extension of our policy-albeit with something of a cutback. It is a real opportunity for the Prime Minister to show a bit of international statesmanship in this area by having a few new initiatives as he goes on his travels around Asia-new initiatives which build on our very considerable expertise. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mrs Moylan) adjourned. NA",48
109,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Repatriation Benefits To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable 'active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded. There are two forms of benefits for ex-servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for 'Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex-members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex-members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam. It is claimed that: (a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on 'active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications; (b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial; (c) the Royal Australian Navy was 'allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently 'unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced; (d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WAG 130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex-members of the RAN had been 'allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex-members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found. (e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the 'Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended; (f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for 'active service'. The fourth, for 'military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya. Your petitioners therefore request the House to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable 'active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960. by Mrs Bailey (from five citizens), Mr Hawker (from five citizens), Mr Miles (from nine citizens),  Mr Sawford (from 32 citizens) and Mr Warwick Smith (from five citizens). Repatriation Benefits To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that there is only one exclusion from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable overseas 'active service' by Australians. That being under 'Operational Service' at Section 6.(1)(c)(ii) of the Act for members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960. The various claims used to date to maintain their exclusion have now been proved wrong by documents in the Australian Archives and elsewhere in the public domain. Some of the claims used to support the exclusion are: (a) members of the RAN were only doing the duty for which they had enlisted (which applied to all service personnel everywhere); (b) they were in no danger (they shared the same dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and were also required to serve under the United Nations command in Korean waters in case that war had started again); (c) they were never 'allotted' for operational service (a letter from the Secretary to the Department of the Navy dated 11 November 1955 categorically stated the date from which the RAN was 'allotted' for operational service was 1 July 1955); (d) they were not on 'Special Overseas Service' (such Service began with the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act of 1962 i.e. two years after their service ended and did not therefore apply to them); and (e) they were not on 'active service' (their service complied with all but one of the requirements of the only Defence Department definition of 'active service' the exception being 'or in military occupation of a foreign country' which did not apply to Malaya). Your petitioners therefore request the House to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby giving the Australian sailors involved comparative recognition and treatment with all other Australians who have honourably served their country on active service overseas. by Mrs Elizabeth Grace (from 23 citizens). Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House their concem for the future provision of affordable, appropriate and quality public housing in the context of current negotiations between the Commonwealth and States and Territories on agreements made under the Housing Assistance Act 1996. Your petitioners therefore request the House to take actions to ensure that the Coalition Government meet its commitments to: the principle that tenants in public housing are not charged more than 25% of their income in rent; the principle that existing tenants in public housing are not disadvantaged; and introducing accountable strategies for addition and replacement of housing stock to ensure that proceeds of sales of public housing to tenants are reinvested in public housing. by Mr Bevis (from 232 citizens). Bears To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the State of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House that approximately 8,000 bears are being kept in cages in China for the purpose of extracting bile for medical purposes and that the cages are so small the bears cannot move, which results in some of them going mad. It is further brought to the attention of the House that the Chinese plan to increase the number of bears, for these purposes, to 40,000. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to object most strongly to this horrendous and tragic practice and ask that steps be taken to stop it immediately. by Mr Eoin Cameron (from 2,617 citizens). Consumer Price Index To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives, Canberra: We the undersigned petitioners do show that: 1. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), of necessity, covers all prices including luxuries and; 2. Pensioners spend their income on the necessities of life, which rise by greater amounts and more frequently than other items, and the pension, adjusted twice yearly according to the CPI, is losing its value and has become inadequate to our needs. We therefore call on Parliament to grant an immediate $10 (Ten Dollar) increase in the weekly pension over and above the CPI, and this we humbly pray. by Mr Entsch (from 59 citizens). Medicare Offices To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. We the undersigned members of your electorate wish to bring to your attention our concerns relating to recent information that Medicare offices are intended for closure. We the petitioners respectfully submit that any reform of the delivery of Medicare services to the public must maintain the existence of all Medicare offices in order to ensure that public access to the full range of Medicare services is maintained, in accordance with election promises. We therefore call on you to make representation in parliament on behalf of your constituents about these matters and to make public your opposition to the closure of the Medicare offices in your region now, or in the future. We call on you to make a public commitment to preserving intact the Medicare system. by Mr Laurie Ferguson (from 45 citizens). Mobile Phone Service To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: For the safety of many rural Victorians, the Commonwealth Government hasten the introduction of better mobile phone services to Western Victoria. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House instruct the Minister to see that the safety of rural Victorians is no longer compromised by poor communications, and immediately install a better mobile phone service. And your petitioners, in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Hawker (from nine citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents in the State of Victoria, draws to the attention of the House that: the funding cuts to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) will mean a significant reduction of Australian content on ABC TV, in drama, documentaries and education program; the funding cuts will threaten the ABC's Statebased productions; the funding cuts can radically cut the number of hours the ABC broadcast each day; the funding cuts can mean the closure of at least one of the three national radio networks, ABC-FM, Radio National or Triple J; and the funding cuts is a breach of the Coalition's election promise to maintain funding in real terms over the term of the present Government. Your petitioners therefore request the House that these funding cuts be immediately reversed and assurances given to the ABC that their funding will be restored. by Mr Holding (from 49 citizens). To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of Victoria draws to the attention of the House that: the Federal Coalition Government has completely withdrawn funding from Australia's contemporary music organisation-Ausmusic; has ignored the findings of a 1994 Coopers and Lybrand report, which recommended Ausmusic be federally funded for a period of five years, in order that it become commercially viable; and has placed in jeopardy the future of Ausmusic programs, including the annual Australian Music Day, Australian Music Education Week and industry courses which are offered at more than 1,200 schools, youth training centres, technical and further education colleges and universities. Your petitioners therefore request the House to reverse the decision made by the Minister for Communications, the Hon Richard Alston, and reinstate full funding to Ausmusic as it provides valuable employment and export opportunities for young Australians. by Mr Holding (from 21 citizens). Mobile Phone Towers To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales calls to the attention of the House that recent expert opinion suggests a link between exposure to low levels of radiation emitted from telephone radio base station towers which may cause significant health risks including childhood leukemia, cancers, miscarriages, eye damage and impaired learning and memory function. Your petitioners therefore request that the House requires the Minister for Communications and the Arts to issue a direction to TELSTRA to immediately refrain from constructing or further constructing telephone towers in the vicinity of homes and schools. by Mr MCClelland (from 443 citizens). Registered Clubs: Taxation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales calls on the Federal Parliament to prevent the Australian Taxation Office from retrospectively taxing Registered Clubs for commission they have received from Club TAB and Club Keno operations as the tax will cause severe damage to the Club Industry, cause significant job losses and reduce the amenities which are provided by the registered Clubs to the citizens of Australia. Ausmusic by Mr MCClelland (from 218 citizens). Multiculturalism To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the State of NSW calls on the Federal Parliament to initiate and promote an education program aimed at: l. informing citizens of the benefits obtained by Australia and its people from our immigration program, and 2. promoting the richness of the cultural diversity and tolerance that exists in Australia which has gained the respect of the international community and has benefited Australia through trade links and greatly influenced the selection of Sydney to host the year 2000 Olympic Games. by Mr MCClelland (from 101 citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House their concern at the threat to the independence of the ABC by severe cuts to its funding. Your petitioners therefore pray that the Hous\! take such action as will enable the ABC to retain sufficient funding to maintain its pre-eminent position in Australian broadcasting free from political or commercial interference. by Mr Mossfield (from 71 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House the extraordinary fluctuation of petrol prices in city and metropolitan services stations during holiday breaks and prior to and after long weekends and ordinary weekends. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House take such action as will enable a consistent petrol price to apply across all service stations to the advantage of all motorists. by Mr Mossfield (from 47 citizens). Widows: Allowances To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House their concern at the disruption to the lives of and additional stress to many widows who are being placed onto widows allowance without the benefit of a concession card that assists during the payment of rates, phone accounts, car registration and public transport. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House take such action as will enable these persons to be restored to some dignity and proper respect by a full return of their concession card thus recognising the special and insecure income position their single status places them in. by Mr Mossfield (from 45 citizens). Nursing Homes: Funding Cuts To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House their concern at the cuts in funding for additions to nursing homes. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House take such action as will enable these much needed local facilities to receive full and adequate funding to enable more beds to be provided in this area of social need. by Mr Mossfield (from 44 citizens). Mobile Phone Towers To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain parents, families and community members of Mitcham Preschool Com'munity in the State of South Australia points out to the House the objection to the Environmental Protection Authority'S acceptance of Mitcham Community Court as the location for a large mobile phone tower for Telstra and Vodafone and support Petrol Prices the City of Mitcham's efforts to halt the installation of this tower. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House halt the installation of this tower which not only compromises the children's future safety and well being, but the enormity of which visually impacts on this Heritage area. by Dr Southcott (from 466 citizens), Telstra Telecommunication Tower To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of South Australia, electors of the Division of Boothby and members of the St John's Grammar School community draw attention to the House that a Telstra Telecommunications Tower will be erected at the water tower on Sheoak Road Belair in close proximity to our school especially our Kindergarten. The petitioners below are concerned that there have been questions raised over the possible effects to human health from long term low levels of exposure to Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR). Your petitioners therefore request that the House move to cease the construction of the said Telstra Telecommunication Tower as soon as possible. by Dr Southcott (from 297 citizens). Petitions received. NA Message from the Governor General reported informing the House of assent to the following bills: Customs Amendment Bill (No.1) 1997 Customs Depot Licensing Charges Bill 1997 NA Automobile Industry",52
110,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (1) acknowledges the progress made by local car and component manufacturers and their labour force in achieving increased productivity, improved export performance and quality production to the benefit of Australian consumers; (2) expresses its concems at the majority recommendations of the Industry Commission interim report on the automobile industry and especially the recommendation to reduce tariffs below 15%; (3) expresses its concerns that the Chairman of the Commission has chosen to publicly advocate this recommendation, while at the same time pretending that he will produce an objective final report; (4) expresses its firm belief that when all factors are taken into account (including Australia's obligations under the World Trade Organisation) the overwhelming national interest is for motor car tariffs to remain at 15% after the year 2000; and (5) is of the view that the reductions which have taken place in the tariffs to this point significantly cut the prices of motor cars for consumers and that to reduce tariffs below 15% will be tantamount to devastating the Australian automobile industry and destroying thousands of skilled jobs in regional Australia. I gave notice of this motion on 11 February. It is interesting that there have been significant developments since it was put on the Notice Paper. In particular, I refer to the fact that the federal opposition and the shadow minister have chosen to take very significant action in relation to this matter which has been coming up. When I speak on this issue, I do not speak as just an interested observer. I speak as the representative of the seat of Calwell, a seat which contains the Ford Motor Co - one of the biggest employers and one of the biggest automobile companies in Australia. I keep in touch with the managing director and the officials at Ford. I must say that in my discussions with them. I have been increasingly concerned about the trend which has occurred in relation to what may happen to the car industry if the recommendations of the Industry Commission were accepted. The reason that I decided to bring this matter before the House is that I and the majority of members on both sides of this House are very concerned about those recommendations. One need not go into the ideological prejudices of the Industry Commission. Over a number of years, it has brought down reports which have been lacking in objectivity and have been based essentially on the presentation of one set of assumptions with respect to economic theory and the approach to the economy. Be that as it may, in this case we are not just talking about some theory. We are talking about the fate of thousands and thousands of Australian men and women who work in these industries, both in the main production plants and for component manufacturers. As a result of the adoption of the car industry plans under the Labor government, we had a period of consolidation for this industry. The industry had to cope with significant and very large reductions in protection, in tariff levels, over a period of have not years and an increase in imports. Indeed, imports have increased from 1984, when they were 23.6 per cent of the total passenger market, to 43.8 per cent in 1995-nearly a doubling of imports; and that trend is continuing. Under those circumstances, we are in danger of losing our industries. We were in danger anyway, to some degree, but the car companies decided to try to adjust to the new circumstances, to the idea that by the year 2000 there would be a reduction in tariffs to 15 per cent. Then what did we do? We have this report which basically says, 'That is not enough. We will reduce them even further.' This additional reduction is critical because it will make it virtually impossible for many of these companies to viably continue to produce motor cars in Australia. If that is the case-just as it has already suited some major multinational companies not to produce a single thing in Australia but to import the totality of their stock-we could have a situation in which some of our companies, including Ford, may at a given moment cut their losses and say, 'Irrespective of the investment we made in Australia, it is clear that the Australian government does not support the motor car industry.' When I say that we have to do something to freeze tariffs at the level of 15 per cent and that we should not go beyond that level at least until the year 200S-and, even then, only on the basis of an inquiry and an objective determination of all the factors-we get support for that view from an overwhelming proportion of Australians. Most Australians want to see a viable motor car industry in this country. Those who argue in favour of further reductions say that there has been some benefit for consumers. The benefit for consumers has been minimal. There has not been a significant reduction in the cost of motor cars as a result of the increase in the level of imports and the increased competition from imports. It is true that there has been increasing efficiency in the Australian industry and, as a result of that, we have been able to produce and sell cars at a level which is increasingly competitive in international terms. But, CHART 33 Country Vehicle Market Malaysia 285,000 Indonesia 350,000 China 1.49m Brazil 1.68m nevertheless, when it comes to the crunch we have to think about balance. The question of balance is a fundamental one which, unfortunately, the current government does not understand; that is, the balance between the national economic interests and the interests of international trade, the interests of the W orId Trade Organisation and the like. One clause in this motion says that to freeze tariffs at that particular level and to actually proceed along the lines similar to the motor car plan announced in the last few days by the federal opposition is not inconsistent with our obligations under the World Trade Organisation. Why do I say that? Because, as we have said, this matter has to be a question of looking at what we are doing and also looking at what other nations are doing, .especially other nations in our region. You cannot go around saying, 'Let's all have a free trade situation. Let's all reduce our tariffs,' when the only country that is actually doing a substantial amount in the car industry area is Australia. We have done enough in this area. It is time for other countries to pull their weight. The Ford Motor Co., in its submission to the Industry Commission, had a table headed 'APEC developments on market liberalisation'. The facts in this table are very valid. I seek the permission of the House to incorporate this table in Hansard. Leave granted.

113,Ms JEANES,APEC DEVELOPMENTS ON MARKET LIBERALISATION,"I rise secure in the knowledge that no-one in this House, or indeed this parliament, wants to see the end of the Australian automotive industry. There are, however, a range of views across the parliament about the assistance that the industry needs to enable it to continue its operations in Australia. The debate at this time has, of course, been triggered by the Industry Commission's draft report into the industry, released last December. The draft report included majority recommendations from commissioners Bill Scales and Jeffrey Rae, and minority recommendations from Commissioner Ian Webber. The majority recommendations have been rejected univerCBU Tariff Rate per cent Other Restraint Mechanisms Size 42-68.5 61 50 Import licensing 30 Ban on Japan and Australia 10 Voluntary trade restraint agreement with Japan 8 Ban on Japan Complex local regulations 8 2.5 Voluntary trade restraint agreement (note: 25% truck) with Japan o Complex distribution arrangements. 25 Nil (Note: 5% truck) sally by the automotive industry; it has generally embraced Mr Webber's minority recommendations. The government is adhering to the required process in that it will make its decision based on the final report, after its release on 12 May. The motion put forward by the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), it is fair to say, asks the House to reject the majority recommendations and to accept the minority recommendations. But, as it is a five-part motion, I will address each part on its own merits. There can be no doubt, as the first part of the motion states, that the Australian automotive industry is now an efficient industry, competitive on the world's markets because its products are highly competitive in terms of both price and quality. Part of the requirement for achieving this efficiency is attaining the volume necessary to reach optimum production levels. It is this issue of volume that is critical to the industry'S continued existence in Australia and thus its capacity to employ Australian workers. Another vital factor in regard to the performance of the wider manufacturing sector is the impact of the technology developed in the automotive industry on the wider manufacturing base. The effect of the loss of this technology on the wider sector has not received the public attention that it deserves. The Industry Commission recognised that volume is critical to the industry in order to achieve the efficiency that the commission's very reason for being strives for. Yet two of its recommendations-the reduction of tariffs by 2.5 per cent per year until 2004 and the cessation of the export facilitation schemehave the capacity to wipe out the volume from underneath the industry. We must seriously face the danger that, if we accept these recommendations, one or more of the passenger motor vehicle manufacturers and of the component manufacturers will leave Australia. Those who argue that the industry is crying wolf should remember that Nissan once manufactured cars in Australia. Mitsubishi, GMH, Toyota and Ford have stuck it out and, because they have, over 200,000 Australians are employed. The second part of the motion asks the House to express its concern about the majority recommendation to reduce tariff protection to five per cent by 2004. Toyota's president, Mr Sam Komori, predicted last week that all four Australian car manufacturers will be forced to close if the federal government accepts the majority report recommendation on tariff reduction. There can be no other explanation for this recommendation other than that it is driven by the ideological preference of the Industry Commissioners because it ignores much of the reality acknowledged in the report itself. It completely ignores the fundamental reality of competition for investment within the multinational automotive companies. Economic rationalism is becoming our nation's newest form of cancer. It has pervaded Canberra's bureaucracy to a degree that has distorted the effectiveness of the advice that government receives because of its failure to incorporate broader social, political and geographic factors effectively, if at all. We should all be mindful of the fact that the Australian operations of our car producers amount to around one per cent of their global operations and that the very fact that they continue to invest in their Australian operations delivers over 200,000 jobs in this country. It is a very sad fact that Australia does not have complete sovereignty over its automotive industry. The fact that I wish we did will not change the fact that we do not. It is this point that the Industry Commission ignored and it is this point, apart from its flawed economics, that destroys the arguments for the majority recommendations. Our car manufacturers compete for investment from their parent companies, many of whom are already producing in other countries in our region, where they enjoy much higher levels of assistance and protection from governments and where they can directly supply the demand of much larger populations than Australia's. If the parent companies do not continue to invest here, there won't be an Australian automotive industry. The third part of the motion expresses concern about the Chairman of the Industry Commission taking to the streets and publicly 'advocating the reduced tariffs recommendation while simultaneously stating that he will produce an objective final report. I suspect that the question of objectivity is in the eye of the beholder. There is no way that many of us in this House will ever accept that the majority report is, in any way, objective. The chairman would have to do a complete about face and support the minority report for most South Australian members and senators, the South Australian and the Victorian Premiers, the industry, the unions and most Australians to consider that he had produced an objective report. The one thing that Bill Scales has achieved is to unite a most diverse group of Australians. The draft report does provide an accurate picture of the Australian automotive industry. Yet its majority recommendations impose a prescriptive response to the future needs of the industry that could destroy it. It is a text book that could be entitled, 'A very detailed description of the Australian automotive industry and an economic rationalist prescription for the car industry that flies in the face of that very detailed description'. The fourth part of the motion states that it is in Australia's national interest for car tariffs to remain at 15 per cent after the year 2000. It is not clear where the motion suggests that tariffs should go after that in light of the fact that the previous government committed the industry to a tariff level of zero per cent by the year 2010. What is clear though is that the industry believes it needs the opportunity to take a breathing space after it reaches 15 per cent in 2000. The report acknowledges that many of the substantial and easier reforms necessary to make the industry more efficient have been implemented due to the massive reduction of protection that it faced over the past decade or so. The report also acknowledges that many of the reforms it now faces are more complex and will be more difficult to achieve. Surely we should not hit the industry over the head with a blunt instrument to make it do in five years what it cannot do. It is clear that it is obviously in Australia's national interest that the car industry continues to operate in Australia and to ensure this the industry must be given its well-earned breathing space after its outstanding performance in improving efficiency and quality over the past decade or so. It is also obviously in Australia's interest that Adelaide does not become a ghost town with tumbleweed rolling down Rundle Mall and the ghost of John Wayne leaning against the deserted, dusty bar of the Grosvenor Hotel blowing on his Colt 45 after annihilating one of the thousands of feral cats that have taken control of the city. What will the rest of Australia do with us? Will the eastern states guarantee 1Y2 million people employment, housing, education and health services? Does the rest of Australia consider Adelaide's demise to be a desirable social outcome? Who does Bill Scales suggest should pick up the bill for the unemployed car industry workers, and how much will it cost to rehabilitate a state that already has an unemployment rate which hovers around 1Y2 points higher than the national average and has serious structural problems that it is struggling to address? This is precisely where the other fatal flaw in Bill Scales's report lies. It ignores the effects on regional communities of its recommendation to remove support from the industry. It acknowledges that the effects will be negatively felt in South Australia and says, 'So what!' The fifth part of the motion notes that the tariff reductions faced by the industry over the past decade have not resulted in a significant reduction in the price of Australian made cars. It also notes the view that the proposed tariff reduction could see thousands of Australian jobs transferred offshore. Neither Bill Scales nor anyone else asked my constituents how they feel about moving to Korea, Japan or the United States to follow their jobs when the board members of Mitsubishi decide to move their investment from Australian soil to any of their overseas plants and the component manufacturers who employ my constituents follow in their footsteps. It is an interesting motion and one which the opposition can afford to put forward because they no longer have to live up to the responsibilities of being in government. I do not like the fact that we have to wait until 12 May for a response, but we do. My primary focus as the member for Kingston is to protect the jobs of my 8,000 or so employees who derive their living-who feed, clothe, house and educate themselves and their families-from the wage they earn working in the Australian automotive industry. I will continue to contribute in a constructive way to the debate to ensure the protection of my constituents' jobs. My government's biggest challenge is to find employment for around 800,000 Australians who are currently out of work. None of us want to have to find a further 200,000 jobs for unemployed automotive industry workers. The battle for zero tariffs has been wonwe are heading there in 201O-but Australia's automotive industry workers do not have to be the sacrificial lambs in someone else's ideological race to get there sooner. There is no point in Australia entering into agreements to reach a level playing field in the year 2020, when the other car manufacturing countries in our region have to reach zero, to find that we turn up at the finish line empty handed because all our cars have gone.",59
114,Mr OCONNOR,APEC DEVELOPMENTS ON MARKET LIBERALISATION,"I welcome the opportunity to support this motion relating to the car industry proposed by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). I acknowledge his long standing interest in industry policy matters-this industry in particular. I also welcome the statement last week by the federal Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, announcing Labor's six-point plan for the car and component industry beyond the year 2000. The central feature of Labor's plan is to freeze tariffs at 15 per cent on motor vehicles original equipment and replacement components from the years 2000 to 2005. The plan establishes a desire to achieve a transparent method of assessing the progress made by our trading partners in lowering their tariff and non-tariff barriers to the products of this all-important industry and we are providing in this plan for a review at the year 2003 to assess how our trading partners are progressing along that route. An important element of that plan is the retention of the export facilitation scheme, which has been responsible for the enormous growth in component manufacturing exports from this industry. We are also proposing continue the duty free allowance to support the domestic market value added and also provide a supportive research and developmentary ment framework for this industry to that it stays competitive over the longer term. The plan is not a gift to the industry. Labor's plan calls for the industry to come the party with further investments and jobs the year 2005. We estimate that, particular plan in place, we can more than double the number of vehicle exports to 100,000 units per year by the year 2005, treble the exports of motor vehicle compoabout nents to $3 billion and, of course, create some 10,000 new jobs in this vital area of manufacto turing in Australia. The part of the motion that I wish to address today relates to the regional employment implications of the Productivity Commission's recommendations with regard to this industry. The car and component manufacturTheophanous) ing industry is of critical importance to Geelong and its hinterland as some 3,700 people are directly employed in motor vehicle manufacturing and component manufacturing in the Geelong area. When you take into account the Golden region, of which Geelong is a part, with the other great provincial of Ballarat and its immediate environs, both those cities have over 5,000 people currently employed directly in automobile manufacturing and component manufacturing in Australia and in those regions. I was very interested in the comments of the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) on this particular motion. It merely highlights the deep divisions which are appearing in coalition ranks on the very issue of where we are going to take the car industry beyond the year 2000. I contrast the attitudes and sentiments that were expressed by the honourable member for Kingston, who has substantial employment in car and component manufacturing in her electorate, with the position taken on the floor of this House by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur), who has consistently advocated, well before 1993, a zero tariff proposal for this industry, which would have already seen the demise not only of Ford in Geelong but also of manufacturing to employment in this industry. I am also interested in the attitude of the to honourable member for Ballarat, the ParliaSecretary to the Minister for Transensure port and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson), to this question. I happened to be in Ballarat last Friday, where I announced to elements of Labor's plan. It was warmly to received at the Bendix Mintex plant, which with this employs 730 people. The honourable member for Ballarat got a bit testy when he was challenged by Martin Ferguson on the floor of the House last week where he stands on this particular industry. I invite the parliamentary secretary come clean with the electors of Ballarat and the electors that comprise Geelong and Ballarat in the Golden region and let us know exactly where he stands. (Time expired)  and good that the member for Calwell (Dr opposes the majority draft report of the Industry Commission's inquiry into the automotive industry. And I am sure the people of Calwell will be grateful for his support of the car industry, though after having their member sit on the government benches for so long they might have expected city some action a little earlier. The member for Calwell might have tried to ensure that the Labor government delivered the tax reform promised the automotive industry in exchange for their acceptance of the Button plan. But cutting taxes, especially those levied on business, is clearly not in the make-up of this man who clings so desperately to such an outdated leftist ideology. Nor did the member for Calwelllead the drive to reform industrial relations. Thirteen years of Labor government kowtowing to a union movement did little for those it was supposed to represent, and even less for the general welfare of the nation. It was left up to the coalition to bring in a new regime that will assist not the union movement but employers and employees. The cost of labour still represents somewhere in the region of 21 per cent of the inputs in building a vehicle and, while productivity improvements have brought costs down, the new arrangements will serve to bring about further reductions-not by cutting wages but by increasing efficiency. But, shrill and hollow as the words of the honourable member sound in light of his role in the previous government, his motion is not totally without merit. I concur with his thoughts that, if post-20()() tariff reductions as recommended by the Industry Commission's draft report were implemented, they would have a debilitating effect on employment in his state and particularly mine. It is important to remember that in South Australia the automotive industry is as large a share of GSP as the wine and defence industries combined. I suspect that General Motors, Mitsubishi, Ford and Toyota will always maintain a presence in Australia. But the question we must ask is: what will be their role? Will they be manufacturing Australian cars and providing Australians with manufacturing jobs or will they become merely clearing houses for vehicles built in the United States, Japan or other countries? To live in Australia is no longer to live in isolation. Protectionism is dead. The automotive industry knows it and even the member for Calwell knows it. But we cannot afford to lose an industry that is so vital to the southern states. By all means, let us aim at removing the barriers in synchronicity with our trading partners. But let us not be the one to jump in the freezing pool while our n-ighbours stand around and ask, 'What's the water like?' The member for Calwell has expressed doubts about the likelihood of an objective final report, given the chairman's public statements. I might point out that, while there was contention between the commissioners on the tariff issue, there was agreement on the other findings. I certainly hold no brief for the draft opinions on post-2000 tariffs expressed by Messrs Scales and Rae and would hope that their final effort shows an about-face on the issue. But far more important than any report is the response of the government and its approach to implementing the commission's findings. The automotive industry have survived myriad changes thus far. It has not been easy but they have coped, despite the broken promises of the previous government. But the responsibility is now with the coalition. Being from a state where motor vehicles represent a major part of the manufacturing base, I am well aware that governments need to make life a little easier for them during this period of adjustment. Any acceptance of a proposal to further slash tariffs without also implementing reforms to assist the industry would leave it with a massive, perhaps permanent, hangover. The motor vehicle industry is important-it would be more important still if more Australians bought more new cars. As the member for Calwell pointed out, tariff reductions of the past decade have not brought prices down to a level where people are trading up with any regularity. With this government's reforms in industrial relations about to take effect, the time is ripe to take a good look at our tax system. Those who wish to abolish tariffs in the name of ideological purity will surely agree as well to abolish some of the abominable charges levied on business. Given that industry has been making all the moves for the past decade, it is now the tum of government. By all means, let us have a lean and mean car industry, but let us ensure that we still have one. And let us have one without the hypocrisy and cant of the previous Labor government-now in oppositionon this issue. Clearly, this is a very difficult issue for South Australia and Victoria. We will, as two states, I am sure, with our Premiers, be working towards a good result for the employees and the employers in the car industry in our two states.",61
115,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,APEC DEVELOPMENTS ON MARKET LIBERALISATION,Mr Jenkins)The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. ABC Charter,64
116,Mr BROADBENT,APEC DEVELOPMENTS ON MARKET LIBERALISATION,"On behalf of the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), I move: That this House: (1) notes in the recommendations by Mr Bob Mansfield on the role and functions of the ABC, that a revised ABC Charter should emphasise the importance of providing services to regional Australia and the for ABC services generally to reflect tralian regional and cultural diversity; (2) strongly endorses the recommendation; and (3) calls on the Government to adopt the recommendation and to expand urgently the Charter accordingly. The motion before the House in regard to the ABC charter actually calls on this parliament to change the charter on behalf of those people who live in regional Australia and looks towards having the board and all those involved in ABC management focus on the charter as it affects Australia in regional areas. It is very clear that, as the song goes that is sung in many of our schools now: We are one but we are many, And from all the lands we come. We share our dreams and sing in one voice, 'I am, you are, we are Australian.' It is those sorts of sentiments that drive people in regional Australia to say, 'We want to be part of what's happening in Australia.' And it is just not good enough any more for a charter not to recognise the importance of ABC radio to regional Australia. In fact, the ABC's regional role is essentially in radio. It operates 34 full-size stations and 14 similar studios in regional areas. Regional radio programming is more broadly based than that of ABC metropolitan stations and Radio National. It has less politics and social issues content, more music, and specific rural programs are 6.5 per cent of content. One of ABC radio's objectives is to provide a full range of radio services to all Australians and so it has expanded its coverage by Triple J to 44 regional centres. It is terribly important for the whole of regional Australia, and the Mansfield recommendation 6 was that the charter 'be revised to emphasise the importance of providing services to regional Australia', although he did not suggest a specific form of words. Nor are we today to suggest to anybody a specific form of words with regard to changes to the ABC charter. What we are saying is that the current need charter is a rounded document that allows the Aus- board great latitude in how it delivers its radio and other services across Australia. However, we are saying as a group of representatives of the people that this is no longer good enough, and there is a recommendation 6 from the Mansfield report that should be urgently implemented and changes made to the charter so that we can have a reflection of what is Australia-and Australia is formed greatly by the regions that surround our capital cities. We have a problem, though, not only with the charter but with those people who are managing the ABC. It is not a direct criticism, but the first thing we want to is say is that there has not been the type of emphasis we desire for ABC regional radio. Every time there is a change it seems that regional radio is the first to get a bit of a slash or a bit of a kick. As an example, Sue Howard, the current Head of Regional Services, joined the ABC in Adelaide as a general announcer in 1986. She moved back to Melbourne, her home town, to work with national radio. She has since worked with ABC Classic FM as well as for metropolitan regional radio, most recently as 3LO's breakfast presenter. In 1995 she was appointed Manager of Regional Radio in Victoria and subsequently manager of 3LO. She remains based in Melbourne and her role is to target, commission and deliver TV and radio services to meet local audience needs around Australia-and I emphasise the word 'local'. 'Regional' is used in the broader sense to incorporate local metropolitan needs, not just regional services. She has overall responsibility for ABC branches, audience research and the syndication of programs among local broadcasting outlets. We have an immediate change in the Gippsland area, for instance, where I have some concern, in that the afternoon program was immediately changed to a regional Victoria program. I do not know how you can have local emanating from Melbourne. When we talking about local, we talk about the floods that were in Traralgon only last year when we were able to go straight to ABC radio, straight to the spot, with Kevin Carmody standing up to his knees in water telling regional Australia and telling our metropolitan friends exactly what was happening in the country. Regional radio is not only important for that reason but it can flick from very local to very regional al if need be. So there is a two-way split in what is happening in regional radio. We want the people that are now concerned with the management of services specifically to have the charter changed so they are forced to address themselves to regional radio issues and to make it extremely important. When I talk to the people in the electorates around Gippsland, they immediately say, 'We are important too. We've got our hands up and we believe that we should be getting more care, because even local weather broadcasts are terribly important to the way we do business-to the way farmers do business, to the way regional business operates.' All of this encapsulates the point that we do not believe there has been enough emphasis on regional radio-and neither does the National Farmers Federation. They are saying, 'We don't want fewer regional services; we want greater regional services.' The member for Indi has a view that he needs the ABC as a critical part of his electorate, where it plays a major role. I am saying-and, I am sure, Mr Lieberman is saying-that ABC radio forms a critical part of what the future of our regions is going to be. The people in those regions need not only their universities but also ABC radio as a integral part of the strategic opportunities for regional Australia. It is also terribly important to the coverage of arts and cultural issues in local areas. Once again, we are talking not only about issues that may be of a business nature but also about arts and cultural issues and those issues raised by people. I met a visually impaired group of people who do a telelink service. I spoke to them and I said, 'What are your other links into the community?' They said, 'ABC regional radio is terribly important to us.' They were not happy with the changes that have been wrought----<:hanges that took the afternoon program from a very, very local program to a program that went all across Victoria. I am sure that is happening across the rest of Australia. We want those people, such as Sue Howard, to have as part of the charter an instruction about the resource funding that goes to ABC radio, especially in and then to nation- the regions. I picked up a newsletter from the Friends of the ABC today. They seem to be on the wrong side of the fence here because they are saying that the charter should not be changed and that the responsibilities that are there are fine. Can I say to the Friends of the ABC: I do not see a lot of reference to their support for regional radio in this particular newsletter. I hope there are other support mechanisms that will be coming through. Although the existing charter provides a reasonable framework, it is time that country people were recognised for the important role that we play in the support that is there for the cities. Yes, we are one and we are many, but we would like to be included. There is absolutely no doubt now that regional Australia has stood up and said, 'In regard to regional radio we want to be addressed.' We have a great opportunity as a parliament to address the issues that affect country people by recognising them in the charter by supporting this motion. I have looked at the Mansfield report. There are many, many people out in regional Australia who have put a great investment into the Mansfield review. There is a great opportunity for us now as a parliaml nt to react to what people are actually saying in country areas. They want to feel that their radio is local; they want to talk about local issues. When we are talking about 'local', we are not talking about the whole of the state or the whole of Australia; we are talking about the regions that people live in. I am sure that, as the rest of the speakers come through supporting this motion, they will reflect the feelings of the honourable member for Indi and those people throughout Victoria who address themselves to us whenever we travel by saying, 'We are looking for regional radio across Australia to inform us as to what is going on not only at a national level through their news broadcasts but certainly at a very local level.' I thank you for the opportunity to address the House and I congratulate the member for Indi on his efforts in support of regional radio. (Time expired)",64
117,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,APEC DEVELOPMENTS ON MARKET LIBERALISATION,Mr Jenkins)Is the motion seconded?,66
118,Mr ANTHONY,APEC DEVELOPMENTS ON MARKET LIBERALISATION,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,66
119,Mr FITZGIBBON,APEC DEVELOPMENTS ON MARKET LIBERALISATION,"I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to support the motion put forward by the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) and moved by my friend the member for MCMillan (Mr Broadbent). The motion calls upon the government to act on those recommendations of Mr Bob Mansfield in such a way as to ensure that the ABC's presence and the programming which we now enjoy in rural and regional Australia remain in rural and regional Australia. I was delighted to learn, on the release of the Mansfield report, that he has recognised the critical role that ABC radio, in particular, plays in rural and regional Australia. He has recognised the importance of the regular reporting of state regional and local affairs and the importance of specialised rural and related information such as detailed weather reports in rural and regional Australia. An AGB MCNair survey commissioned by the New South Wales Farmers Association last year showed that four in five farmers listen to ABC radio on a regular basis. No doubt that is mainly a function of their dependence on the information they gain daily from ABC radio-information like livestock reports from saleyards and, something I have already mentioned, the all-important regular weather information. Of course, none of this should come as a surprise to us. There have been a number of reports over many years that have highlighted the critical role that the ABC plays in rural and regional Australia. One of these reports was the Dix report of 1979. Those of us who live in the Hunter do not need the Mansfield report to remind us of the important role ABC radio and television play in rural and regional Australia. We have what is, I suspect, the most professional and cost efficient service in Australia in radio 2NC Newcastle and its Upper Hunter outpost, radio 2UH. Operating with only about eight staff, the Newcastle newsroom is one of the smallest in the nation that offers its own composite news bulletins which are entirely compiled and read by the newsroom and include international, national, state and local copy-but not necessarily in that order. The Newcastle team prioritises the news to reflect the expectations of the Hunter community and to reflect the priority of news in the eyes of those residents. Within the ABC in the Hunter we have a dedicated team who have been prepared to embrace change and to provide the same service-if not better-as that traditionally enjoyed by Hunter residents. The team in the Hunter Valley have weathered the storm of the budget cuts but they certainly are not in a position to wear any further cuts. That is why it is so important that the government move quickly to embrace Bob Mansfield's recommendations with respect to rural and regional Australia. What intrigues me about this motion is the sudden interest being displayed by the member for Indi, the member for MCMillan and indeed the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony). I have to ask the question: where were they during the address-in-reply? Where were they in those heady days post the Prime Minister's first budget when we learned $209 million would be cut from the ABC's budget over four years? Of course, the most sensible conclusive way of addressing the threat posed to rural and regional Australia would be simply to oppose the budget cuts, to stand up for rural and regional Australia to ensure that that funding is restored. If government members are not prepared to do that, they have to give some trade-offs. They have to determine what else and rural Australia is to maintain the level funding that it currently enjoys. We have learned that the rock-solid guaranto tee given by the coalition prior to the with respect to ABC funding was one of those non-core promises we have heard so much about. You remember the promises, Mr on election Deputy Speaker. They were contained in their document entitled Better Communications: The Coalition will maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC. The Coalition will maintain the current prohibition on advertising and sponsorship on ABC television and radio. The Coalition is committed to maintaining the ABC's comprehensive radio network. We will encourage and support the ongoing expansion of ABC radio, including the extension of the highly successful Triple J network into regional Australia. We all know the story now. By 26 September the minister was ducking and weaving. When addressing the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts, the minister started using definitions of words to try to explain away that pre-election commitment. He then started to suggest that 'current', 'existing' and other words did not always mean the same thing. The minister had a little more difficultly when explaining his election night comments. It was difficult enough to explain why the government went back on the commitment contained in their document, but he had a little more difficulty responding to questions on the answers that he gave on election night to the ABC's Jim Middleton. Let me share with the House what the minister said on that occasion. Jim Middleton asked the minister that whether the pre-election commitment to maintain ABC funding levels still stood. His response was: and most Alston: 'Absolutely.' 'Absolutely,' he said. The interview went on: Middleton: 'Even if you discover on Monday that the budget's bottom line is much worse than the for a change government's been saying?' Alston: 'Oh yes. I think John Howard's made it very plain that we want to maintain--honour--all our commitments and the ABC is a very important goes if regional part of that.' of Senator Chris Schacht, our representative on communications in the upper house, wanted pursue that more vigorously. In the comelection mittee he asked Senator Alston: But after you had clearly won the election, while being interviewed by Mr Middleton from the ABC night, you clearly said yes in response to a question that the level of the maintenance of funding in real terms was for the term of the parliament. Senator Alston responded: I think I said 'absolutely' and went on to explain what I meant by all of that. If you are seriously suggesting that being sprung by Jim Middleton in the euphoria of election night should somehow be regarded as overturning a solemn policy provision which was spelt out in writing, taken right through the campaign and clearly understood, you are quite wrong. What an absolutely amazing statement to make! Mr Deputy Speaker, this motion is quite timely because, as you know, we all picked up the newspapers last Friday morning and read of more impending cuts to the ABC's funding. It is all right for backbenchers on the government side to come into this place and bleat about the impact of ABC funding cuts to regional and rural Australia so they can go back to their electorates and put out a little media release to prove to all and sundry in the electorate what wonderful things they have been saying in the parliament about the ABC in regional and rural Australia, but what they should be doing is coming in here and opposing those budget cuts. That would be the best way to ensure that rural and regional Australia maintains the level of service it currently enjoys. But at least they are prepared to come in here and do somethingunlike Minister MCGauran and the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) who issued media releases attacking the ABC for putting about unfounded fears as to where the ABC cuts were likely to fall as a result of these budgetarrangements ary measures. How disgraceful is that? They cut more than $200 million from the ABC budget over four years and then cry poor, saying what a terrible thing the ABC is doing when it suggests cuts to regional and rural programming. I would suggest that Minister MCGauran and the member for Wide Bay should come into this place and oppose these budgetary cuts. As I say, that would be the most effective way of ensuring that services in rural and regional Australia will be maintained.",66
120,Mr ANTHONY,APEC DEVELOPMENTS ON MARKET LIBERALISATION,"Richmond) (4.28 p.m.}-I rise to support the motion moved by the member for MCMillan (Mr Broadbent) on behalf of the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) on recommendations made in the Mansfield report on the role and functions of the ABCspecifically the role the ABC plays as an institution in regional and rural Australia. report also addresses the need to revise the ABC charter, to ensure that regional and rural interests are clearly spelled out in the charter rather than being incorporated within its corporate plan as is proposed. That is certainly what a number of senior executives within the ABC would like to do. As mentioned before, numerous reports have been made on the ABC, and these have been outlined by the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon). The last major report on the ABC was in 1983. I think it is timely that the Mansfield report has re-examined the efficiencies and direction of the ABC, bearing in mind the government's stated objectives which have partly driven the reduction in the budget allocation following the situation we inherited from the previous government. It is important that we all acknowledge that the ABC plays a critical role but, as with all financial institutions, there has had to be a spreading of the budget deficit load that has been passed on to us. The ABC is not a sacred cow but, by the same token, we have to show compassion, understanding and guidance, particularly in regional and rural areas of Australia, as to how the ABC will be placed. Some of the biggest challenges the ABC will face are not only in terms of its financial and the effect they will have on regional areas but also in terms of the rapid pace of technology and the absolute change that will have right across Australia, and particularly in more remote areas. At the end of last year, Brian Johns attended a National Party meeting and he talked about the ABC and two of its strengths, which are a bit of a paradox. He mentioned that one is the ABC's internationalisation. It had extremely good coverage of international events on both TV and radio. The other side of the coin was the ABC's unique ability to localise stories and issues. It is the only network that has infrastructure right across the country. We want to make sure that that local infrastructure is retained. The ABC, and particularly ABC radio, is a critical lifeline for communications, news, information and emergency services right The across Australia. The ABC's coverage is unmatched by other stations. It has over 600 television towers and satellites across Australia covering 100 per cent of the nation. It also has 49 regional radio studios including in Lismore and on the Gold Coast. It has over 300 transmitters in a second regional network and 44 additional transmitters for Triple J. It is interesting to note that the ABC rural department celebrated 50 years of broadcasting last year. ABC radio has over 6.3 million listeners and 25 per cent of that listening audience is in regional Australia. I know that my local stations, 2NR Lismore and Radio 91.7 on the Gold Coast, provide a valuable service to that region not just in the general and important areas of entertainment, culture, education and the arts but tide, weather, market, livestock and surfing reports. It is the communication lifeline to those remote communities. Before the Mansfield report, Brian Johns guaranteed that there would be an emphasis on local radio, which I encourage. I would not like to see regional radio become the poor cousin to metropolitan radio where there are a number of different stations and a huge number of resources. When you look at some areas in regional Australia, particularly areas in Queensland which is the most decentralised state, it is interesting to note that 15 years ago local programming amounted to 17 hours. Today it is down to six hours. Staffing levels have fallen by two-thirds over the last 15 years, which was during the period of the previous government. I think we need to draw the line somewhere-particularly in relation to those areas and communities which rely on this service. As far as the charter is concerned, I believe it is necessary for the ABC to have the interests of regional and rural Australia enshrined in the charter. There needs to be an adequate corporate plan to dovetail with the charter. I am glad to see that when the government establishes its $250 million communications fund-obviously part of that will come from the Telstra sale-there will be an interface between the fund and regional ABC services. (Time expired)",68
121,Ms MACKLIN,APEC DEVELOPMENTS ON MARKET LIBERALISATION,"Jagajaga) (4.33 p.m.)This motion would be commendable if it was part of a wider and more detailed motion in support of the ABC. As it stands, it is merely a smokescreen of concern to cover this government's unparalleled attempt to muzzle our national broadcaster. Of course the ABC charter should-and I quote from the motion: . . . emphasise the importance of providing services to regional Australia and the need for ABC services generally to reflect Australian regional and diversity. Anyone from regional Australia-and the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) represents the country town in regional Victoria where I grew up and went to school, so I do understand what he is talking about in this regardand anyone who has lived away from the major cities understands the fundamental importance of ABC radio and television to their way of life and their lifestyle. Frequently, the ABC is the only broadcaster they receive. Increasingly, it is the case that country radio and television is being networked from city stations and any local flavour is being lost. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, in Melbourne we are also being treated in this way. Like the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the ABC is now coming, in the main, from Sydney. The Prime Minister has moved out of the Lodge to Kirribilli and we in Melbourne are getting our evening radio out of Sydney all because of this government's cuts to the ABC. We have seen outstanding presenters from Melbourne lose their jobs and lose their local input because of this government's cuts and the move to Sydney. The ABC cannot discharge its charter if it is starved of the funding necessary to carry out its task. Let us remember what the government promised in its election manifesto. It said it would 'maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC'. This commitment was reaffirmed on election night by the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston. Yet even before the budget, the Minister for Communications and the Arts was announcing cuts of $10 million to $11 million for 1996-97 and $55 million for 1997-98-a total cut of $65 million. These cuts represent more than 10 per cent of the ABC's budget. Put another way, they represent one-third of the entire ABC radio budget or nearly 20 per cent of the TV budget. What makes it worse is that further cuts in the forthcoming May budget have not been ruled out. I put it to the member for Indi that, if he were truly concerned about the quality of ABC services to regional Australia, he would be putting the government on notice cultural not just to quarantine the ABC from cuts planned in the May budget but to make sure that funding was restored to the organisation to enable it to carry out its charter in terms of quality and access to services. If the member for Indi is not prepared to do that, then what he is going to see is the ABC and regional services sacrificed on the altar of this government's budget. What we are going to see is the loss of local radio programs, local sports coverage and maybe Radio Australia, Triple J and Classic FM. It certainly goes without saying that the loss of any of these services would greatly diminish the quality of service not just to regional Australia but to all Australians. These certainly will be the outcomes if the cuts to the ABC go through. It is also important that we remember that this government wants to attack the independence of the ABC. We must reiterate the absolute necessity to keep an independent ABC. It is in this minister's cabinet submission that we see the admission-this is a quote from a news report-that they seek to 'influence future ABC functions and activities more directly'. If we are going to have a serious discussion about the charter of the ABC, what we need to be making sure of is that the charter contains an absolute commitment to the independence of the ABC. For a healthy democracy we have to have a high quality media that can criticise without fear or favour. The ABC must not be threatened by this government. The way the government likes to see it is, 'Toe the line or you will be crucified.' That does not create an independent broadcaster. I support the motion as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough. (Time expired)",69
122,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,APEC DEVELOPMENTS ON MARKET LIBERALISATION,Mr Jenkins)Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Medicare Office Closures,70
123,Mr LEE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I wish to grieve for the imminent closure of 84 Medicare offices around Australia. I am standing today to raise this issue because of an exchange that took place in this chamber last Wednesday. Last Wednesday the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren) mentioned in passing some concerns he had about the Labor Party seeking to speak up for the continuation of the Medicare office in Lithgow, which is in the electorate of the honourable member. After I sought some information from the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) about whether the member had been given any assurances about the future of the Medicare office at Lithgow, Dr Wooldridge said that he would have to check. Surprisingly, after question time last Wednesday, the honourable member for Calare came into the House and made the following statement: I claim to have been misrepresented by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), who during the debate on the Private Health Insurance Bill in this place today suggested I had passed on assurances to my electorate from the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) that the Lithgow Medicare office will not be closed. The minister has given me no such assurance, nor have I publicly stated he has. I issued a press release after the budget saying the minister had assured me there is no hit list of Medicare agencies ... Immediately thereafter-I am sure it was no coincidence-the Minister for Health and Family Services sought the call and said in part: Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence very briefly on this matter. This arose from a debate just before question time. Subsequent to that the member for Calare has shown me the press releases that he has put out. I have examined the press releases and I can find nothing in them that is not absolutely honest. People who heard that exchange might suspect that I, the member for Dobell, had unfairly suggested that the member for Cal are had assured his electorate that his Medicare office would not close and that I had accused the member for Calare of saying something which he in fact never said. On the day after, I received a letter from the honourable member for Calare. I have to say at this point that I am grateful that the honourable member for Calare, apparently at the first opportunity, has sought to clarify the record. He even offered to me to come into the House and put this on the Hansard record. He did admit to me that in fact he had come across an earlier press release which he had put out which was not covered by the assurances which he gave earlier. I would like to quote from the earlier press release, which reported in the Lithgow Mercury on Saturday, 25 May 1996. Under the headline 'Medicare closure is just a rumour', the following quote is attributed to Mr Andren: The federal Minister for Health, Dr Michael Wooldridge, has assured me there are no plans to shut or relocate the Lithgow office. Under the headline 'Just word games' an article in the Lithgow Mercury on Tuesday, 13 August states: It appears the federal health minister has been deliberately deceptive over the fate of the Lithgow Medicare office, according to the member for Calare, Peter Andren. The article goes on to quote the member for Cal are as saying: When I sought assurances from the minister in March that the office and its staff were safe from closure, Dr Wooldridge's assistant, Dr Bob Woods, assured me that the government had no plans at present to close or relocate the office. Now it appears Lithgow will be one of 44 Medicare offices state-wide to get the chop, with another three jobs lost in a city that has been absolutely devastated government downsizing. When the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, said that he had seen all the press releases which the member for Calare had put out and said, 'I have examined the press releases and I can find nothing in them that is not absolutely honest,' I am not sure whether that included the press release from the member for Calare that is reported as saying, 'It appears that the federal health minister has been deliberately deceptive over the fate of the Lithgow Medicare office ... '. I would be surprised if the Minister for Health and Family Services would describe as 'absolutely honest' the claim that he had been deliberately deceptive, but you would never know. I can understand why the honourable member for Calare and other members of this House might be a bit confused about what the government is actually intending to do with Medicare offices. On budget night last year, one of the government's official documents, which was handed out with the budget papers, was a small pamphlet entitled 'Recognising older Australians'. On page 19 of that official budget paper it was stated that the government intended to close 84 Medicare offices around the country. In the Senate estimates hearings in October last year we were able to obtain a number from the government, in intense questioning of the Department of Health and Family Services. We had the government actually admitting what their timetable was for the closure of these Medicare offices around the country. The timetable, as announced in Senate estimates last year, was for 35 of the offices to be closed this financial year, coming to a cumulative total of 51 the following year. Further closures would come to a cumulative total of 68 by 1998-99. By 1999-2000, a total of 84 offices would be closed right around the country. The difficulty we have had has been that this financial year, with about four months to go, it was expected that 35 Medicare offices would close. Yet when the officers appeared before the additional estimates last week, statements were made by members of the by department of the Minister for Health and Family Services. This quote is from page CA57 of Wednesday, 26 February. Ms Wood from the Department of Health and Family Services said: I would expect to be closing branches around the end of the financial yearthat is, the first 35 Medicare officesbut whether it will be at the end of this financial year or in July, I am not sure. We have been seeking to find out what the criteria will be for choosing the lucky 35 Medicare offices which will be the first ones to close. We were told last October that, despite submissions to the minister, they had not yet been able to get a decision out of the minister as to what the criteria would be for picking the Medicare offices to close. Ms Wood as recently as last Wednesday stated: We will be looking at finalising the criteria for closing the branches once we have seen some of the success of the pilot. That is, the pharmacy pilot. More than six months after the budget was brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), we still cannot get any decision from the Minister for Health and Family Services as to what the criteria will be before these offices begin to close. I really do think it is very tardy. The killer quote is near the end of the questioning on this issue. Ms Wood was asked by Senator Neal: Could I rephrase the question and ask: how many Medicare offices do you anticipate closing by the end - f July? Ms Wood-I cannot answer that. I do not know at this point. We have come up with the offices that we wish to close . . . For six or seven months we have been trying to get from this minister and from this government the list of offices that they intend to close. We now have confirmation that in the Health Insurance Commission they have a list of offices that they wish to close, even though we do not have any criteria which the government intends to use to decide which ones will close. Our great concern in particular is that large numbers of the smaller Medicare offices in regional and provincial Australia will be the ones hardest hit by this decision to close these offices. I am sure my colleague the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) is very concerned about the impact that this is going to have in his own state of Queensland. The largest states such as Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia will be under enormous pressure as decisions are made as to which Medicare offices are closing. Mr Bevis-Especially in decentralised areas.",70
124,Mr LEE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I think Queensland is the most decentralised state of Australia, and it will probably be the state hardest hit by the number of closures per capita that will take place. For ordinary Australians who use their Medicare office, it is certainly going to make a difference. At the moment, the people who live in these towns go to their Medicare office and get cash in the hand, cash across the counter. If you have to post off your claim, people understand how long it takes to get the cheque back and wait for it to be cleared. If the government thinks that in some way these new faxes in pharmacies are the answer, the do-it-yourself Medicare office, it has another think coming. It will certainly get a reaction from Australians who live in the towns around the country that will lose their Medicare offices. It is also interesting to note that for some reason the member for Calare got an assurance, the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) got an assurance-and I am sure it was totally unconnected with the fact that she had a by-election due-and the member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) got an assurance, but Labor members of parliament cannot get any assurances from this minister or this government about how the closures of these 84 Medicare offices across the country are going to affect the people who live in their electorates. The Labor opposition will continue to raise this issue because we think it is wrong for the government to be removing this essential community service. (Time expired) Children: Abuse",72
125,Ms JEANES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Kingston) (4.49 p.m.)Today I rise to tell the House about one of the most serious issues that I have faced as a member of parliament involving some of the most distressing problems imaginable facing children. Many children will never recover from the abuse that they have experienced and their recovery is often made harder by the systems that governments impose on them. State governments across the country are gUilty of underfunding the agencies that are responsible for the welfare of children. The federal government is guilty of imposing an adversariallegal system on them that does not effectively recognise their rights and interests. The rights and interests of the children who appear before the court should be its first priority. It is the determination of those rights and interests and their priority in relation to the rights and interests of the adults that leads to the problems. It is my view that all governments are guilty of not doing enough to prevent the factors that lead to the abuse and neglect of children because they are not facing up to those factors. In my electorate we have some very dedicated people working with those who have experienced sexual abuse in their families. Organisations like SSAFE do some very challenging work with around 80 families in my electorate. But are these families who have come forward only the tip of the iceberg? No-one really knows. I also have some wonderful general practitioners who do their best not just to write out a prescription for the symptoms that people who have been abused suffer. They seek to get to the cause of the problem. Sadly, the causes may be embedded in the abuse that they received as children. In many cases, these organisations and the people they help are finding not just that it is the perpetrators of the abuse that will haunt the children's heads for many years to come, or indeed for the rest of their lives, but that the system must go through is still a major impediment to their opportunity to heal. I have seen a number of the families who have sought assistance from organisations in my electorate and their stories are very grave indeed. The problem is that the stories are often so horrendous that no-one believes them, and herein lies a major part of the problem. The system, whether it includes parliamentarians, judges, lawyers, police officers, school teachers, health professionals or welfare workers, often fails to hear the stories because sometimes they are just too hideous to be believed. After all, who wants to believe that a fouryear-old child could be anally raped by its father? Who wants to believe that a baby could be used in a bizarre ritual by a family member and the baby could suffer puncture marks to the skin in that ritual? Who wants to believe that a mother could go out to a hotel and leave her three children, all under five, with their uncle who she knows sexually molests them but accepts it because both she and her brother were sexually molested by their grandfather as children? No-one wants to believe such stories so it is easier to assume that the child made it up or perhaps that one parent made it up to prevent the other parent having access to their child. It is not difficult to imagine that sometimes this does occur but, in terms of the child's long-term future and mental health, surely the focus should be on what is the right thing for the child-what does the child really want? The longer we ignore the reality that very serious abuse happens and we do not become obsessed with exposing it and wiping out its causes, the longer the children will be forced to endure a nightmare existence that they may never recover from. I have one child in my electorate whose family is about to go to what they think is their 39th court appearance, and the child's voice is still to this day yet to be heard in the court. Who knows whether or not it will be and whether the outcome will ever enable the child to recover. At the end of each court appearance, the family picks itself up and goes home, then they have to prepare themthey selves mentally for the uncertainty that will prevail until the next appearance. But the lawyers who seek adjournment after adjournment and counselling session after counselling session write up their tabs and, in my area, it is likely that the Legal Services Commission is picking up the bill for its clients. We have the Legal Services Commission granting legal aid to adults whose children do not want to see them so that the adults can keep fighting to see them. Who is asking the children, and where is the accountability from the court officers for the public money they receive or for the money they take from their clients who have no choice but to pay? The people who may know the child best outside of the familythe doctors, the welfare workers, the teachers or the school counsellors-have no automatic standing in the court to put the child's truth forward. The presumption of the innocence of the alleged perpetrator wins out against any right that the child might have to be protected. Unless the alleged perpetrator is found guilty of any sort of abuse, they are likely to be granted access to the child and, if they are eligible, they are likely to be granted legal aid to do so. One family and community services worker told me that, in the 20 years he has been working in the business, only one lawyer whom he has dealt with has in his view actually properly informed him about the child's needs and desires before going into court to represent the child. This particular lawyer took it upon himself to interview all the people who were close to the child, including family members and health professionals who had known the child over the years. The lawyer was able to determine for himself a clear picture of what was good for the child based on his broad understanding of the child's history. Sadly, this is not the common case. It seems that the system is actually designed to let children down. Once their families get to the stage that they need to have their problems sorted out by the Family Court, the child has already been significantly damaged. The continued pursuit of the interests of adults through the court can lead to the child becoming even further damaged. In September last year, I put out a paper asking the question, 'Does Australia need a Commissioner for Children?' I circulated the paper widely through the various organisations around the country that represent children, and I am very pleased with the response that I received in support of the commissioner. It seems that every paper that has ever been written looking into the abuse and neglect of children has recommended that Australia needs a Commissioner for Children, yet we still do not have one. For a Commissioner for Children to be effective, they would need to be charged with the responsibility to investigate the reality Australia's children experience and, based upon that reality, make recommendations to governments about the measures necessary to address the problems with that reality. That reality involves some horrifying statistics. In the 1994-95 financial year, 76,954 cases of child abuse were reported in Australia; 30,615 of these cases were substantiated; and 11,973 were committed by a family member, 9,479 of whom were their parents. Something is going very wrong in this country when nearly 10,000 Australians are abusing their children each year. Who protects these children from their own families? The answer is that the state welfare agencies are supposed to, but clearly they are failing because the abuse still occurs. It is not good enough to say that we should protect a child from an abusive parent. What - mr goal should be is to address the factors that lead to the parent's abusive or neglectful behaviour. In many cases, the behaviour may be triggered by external factors such as the stress of poverty and unemployment. In other cases, the abusive behaviour may be learned from the parent's parents, and they have simply never had an effective parenting role model. The factors are very complex, but we must not run away from them because they are too hard. Whatever the causes, solutions must be found to the factors that lead to the abusive and neglectful behaviour. Some people become very concerned when the issue of children's rights is raised. There is a genuine concern in the community that the information necessarily given to school children about their rights should include some information about their responsibilities. This is a separate issue from the denial of basic rights suffered by too many of Australia's children. But who would deny children their right not to be physically, emotionally or sexually abused? Who would deny children their right to receive the best education available? Who would deny children their right to health care when they are sick? And who would deny that children have a right to live in a house with a roof over their heads with family members who care for them and who strive that to provide for their physical and emotional needs? So why is it that too many Australian children do not have a roof over their heads and do not have health care available to them to cure their illnesses? Sadly, our indigenous children are overrepresented in all these categories. Why is it that when the most important support mechanism for children breaks down-that is, when the child's family breaks down-the future of our most vulnerable children is placed in the hands of a court whose primary focus is not on them? I am not suggesting that, if we appoint a Commissioner for Children, we will wake up the next morning and everything will be just peachy with all of Australia's children. But there is no government organisation or position with the power to investigate the shortfalls in the system that is supposed to protect our children. The position of the Human Rights Commissioner was established under legislation passed by this parliament, and the rights that the commissioner upholds are described in schedules included in the act. It is fair to say that the civilised world has not come to an end because the schedules include international treaties to which Australia is a signatory. I suggest that Australia's children need someone with similar powers to uphold and protect their rights by revealing the problems within society and within the system that lead to the denial of their fundamental rights. National Party of Australia",72
126,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"This afternoon I grieve for the National Party of Australia. Black Jack MCEwen would be rolling in his grave at the way in which Tim Fischer, the Leader of the National Party of Australia and Deputy Prime Minister, and the National Party generally have rolled over to the Melbourne and Sydney lawyers in the current Howard coalition government. The Melbourne and Sydney lawyers are dominating this government to the great expense of rural and regional Australia and to the great expense of the outlying states, such as Western Australia, and the outlying areas, such as North and Far North Queensland. That this is certainly the case was first picked up as early as June last year when, in respect of proposals to cut Commonwealth programs which were of relevance to Australia generally and to companies operating in rural and regional Australia in particular, Mr Hendy Cowan-who is the senior National Party figure in Western Australia, the Leader of the National Party in Western Australia, the deputy premier of Western Australia and the state Minister for Commerce and Tradepublicly said: . . . that the Commonwealthreferring to the government of coursemight need to rethink some of the programs they have decided to axe. He was referring there to DIFF and EMDG. Mr Cowan went on to say: Australia is going to he the only developed country which will not have an equivalent of the DIFF program. So as early as June of last year Hendy Cowan was on to this. We saw in the budget the export market development grants program being gutted and slashed to the tune of $426 million over four years. I do not need to remind the House of the DIFF debacle, of the embarrassing way in which Australia's reputation was hurt overseas and of the way in which the domestic and international reputation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) was shredded. In addition to the EMDG decision in the budget, we saw the decision to remove funding for the department of regional development. We now have the minister for transport, Mr Sharp, conducting himself under the illusion of having a second portfolio, regional development. We heard public statements made at the time of the budget defending that decision to the effect that there was no constitutional role for the Commonwealth so far as regional development was concerned. Last week Hendy Cowan brought many of these threads together with a scathing attack on Mr Fischer-the Leader of the National Party and the Deputy Prime Minister-and with a scathing attack on the National Party at the federal level generally. He complained bitterly, publicly, that the National Party-and in particular Mr Fischer-had lost its direction, was moving away from bread and butter issues and had failed to support industry in regional Australia generally. It is worth reading parts of an interview on the ABC Radio AM program of 26 February into the record. The ABC presenter starts the program by stating: Hendy Cowan, Western Australia's Deputy Prime Minister, says the Federal National Party has lost direction and is becoming removed from its grass roots. But his anger doesn't stop there. He says the National Party is letting rural Australia down . COWAN: I think it's fair to say that very clearly the Federal National Party seems to me to have lost some sense of direction. It needs very much to get back to the real issues . . . INTERVIEWER: Why do you say the Federal National Party has lost direction? COWAN: For the simple reason that it seems to me that the basic and fundamental issues which are important to the National Party have been lost in the sense of making sure that the Coalition Government doesn't have any hiccups. What is that code for? That is code for the National Party-for the Leader of the National Party and the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer; for the deputy leader and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson; for Minister Sharp; for Minister MCGauran; and for other members of the National Party rolling over to the Sydney and Melbourne Liberal lawyers who dominate this government to the great expense of rural and regional Australia. Mr Cowan went on to refer to bread and butter issues for the National Party which are the issues that need to be addressed by the National Party. He was very critical of the subject matter of the National Party's conference which was held last weekend. He went on to say in the interview: COWAN: ... we have to take charge of the direction in which we're going and I see the National Party as being the main vehicle for that. INTERVIEWER: Are you happy at all with Tim Fischer's performance as Leader of the Party? COWAN: I'm not going to talk about that. That's a federal issue. I'm not a member of the federal Party. INTERVIEWER: Do you think he's doing an adequate job? COWAN: Again, I'm not prepared to comment on that. So twice in the space of that interview the senior National Party figure from the outlying state of Western Australia refuses to endorse the leadership attributes of the Deputy Prime Minister. I am sure that one National member of this parliament would have been entirely pleased to see those comments made, namely the right honourable member for New England, Mr Sinclair, who-it is an open secret-has been stalking the Leader of the National Party for a number of years. Ms Jeanes-You've been reading too many books.",75
127,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I certainly read l""LcEwen over the Christmas break and I found that very edifying. I strongly recommend that National Party members re-read that. They might actually learn something about standing up for rural and regional Australia and standing up for the growth states such as Western Australia and Queensland. Mr Cowan went on to make the following comment in the interview, which is not directed to members of the National Party but directed to federal members of parliament representing Western Australia. He said: COWAN: Well, as I said to you, I am very critical of the performance of both the Federal National Party and also the Federal Members of Parliament representing Western Australia. He made the point there are not any National members of the federal parliament from Western Australia. But Hendy Cowan's comment was a searing indictment of the failure of those Liberal Party members from Western Australia to stand up for Western Australia. It is reflected by the fact that not one minister from Western Australia is in the doing cabinet-whether it be the Attorney-General, Mr Williams; whether it be the Minister for Family Services, Mrs Moylan; or the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Prosser. Mr Bevis-You can understand that.",76
128,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"As the member for Brisbane interjects, that is entirely understandable. But coming from the great economic and population growth state of Western Australia, that is a searing indictment on the Liberal Party. Let me return to the National Party. I indicated to the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) that over the summer break I read Black Jack MCEwen's biography. Black Jack MCEwen, for all his faults, at least was a person who was prepared to stand up for what he believed in and was also a person who believed that it was possible to have two thoughts in one's head at the same time. I make this point because over the summer break-at precisely the same period-I saw an article in the Weekend Australian in which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, was saying that Australia needed to return to raw commodities as its export future. We saw in the Leader of the National Party and trade minister's trade outcomes and objectives statement, which he tabled in this parliament on 5 February; we saw in the government's own work; we saw in the trade minister's own work, the very clear analysis that the trend of international trade continues to be in favour of manufactures, in services and in value added goods. While it is vital-and I am sure that members on both sides of the House would subscribe to this view-that we continue to be a world competitive exporter in our rural commodities as we have traditionally been, we need to continue to make the shift to manufactures and services and value added goods. Black Jack MCEwen was of the view that it was possible to sustain a raw commodities output at the same time as sustaining a manufacturing output. Unfortunately, this is not a view which the minister for primary industries subscribes to. He would have us completely at the risk of the fluctuations in commodity prices. To conclude on the National Party, it is with some consternation that I hear the almost deafening silence of National Party members from New South Wales and Queensland on the current deliberations by the government so far as the sugar industry is concerned. I this question With the Deputy Prime Minister last week at question time and asked when the government· was proposing to announce its decision in respect of the sugar industry and the sugar tariff. We saw the following day-I clearly flushed them out-an article leaked to the Australian of Friday, 28 February headed, 'Sugar producers to get export aid for tariff reform'. The game is up so far as the sugar industry is concerned. The minister for primary industries is already talking in terms of industry adjustment rather than that which we have heard from the member for Dawson (Mrs DeAnne Kelly) and the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) in raising the substantial question. The cat is out of the bag. The horse has already bolted. The National Party stand condemned. (Time expired) Drug Use and Abuse",76
129,Mrs VALE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I wish to raise a very serious issue in the grievance debate which is of great concern to me and to many parents in my electorate of Hughes: that is, the use of drugs by our young people. I am also alarmed at the apparent failure of the present anti-drug use policy, harm reduction, and wish to outline to you a superior policy of drug prevention. Australia presently faces an enormous crisis in that our children and young people are growing up in a culture thinking that it is normal to use drugs. Because of present government policies on drug use, the bodies and minds of our young people are being damaged, the futures of some children are being limited and some children are even dying. The responsibility for these deaths and this damage lies with usthe people who create the laws and policies of our country, the people who have made drug use, especially illicit drug use, appear to be acceptable to the young people of our nation. I am informed that statistics from the old Department of Human Services and Health document the increasing rate of drug use amongst young Australians. Three years ago, raised that department published Drug Abuse in Australia, a document which clearly demonstrated the failure of existing anti-drug policies. Some of the findings of this document revealed that the proportion of secondary school students aged 12 to 16 years using cannabis at least weekly is increasing with every age group; that the percentage of year 11 students using marijuana increased from 30 per cent in 1989 to 43 per cent in 1992; that the proportion of students who have ever used cannabis, inhalants, hallucinogens and narcotics has increased since 1986; that 40 per cent of 14to 19-year-olds have tried marijuana; and that 54 per cent of males and 50 per cent of females aged between 14 and 19 years would accept an offer of marijuana. I speculate that these figures, collated in 1992 and now five years old, represent the tip of an iceberg. Existing policies, with the lack of sound prevention initiatives in the promotion of so called safe drug use, have clearly failed us on at least two counts: they have failed to reduce the demand for drugs and they have failed to reduce harmful use. The previous Labor government dismissed such sound drug prevention strategies. Instead, they pursued a policy that ultimately, as far as young Australians are concerned, has nonnalised the use of drugs. The idea adopted was that of harm reduction. This policy starts with the premise that our children will use drugs anyway; therefore, we should teach them how to use them safely. This does not impress the majority of parents. This, I believe, has increased drug use by our young people. It is now high time that we take stock of reality and change this policy for a positive focus policy that clearly targets drug prevention. Our young people are not being made aware of the health risks associated with drug use. They are also becoming increasingly confused by leaders who entertain hann reduction policies, such as the decriminalisation of cannabis or the proposed ACT heroin trials. Such actions would make hannful substances more readily available in our communi ties. This kind of debate is disempowering parents in their desperate attempt to guide their children successfully to adulthood while at the same time tacitly telling children that it is okay to use drugs. Just last week, the New South Wales Police Commissioner suggested that we might as well try cannabis decriminalisation. Well-regarded public figures must understand the confusion that such comments from one in such respected authority have on the mind of a child. It would be far better for the Police Commissioner to come out and say, 'Let's get tough on drugs.' He could count on me to back him to the hilt, together with many other parliamentarians and thousands of worried parents. Then at least our young people would see a strong cohesive community rejection against drug use. Young people will experiment. It is in the nature of the young to test and to try new experiences and to push their known boundaries. However, there is a well-established body of research which shows that, if young people think it is normal to use drugs, then increased drug use will follow. Conversely, as explained by Johnson et al in his research work Drug use among American high school seniors, college students and young adults, if children see the leaders in their community standing strongly against drug use, if they are educated in the risks to their health and if they perceive the social risks of drug use, then such use will decrease. There is no doubt-and many parents have complained of this to me-that there is an alanning insufficiency in the poor effort being made to infonn our children of the health risks associated with drug use, because the policy of hann reduction has been established as the cornerstone of anti-drug policy in this country. I point out that research showing the success of the hann reduction policy to reduce drug use is markedly absent. In fact, there are numerous studies demonstrating how harm reduction measures are becoming harm promotion, particularly with the young. In his paper Drug Reform: the Dutch experience, Richard Schwartz states: The Dutch policy has been associated with progressive increase in cannabis among 15-19 years old. Between 1984 and 1988, the use of cannabis increased by almost 100% amongst upper high school students in the Netherlands. Another paper by Dr Karel Frederik Gunning, entitled Dutch drug policy, concluded: ... the availability and sale of cannabis in Dutch coffee shops has been associated with an increase in its social acceptability and use amongst adolescents as a soft drug. Our children deserve better than this. Our children have a right - o the best protection and guidance we, their parliamentarians, police commissioners and parents alike can give them. They have a right to a superior drug policy. And I mean a policy which does not accept drug use as nonnal, a policy that will not give up on our children. Let us get tough on drugs. Let us deliver a smart anti-drug policy, a positive anti-drug policy which is sustained by hope, affinnation and community leadership. I propose that we form a new drug policy infonned by the astute research on drug prevention and drug demand reduction that is already available. Prevention is action that leads to planned change that improves life for all communities. Firstly, we must maintain our efforts to reduce the supply of drugs and we definitely should not make drugs more widely available through decriminalisation and similar soft attitudes which send confusing messages to our young people. Secondly, we need strategies to target 100 per cent of institutions in which drug use or the promotion of drug use occurs. This includes families, schools, local communities, the mass media, the legislature, the police, the court system, treatment centres, government departments and anywhere else. Thirdly, we must foster and promote campaigns of information and prevention which bear not only on the legal aspects of drug abuse but also on the very real health risks. If we seriously want to change the level of drug usage in Australia, we need to think about the process of how individuals, families, communities and cultures change behaviour. Perhaps the best most recent example is the change in attitude to cigarette smoking. Many countries have been aware of the health problems associated with cigarettes since as early as the 1960s. It is now socially unac-ble to. smoke in many places. Over the Jast;2S; )lears, the entire population has been tloode4 with researched information on the 'be-'qsb of smoking. The result of this ptoIonged effort has been the present social disapproval of smoking and a reduction in tobacco use. Drink driving is another good example of a positive and focused campaign. We know that determined drug prevention strategies work. There are countries in the world which have been extremely successful with their prevention policies. Sweden in the 1960s had a very liberal drug policy. The Swedes gave out drugs, including opiates and amphetamines, similar to the heroin trial proposed for the ACT. This resulted in a sharp increase in drug abuse in Sweden, including the use of cannabis by young children. It has taken Sweden almost 20 years to reverse that trend. Now, with the adoption of a restrictive policy and intelligent prevention strategies, Sweden has one of the lowest drug use rates in the world. I fear that the proposed heroin trial in the ACT will undermine our present inadequate prevention efforts and send the wrong message to young people. Research on the success of such a trial is markedly absent. Research in Great Britain states that the success of heroin prescription is unproven. The experiment with legal heroin in Switzerland has some major problems. I refer to the critique of only last year by Dr Ernst Aeschback on the scientific value of research studies accompanying heroin distribution. The more pressing question is why are there moves to further normalise damage to our young people. Why are we not seeking solutions rather than supporting dangerous harm reduction measures? Drugs cause enormous harm to the mind, body and spirit of our young people. If we do not reverse the present trend towards so-called responsible drug use and put in place and practise a determined prevention strategy, irreparable misery, ill health and even death will continue to threaten the happiness and fulfilment of the children of Australia. The harm reduction experiment has been running for over a decade, and the results have shown it to be a miserable failure. Despite the alarming lack of up-to-date prevalence research figures, there is endless anecdotal evidence from those who work in the field that drug abuse is increasing in our young population. If we are to have the real tools to help us combat this growing problem as a nation, it is vital that prevalence studies of drug use amongst young Australians be conducted in every state on an annual basis. Other countries have had success in reducing drug use. These reductions have been achieved by research based prevention, parental empowerment plus clear and courageous leadership for our young on the health risks associated with these destructive substances. The well-being, health and happiness of our children and young people is presently under enormous threat due to this ill-conceived unproven experiment called harm reduction. (Time expired) Dementia Counselling",77
130,Mr ANDREN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I would like to draw the government's attention to the problems emerging for rural Australia from the changes in federal funding for aged care, both in the nursing home sector and in delivery of dementia care. The five-year national plan for dementia care is due to end on 30 June. This effectively means the end of the plan that has been hailed by the New South Wales Alzheimers Association and other aged care services as perhaps the most successful program yet devised to support dementing illness sufferers and their carers to remain in their own homes. In its own review of the five-year plan released in July last year, the reference group stated that 'the balance of aged care has shifted from nursing home care towards support for people living in their own homes or in hostels.' Despite this, the rural areas of New South Wales stand to lose five counsellors from the dementia counselling service as the department of family services heads down a path of main streaming these services through the over taxed and under resourced home and community care structure. The New South Wales Information and Counselling Service, which employs two counsellors in my region-in Orange and Dubbo-is the only dementia-specific counselling service in the state. It has been fully funded by the Commonwealth under the national action plan for dementia care at a cost of $533,000. The service is delivered in Dubbo and Orange under the co-ordination of the Alzheimers Association and the New South Wales Health Department aged care assessment teams. The mid-plan report on the action plan states: there appear to be significant advantages to the colocation of counsellors with Aged Care assessment teams. The message I am getting from the aged care experts in my electorate is that it is essential to maintain the counselling service as it stands. Mainstreaming it through home and community care staff or transferring counselling responsibilities to nursing home staff will not work. I held a meeting with dementia carers in my electorate in Orange the week before last. These are mostly elderly partners of Alzheimer's or dementia sufferers who are prepared to sacrifice their time for the care of someone they love. All they ask is a continuation of the help line and the face-to-face service that a person like counsellor Mamie Mason has been providing to her clients in the central west. Defunding of the New South Wales Information and Counselling Service would mean the end to a 24-hour help line, no face-to-face counselling and an end to the free family therapy sessions for people with dementia and their carers-who are in crisis, especially at the time of diagnosis. From January to October last year, the service responded to 4,300 help line calls and 2,300 counselling sessions state wide. One lady told me she would have suffered a breakdown without the calm and supportive help of the counsellor, who has a specific understanding of each client. The concept of main streaming these services may be a possibility in the city, where there may be more extensive resources, but that is not the case in regional and rural New South Wales. The Orange aged care services, including representatives of the aged care assessment team, Orange City Council ageing and disabilities services and the local nursing home industry, all tell me that the national action plan for dementia has met significant gaps in service provision. They feel strongly it should be maintained indefinitely as part of ongoing aged care strategy. We have heard so much about the $8 billion black hole, later $11 billion, now supplemented by $3 billion which we missed in tax receipts, and another $1 Y2 billion because Treasury got its sums wrong. All of this arithmetic gymnastics for what? As Bob Ellis so eloquently says, for what has this expenditure pain on the aged been imposed? In his words, 'To impress four sadomonetarists in Moody's with our economic correctness'. It may come as a surprise to Treasury that carers in our community save this country not $1, $2, $3 or $5 billion but $8 billion a year. Yet we dismantle this valuable counselling service and substitute a less than satisfactory alternative arrangement through the home and community care structure whose services help carers with housework such as house cleaning, washing, ironing, shopping, transport, bathing, toileting, dressing, feeding and personal grooming-all very important, but in no way providing the very professional and targeted counselling that the dementia counselling service has delivered through these five rural officers. There are aspects of the government's aged care bill exposure draft which I would also like to draw to the attention of the House. I did not receive a copy of the draft until the week before last. I could have sought a copy earlier had I known of its existence, but I chased it up in response to concerns from these aged care services in my electorate that had not seen a copy. The problem is, they were supposed to have made their comments on the draft by Friday, 21 February-the day after I received my copy. As far as I know, my copy is the only copy west of the sandstone curtain, the Blue Mountains. I notice the minister's office told a local paper that peak groups in aged care had had copies for some time and they should have transmitted the information down to their colleagues in the aged care industry. But the Orange district aged care assessment team, the Calare Nursing Home, the dementia counsellors, none of these had seen the draft bill and there .- concerps about inclusions within that bUr .w-ic,- ,they want to highlight. Such concems relate to the accommodation bonds scheme. They' wonder about clients who may have the financial resources to pay an entry contribution, but may decline placement now that the bond is a requirement for entry. The aged care providers also want to know what assurances are contained in the draft bill if entry contributions will indeed be used by residential facilities for capital improvement, and they want to know whether consideration has been given to the provision of suitable residential care for people with disabilities who are not aged. I have spoken in this place in support of thrust of the accommodation bonds proposal, particularly as it may very well maintain the viability of nursing homes in smaller communities and to enable older people to contribute to infrastructure within their own community and so stay close to relatives. But I cannot support the consultation process because it has not occurred at a grass roots level. This legislation is due to be introduced later this month, I understand. Some other concerns expressed to me about the aged care bill from my electorate are fears that a two-tier system will develop, despite the checks and balances and accreditation requirements built into the act. It is also vital that the monitoring of access is very tightly controlled, so that the high entry contributor with low care requirements is not favoured over the low, or no entry client with high dependency. This is particularly concerning in Alzheimer's or dementia care patients. The recommendation of the aged care assessment teams should be paramount, but these teams need the assistance too of the very dementia counsellors who will be taken away from the Central West under this mainstreaming, which I see as downgrading. In closing, I want to refer to the comments of the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) earlier in this debate about Lithgow Medicare. I want to clarify a statement. I made to the House last week on another health issue when I said I had received no assurance from the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) that the Lithgow Medicare office would not be closing. The member for Dobell said that I had publicly repeated an assurance to this effect. A check of my records does reveal that I told the Lithgow Mercury last May that an assurance had been made to this effect by a ministerial staff member, later supported by a letter from the then parliamentary secretary, Senator Dr Bob Woods. I let the minister and the member for Dobell know about that late last week and I checked out the circumstances over the weekend. However, I accepted at the time that the assurance related to the pre-budget concerns in the community that a closure of that office was imminent. I accept the minister's assurance now that current pharmacy trials of the Medicare will be restricted to non-Medicare agency towns and that any consideration of agency closures in larger centres will involve full and public consultation. I remain opposed to any closure of the Lithgow Medicare office. I apologise to the member for Dobell or, indeed, the minister if I have, inadvertently, misrepresented their positions on this matter. Culunga Community School Aboriginal Corporation",79
131,Mr RANDALL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Swan) (5.28 p.m.}-I wish to bring to the attention of this House a matter of grave concern. This matter involves deception, alleged fraud and a complete lack of professional conduct. I refer to the Culunga Community School Aboriginal Corporation located at Harrow Street in West Swan in Western Australia.Before any of those oppose decide to shout 'racist' as a response, I would like to point out that I have been made aware of this situation by concerned Aboriginal members of our community and Aboriginals associated with this school. This matter has received some media coverage in the past. However, the problem has note been addressed; in fact, it is worse than ever. As a background, Culunga as a school was run by the Catholic Education Authority in Western Australia until 1993. It was then vested as an Aboriginal association, pursuant to the Aboriginal Council and Associations Act 1976, As Amended. One of its many objectives-objective (c)-is: to support education, job training, health services, work and housing for its members. Another objective-objective (h)-is: to receive and spend grants of money from both the Commonwealth and state governments as well as from other sources. There are other objectives. However, I am informed that the two which I have cited are not being met in a judicious manner. At the outset, this school was to be supportendeavouring ed by a democratically elected board selected from the wider community who would have as their primary interest the desire to serve interests of the Culunga community school. Time does not permit me to give a detailed account, but there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that highly respected members of the community in Western Australia, in particular Aboriginal community members, were, for want of a better word, run off and the members and friends of one particular family were elected to this board. In fact, in a letter dated 20 April 1996, the school principal wrote to Naruredine Bouhafs, the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations, in Canberra, saying, in part: It is my concern that the running of the AGM was unfair and undemocratic as the AGM was conducted in the following manner ... She cites 10 points of concern. I might just refer to a couple of these points. There was some confusion as to who was chairing the AGM, and both the chairperson-it mentions a name-and a board solicitor alternated in chairing the meeting; the parents, caregivers and community members were informed that they had no voting rights although they were requested by the board, 10 days prior to the meeting, to nominate themselves to any of the positions; approximately 80 parents, caregivers and community members attended the meeting but their concerns were completely ignored, which led to feelings of frustration and anger; both the annual report and the financial report were not addressed; the agenda was not followed; and the new constitution, which solicitors and the board drafted, was not even addressed. I could go on; it is quite an extensive letter. She continues: Once again, I urge you to do your utmost in addressing and rectifying the present situation. It was signed by the Principal of Culunga Community School. Other letters were sent to Mr Bouhafs, pleading for his help and intervention. Added to the maladministration and serious allegations which caused this school to become further dysfunctional was one particularly alarming incident. This incident refers to a previous chairperson of the school board to have herself installed as the deputy principal of this school. The other members of the board, being her family and the friends, agreed to this-even though they knew that she was in no way academically or otherwise qualified for the position. In other words, she just wanted to be the deputy principal without any legitimate reason for being so. Unlike the board positions, the deputy principal's position is a paid position. Thankfully, after media attention and local complaints, the Western Australian Office of Non-government Education in its capacity disallowed the appointment-and, I might add, received a stinging letter in reply from the person concerned. After this and other matters were raised in the West Australian and the local community newspapers, some action was finally taken to scrutinise this school. The Western Australian Office of Nongovernment Education sent a superintendent to inspect the school and assess the quality of education on offer given the well documented problems that the school was having. To say the least, extracts of this report, which I have had read to me, were most critical and damning. In fact, the report reinforced all the complaints and criticisms that were made regarding this school. The Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations, in concert with others, appointed an administrator to Culunga in 1996 with a view to addressing the now much publicised problems with Culunga. The administrator proved no more than a rubber stamp for the board that she replaced. It is little wonder because, I am informed, she is a very close relative of one or more of the board members. Given the previous nepotism of the school board and the family network associated with the school, one. must question the objectivity behind the appointment of this particular administrator. .. ""Towards tlle end of 1996, the administrator . presi4ed QVel"" the election of a new board to replace her in 1997. And, guess what? The previous board of family and close friends and relatives was re-elected. In other words, the good old family board had been re-elected. The net gain-almost nothing-was to legitimise the previous set of circumstances. Eventually, after much scrutiny, on 3 July 1996 the federal Attorney-General's Department, under the heading of the Australian Government Solicitor, conducted an audit relating to some of the concerns. I have a copy of the Solicitor-General's report here and it is highly damning. It sets out, in no uncertain terms, a money trail. There is a sample of 219 payments, many of which could not be supported with appropriate documentation. These include, for example: 31 July 1994, $708; 25 November 1994, $2,900; 27 December 1994, $5,606.50. There is a whole list, which I will refer to later. It is quite damning about where the money has gone and how the school has been run. I am surprised that the matter has not received more attention so far. Other items raised in the Attorney-General's audit of this school, under the support of the Australian Government Solicitor, include: the board members not being able to substantiate membership of the corporation; on 11 June 1996, the school staff going on strike-on 11 June 1996, a majority of staff decided to go on sick leave as a protest; and alleged intimidation of staff and former staff over a long period. In fact, people have informed me that they have been threatened with their lives, they have had their telephones cut, they have been followed home and they have been physically assaulted. An item from the Solicitor-General's report states that police had to be called to the school over several violent acts toward students and staff, and there was a petition by parents concerning the school and a petition by many community members. There is a raft of other allegations, which I am happy to provide at the end of my contribution. The Solicitor-General refers to the fact that an argument may exist as to whether the corporation is acting outside of its objectives. Given that the Western Australian Office of Non-government Education sees fit to revisit the Culunga Community School as a matter of priority-they are sending a superintendent out again; given the unanswered matters highlighted in the Australian Government Solicitor's report of 3 July 1996; given the information that approximately 130 children are on the school census and there is an average daily attendance of only 45 and there is information, which I can provide, that the school attendance records are being manipulated-you will understand what I mean by the term 'ghosting', I hope, as there is a Commonwealth payment which goes towards the number of children on the roll and, as I have said, these are ghosted; given that the teachers have been improperly dealt with both professionally and in terms of their employment contracts; given that there is mounting evidence to suggest that the quality of education has been severely diminished; given that the Aboriginal program in this school is almost non-existent and has not even been implemented and that there are schools in the neighbourhood with very good Aboriginal programs; given that there are large amounts of money in the form of cheques being cashed without supporting or appropriate documentation; and given that actions have been undertaken for blatant and undeclared pecuniary interest-for these and numerous other reasons such as the availability of statutory declarations to this effect-I call on the federal minister responsible to set up an independent and responsible inquiry. (Time expired) Senate Vacancy",81
132,Mr BEVIS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I wish to draw the House's attention to an issue which I regard as an important constitutional and democratic principle. I refer to the threat by the Queensland National Party Premier Borbidge in the last couple of days to defy the constitution and to appoint a non-Labor person should Senator Colston be forced to resign or should there be for some other reason a casual vacancy arising from Senator Colston's departure from the Senate. It was characterised in today's front page the Australian by a banner headline saying, ' Borbidge Threat To Defy Rule on Colston'. The Courier-Mail front page headline said, 'Borbidge Ignites Colston Legal Row'. This is not just a legal row. This is not simply a rule, nor is it an important convention as it was in 1975 when a former Queensland National Party government disgraced itself and others in ignoring the conventions; it is in fact the constitution of Australia that we are talking about. There can be no more important document in the land. Sadly, what we see from the comments of the National Party Premier in the last couple of days is more evidence that the white shoe spivs of the Queensland National Party are alive and well and still hold sway. They are the same people who ignore the conventions and the rules in the constitution when it suits them. They subscribe to the view: 'If you've got the numbers, you don't worry about the rules. ' They are the same people who have tried to nobble the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland and the same people who tried to nobble an inquiry into the shady deal that was done between the National Party and the police union prior to the Mundingburra by-election. But they cannot be allowed to attack the Australian constitution, particularly one area of the constitution which has been determined so recently in historical terms by the people of Australia. I think it is important to put on the record the exact reference from the constitution. It says: Where a vacancy has at any time occurred in the place of a senator chosen by the people of a State and, at the time when he was so chosen, he was publicly recognized by a particular political party as being an endorsed candidate of that party and publicly represented himself to be such a candidate, a person chosen or appointed under this section in consequence of that vacancy, or in consequence of the vacancy and a subsequent vacancy or vacancies, shall, unless there is no member of that party available to be chosen or appointed, be a member of that party. The wording of the constitution and the amendment adopted by the people by referendum in 1977 made it clear that it was a senator chosen by the people at the time in which he was chosen to be member of a of political party. For the National Party spivs to hop up now and publicly claim that they have some legal advice that allows them to try to subvert that process is an affront to the people of Australia. Of course a lot of the debate and the amendments to the constitution that I just referred to came from the events of 1975, and Senator Colston had something of a role in the drama of 1975. In 1977 when the constitutional amendments were so strongly passed-and that question was passed in every state of Australia, by the way, and in the state of Queensland it was passed with a majority of greater than 58 per cent-Senator Colston was moved to support the referendum-not surprisingly, given his role in the 1975 issues. He put out a press release on Tuesday 17 May in 1977 in which he said: Queensland Labor Senator Mal Colston has challenged the Premier of Queensland, Mr BjelkePetersen, to a public debate on the casual vacancies referendum. And that would have been a clash of the intellectual giants, no doubt. The press release went on: ... Colston strongly advocates a ""Yes"" vote for the casual vacancy proposals and the other three referendum questions. Elsewhere he said: It is imperative that the composition of the Senate as determined by the voters is not upset by arbitrary underhand methods such as Mr BjelkePetersen used in 1975. Of course, Senator Colston was dead right when he said that in 1977. He was quite right to point that out. This was not something that the Labor Party was the sole voice on. I happily acknowledge that there are a number of people in the Liberal Party who in 1975 and again in 1977 took what I regard as the proper, principled, democratic position in that debate. In fact, when Mal Colston lost the opportunity to go into the Senate in 1975 the newspapers of the day reported it in the following terms: The official ALP. candidate, Dr Mal Colston, lost 53 to 26 although every Liberal Cabinet minister present at the debate voted with the ALP., including the Liberal leader and Deputy Premier, Sir Gordon Chalk. The' Liberal Party in 1975 understood those principles and, quite rightly, was critical of thespivs in the National Party for their antics inl-75. It is a sad reflection that in 1997,20 years down the track, we have the same spivs in the National Party trying to pull the same stunts. Sadly, we have not had the same strength of commitment from the Liberal Party. I do want to refer to one other comment from the Liberal Party of the day because it comes from a gentleman whom I respect. In 1975 during what was very much the heat of the issue, the shadow defence spokesman, the then Mr D.J. Killen, made a number of comments about it. The Sydney Morning Herald report said: He disagreed with State Parliaments filling casual vacancies ""without proper regard to the character of political associations."" The article went on: ""I am dead against it, and 1 do not intend to change,"" he said. ""It is one of the most significant de facto alterations ever to the Australian Constituconstitutional tion."" Jim Killen was right when he said that, and it is about time we saw from the Liberals of the 1997 era the same sort of commitment to-and conviction about-these basic principles. Today in question time the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was asked a question about these matters and he gave an answer that I thought was so tepid. He said-what else could he say?-referring to the vacancies: ... those should be filled in accordance with both the letter and the spirit of the constitution as amended by referendum of the Australian people in 1977. Of course they should! And, as the Prime Minister and head of government of this nation, what is it that he has done or intends to do about it? There has only been one occasion since 1977 where this principle has been tested, and that was in 1987. These things seem to come in cycles of a decade. In 1987, when then Senator Don Grimes retired, the Tasmanian conservative government decided they would play games with his replacement. The Tasmanian Premier of the day, Mr Gray, declined to accept the recommendation or the nominee of the Labor Party to fill that vacancy, even though the constitution clearly required it. The ALP's nominee at that time was Mr Devereux. On that occasion Mr Howard had a little more intestinal fortitude to deal with the circumstance confronting him because on that occasion, in 1987, the Advocate newspaper records Mr Howard in these terms: Liberal leader John Howard yesterday delivered a mammoth blow to Premier Robin Gray's attempts to reject ALP nominee John Devereux as Tasmania's next senator by telling Mr Gray to back down. That is what he said to Robin Gray in 1987 when Robin Gray tried to pull the same stunt. But here we are 10 years after this, when he is the Prime Minister of the country, and the best he can do is come in here at question time with a tepid answer. But that is better than we got yesterday because yesterday, if you have a look at the AAP wire as at last night, on this issue the AAP wire recorded: Mr Howard's office would not comment on the issues raised by Mr Borbidge. Last night he could not move himself to make any comment at all. At least in 1987 he had the decency to get on the phone and ring up Robin Gray and say, 'You cannot do this, it is not on.' In 1997 he should do the same thing. As the Prime Minister of Australia, he should be on the phone to the spi vs in the National Party in Queensland and he should be making it plain to them that the constitution is not a toy for them. They can play games in their backroom-in the bunker at Spring Hill or wherever their new party office is going to be-they can play those games the way the former National Party Premier, Bjelke-Petersen, used to do in their own backyard if they must, but they are not going to play games with the Australian constitution. It is time that the Prime Minister made that plain. He should do it immediately and he should do it publicly. The Queensland National Party Premier deserves to be rebuked by the head of the government of this country for calling into doubt the constitution of Australia and for threatening a very clear expression of the will of the Australian people passed in every state of the country only 20 years ago.",84
133,Mr MAREK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Capricornia) (5.48 p.m.)This grievance debate has come at a most opportune time for me, as in my electorate of Capricomia in central Queensland we have an ever-increasing problem with the lack of aged care facilities. We have a need, not a want. It has become a point of desperation for the public health facilities, community aided nursing care groups, families or carers and, of course, the aged people themselves. It is less expensive for the taxpayers to caie for the elderly in dedicated nursing homes than have them tie up beds in the hospital system, which is the present case. The situation has been like this for years, and I intend over the following months to provide sufficient evidence to prove my case for the need for nursing care. The statement by the bureaucracy that we have more than enough beds is misleading and nothing but a furphy. To this end I wish to announce that I will be employing a research officer in my electorate of Capricomia. It should be noted, of course, that some of the cost of the submission will be at my own expense. With this in mind, although we may feel passionately about a particular issue, I firmly believe and reinforce that we are not in this parliament for our own benefit but to serve our employers, the people in our electorates--or, more to the point for me, the people of Capricomia. The research officer's responsibilities will be to prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that Capricomia is lacking the bed numbers and facilities required to give a responsible standard of care. To ensure the result is not biased and has no holes in it, the officer will be an individual of sufficient ability to handle the task set and be 100 per cent au fait with the position which the electorate is currently in and will have the ability to get past the bureaucratic brick walls presently erected throughout this country. In other words, the officer and their completed submission will have the teeth to do the required job. . This untenable situation facing us today is only getting worse, on the ground I can prove that the more mature electors of Australia are moving north in their later years of life, Aged Care particularly those not from Queensland. One of the major reasons for this, of course, is that in Queensland we do not have a death duty like in some other states. I believe that the care of the aged is paramount, because they have paid their dues to society and, fair's fair, it is time we gave them back so much of what they deserve, and that is our care in their later years of life. I must say it is not much to ask, particularly after what they have done for us. On top of this, it will create jobs for the people in Capricornia. At this point it is imperative that I give some examples of what we are currently experiencing in Capricornia. For example, a situation was brought to my attention which highlights the need for additional bed spaces. A married couple aged 94 and 92 were living in a retirement village in Yeppoon. They have no family close to them. In fact, their closest relatives are nieces and nephews who live in mining towns in central Queensland. The wife became very ill and was transferred to St Andrew's Private Hospital in Rockhampton. She remained there for 30 days, only to be moved when the bed was required. Yeppoon Base Hospital initially did not have a bed for her as they were already beyond their normal capacity to care for the aged. Because patients had nowhere to go at that particular time, all it did was cause overstrainof ing because of bed capacity, and, like I said, they lacked nursing care. Eventually, a placement was found in a nursing home in Longreach. This was not suitable as it would mean that she would have to leave her husband for good. Because of their separation, and because of their age, they would not have the ability to visit each other. To cut a long story short, they had to find somewhere to go to be together. In the end, a nursing home was found in Cairns--quite a long way from Yeppoon, I must remind everybody. But, at that point, they had nowhere else to go. So at least they have somewhere at this particular stage. I would also like to bring to the attention of the House an article that appeared in the Central Queensland News on Wednesday, 12 February. It was the story of a man, Mr Clive Callaghan, who was tom from his family and frAeqds to be placed in a home more than 400 kilQJ,netrcs..away from those he loved and cbeashed so much, only to die three weeks later. He was a broken-hearted man, all because a bed was not available in his town of Emerald. Increasing pressure being applied on nursing home providers indicates that the current level of licences is inadequate. Pressure is coming from three directions. Firstly, there is pressure from people who have been assessed as requiring nursing home care but who are forced to remain in the community. Secondly, there is the pressure from people in hospital wards requiring care but who cannot be placed. Thirdly, there are a growing number of residents in hostels who require nursing home care but who also cannot be placed. In the year 2001 it is anticipated there will be some 429,000 Queenslanders aged 65 and over and 44,800 aged 85 and over. For Rockhampton and the central highlands, the aged care places based on the national service provision benchmark are considered comparatively high. I am told that this national benchmark is not an indication of need but, within available resources, sets the level of funding provided in anyone locality. On this basis, we are told that the provision additional places in the region would not be considered a high priority. How can this be when we have waiting lists in the hospitals and nursing homes? At present, in Rockhampton and Central Queensland, nursing homes are full, with lengthy waiting lists. The position with hostels is little better. This is now impacting on community support services in a number of ways. I commend the government on its reforms to aged care which will address the concerns in the future. However, we have a crisis now. Recently in Rockhampton the state government, with federal funding, announced the redevelopment of the Eventide Nursing Home to the tune of $9.5 million. The Eventide Nursing Home is a 130-bed facility. The new redevelopment is an 80-bed facility. Rockhampton has just lost 50 beds to the system. In other words, instead of reducing the problem, it has created problems. I commit to the minister that, with the submission we will provide in the coming months, we can prove to the people in this parliament that aged care needs to be addressed in Capricornia.",86
134,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Hollis)Order! I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. AUDITOR-GENERAL BILL 1996 Cognate bills: NA ACCOUNTABILITY BILL 1996 NA AND COMPANIES BILL 1996 AUDIT (TRANSITIONAL AND MISCELLANEOUS) AMENDMENT BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 December, on motion by Mr Fahey: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr GARETH EV ANS (Holt-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (5.57 p.m.)-Just as the world has changed quite massively over the course of this century since the Audit Act was initially passed in 1901, so too have the needs concerning financial management, accountability and auditing in the Commonwealth sector. What this legislation seeks to do is to modernise, streamline and improve the existing financial management framework. It represents quite a substantial milestone in the financial management of the Commonwealth and it is legislation which is supported by the opposition. Apart from its intrinsic merits, the package of bills is supported, I have to say, because it was an initiative of the former Labor government. I have to say, with all due churlishness, that it is no credit to this government that it delayed the passage of these bills during the last parliament and has waited more than a year since being elected to have them now debated in this House. A number of members would be aware of the rather tortuous history of this legislative package, but I think I should, at least briefly, put on record the origins of these bills. It really goes back to 1988 and 1989 when the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, in its report No. 296 entitled The Auditor-General: ally of the people and parliament, suggested a major reform of the Audit Act. The Labor government responded to that report in November 1989, accepting this basic recommendation. The complex policy development and drafting process was completed and legislation was finally introduced into the Housenot quickly, I have to acknowledge-in 1994. It was then considered in detail by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which issued its advisory report No. 331 in September of that year. Unfortunately, it was not possible to get agreement in the parliament on the final design of the package because of some, I have to say, opportunistic behaviour by the then opposition in the Senate. As a result, the legislation lapsed when the parliament was prorogued before the last election. It is to opportunistic behaviour that my second reading amendment, which I will move at the conclusion of this, is directed. The new Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) wrote to the new chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), on 12 August 1996 requesting that the JCPA consider how the functional independence of the Auditor-General could be improved in the context of the government finalising the details of this package of legislation. That resulted in its report No. 346 of October last year and the introduction of these bills following that, on 12 December last. It is not surprising, now that we look at the terms of this legislation, but it is a little bit disappointing, for those of us who appreciate a degree of consistency when we see it, that the current government has changed many of the positions that it rigorously argued when our legislation was being debated during the last parliament. I say disappointing not from the point of view of outcomes, because we think the outcomes are far better to be couched in the way they are now, but it is always a bit interesting to see the wisdom of views that were hotly contested at the time now being accepted once the transition to government has been made. It would have been nice to have had some acknowledgment of the change of heart and the reasons for it, which we have not seen. I will come back to some of this later. In terms of what this legislation is all about, there are two basic differing categories of entity within the Commonwealth sector. Either a body has the legal capacity in its own right to acquire ownership of assets, including money, or it may function only as a financial and custodial agent for the legal entity of the Commonwealth as a whole. Which category a body falls into is dependent upon the kind of legislation or other process which establishes it. Two of the four bills in this legislative package consolidate the regulatory, accounting, accountability framework of these two basic categories into separate bills. The Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill applies to those entities in the first this category I mentioned-namely, those bodies with a capacity in their own right to acquire ownership of assets-while the Financial Management and Accountability Bill applies to the second category, where bodies function only as agents of the Commonwealth. These two bills will certainly provide a modern and appropriate framework which specifies the responsibilities and powers necessary for the efficient, effective and ethical use of the resources available to the Commonwealth. So far as financial management and accountability is concerned, this maintains the central role of the finance minister in the functioning of the so-called constitutional Treasury of the Commonwealth. The minister retains the sole power to agree appropriate banking arrangements for public money and its investment. The current legislation is silent on the issue of management performance. The new FMA legislation seeks to place responsibilities, however, specifically on chief executives of agencies. The CEOs are to be required to manage their ageucies efficiently, effectively and ethi<:;aIly. They will be required to implement ftaad:oontrol plans and to establish audit eOlnmittas. The· Minister for Finance will aIso--be: able to request financial information more regularly than annually from agencies to ensure better supervisory standards. Chief executives are to be permitted to subdelegate to officials. This is designed to achieve a major strengthening of the financial framework. The rationale behind this is that they are better placed than the finance minister to manage the specific tasks. The bill is virtually indistinguishable from the one proposed by us. It would be extremely cantankerous of us, under those circumstances, to oppose it. We do not; we support it. The Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill achieves a number of things. The Commonwealth authorities and companies have been generally regulated by part 11 of the parent Audit Act. Since this is to be repealed, replacement provisions are needed and now there is a whole bill specifically devoted to this task. While most authorities are regulated under the Audit Act only about two-thirds of them are currently caught under the general legislation with the rest having their own financial reporting and auditing provisions. That is the situation at the moment. Similarly, the memoranda and articles of association of many Commonwealth companies contain their own requirements so far as accountability to ministers is concerned. What the new bill does is propose to replace these very diverse accountability requirements with a single set of core requirements. Many of these are modelled on comparable areas of the Corporations Law as well as best practice applying to individual authorities. This standardisation is a major reform which should both strengthen and simplify the current regulatory requirements. Again, this bill is virtually indistinguishable from the one proposed by Labor and we are certainly not opposed to it. The major change seems to be the strengthening of the penalties applicable to office holders of Commonwealth authorities and/or companies to include a civil penalty regime in addition to a criminal penalty regime. We support this initiative. While each of the four pieces in the legislative package is significant, the Auditor General Bill is the key element of the whole package. The mere existence of a separate Auditor-General Bill is a recognition of the almost unique position of the Auditor-General in the constitutional institutional arrangements of this nation. I say almost unique because, as my colleague the member for Chifley (Mr Price) continues to remind me, the ombudsman is in a very similar position-though not being given appropriate recognition by this government at least so far as making available to her the necessary resources for her to do her job properly are concerned. Let me say that the special position, rather than the unique position, arises because of the special duties of the Auditor-General, the special responsibilities of that office and the really quite fundamental importance to effective and accountable democracy that a fearless and truly independent watchdog does provide. Subclause 8(1) of the bill proposes to designate the Auditor-General as an independent officer of the parliament. We have no problem with this approach. Indeed, we do think it is appropriate to recognise the uniqueness or special character of the position. I think we do have to frankly acknowledge that this change is really cosmetic and meaningless as it is brought to fruition in the terms of this particular legislation. Subclause 8(2) really makes this crystal clear when you look at its terms. It states: There are no implied functions, powers, rights, immunities or obligations arising from the Auditor General being an independent officer of the parliament. I should add that there are no explicit or express functions, powers, rights, immunities or obligations either. The bill is really quite silent in all these things. So in terms of the functions of the office, it really is quite meaningless to describe the Auditor-General as an officer of the parliament. It is mere window dressing without any substance-like a few other policies of this government; for example, the ministerial code of conduct springs rapidly to mind. So it is not unique in that respect. The establishment of the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory authority is a somewhat more substantial step toward ensuring the actual independence of the Auditor-General. Currently the ANAO exists as an administratively established body only. It is therefore technically very much at the mercy of the executive of the day. It could be abolished at any time. With the passage of this legislation, that unsatisfactory state of affairs will have been ended and the ANAO will, to that extent, have the protection of this parliament. I think it is very important that the Auditor General and the administrative machinery surrounding him and the particular core functions that he exercises do have the protection of the parliament and also the commitment of the executive government of the day. The current circumstances that are unfolding in Victoria do, I think, give us an object lesson of what not to do in this respect. Many members will be aware of the quite outrageous proposals now being examined by the Kennett government concerning the state Auditor-General's role in Victoria. Mr Ches Baragwanath has been a high profile watchdog of the Victorian government since the early 1990s. In the conduct of his duties I have to say he has exposed financial mismanagement and maladministration not only by the current government but also, to some extent, by the former ALP government. While it is always embarrassing for any government to have administrative failings exposed in this respect, it is perfectly proper that they be exposed provided, of course, the officer in question is acting in a level-headed, meticulous and non-crusading or emotionally excessive, overextended kind of way. All of that is the task of an Auditor-General-to look at just these questions of basic financial administration. The role does need a fearless, competent person who is prepared to incur the wrath of the government of the day to provide proper protection for taxpayers. Just one example of the unhappy situation in Victoria these days, out of a legion that come to mind, is the . Crown Casino saga. One particular aspect of this was an additional licence being granted to Crown for a further 150 gaming tables for consideration of $85 million. Mr Baragwanath pointed out in his report on ministerial portfolios of May 1996 that the government could have actually charged up to $259 million for the additional licence. The Kennett government had in effect given Crown Casino a windfall of $174 million. Because of this and a good many other adverse findings against the present Victorian government-including the misuse of government advertising for political purposes- Mr Kennett wanted to bring the Auditor-General there down a peg or two. First he tried to put him onto a completely inappropriate contract, which Mr Baragwanath successfully resisted. Now we are seeing unfold a totally mischievous misuse of the so-called obligations of the government under the national competition policy to try to remove the Auditor-General's monopoly over external auditing in the Victorian public sector. That exercise has led to the unprecedented warning we have seen in recent days from the Australasian Council of Auditors-General that the Victorian government's agenda of open competition and letting it all go off to the private sector will interfere with the independence of the Auditor-General. It is our understanding that no other jurisdiction in this country, either the Commonwealth or any of the states or territories, is looking at its audit legislation in the same way as Victoria, even though all of them do have an obligation to undertake competition policy related reviews. In the Commonwealth and in a number of other states as well, the Auditor-General is expressly permitted to subcontract out some of the actual functions of the auditing task, but the responsibility certify, to report, at the end of the day as the affairs of particular departments and agencies remains that of the Auditor-General himself. The statutory obligation is not ished in any way. That is what is up for grabs in Victoria it is a pretty obvious, transparent endeavour to--as Mr Baragwanath has been saying very publicly-'effectively muzzle' parliament's watchdog or at least put it on 'an extremely short leash'. He has gone on to predict the potential for 'irreparable long-term damage' to the governance of Victoria's public sector if the changes go ahead. Hopefully the provisiems that we are putting in place with the passag-,of this legislation at the CommonweaJtJt l-vel will make impossible that kind ofex-ise of crude executive political muscle here ilt 'the Commonwealth level. I certainly hope so. . That said, the bill does contain a number examples where there is some pretty breathtaking hypocrisy being displayed by the government. I think I will get out of the habit of talking about 'breathtaking' hypocrisy because just about every example of hypocrisy that one comes across these days is in fact quite breathtaking, and it has become almost an unnecessary cliche to talk of it in those terms. This is hypocrisy with a capital H, but that is not unusual because we have seen a lot of examples of this. I am talking about a number of issues which we were told were so vital to the coalition before the last election that they simply could not allow the then tabled legislation to proceed without amendment-issues on which they have now been utterly exposed as hypocritical opportunists because they have now altered or completely reversed their previous positions. Now they are in government and seeing things from the perspective of government, they are basically adopting positions which were the sensible ones to adopt all along. Let me give some examples of this phenomenon at work. First of all, the Senate actually went so far as to amend the Labor legislation to ensure that the Auditor-General could not be appointed unless at least two-thirds of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts agreed with the appointment. The to government's bill proposes only that a simple to majority should be necessary to agree to the appointment of the Auditor-General. Obviously the change to a simple majority vote keeps diminthe power with the executive-something which we are familiar with. Here it is, and and let's recognise perhaps the acceptability of that I am not arguing against that-but let's at least acknowledge that nothing really has changed so far as the basic principles are involved, only the names of the players. Secondly, the Senate also amended the Labor legislation to allow for consultation between the Auditor-General and the chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts where the Auditor-General wishes to suppress the disclosure of sensitive information. Clause 37 of the bill currently proposes that the Auditor-General should not be allowed to disclose information if he or she is of the opinion that disclosure would be contrary to of the public interest or if the Attorney-General has issued a certificate to suppress the disclosure of information. All I can say here is that, if Labor had proposed this type of secrecy regime, this would have been vigorously denounced by members of the coalition. Now they are running mute on the issue; they are proposing an absolute blanket of secrecy from an officer of the parliament to any member of parliament. This is one provision about which we do have some concerns. We certainly would have preferred the original terms of our legislation. Next we come to the exercise whereby the coalition members were very keen to ensure that the Auditor-General was able to conduct performance audits on government business enterprises or any of their subsidiaries and amended, again, the 1994 bill in the Senate to that effect except for partially privatised GBEs. The current bill basically adopts Labor's model, which involves a request from either the Minister for Finance or the joint committee before a performance audit of a government business enterprise can be undertaken. We agree with that proposal, but we are unimpressed, again, with the hypocrisy of the now government in opportunistically changing its views for no other reason than its change of status. Finally, in this respect let me mention a similar disdain for consistency that was displayed in the government's preferred provisions concerning the appointment of the Auditor-General. The government has changed its previous position on the appointment, now preferring a bare majority in votes on the joint committee rather than the two-thirds majority that had been previously insisted on by the Senate. The last bill in this package of four contains the myriad of consequential and transitional provisions which arise from a rewrite of the Audit Act. The major initiatives here are provisions which increase the role of the joint committee. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts is now to become the Audit Committee of the parliament. The joint committee's additional responsibilities wearing this new title will include consideration and reporting on the operations and resources of the ANAO, examination of the draft budget of the ANAO, subsequent reporting of recommendations to the finance minister and both houses of parliament, determining the audit priorities of the parliament and advising the Auditor-General of those priorities. Labor supports all these proposals. We have no difficulty with any of them. The minister has provided the opposition with some notice of two amendments which it proposes to move. Let me say that we have no problem with either of them. We will be supporting them. There is no need to delay the House in the consideration in detail stage for that reason. The first is a minor technical error on the timing of the commencement of the Natural Heritage Trust. The second, however, is really much more significant and deserves a little attention. There was an error in the bill-a rather spectacular one-which would have been serious if it had not been detected and gone through unamended. That is fixed in the new clause 1056B, which is amended to ensure that the Treasurer retains his existing power to approve of amounts of Reserve Bank profits being set aside for contingencies. Without this amendment I understand the distribution of the Reserve Bank's income could have been inappropriately high and inadequate moneys might have been retained by the bank for future contingencies. Perhaps this error was picked up by the same very astute Reserve Bank officer who was the one who apparently noticed that Mr Costello's, the Treasurer's, mid-year review estimates of the general government sector underlying deficit was actually $1.2 billion greater than that originally published in January. That leads me to make an observation about 'the number of really quite significant errors that have been creeping into Commonwealth financial administration and in fact becoming a matter of now public notoriety and, I would have hoped, some concern to the government, not that there is much sign of it, given the normal insouciance with which these matters are being brushed aside by the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance. Let me mention for a start, after all the trumpeting about the Labor government's forecasting difficulties at a time of low inflation in our last budget, we have seen announced in the mid-year review a blow-out within six months of this government's budget of just on $3 billionthe Costello crater or chasm as it is appropriately called-itself a product of misforecasting of inflation, messed up wage growth forecasts and also very comprehensi ve misreading of the likely collections from company tax following earlier changes to the company tax rate, which threw the budget out by some $1.6 billion in the space of the time. I have mentioned. Reports have now been coming in incidentally about the government being aware of that forecasting error as early as September last year. I note again in passing the ministerial code of conduct seems to have no application to some people in the government when it comes to correcting things in the public domain at the first available opportunity. Then, of course, we had the mid-year review document itself becoming subject to a further confession of error. Indeed, it was a confession of error on a spectacular scale with a further $1.2 billion of blow-out coming to light, this time in the bottom line of the so called general government deficit, raising a very real question-although, again, it was brushed aside by the Treasurer in this House-as to whether the budget sector would in fact have to pick up the tab for the blow-out, if not this financial year then next year, whether caused by revenue shortfalls, expenditure overruns, or whatever. I make the point, as I have publicly, that errors of this kind do subject us, among other things, to a degree of international ridicule, given that the OECD and other international agencies do pay particular regard to these figures, not least the figure ment deficit, which is something separate and distinct from the budget deficit itself but, nonetheless, it is an important macroeconomic accounting entity. The point about the mid-year review errors is that there was not just one big error of that kind. There were in fact something like 170 separate arithmetical or numerical errors in the mid-year review document-leading me to make the point on one or two occasions that, while one clerical error may be regarded as a misfortune, to have 170 begins to look more than a little like carelessness.  audited.",87
135,Mr GARETH EVANS,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"The auditing of the executive government in this respect would be very sensible, as the member for Chifley says. The government's credibility in all of this has also been diminished because of the way in which it tried to conceal public information about the scale of these particular errors. The correction document was not given to the press, was not circulated, was not passed around Parliament House and was not tabled in parliament; it was just hoped that somehow, by printing it and giving it in due course to a handful of people who had to have it, the scale of the mess-up would pass unnoticed. It is worth asking why so many of these errors have been creeping into public administration. The ministers have to accept the immediate responsibility for them; whether they do so or not may be another matter. But lying behind that is the question which is concerning many people now-that the impact of significant downsizing and the loss of expertise in key areas of the Commonwealth Public Service will now create a much greater chance than used to be the case of significant errors of this kind recurring. The newly elected member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel) raised our concern about this in this place on 27 February when he asked a question of the Minister for Finance. He asked: ... whether it was the savage staff cuts in his department which led to the spectacular blunders in the mid-year review? Is it true that the Department ... is to be savagely reduced again in this of general govern- year's budget? That followed reports that had appeared in the public print to that effect. He further asked: Is it true that the minister is planning to cut staff by four to five per cent this year and four to five per cent the year after? He then asked whether it was true that the ultimate object, as reported, was to: ... reduce Finance to a rump of 60 staff, with the loss of corporate memory, skills and staff numbers? The rest of the functions would presumably be farmed out somewhere else. We did not get any sort of an answer from the Minister for Finance. He just said: The answer to all four questions ... is no. Whether that was because it was only a 3.9 per cent reduction contemplated rather than a four to five per cent reduction, or whether it was 65 staff contemplated as the end rump rather than 60, we do not know. What we do know is that there does appear to be a continuing pressure on all government departments and agencies to reduce their personnel. That has also been the case with the major financial and management administering departments of state, Finance in particular. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has been reported in today's Financial Review as saying that more spending cuts are necessary following the deterioration in the government's tax takings-to which I have already adverted. So the pressure will in fact continue. There are many other reasons why we say that the budgetary contractionary exercise is misconceived. This is not the time to be going into them now, but certainly it is the case that one of the consequences of this kind of budgetary pressure is to make it more and more probable, more and more likely, more and more certain that errors on this scale will continue to recur. Let me say simply in conclusion-having made all those points about the bill itself and about some of the issues arising out of aspects of it-that this is important legislation. It will be given swift passage by the opposition, and not before time after the number of years it has been hanging around. The comprehensiveness and flexibility of the new provision should provide a very good framework for Commonwealth financial managementprovided there is the staff there to administer it-well into the next century. The legislation should have been a lot higher on the government's priority list than being relegated to something that could not be advanced within a year of election but, that said, it is better late than never. It is good legislation and we will support it. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government: (1) for its profound indifference to good financial management by delaying the consideration of these vital financial reforms until more than one year after its election; and (2) for its hypocrisy in amending in a number of aspects Labor's legislative package in the Senate when in Opposition and then retreating from these positions after the election"".",93

138,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"It gives me considerable satisfaction today to speak in the debate on the financial management and accountability legislation package which will replace the Audit Act 1901, one of the oldest pieces of legislation in the parliament. The Audit Act will be replaced by the Auditor-General Bill 1996, the A-G Bill; the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1996, the FMA Bill; the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1996, known as the CAC Bill; and also the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1996. I believe that the previous government deserves congratulations for initiating this legislation and almost driving it to a conclusion. I congratulate this government for picking up that splendid initiative and pursuing it to its fruition. It is an example of the parliament working with common purpose, which the public sees only too rarely. These four bills incorporate most of the recommendations made by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the JCPA, in two of its reports: report 313 entitled An advisory report on the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994, Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994 and the Auditor-General Bill 1994 and on a proposal to establish an audit committee of parliament tabled in September 1994; and report 346 entitled Guarding the independence of the Auditor-General tabled in December 1996. The financial management and accountability legislation package is of paramount importance to the future of federal government and of the parliament itself. The existence of a strong and independent Auditor-General is absolutely fundamental to the effectiveness of the parliament in its scrutiny of executive government. In report 331, the JCPA, of which I was deputy chairman at the time, made a series of recommendations to amend the Auditor General Bill 1994 to enhance the functional independence of the Auditor-General from the executive and to provide for greater parliamentary involvement in the performance of the audit function. In report 346, the JCPA recommended that the Auditor-General be declared in the redrafted Auditor-General Bill an 'independent officer of the parliament'. It is satisfying to the JCPA to know that its recommendation has been adopted. The title independent officer of the parliament encapsulates the role and status of the office of the Auditor-General. The Auditor General performs a function that is essential to parliamentary scrutiny but which the parliament itself has neither the technical expertise nor the resources to perform. The Auditor-General does the work of the parliament. The JCPA recommended in report 346 that a guarantee of the Auditor-General's audit independence be enshrined in the Auditor General Bill, putting beyond doubt that the Auditor-General has complete discretion in determining the audit program of the Australian National Audit Office and in deciding the manner in which audits will be conducted. We are delighted that the government has in the 1996 bill made the Auditor-General an independent officer of the parliament, but not subject to direction from the parliament in relation to the exercise of audit functions. An important element of the new framework to underpin the independence of the Auditor-General is the establishment of an audit committee of parliament which, on behalf of the parliament, will enhance the transparency of decisions taken in relation to the Auditor-General. It is most appropriate that the JCPA will be empowered to perform the duties of an audit committee of parliament, with an increase in committee membership from 15 to 16. The audit committee functions are an integral part of the JCPA's existing broad role of reporting ment on means for improving public accountability. The JCPA is enthusiastic about the prospect of becoming the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, the JCPAA, of the parliament. The bill provides to the newly expanded JCPA the powers of veto over executive appointments to the position of Auditor-General. This requires a majority vote within the JCPA and will ensure that any appointment will be subject to committee scrutiny. The JCPA has also noted that the new JCPAA has similar powers of approval over the appointment of the Independent Auditor and may advise the Independent Auditor of parliament's audit priorities. In report 346, the committee had recommended that the Auditor-General Bill provide for the Auditor-General to have a mandate to conduct a full range of financial and performance audits across the entire public sector, including performance audits in government business enterprises. While the Auditor General is so empowered, the mandate is not unfettered. It is very satisfying to the JCPA to know that the government has accepted all bar two of its recommendations. I wish to tum my attention to the issue of sensitive audit information. The Auditor General Bill makes the Attorney-General the arbitrator in deciding when sensitive information may not be disclosed. However, the bill does not restrict the circumstances in which an Attorney-General can order the Auditor General to suppress the publication of sensitive information. The JCPA had recommended in its report that suppression orders would apply only where the publication of the information was likely to prejudice national security interests. The JCPA is also concerned that in those circumstances where a suppression order is issued by an Attorney-General the Auditor General Bill forbids the Auditor-General providing an unabridged copy of the audit report and/or a copy of the suppressed information to any parliamentarian, the JCPAA or either house of parliament. The only recipient of the information will be the relevant minister, the Minister for Finance and the to the parliaPrime Minister. The committee feels that this is not transparent, that it is not enhancing the independence of the Auditor-General and that it is not enabling the parliament to properly scrutinise. The JCPA believes that this clause of the bill will have the effect of limiting the powers of parliament. For parliament not to have access to some of the information which might be excluded by this clause impinges on the rights of Australians to have the administration of the country by the executive properly scrutinised by the parliament. The JCPA considers the independence of the Auditor-General to be absolutely fundamental to public accountability in Australia. If the Auditor-General is not properly resourced or does not have a legislative mandate to carry out an effective and broad scrutiny of the public sector, then parliament itself is compromised in its ability to hold the executive to account. In adopting most of the recommendations of the JCPA in report 346, the government has gone a long way to restoring authority and meaning to the parliament and securing the Auditor-General's independence from the executive. We find it a shame that the clause on sensitive audit information compromises this independence to a degree. I tum now to the other three bills which make up the FMA legislation package. All the recommendations made by the JCPA in its report 331, except one, have been accepted by the government in its 1996 CAC Bill and the 1996 FMA Bill. The one exception concerns the penalty regime for breaches of trust and duty by directors of Commonwealth authorities and companies. The penalty regime will be consistent with that which applies to directors of private companies rather than the more stringent criminal penalty regime proposed by the 1994 version of the bill and supported by the JCPA. The JCPA accepts this modification as it realises that it may be unduly harsh for directors of Commonwealth authorities and companies to be subjected to criminal penalties were they to breach trust and duty when private sector directors are treated more leniently for similar breaches. Overall, the committee acknowledges that the four bills reflect the spirit of the committee's reports. The JCPA is pleased that changes to the Audit Act 1901 are finally being made. It believes that the 1996 bills will result in greater transparency and accountability among public agencies. By heeding recommendations in reports 331 and 346, the government has ensured that Australia is at the forefront of international trends greater financial accountability reporting for governments. It is encouraging for the JCPA and the whole parliament to see so many of its recommendations incorporated in these bills. Before I close, when we see reforms such as these tabled in parliament and presented by ministers of successive governments over a long period of time, we should be aware that this does not happen overnight. These bills are here after a long process of policy development involving many people of vision working behind the scenes. I believe parliament should express its thanks to these people and always give credit where credit is due. I wish to place on record my personal thanks, as well as that of the JCPA, to Mr Maurie Kennedy-who is with us tonight in the advisers' gallery-the Assistant Secretary to the Financial Administration Advisory Branch. Mr Kennedy and his team have been the driving force behind the conceptual development of the new FMA legislation, gathering together a skilled and experienced team to undertake the work. He has displayed qualities of strong and sound leadership, absolute professionalism and real determination to see this package of bills and this project through to fruition. I am sure that Maurie is as pleased as the JCPA is to see these bills back in parliament. When the bills finally become law, Australia will have a legislative model that ensures the retention of important protections for the public purse while enabling more flexible, innovative and responsive management practices by Commonwealth agencies. The new legislation sets a professional standard for probity and ethical behaviour in the provision of government services and the accountability of bureaucracy to parliament. Mr Kennedy deserves much of the credit for this achievement. I commend the bill to the House.",94
139,Mr MCMULLAN,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"Canberra) (8.13 p.m.)I rise to support the amendment moved by my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). In so doing, I want to say that I think-as all members of the House will-this is a welcome package. We to have some debate, as is reflected in the amendment, about elements of it. I detected some of those concerns in the comments of the Chairman of the JCPA reflecting that committee's views. I respect the manner in which they were presented. As the Chairman of the JCPA said, it is a package with a long gestation period. One could have expected a much larger package, given the length of the gestation period. Elephants have been bred in much shorter periods. Nevertheless, that has allowed a lot of sensible discussion and debate. It has also allowed for an unfortunate amount of hyperbole, exaggeration and claiming of the moral high ground. Nevertheless, it is a package on which a lot of work has been done by a lot of very good officers of the Public Service, a lot of members of parliament, staff of this parliament and independent commentators over the years. I want, particularly, to refer tonight to the Auditor-General Bill. I will make some brief comments on the other elements of the package but they are not the ones to which I wish to give my attention; nor are they the ones to which the amendment refers. The package is very well known and understood by members. In brief, it is a package of bills which will replace the Audit Act 1901, which regulates the financial management of the Commonwealth sector. It is a significant reform, initiated by the previous Labor government. It seeks to modernise, streamline and standardise the financial management and auditing regime which applies to all Commonwealth entities. In particular, with regard to the Auditor-General Bill, it sets out the Auditor General's powers and functions, and specifies, clarifies and broadens those when compared with the current arrangements, which have their origin in the act of 1901. There are many changes, however. I suppose the most important symbolic change is that the Auditor-General is specifically designated as an officer of the parliament. I do not want to go on about the detail, merely reiterating things which have been said by others or which are adequately written elsewhere. But it is fact that the function of an Auditor General, and particularly of an independent Auditor-General, is and should be a very important function of any Westminster system of parliament. The function of audit of public finance and public instrumentalities and of ensuring the proper use of taxpayers' money is not an issue of concern exclusively, of course, to Westminster systems. But the particular nature of an Auditor-General and its relationship to the parliament does have its Westminster elements. Here in Australia, as in other comparable jurisdictions, it has always been an important part of our financial arrangements. It has always been one of those elements which should be and, when properly recognised and explained, has the capacity to be a source of assurance to Australians that their taxes are being spent as intended by the parliament and that they are being spent scrupulously, honestly and fairly. It also has the potential to play other, more positive roles in terms of allowing more innovative management processes without the risk of misuse of public funds because of the rigour of audit. I would like to make some brief comments on the comparison between the major bills and the package of 1994, not at great length but to some extent because it is relevant to the amendment and because it does indicate the essential continuity, notwithstanding some changes in this bill. Mr Georgiou-For the better?",96
140,Mr MCMULLAN,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"I will comment on that as I go along. The Financial Management and Accountability Bill is effectively the same as the 1994 package. The Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill makes the Auditor General's external audit functions more explicit and, in the broad, I support that. I worry as to whether the resources are going to be supplied to enable the function to be discharged for that broader brief. It is not an easy issue, particularly when you get into some of the grey areas of partially privatised organisations. The Auditor-General, Mr Barrett, has written about some of the complications of that. While it is a very easy principle to assert there is actually, at the margin, an area of complexity which will require continuing judgment. It is my view that the appropriate body to undertake that external audit of Commonwealth bodies is, and remains, the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General Bill itself is substantially the same. While it does strengthen the role of parliament, I regard that strengthening as essentially more apparent than real. But they are not changes with which I have any disagreement. What has worried me, and what has motivated the nature of the amendment, is that when in government we had a tedious repetition of a monopoly of virtue in these matters by members of the then opposition. I suppose this calls forth an extra element of passion from me because, as a senator at that time, I had to listen to some of the most sanctimonious contributions the world has ever heard fro n people who seem to have lost their enthusiasm for the task since the election. The now Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, the then Senator Bishop, did presume an absolute monopoly of virtue on this matter. The way the Auditor-General's position was described, you would certainly have said that if Mahatma Gandhi had applied he would not have had the moral fortitude required for the position. I know the current Auditor-General quite well and regard him both as a very appropriate and a very well-qualified holder of that position who will discharge it with competence and probity. But Mahatma Gandhi he is not. It was stomach turning in the extreme the way in which this never-ending series of sanctimonious speeches were made assuming that there was a monopoly of virtue on one side with regard to the question of accountability to parliament. There are some disagreements, mainly at the margin. I have not heard a member of parliament disagree with the broad thrust of the direction of this package. There are arguments about its priority. When we were the government the then opposition could not understand why it was not at the top of our priority list. It is interesting to see that now more than 12 months into this new government and it is still in the process of passing this legislation. Mr Georgiou-It beats five years.",97
141,Mr MCMULLAN,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"If the Senate had allowed it to pass it would have been passed in 1994, as you know. The member for Kooyong is here but he is not usually one of the 'monopoly of virtue' brigade. I would be very disappointed to see him join it on this occasion. Within political parties and across political parties there are debates about some of the issues at the margin and about some of the issues of priority compared to other important matters. This government had to make those choices and it did. The previous government had to make those choices and it did. I would have been much happier to support this package of legislation than the industrial relations package last year. If the government wanted some advice on priorities I would quite happily have said, 'Yes, you should put the Auditor-General package up well before that. This may do some good; that can only do damage.' Nevertheless, the issue of accountability that we are addressing, and which the Auditor-General package deals with, is a very major issue in any modem democracy. It is one of the distinguishing characteristics of an open society: government being accountable to the citizens through the parliament. It is an issue that countries in transition to democracy sometimes have difficulty accommodating themselves to, particularly parties that have been in government in an authoritarian manner and find themselves meeting this new challenge of accountability. It is quite a revelation to those of us who are used to it to see the difficulty of transition for those to whom it is new. - Accountability means much more than the Auditor-General, but the Auditor-General is, nevertheless, very important. The functions of regular audit and the opportunities for special audits when required should give significant public confidence to the Australian people about the probity with which their funds are handled. It enables us to balance and provide we are the freedom for people sometimes to take reforming initiatives in public administration without being unduly constrained by a body of rules governing every element of behaviour because we are confident that we have, first of all, a very efficient and honest Public Service and, secondly, a rigorous process of scrutiny by the Auditor-General. The alternative to that is continuing to be entirely rules driven and not allowing initiative in public sector administration in ways that can enable value for money to be achieved. The role of the Auditor-General is one of the areas that emphasises the way in which the public sector differs from the private sector. It is one of the distinguishing characteristics-the way in which the Auditor General plays a much more prominent role and a much more arms-length role than has always been the case in the private sector. Of course, auditors are of increasing importance in the private sector. The recognition of that is growing. There was certainly significant debate and concern about the reality of the independence of some auditors of major corporations in the 1980s, to the great cost of shareholders and the Australian public. I want mainly to turn not just to the accountability theme but to the theme of effectiveness and the efficiency audit process. I have always been one of those who has never been absolutely convinced that the Auditor General is the appropriate body for this function. I think it is a very important function, but I note with interest, for example, that the Coombs royal commission did not believe that this was a function properly conducted by the Auditor-General. There should be a separate body, they contended, as I recall, within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, but that is not important to me. I think it is a very different function from the accountability function and, in time, we may want to look at whether there is a better way of doing it. I accept that the initiative has been taken for it to be done by the Auditor General and it is very important that it is done and that it is given increasing emphasis. That is not effectively changed by this package. I mention it only in passing as something which we might want to give consideration to over the years; I do not propose it as a criticism of this package of legislation. The previous government thought it was appropriate to conduct efficiency audits through the Auditor-General's office and this government shares that view. It is clearly the majority view, and it is one legitimate view. I have some doubts about it which I think we can consider on another occasion. I think we need to take a broader view of the focus of efficiency audits. It is not just whether the resources, as provided by the parliament, are being used effectively, but also whether adequate resources are being applied to enable the goals, as outlined, for example, by the performance indicators, to be achieved. It is quite possible for taxpayers' money to be spent with absolute propriety and quite efficiently but the goals specified are not being achieved because the resources are simply not sufficient to the task. The most competent people performing in the most efficient manner cannot achieve all goals with limited resources. So it is a question which I think needs, over time, to be reviewed. That is one of the reasons why I doubt, in the long term, that it is a function that will appropriately remain with the Auditor-General. It is not a change, I have to say, which I expect this century. I still welcome the emphasis on propriety and accountability and, as I said before, with the capacity for that to be combined with flexibility because of our confidence in the rigour of the scrutiny of the Auditor-General. I still support rigorous efforts to ensure that taxpayers' money is being taken care of responsibly, but also these same people-the taxpayers-are the consumers of the services and their interests in this capacity must also be protected. It is that balance which we sometimes have lost sight of. People do not only want to be sure that their money is not being squandered. Of course, that is what they want. Of course, that is what they are entitled to be assured of, and it is an obligation we all have. When examples of waste are exposed, the public gets justifiably angry. But they also want us to be effective. They want the money to be spent to achieve worthwhile social goals. That is a balance that is sometimes missing in the narrower approaches to efficiency audits that are conducted at the moment. That brings me, in conclusion, to the specifics of the amendment. I have referred to both of the grounds of the amendment in my remarks to date, which are that, whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House is called upon to take note of both the delay in proceeding with this matter, given the priority that it was given both by the now government when in opposition and by the now Prime Minister in major speeches in the lead-up to the election, and the fact that setting the bar very high in their time in opposition always used to encourage us because it looked very much like they were going to be in opposition forever. That is a mind-set, when I was in government, which I enjoyed seeing in the opposition. They reflected it on occasions, setting standards were, I thought, not likely to be ones that would be reflected by them should they be elected to govern. History has vindicated that judgment because the legislative package is not that which they advocated so enthusiastically in opposition. I support the amendments. I also join with the chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in congratulating the staff of the Department of Finance, not only those present here tonight-who I congratulate personallybut also those people who have worked so hard in the department and others. I hope those present will take back from me and from all the parliament the congratulations of all of us for their work, which is almost now coming to fruition. While supporting the amendment, I will also be of course supporting the bill.",98
142,Mr GEORGIOU,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"Kooyong) (8.31 p.m.)It is a rare situation for a professional body not to overstate the significance of its members' role, but the Australasian Council of Auditors-General does pinpoint with utter accuracy, I think, the Auditor-General's strategic position, as the only one which subjects the practical conduct and functions of the public sector as a whole to regular independent investigation and review. It has long been my personal view-it goes back to my 20s-that the Auditor-General is fundamental to maintaining the accountability and preventing the abuse of power across our political system. I applaud the Auditor-General Bill 1996 for achieving a substantial strengthening of the office. The bill is the culmination of a lengthy process of review which began in 1989 with the JCPA's report The Auditor-General: Ally of the people and the parliament, which progressed through Labor's Auditor-General Bill 1994 and then the JCPA's 1996 report Guarding the independence of the Auditor General. This seven-year process has perhaps been unnecessarily long. If we want to see the main gap in timing it is between the JCPA's 1989 report and the then Keating government's 1994 bill. I must say that, while I do not see all evil on one side, I think that Labor's amendment that is of the most profound hypocrisy. How the opposition, particularly the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), can now, after waiting five years before formulating their bill, complain about the 12 months lapse between the election of a new government and its legislative priorities and the introduction of a significantly amended and strengthened bill is, I must say, in the spirit of fairness and bipartisanship, entirely beyond me. The election of the Howard government has meant that the commitments entered into when we were in opposition, namely, to establish a completely independent Auditor General so that a fearless and authoritative surveillance of government departments can occur without intimidation from the executive, is now about to be met. The bill is a part of a package of bills which are important in themselves. I do not think that any of them are more important than the Auditor-General Bill 1996; I believe it is of paramount importance. It is vital in a parliamentary democracy that the key watchdog over the public sector be free to carry out its tasks, independent of interference from the executive. If the independence of the Auditor-General is compromised then so too is the accountability of the executive to the parliament and, through the parliament, the Australian people. The 1996 bill addresses this fundamental issue of the independence of the Auditor General through a range of measures: it establishes the Auditor-General as an independent officer of the parliament; it provides a role for the parliament, through the JCPA, in the appointment of the Auditor-General; it provides a necessary degree of security of tenure for the Auditor-General; it grants the Auditor-General a wide legislative mandate; it provides the Auditor-General with substantial powers to obtain information; it provides various safeguards against the interference of the executive in the resourcing of the ANAO; it establishes the ANAO as a statutory authority under the direction of the Auditor General and it gives the Auditor-General the flexibility to engage consultants to assist in the performance of his or her function. A key provision of the bill is its declaration that the Auditor-General is an independent officer of the parliament. As the JCPA's 1996 report indicated: ... very few people even in the bureaucracy, will ever know the details of the legislative framework that underpins the Auditor-General's role, functions and independence. It is thus important to give the Auditor-General a title that will encapsulate the features of that legislative framework. The change in designation does express a special relationship that the Auditor-General shares with the parliament as the key scrutineer of the executive and it clears up some of the ambiguity about the role of the office. The change is, I believe, symbolic. In politics, however, symbolism is important. The insertion of the word 'independent' lays to rest any concern-and there was somethat the strengthened Auditor-General's relationship with the parliament might bring with it risks of the legislature interfering with the Auditor-General's independence. A title which highlights the independence of an office, however, is of little value without provisions which guarantee the Auditor General's personal independence in terms of the mode and tenure of appointment. In the past, the Auditor-General has been appointed solely on the advice of the executive. In effect, this has meant that the auditee has been responsible for the appointment of the auditor. This practice has the potential to undermine the independence of the Auditor General and it is inconsistent with the appointment of auditors in private enterprise. There is, I believe, an imperative need for parliament to be involved in approving any appointment to the office of Auditor-General. The bill, by giving the parliament, through the new Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, an effective veto over the appointment of the Auditor-General, meets this need. In my speech to the House on the tabling of the JCPA's 1996 report, I indicated that in my view the office of the Auditor-General is perhaps the one Commonwealth office that would justify appointment until retirement. This bill does not provide for such a term but it does follow the JCPA's 1996 recommendation and fix the term for the Auditor-General at 10 years. This provision is, I believe, an effective compromise between the existing system of appointment until retirement, under which there was concern that auditors-general would retire in fairly short order, and the proposal for appointments of only up to seven years contained in the 1994 bill. I do not believe that the 1994 provisions would have been conducive to a strong and independent Auditor-General and would have weakened the autonomy of the Auditor-General. Importantly, the provision for a single term only will maintain the integrity and independence of the Auditor-General and further the ability to perform his or her job without fear of reprisal from the executive. As one of the primary means of securing the executive's public accountability, it is vital that the Auditor-General has a wide legislative mandate to audit the various functions of the Commonwealth. At present, the Auditor-General's mandate is somewhat ambiguous and subject to a significant loophole. Under the existing act, the Auditor General is appointed as the financial auditor of all Commonwealth entities. Some statutory authorities, however, through their own enabling legislation, have been able to appoint an external auditor and avoid their accounts, records and financial transactions being audited by the Auditor-Generaland, by so doing, also prevent the Auditor General from conducting performance audits on them. The Auditor-General Bill 1996, in conjunction with the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill, effectively closes this loophole and it will ensure that the Auditor-General does audit the financial statements of all Commonwealth entities. In relation to performance audits, the bill gives the Auditor-General wider powers than ever to examine the efficiency of Commonwealth entities. The Keating government, in its 1994 bill, rejected the JCPA's view that the Auditor-General have an unrestricted right to performance audit GBEs, or the alternative JCPA view that the JCPA itself should be able to request the Auditor-General to perform an efficiency audit. While I take on board the conceptual arguments that GBEs are in general subject to accountability via the marketplace-an argument which indeed the Keating government made with special force-in fact these constraints do not always work and, taking into account the fact that government business enterprises do spend vast sums of taxpayers' money, I feel it is reasonable that parliament should have the capacity to make judgments on its own GBEs based on evidence provided to it by the Auditor-General. The bill does not give the Auditor-General completely free rein to examine the activities of GBEs; it does, however, give him a much greater range of power to conduct performance audits on wholly government owned GBEs than the 1994 bill proposed, as long as the JCPA, the responsible minister, or the Minister for Finance requests such an audit. If the Auditor-General's wide legislative mandate is to be effective, it must be backed by sufficient powers to obtain information and powers to disclose this information to the parliament. The bill provides for the Auditor General to continue to have wide powers to obtain information and documents, and to take evidence under oath. These powers are limited only by the laws relating to parliamentary powers, privileges and immunities and other such laws which are passed expressly to exclude the operation of the Auditor-General. This latter provision has been included to ensure that parliament is made aware of such exclusions. The gathering of information is only one half of the equation, however. Accurate, complete and instructive reporting to the parliament also requires that the Auditor General be empowered to publish the information which is obtained during the audit process. While I believe that the Auditor General should have some discretionary power to exclude particularly sensitive information, I do not think it is appropriate that the Auditor-General be unduly restricted by the executive from reporting information to the parliament. It is on this issue that the Auditor-General Bill 1996 departs significantly from the recommendations of the JCPA-in part, because it has a definition of public interest in it, in such general terms that practically any form of moderately interesting information about government activities could be fitted into one of the categories, if the government had a will to do so. Most importantly, the bill prevents the Auditor-General from including any information in a public report if the Attorney-General has issued a certificate stating that disclosure would be contrary to the public interest. To its credit-and once again, if the Labor Party is concerned about effective consideration of its 1994 bill, then it should look at some of the significant differences between the 1994 and 1996 bills-the bill does specify that in circumstances where the Attorney-General has issued a certificate in relation to information in a public report the Auditor-General must state in the report that the information has been omitted and why the Attorney-General has issued the certificate. This is a substantial improvement on the provisions which were proposed in the 1994 legislation, which placed no check whatsoever on the exercise of the Attorney-General's power to issue a certificate-but perhaps the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) had a particularly warm spot for his previous position as Attorney-General. Resourcing lies at the heart of both the symbolic and functional independence of the Auditor-General. Legislative ambiguity as to who in fact should accept responsibility for the Auditor-General has often led to situations of neglect by both the parliament and the executive-and this was noted by the JCPA in 1989 when it observed that the Australian Audit Office, as it was then known, was in a state of crisis and under-resourced. It took five years for a bill to go forward after this observation by a non-partisan committee which was, incidentally, chaired by the Labor Party. In general, however, the responsibility for resourcing the Auditor-General has come under the umbrella of the executive, with the less than satisfactory situation that one of the primary checks on government performance and expenditure is heavily reliant upon that executive for the resourcing of its activities. While accepting that there is no evidence that any government has deliberately sought to exert pressure on the activities of the Auditorresourcing General by manipulating its resourcesalthough there are other forms of pressuresuch arrangements do of course carry that very potential and, in doing so, compromise the true independence of the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General Bill 1996, working within real constitutional constraints the appropriation of funds, makes an important contribution towards insulating the Auditor-General's resourcing from executive influence. It does this by providing for the JCPAA to examine the estimates of the ANAO and make recommendations to the executive before the budget on the appropriate level of funding for the office. The ANAO's estimates and the recommendations of the JCPAA are then considered by the executive as part of the normal budget process. The bill importantly also provides for the JCPAA to report to both houses of parliament regarding the ANAO's draft estimates. These mechanisms provide for a higher level of input from the parliament, through the JCPA, on matters of resourcing and for greater transparency in the funding arrangements. The bill also guarantees the ANAO access to parliamentary appropriations and gives the Auditor-General the authority to approve a proposal to spend money under an appropriation. An independent Auditor-General must also have at his or her disposal the tools with which to carry out the duties of the office, and in this respect the creation of the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory agency under the direction of the Auditor General is an important provision of the bill. In granting the Auditor-General this degree of independence, the parliament is ensuring that the office is able to perform its important task of examining government activities. Following the recommendations of report 346, the current legislative package has added to the JCPA's functions the task of being the Audit Committee of Parliament. Under these changes the new JCPAA will! as I have already indicated, have a role in appointing the Auditor-General and advising the Auditor General about the parliament's audit priorities, as well as an input into decisions about the of the office. In addition, the bill empowers the JCPAA to approve the appointment of an Independent Auditor and to consider the Independent Auditor's reports. These arrangements, I believe, will help to facilitate the Auditor-General's accountability to parliament for the effective discharge of the regarding audit function. The Auditor-General Bill 1996 provides the legislative basis for a symbolically and functionally independent, yet highly efficient and effective, Commonwealth Auditor-General. I do believe that it places Australia at the forefront of world practice. The bill provides for a degree of separation between the Auditor-General and the executive which has been lacking under current arrangements. It strengthens the role of the parliament. It also gives the parliament, through the JCPAA, an important function in relation to the Auditor General's role. In conclusion, I would like to commend a number of people. The plaudits for Finance have been flying thick and fast and I would like to add my bouquet to them. I would like to commend the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) for his very considerable role in the framing of this bill. It is the government that has to bear the pressure of added scrutiny as the result of the strengthened and more independent Auditor-General, and this government has bitten the bullet and we are almost there. I would also like to extend my thanks to the former Auditor-General, John Taylor. In his term as Auditor-General, he campaigned strongly and in a committed fashion to bring about reforms which would secure the independence of the Auditor-General, strengthen the Auditor-General's relationship with the parliament and provide for a strong audit office for the future. I believe he did an exceptional job as Auditor-General, producing reports of the highest quality, in the face of substantial political criticism and ferocious attacks from some ministers in the Keating government. Anyone who does not recognise the history of the Auditor-General in the last few years of the Keating government in personal and professional terms is missing a significant part of our legitimate recollection. Finally, I wish to thank the chairman and members and staff of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The JCPA has been working for a long time, in a bipartisan spirit, to bring about reform of the Auditor-General. It worked in a bipartisan spirit between the years 1989 and 1994-for five years-without an outcome. It also worked together in the years 1996-97 with an outcome. The JCPA has produced a number of quality reports since 1989 and I consider the bulk of the JCPA recommendations which have been included in the current bills as a great tribute to their endeavours. I commend the bill to the House.",100
143,Mr KERR,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"The previous speaker, the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou), making one of his occasional forays into the House, has said that we are almost there. Almost there? Certainly not so near to the mark as the former opposition, now the government, would have had it with the amendments they moved to the legislation in 1994 in the Senate. It is very important to realise that this legislation actually contains a significant retreat by the then opposition, now the government, from the position that prevailed and they advocated at the time. This legislation proposes, for example, that the appointment of the Auditor-General be arranged with the agreement of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. That is a very fine proposal, but the amendments that the coalition moved in the Senate when the bill was brought forward by the Australian Labor Party actually proposed that the Auditor General could not be appointed unless two-thirds of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts agreed with the appointment. That would have ensured that an appointment was not controlled by the executive. The simple truth is, of course, that the majority of members in the Joint Committee of Public Accounts are inevitably government members. So the executive, through this mechanism, still holds the key to the appointment of the Auditor-General. It is true that this legislation does do some important things, but most of the important things it does are merely a reflection of the legislation that was introduced in 1994 by the Labor government. Those areas where we have seen backtracking need to be mentioned. The Senate also amended the Labor legislation to ensure that, where the Attorney General was of a view that particular matters should be suppressed in relation to the Auditor-General's report, there should be consultation between the Attorney-General and the chair of the Joint Public Accounts Committee. The present bill proposes that the Attorney-General is able to require the nondisclosure of information if he or she has issued a certificate to suppress that disclosure. Of course, had we proceeded in such a way we would have been charged with running a regime of secrecy. In fact, we were. The regime of secrecy has now been brought back into place, courtesy of this government. Coalition members in 1994 were very keen to ensure that the Auditor-General was able to conduct performance audits on Commonwealth government business enterprises and amended the bill to propose that they be so entitled, except for partially privati sed enterprises. In government those matters which were of great moment and fundamental importance to the democratic functioning of the parliament have been abandoned. We have an example of stunning hypocrisy here. It is an issue that was given considerable weight by the then opposition in its stonewalling of the 1994 legislation which went a considerable way to preventing measures of this nature coming into place at that time and deferring for two years the important implementation of the bulk of the recommendations that had been made by the Joint Public Accounts Committee. That history needs to be known. Certainly, it is true that the legislation that has been brought forward today is welcome. It will be the fourth Audit Act passed by the parliament. It reflects the recommendations of a number of reports of the Joint Public Accounts Committee, a committee on which I served for some time. There is no doubt, too, that there was a very tortuous process between the recommendations of the Joint Public Accounts Committee and the implementation of the legislation. That long process was largely due to the difficulty in getting agreement to the package because of the very insistence on these matters, that I have referred to before, from the then opposition in the Senate. The then opposition declined to enable the legislation to proceed in the form that the then government had proposed and insisted on measures of the nature I have indicated. What a difference a year makes. We now have the government, refreshed by its awareness of its own need to be self-protecting to some degree I suspect, coming before this House and saying, 'Well, we are more than happy with the weight of the approach that the Labor Party took in relation to these matters. We will adopt it. We will congratulate ourselves for that approach. We will ignore those areas where we had insisted on higher standards. We will ignore those areas.' So we are entitled to come to the dispatch box on this side of the House to say that we have a situation where the government is, at least, capable of very flexible standards: one set of standards which it articulates, advances and fights fiercely for when it is in opposition, and another set of standards appropriate for government when it comes before us and says, 'Well, the measures we are now proposing are ones upon which we will congratulate ourselves and request the Australian public to give us credit for.' The Australian public can look behind these things and will be, I think, legitimately expressing some scepticism. This goes with the other range of measures which the government had set out to say that it would bring about higher standards. Higher standards require consistency. Higher standards require that you do not articulate propositions, move amendments in the Senate, argue for propositions on the basis that those amendments are fundamental to the legislation and then, when you are in government, delay for a very substantial time the implementation of this legislation. It is now a year since the election of the new government. It has had months and months where this legislation would have been ready for introduction into this parliament. It has not brought it in. The kind of scrutiny that will flow from the work of the Auditor-General under these enhanced reporting conditions will not start to flow for a time because of that. I believe that the community is entitled to say that this whole process has been unduly delayed because of the way in which the Liberal and National parties have tried to have their cake and eat it too. They have one set of standards in opposition, yet, when in government, legislate in a way which is more consistent with the approach of the previous government and yet seek the high ground by asserting to the public that they ought to be congratulated for the way in which they have operated. There are a number of things that are important in relation to the Auditor-General's legislation. Some of it is rhetorically important rather than practically important. For example, the change in name of the Auditor General as an independent officer of the parliament. It is included in the legislation, but the provisions of the bill make it plain that this really is a piece of political windowdressing because it says that there are no implied functions, powers, rights, immunities or obligations arising from the Auditor-General being an independent officer of the parliament. That, in itself, is merely a rhetorical expression of what the Auditor-General ought be rather than a guarantee of some specific charter that flows from that. There are welcome measures in this legislation which include the statutory formation of the basis for the Auditor-General which would prevent any undermining of it, in a simple sense, by the executive government. In terms of the appointment of the Auditor-General, it would have been far better had the coalition parties maintained the position they put in 1994. When the position of Auditor-General becomes vacant, they will be in a position to insist on the appointment of their nominee. The provision requiring the agreement of the Joint Public Accounts Committee is really only window-dressing because the government has a majority on that committee. The opportunity to establish a process requiring consultation with all parties within the parliament in order to gain support for the appointment of the Auditor-General has been missed. I am also very interested in the way this debate has proceeded that we have had little reflection on the experience in Victoria. In Victoria the Kennett government has undertaken one of the most savage attacks on the independence of an Auditor-General in Australia's constitutional history. It has required the Victorian Auditor-General to put his position repeatedly and publicly. This has drawn concern from distinguished academics and people concerned with the propriety of public administration both in the private and public sectors and has been much agitated in the press. We have an interesting contrast between the high standard asserted and claimed to be implemented by this government in this legislation and that practised by its state Liberal Premier in Victoria. It would appear that that practice is entirely inconsistent with the direction of this legislation. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) said the other day that you can choose your friends, but you cannot choose your relatives. I think it is very important that we do have some consistency of approach. One of the things I trust this legislation do is set a benchmark for the auditing of public accounts Australia wide. This is good legislation because it really reflects the package that we introduced. It is deceptive legislation in that the government claims it is distinctly better and improved. It is deceptive because it does not pick up those elements which the coalition asserted were vital for the establishment of a fully independent Auditor General when the legislation was previously before the Senate. A key area where there will be considerable concern is performance audits of Commonwealth government business enterprises. It may be that the reason there is to be no requirement for performance audits of such agencies is that the long-term strategic objective of this government is not to have any Commonwealth government business enterprises or to sell them. In a sense, they would regard these provisions to be ultimately redundant. Whatever their objectives, we will have government business enterprises with us for a considerable time. When the coalition put that as an amendment in the 1994 package and asserted the importance and obligation of this parliament to be able to scrutinise the workings of such government business enterprises in which significant amounts of taxpayers' money are committed it touched a nerve with many in the community. Those people who believed that we would have a more transparent and more effective regime would be concerned that the coalition in government has decided that those particular approaches can be expediently abandoned. It is not surprising but it is disappointing that the current government have changed many of the positions that they vigorously argued when this legislation was being debated in the last parliament. They have now seen the virtue of the approach adopted by the previous government but without the courtesy of recognising that fact in any of the speeches that have been made. I will now tum to some other points about this legislation that merit some short comment. As well as the changed arrangements for the establishment of the statutory office, will its designation as an office of the parliament and an extension of the rules regarding reporting using a modem, streamlined and approved financial management framework, the bill also includes a number of consequential and transitional provisions including the renaming of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts to the Audit Committee of the Parliament and giving that committee the additional responsibilities of reporting on the operations and resources of the Australian National Audit Office, examining the draft budget of that office, reporting recommendations to the finance minister in both houses of parliament, determining the audit priorities of the parliament and advising the Auditor General of those priorities. They are useful tasks to be given to the joint parliamentary committee. I would think that as the Audit Committee of the Parliament that body will continue to be as energetic as the previous committee was in the past. Might I say, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you would be aware that the foremost committees of this parliament would be the Joint Committee on Public Works and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. On both of those committees the chair is recognised with additional remuneration and greater support through the parliamentary committee system. You have chaired one of those bodies",104
144,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,Mr Hollis)With distinction.,107
145,Mr KERR,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"With distinction. The parliament is in fact done great honour by the way in which members from both sides have approached their task as members of those committees and as chairs. In the main the work of those committees proceeds in a largely non-partisan way. Of course, that changes from time to time, as when the former Senator Bishop decided to use the committee system for her crusade for the prime ministership. She is now, I think, more modest in her aspirations. That aside, the work M those committees in the main is that of<members of parliament working diligently . over a long period of time, with a very effective staff to provide background assistance and support. I think this parliament really has a lot to thank those members for. Might I also join in saying that no government really ever likes the work of the Auditor-General. If the audit office is to do task properly and fearlessly, it will from time to time say things which will form ammunition in the public environment for criticism of government administration. Therefore it does need the support of the audit committee of this parliament. The measures that have been introduced today will help the Auditor-General and his office do that task well. My only regret is that this has not been associated with a proper recognition of the fact that the government has resiled from propositions that it put before and is crowing loudly about small changes it has made but is not recognising the work that had gone in over a long time by the previous government to achieve these objectives. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (9.10 p.m.)-I rise tonight in support of the Auditor-General Bill and cognate bills. One of the major achievements of the coalition in the introduction of this bill has been the 12month delay in bringing it into parliament. I was working in the RAAF as a legal officer when these three separate bills that were proposed to replace the Audit Act were introduced. At extremely short notice we had to rearrange a number of procedures, a number of finance orders and regulations, and a number of our training and skills requirements. This was in very crucial circumstances, because these bills prescribe offencesmisappropriation of public moneys-which need to be tracked; evidence needs to be taken and prosecutions made. It took a while for those of us who had any dealings with the act to become acquainted with the jargon that was being used-for example, prescribed authorities becoming GBEs-and with the subsequent orders and regulations and the proposed amendments and how the changes would impact on our work at the coalface. I think the members opposite who have spoken in this debate have probably been in parliament too long and have failed to recognise the effect of such sweeping changes to the Audit Act, which we have been operating under since 1901. It has got a close tie to our constitution. Chapter N of the constitution under 'Finance and trade' states: ... the Commonwealth shall form one Consolidated Revenue Fund, to be appropriated for the its purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution. No money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the Commonwealth except under appropriation made by law. The Audit Act was introduced in 1901 to regulate these requirements of the constitution. In 1901 we did not have government prescribed authorities or government business enterprises or government companies or authorities or government having major shareholdings or quangos or whatever. In 1901 we barely had a Commonwealth. So, yes, the Audit Act was a fledgling act which has struggled on to 1996, but it was one that we were all familiar with. We were familiar historically with the changes that had been made to it and then three major, sweeping changes came through. They deserved some delay in the Senate; they deserved some public comment; they deserved some Public Service scrutiny. Between go and whoa something can pass through the House of Representatives in a very short period of time. The first thing the public knows about it is when it is introduced to this chamber. It is that time between when it becomes public in this chamber and when it is discussed in the Senate that the public has a chance to become familiar with the changes. It is in the subsequent time that the people at the coalface, as in the Public Service, get some knowledge of how the changes are going to affect them, right down the bottom of the food chain. The subsequent entry now of these bills has been a blessing in disguise. This change did cause a lot of confusion at the coalface. It make a lot of people nervous. If the opposition are worried about scrutiny of public funds or scrutiny of government expenditure, perhaps they should not have so vigorously opposed-or perhaps should even have introduced themselves-a charter of budget honesty. Probably one of the most appalling aspects of the previous government's time in office was that during the 1996 election campaign the public was not aware of a $10 billion hole in government spending. I assure you that the Auditor-General probably will not find such glaring accounting errors, but the charter of budget honesty certainly will provide that for the public. government is not afraid of public scrutiny. We have long held ourselves out for open and very transparent government, as previous speakers to this bill have stated. The Auditor-General's position must necessarily be fairly independent from government but, as always, it comes back to this parliament to be legislating for the good and the ,- :lfare of Australia. Therefore, the appointment and selection of an Auditor-General is a very crucial task to be undertaken. It is a .very skilled and complex matter to follow the various avenues of funds that are available to the Commonwealth. We no longer just have consolidated revenue. We now have the three government funds that were not contemplated in 1901. We also now have the various government bodies. The Commonwealth now operates as a private person in a commercial way, not just as a parliament or in a legislative nature. Most of these changes have been recognised in these bills. It probably was long overdue that we got rid of the Audit Act, but people were comfortable with it, and I think the time to get used to the changes has been very valuable. The separation of the liabilities of Commonwealth authorities and companies was an appropriate action in separating those responsibilities and offences into one act and leaving the Financial Management and Accountability Bill as a crisp, very distilled, easily read bill for those who have to deal with it at the coalface. Again, a lot of the use that this will did have for people at the coalface will be in the orders and regulations that are made subsequent to these bills. As you can see from the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill, there have been a number of changes made to assist in the transition that will be necessary as people get used to moving from operating under one system with one set of terminology, one set of forms, one set of reporting procedures, to something that is a little different. I commend these bills to the House. The government has acted wisely in its entire handling of this legislation. I am glad to see that it does receive the support of the opposiThis tion. I think that the public servants who created the bill and sought a more workable form of the Audit Act were probably long overdue in doing it. Keeping the people who have to use the bill down at the lower end informed of the changes, comfortable with the changes and happy with the transition was a necessary part of its introduction.  not being able to listen to the full contribution of the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) or the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay). We are supporting this legislation. The shadow Treasurer has moved an amendment, which I have been pleased to second. It is very important that officers such as the national auditor are seen to be independent and free from executive control. In some ways I have missed a real opportunity here because I have been particularly interested to ensure that the Ombudsman, if you like, gets a bit of an advantage of the tailwind that the Auditor-General is enjoying with this legislation. The Auditor-General has always been well served by having one of the original three parliamentary committees to report to that is, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The Ombudsman has not been so fortunate. When I was privileged to be the chairman of the Human Rights Subcommittee-and I know your interest, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, as the serving deputy chairman of that subcommittee-I was always interested to try to make sure that we had an Australian focus, and that it was not just in our region or woJ:l.dwide. So I was very pleased that we extendedfot the first time an invitation to the Hbman""Rights Commissioner to report to the subcommittee but, more recently, the subcom.'mittee has been pleased to invite the Ombuds. man, and I think that is very important. I see roles such as Auditor-General and Ombudsman as adding significantly to the effectiveness of the parliament and the effectiveness of the scrutiny on the executive and administrative arms of government. The Ombudsman has not enjoyed the same relationship that the Auditor-General has. One of the things in this bill is to style the auditor as an independent officer of the parliament. Some have suggested-and maybe they are quite right-that really these are just words, that there is in a sense no legislative substance to it. I think it is important for us to try to use words to delineate the role of the auditor and the Ombudsman from other agencies that are operated and funded from the Commonwealth public purse. If there was one suggestion I could make to the chairman of the Joint Public Accounts Committee, it would be that over time we should perhaps give even more substance and clothing to the title of the independent officer of the parliament. I have presented to the House a private member's bill, the Ombudsman Amendment Bill. I should have taken the opportunity to present an Auditor-General Amendment Bill that would have had the same effect because, when I think of who are the independent officers of the parliament, I can really only think of those two-the Auditor-General and the Ombudsman. As it is, I must say that I am pleased that the Senate committee will be bringing down a report on the bill. Hopefully, the Human Rights Subcommittee will mention some of these issues when they table their report following the Ombudsman's appearance before them. What we really need to do is define independence. I think the first thing you will run up against, whether in government or in opposition, is ministers or former ministers who say, 'It's up to the executive government to control the purse.' I have some sympathy with that view, but I think it is important to understand when controlling the purse to what extent the role of an organisation or an officer is expanded or contracted in the public interest. Whilst this bill gives the committee the responsibility of indicating to the parliament's independent officer what his or her priorities should be, do we need to be more prescriptive? Is it an issue that we need to tighten up a little? Do we need to indicate that we are funding so many audits or efficiency reviews that need to be done? You can get into problems in that, as much as you try to dimension the work, you find for unexpected reasons that you are getting deeper and deeper into issues and are requiring more manpower to get on top of them-particularly with efficiency reviews-which then takes more time. I see that the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) is at the table. For the first time, we have actually had the Auditor-General do an audit into the Family Court, and that is an interesting issue. I certainly believe that it has been a beneficial thing for the auditor to do an audit into the Family Court-not the way they make decisions or how they make decisions but how the rest of the operation is going. I am sure that, when the Auditor-General actually responded to a request of the parliament and the Attorney-General to do the audit, that was nowhere on the screen. They had no idea that report would be required, and I commend them for their actions. I understand that an even more detailed report is to be released shortly, and I must say that I am looking forward to that. If you are not careful, I think you can become a little too prescriptive in terms of trying to define, not in terms but in program terms, exactly what you are hoping the auditor will do. When the Ombudsman suffered a 30 per cent funding cut, it had a diabolical effect on people's ability to access her-and indeed on her ability to respond to people making complaints about administrative decisions. She is not able to look at all the casework normally would have, and this means that ordinary Australians are missing out on an important element of justice. If we were to look at the budget of the Ombudsman or what we should recommend she does, we should do it on program terms and target exactly the scope we would like to see her perform under. We should respond to the complaints, bearing in mind that, just like the Auditor-General, she should not always look at individual problems. Clearly, when there are systemic problems, she needs to deal with them rather than the individual cases. I do not want to take up too much more time of the parliament. This legislation has been a long time coming. It was proposed in the last government, but I do not want to make too much of that. It has already been said that the then opposition, now the government, insisted on changes in the Senate. For example, they felt it was absolutely vital that there be a two-thirds majority approval in the committee when it came to the appointment of any new Auditor-General. Of course, now it is a simple majority. I am not sure if I am not trading places as I understand it, there are nine members of the government on the committee and six members of the opposition. You could get a simple majority amongst the government, even with 50 per cent of the National Party representation defecting. But I am sure that, in the deliberations on the appointment of an independent officer of the parliament-which the committee would be charged with-any residual partisan politics that were involved would be set aside and the most meritorious person would be selected. The legislation talks about the common reporting required under organisations. I notice when you go through the list of companies with reporting requirements that most dollar of them-regrettably-have either been partially privatised or will shortly be partially privati sed. About the only one not listed in the library briefing is Australia Post. I must say that under this government I am not too sure that that may not happen in the future, although I think it would be a regrettable thing. I just want to read the amendment that that she the opposition has moved: ... ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government: (l) for its profound indifference to good financial management by delaying the consideration of these vital financial reforms until more than one year after its election; and (2) for its hypocrisy in amending in a number of aspects Labor's legislative package in the Senate when in Opposition and then retreating from these positions after the election"". Apparently, we may have a charter of budget honesty, but we do not actually have a charter of election honesty.",107
146,Mr ROSS CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"I enjoyed and benefited from the remarks of the member for Chifley (Mr Price), up until the last couple of paragraphs. He is certainly one of the most even-handed and balanced members of the opposition in his judgment, but clearly he has fallen into what I would regard as a gaping hole of hypocrisy in relation to the amendment proposed by the opposition. The question the Australian people ought to be asking is: why is it that we are considering but, the Auditor-General Bill 1996 this evening some seven years after the original handing down of the report by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which contained many of the recommendations that are being enacted tonight? That report considered in 1988 and handed down in 1989 has been some years in actually arriving. The report was entitled The Auditor-General: Ally of the people and the parliament, but somehow it never quite made it to the forefront of the consciousness of the previous government. The previous Labor government were happy to have it bubbling away in the backwaters of the committee, but somehow they were always reluctant to have it come forward for the vote. No doubt the chairman of the committee was preoccupied with secret women's business under a bridge somewhere in South Australia at the time, while the government, impervious to the level of accountability which the Australian people deserve and are fully entitled to, continued to march on spending the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars with gay abandon. The previous government seemed to be inebriated by this sense of power and importance; and the poor taxpayer down there at the bottom of the heap-the rabble-:-never really seemed to enter into the - ciousness of decision makers. -,'But under this government we have seen a changing of' the guard. We have seen a fundamentally different attitude. I would like to begin my contribution by quoting from the headland speech by the Prime Minister, Mr John Howard, entitled 'The role of government, a modem liberal approach', which was delivered in June 1995 at the Menzies Research Centre. I would like to quote a number of paragraphs from page 22 with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, which really outline the new impetus behind the passage of this bill. The Prime Minister said: No person who holds parliamentary sovereignty dear could be other than disturbed at the steady decline in both the actual power and the reputation of the parliamentary institution. Much of the responsibility for this can be fairly sheeted home to the Australia's Labor Government of the past 12 years. Reversing this trend uniquely lies within the power of the government of the day. Our party system dictates that if the executive has a will to by-pass parliamentwhich the previous executive most certainly didonly a major revolution from within the government party-which might imperil the government's very existence--can prevent that occurring. reason I wish in advance of the election of a Coalition Government to commit the next government of this country to a series of reforms which will restore greater authority, dignity and meaning to our parliamentary institutions. This bill is entirely consistent with the much broader philosophical commitment of this government to enhancing the role of this parliament. The Prime Minister went on: We will establish a completely independent Auditor General so that a fearless and authoritative surveillance of government departments can occur without intimidation from the Executive ... Under the Coalition the Auditor-General will be an officer of the Parliament. He will be funded from the Appropriation for the Parliament. These reforms will go some way towards restoring the proper role of parliament and I hope a return of some respect and trust and a greater understanding of what occurs inside Parliament House. The member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, has ably outlined some of the more detailed provisions of the bill. I wish to go back to some of the first principles which underline the philosophy behind this legislation. By way of contrast, the French philosopher Proudhon was the one who said that 'private property is theft'. This is the guiding thought behind the whole socialist philosophy which suggests that individuals are under some sort of moral obligation to forfeit their income, the fruit of their labours, for some concept of the social good. It is not a tradition which I belong to. My own view is that a man is entitled to the fruit of his labour and that it is the men and women in the cities and towns of this country, the breadwinners of Australian families, who are better placed than the government, than the state, to make decisions about the best use of the income which they generate. I belong to that philosophy which is guided by the eighth and 10th Commandments of the Jews which are 'Thou shalt not steal' and 'Thou shalt not covet that which is thy neighbour's' . Upon these foundation stones of private property we have built a quality of life throughout the developed world which has For that never before been witnessed in history. On that basis, the taxpayer has not only the right but, in my view, the duty to deprive the state of whatever revenue is not strictly entitled to according to law. As for the state, it must discharge an onerous balance of proof. It must show not only that moneys were spent for the purposes for which the parliament authorised their expenditure but also that those purposes involved a greater public good than that which would have been achieved if the revenue had been left in the hands of those private citizens who generated it. When you consider that the state-broadly speaking, the Commonwealth-has its hands in the pockets and wallets of Australian people to the tune of $115 billion a year, one might be excused for feeling that excessive and oppressive taxation is much closer to theft than is private property. In that regard, I speak today on behalf of the many small business operators in my electorate of Parramatta who are struggling under the weight of taxation. I speak for Mr Tony Wehbe, who serves me kebabs from his cafe right opposite my office in Church Street. You will find Tony opening early in the mornings to catch the passing commuter traffic, serving fast food throughout the day, working behind the counter in front of the grill in temperatures of about 45 or 50 degrees, sweat pouring off the brow, still in there at 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock at night cleaning the fat off the grill and wiping down the tables and counters. I submit to you that we as a government had better have a pretty compelling reason to reach into the till with the frequency with which we do. This bilI, fundamentally, is about giving the Tony Wehbes of this world some reassurance that the moneys expended by the state are being expended for proper purposes. It is a bill which restores the parliament to its place at the centre of probity and accountability of the executive. As we look back through history, we can see that our Westminster tradition has constantly worked to preserve the place of the parliament in the broad scheme of the three tiers of the judicature, the executive and the legislature. I look back to Alfred the Great as an inspirational example who, in the introduction of his witan, or council of wise men, provided the first adumbration of this parliament---of the idea that the executive does not govern in a vacuum but governs with the acquiescence, with the advice and with the consideration of the people. We must never lose sight of the people, without whose revenue we would have no capacity to function as a government. I had the pleasure just this evening of having dinner with Sir Peter Lawler, who was decorated for his extraordinary contribution to public life in this country, in the city of Canberra. He remarked over dinner that Ben Chifley and R.G. Menzies both shared the characteristic of having a deep respect for the tax dollar contributed by ordinary Australian citizens. Likewise, as we look at the principle of the independence of the legislature and the commitment of this government to the preservation of the parliament, I note the way in which the Speaker was dragged to his chair at the opening of parliament by the members for La Trobe (Mr Charles) and Lyne (Mr Vaile). This brings to our recollection the example of Charles I, who stormed into the House of Commons and demanded of Speaker Lenthall the five members of the parliament who were resisting overarching initiatives of the executive, to which the Speaker responded: Your Majesty I have only eyt.ts to see and ears to hear as this house directs me. That was an historic moment, a watershed in carving out the boundaries of the power, of the independence, of the autonomy of the parliament. This bill falls very much in that tradition. Its principal purposes are to re-establish the Office of the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia as a statutory authority answerable not to the executive but to the parliament. It clarifies and broadens the powers and authority of the Auditor-General and it entrusts to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts the additional role of the audit committee of the Commonwealth parliament. It also governs the process of appointment and safeguards the removal of the Auditor-General. In total, it represents a fairly substantial shift in power from the executive back to the parliament. In that regard, it is kind of an echo of the bill which was introduced into the parliament of the United Kingdom in 1983 entitled Parliamentary Control of Expenditure Bill. The then Leader of the House, the Hon. Norman St John Stevas, said: It is no exaggeration to say that this Bill raises a constitutional issue of major ance. For 700 years the power of Parliament has rested on one thing above all others-its control of the granting and spending of public money. I emphasise that the government has no money of its own. Whatever money it possesses comes with the acquiescence, with the support of and in the gift of the Australian people. He continues: It was over that principle that the civil war was fought. It was over that principle that the House of Lords was deprived of many of its powers in 1910 and it is that principle which has led to the Bill. And, indeed, this bill before the parliament today. He continues: it .is. an intrinsic part of those reforms I had the - D-ur to, introduce as Leader of the House in the - ly da--.?f the present Government. But, most importantly, he says: They were designed to shift the balance of power away from the bureaucracy of Whitehall, back to the elected representatives of the people at Westminster. That is the reason I have great pleasure in rising to support this bill. It represents a very substantial strengthening of the power of the people. What we see happening is something which is very unusual. So often Canberra has this rapacious appetite for power and for revenue, but in this instance we are seeing the executive government taking a step back and deliberately strengthening the hand which has been entrusted with its probity, with its accountability, with a searching scrutiny of expenditure by the executive. In that regard it is an unusual piece of legislation. It echoes a statement made by an American politician. It was once said that one ought not to judge the quality of an idea by reference to the individuals who subscribe to it. That may be a necessary caveat to the remark attributed to the 1964 US presidential aspirant who lost the subsequent election to LBJ by, I understand, the largest margin in American political history. That aspirant was Barry Goldwater. He wrote in 1959, before his ill-fated run for President, that the American people should: . .. entrust the conduct of our affairs to men who understand that their first duty as public officials is to divest themselves of the power they have been and first class import- given. That is the whole spirit and character of this piece of legislation. It is about the executive divesting itself of its arbitrary powers. It is about the submission of the executive to the Australian people through the parliament in the form of a much higher level of executive accountability. It provides for audits of various kinds. It strengthens the hand of the audit office and of the Auditor-General. It provides for proper purpose audits which examine whether or not expenditures have been within the ambit of a strict parliamentary authorisation, for probity audits which look at the question of whether expenditure benefits the community rather than the party in power and for efficiency audits which seek to ensure that the funds themselves are well spent. In each instance the Howard coalition government is deliberately strengthening the hand of one of its potential principal critics, in the full knowledge that that extension of power may provide a source of embarrassment to the government at some stage in the future. It reflects a commitment in this government and a belief that fostering a culture of probity is, in the long term, not only good politics but good government. For those reasons I commend the bill to the House. It is consistent with the commitment of the Prime Minister. At the conclusion of the sittings last week, we heard about the extraordinary number of questions which had been answered in the House since this government came to power and the fact that the Prime Minister had been in the chamber for every single question time-except for the two instances when he was not in Australiasince coming to government. That reflects the commitment of the Prime Minister to a full time parliament-the parliament is not some sort of an irritant on the back of the executive. It reflects the Prime Minister's and the government's commitment to a truly accountable executive. It is not as if the parliament is there as something that has to be gone through which gets in the way of the real business of governing. It is an example of the fulfilment of the Prime Minister's commitment prior to the election to re-elevate the parliament and restore it to its place as the engine of accountability and as the most direct link back to the Australian people to ensure that their hard-earned tax dollars are expended for the purposes authorised by this parliament and in the most efficient manner possible.",110
147,Mr GRIFFIN,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"I take it from the contribution of the previous speaker, the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron), in particular that we are considering this matter as one that can range far and wide and beyond the particular content of the Auditor-General Bill and cognate bills. As Deputy Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and someone who was involved in two of the three reports which relate to these matters, I found a range of issues broached by the member for Parramatta were not part of the consideration that my committee made in relation to these bills and issues. On that basis, for a start, him up on a couple of the points he made and then go on to some other issues. The bills before the House tonight-there are four of them-have the support of the opposition. There is an amendment, but essentially they have our support. They have support for a very good reason: essentially they are our bills. There have been only minor adjustments made by the government to the bills that were out there over the last couple of years and certainly around the time the Prime Minister made his headland speech which the member for Parramatta quoted from so extensively. There are some questions here. There is also a little bit of hypocrisy. When looking at the previous speaker's contribution, the fact that questions are not answered in question time is probably another issue that should be raised. The question of ministerial codes of conduct and how they can be flouted and treated like something out of Mission: Impossible is another issue. The fact is that these bills are essentially Labor Party legislation, with some minor amendments. I will tum to a couple of issues for a start to give you an idea of some of the other aspects of the government's hypocrisy here. For example, there is quite a history to the issue of the appointment of the Auditor General, and it is an important one, because all members of the chamber would agree that the Auditor-General ought to be independent and ought to be seen to be independent. The major changes in this bill are essentially-and this has been said by members of the then opposition who are now in governmentsymbolic. The symbolism is important. I agree that this is something that we should be doing, but it is largely symbolic. When we go into the history of what has been happening around these bills and the considerations that have occurred-there is quite a history there-we find, for example, that in report 331 from the Public Accounts Committee there was a recommendation that the minister should seek the approval of the the Leader of the Opposition or his/her nominee, the JCPA and an Audit Committee of Parliament. That was partially accepted by my government at that time-but with consultaI will take tion, no powers of veto. The interesting thing' is that amendments were made to that bill when it got to the Senate. For example, in schedule 1, part 2, on page 16, it said: ... a person is not to be appointed as the Auditor General until: (a) a proposal that the person be appointed has been referred to the JCPAA under Section 8A of the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 and the proposed recommendation has obtained the approval of at least a two-thirds majority of the JCPAA That two-thirds majority in effect means a veto. That was the now government's position in relation to this issue when this bill was before the Senate. Following on from that, the bills were withdrawn. Following the proroguing of parliament, the government reintroduced them and the Public Accounts Committee, under report 346, came down with a recommendation that: The Audit Committee of Parliament should approve, by a three-quarters majority, the ap-ointment of the Auditor-General and conduct public confirmation hearings. The interesting thing is that, when we look at the bill today, it says: The Minister must refer recommendation for appointment of Auditor-General to the JCPAA for its approvala simple majority. Essentially, we had a position where the JCPA and the Sena.te, at the behest of the current government pnor to the last election, was talking about a veto and broad consensus approval whereas the government is now talking about a simple majority. The JCPA is a very constructive committee of the parliament, and I am proU? - o be deputy chair of it, but it has a maJo-lty of government members. From our. pomt of view the key issue there was havmg a veto or a - itllation where whoever was appointed .-aS bn,adlysupported. I bring no reflection .YP.dit'rec-nt Auditors-General because, cer'-y--i¥ tittle 'of their, appointments, t-eir - t?<>iJ)trnents were welcomed, but there IS .a fUndamental' change here. The change IS sign'ificant because it says something about this government's stated positions. Its position was that there should be a veto where all major components of the parliament agree. But now we see that commitment counts for naught. Another issue which I think was quite significant was the question of conducting performance audits of a Commonw-alth authority, that is, a government busmess enterprise or any of its subsidiaries: The JCPA's position was very much that thiS was a good idea and certainly that it is something that the government should embrace. Senate amendments, again sponsored by the current government, were successful to the earlier bills along those lines. The circumstances were then that report 346 from the JCPA fired on with the same recommendation. But here we go again! When we go to the provisions of the bill, the fact is that the Auditor-General may conduct a performance audit of a GBE, or of any of its subsidiaries, if the responsible minister, the Minister for Finance, or the JCPAA requests the audit. That is quite a different position from the likely operation of this bill. The situation is the control being removed from what was proposed to the Auditor-General to a situation where it has to be by recommendation following through from either the minister or the JCPA, both organs which, as I said earlier about the JCPA, have a government majority. The circumstances, as you see them in some of these issues, are very different. We have had a position where the current government has changed its mind on some key issues. I know, from what I have seen of some government members who have been involved in this process right the way through, that th.ey have some difficulty in coming to terms with it. Certainly it has been followed by some embarrassed silences in some meetings that I have been involved in around the question of this legislation in recent times. It does raise an issue about the question of credibility in this government. It is one thing to herald and to parrot on about the fact that this is a new broom, a new approach, and that there are major changes occurring in the operati-n of this place, but when we look at the detail we can see some fairly skilful window dressing. For example, the ministerial code of conduct was heralded and trumpeted by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) as a significant break with the past: here was a move forward in standards in this place, in standards of executive government. But what did we see happen? As minister after minister was tripped up and otherwise found wanting in their own personal behaviour and the institution of their duties, that code was weakened. It was weakened by the words of the Prime Minister himself. It went from being a bold new blueprint for the future-a Star Trek ?o-u­ ment-to a situation where it was very Similar to the position of the previous government, to a situation where it was recommendatory rather than compulsory, to a situation where, . 'You've already got two ministers; you're not getting any more.' I congratulate the Prime Minister on the fact that so many more questions being asked in question time. The one thing I would l-ke is a few more answers. We are not gettmg answers on this side of the House. We sure are getting a chance to ask a few questions, but we are not getting any answers. This legislation is supported by both sides of the House because it is good legislation. Essentially, it leads to a much needed revamping of the question of the Auditor General and the question of financial and regulatory frameworks in relation to Commonwealth enterprises. It is long overdue and is something that the parliament should broadly support. I know that the view within the audit office, and also within senior management in government departments, is that this is a significant reform, that it should go ahead post haste. Hence I have great pleasure in supporting it here in this House today. I could go on further, but I do not think I will quote from Alexander the Great, St John the Righteous, Donald Duck or Mickey Mouse. I might just leave it to roughly considering the question of the bill at hand, a bill which I am proud to support. I am pleased to be part of the JCPA, which has had a very constructive role in making these bills even better. I am happy to see it coming before this House and I wish it a speedy carriage. I will finish on one other note which again raises the question of accountability, of this new broom. The central issue which relates to the question of the role of the Auditor-General and the capacity for the Auditor-General to discharge his duties is that of funding. If you do not have the money to employ enough auditors, you are not in a situation where you can audit government departments properly and ensure the value for money which was mentioned by the previous speaker, although I am quite sure he has not read the bills. Another issue relates to the question of the JCPA which, under this legislation, will become the JCPAA because it will take on the role of the Audit Committee of Parliament. This committee is an incredibly crucial committee of the parliament in the role it performs, but again the question of funding is crucial to the performance of its duties. This government, for all its talk about accountabiliAuthorities ty to parliament, has severely cut back on resources to parliamentary committees since it became the government. This is not only in this area, but right across the board. As members would know, if you do not have the research resources available to your committees, you will not be able to perform your duties as well as you would like. That has implications for the scrutiny of government legislation, it has implications for the scrutiny of government action that is nonlegislative and it has important implications for the operation of this parliament both in its role of performing a review of what is done by the executive and as an organ to recommend changes to the executive. The JCPA will have an increased role, a role of even greater importance in the operation of this place, but it will be in circumstances where at this stage there is no increase in resources. That is not good enough. The government has recently, for example, with taxation legislation, forwarded these on to the committee for consideration. I am quite supportive of that. I am not supportive of the situation where drastically reduced time frames are put forward in getting reports back and the situation where there is a limited amount of resources-and getting smaller-in the coverage of those sorts of issues, which all have implications for the effective operation of those committees and the roles that they play. That again relates to that question of the audit office. The fact is the audit office has a very important, independent and symbolic role, which is improved by this legislation. I support that symbolism. The real issue is the question of resources to perform its duties, and on those issues we are still awaiting the government's response in ensuring those resources are available to properly perform those sorts of activities. I commend the bills to the House and I wish them a speedy passage.",114
148,Mr HAWKER,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"I am very keen to join in this debate on these four bills: the Auditor-General Bill 1996, the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1996, the Commonwealth and Companies Bill 1996 and the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1996. I was somewhat mystified by the member for Bruce (Mr Griffin) when he started to complain about question time in this parliament. If there is one thing this government ought to be praised for it is the accountability that it has brought to question time. It really is quite a contrast when you look at the previous government, of which he was a member, and when you remember how difficult it was to even get the former Prime Minister to come into the chamber, let alone answer questions. We had this ludicrous situation where the part-time Prime Minister and members of the front-bench were fronting for only half the time the parliament was sitting and, at the same time, the number of questions that they were prepared to answer was becoming progressively fewer. I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on setting the record, as he points out, for letting 20 questions get up each That is the best performance we have seen the parliament for 20 years. I think that something that this govermpent ought to be c,on,Fatula-d for rather than being criticised, asjhe previous member did in his tion to this debate. It is important to' see that these bills modernise some of the controls over Commonwealth finances and I think, as we move along, that is an important development. It is important to see that they are very much involved in modernising the controls over businesses owned or operated by the Commonwealth. Turning to the Auditor-General Bill, it is indeed, as the member for Bruce said in his speech, similar to one that was the previous government. But the reason it was held up was that the then government, the Labor government, rejected some opposisomething tion amendments and it lapsed because of election. It is important to remember that amendments that were to have been put forward by the opposition in the previous parliament would have allowed the parliament to have a greater say in the appointment the Auditor-General. They would have also allowed the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of government business enterprises and allowed the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to act as an Audit Committee of Parliament. This bill on audit amendment acts on our commitment to establish a completely independent Auditor-General, and that is very much in contrast to the previous government. Who could forget the way that the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, got in such a rage over the Australian National Audit Office's powers to conduct an efficiency audit of the National Media Liaison Service, otherwise known as aNiMaLS, which was employed by the Labor Party as its method of instituting an almost Goebbels type attack on the opposition of the day? Likewise, who could forget the role that the audit office played in the sports rorts affair, which led to the demise of the then minister, Ros Kelly. Who could forget-we still have day. the evidence before us today-the way that in the previous government used the audit office is to assist it in its finances with Centenary House, where it pushed the audit office into a rental scheme that is still an embarrassment contributo the Commonwealth today? The Auditor-General Bill provides for the re-establishment of the Office of Auditor General under the proposed new accountability regime. It more clearly defines the roles and powers of the Auditor-General and it strengthens the function of the current office beyond the level of current laws and, at the same time, protects the office from interference from the executive or the parliament by providing a statutory safeguard in line with the government's commitment to confer genuine functional independence on the introduced by Auditor-General. To put it another way, the bill re-creates the audit office as an independent statutory body, that I believe all Australians would the normally expect-unfortunately they did not the always get it from the previous government, but certainly they are getting it from this government. Together with the transitional provisions of the bill, it provides for a wider of role for the parliament in selecting the Auditor-General through what will be the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit as well as monitoring the performance of the Auditor-General and the audit office. In addition, it re-establishes the parliament's auditor of the Australian National Audit Office as the Office of Independent Auditor. I pay tribute to the fact that many of these provisions arise from the work of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. In fact, in 1988, the JCPA inquiry into the operations of the Auditor-General produced the report headed The Auditor-General: ally of the people and parliament, in which it recommended major changes to the Auditor General's operations, particularly that the Audit Act be replaced with more modem legislation. It may have taken nine years, but this government has acted on that recommendation. The government has accepted the joint committee's recommendation that it assume the additional role of Audit Committee of the Parliament. Changes to the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 to that effect are included in the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1996 and are complemented by provisions in the Auditor-General Bill. The bill also details the processes of appointment and conditions of the office. It also outlines that, as a statutory office holder, the Auditor-General will continue to be appointed by the Governor General and that this appointment be on the recommendation of the appropriate minister. The administrative arrangements and orders are expected to continue to specify that the Prime Minister will be the appropriate minister. Under the Auditor-General Bill, the minister must seek the JCPA's endorsement of the proposal prior to advising the Governor General of the proposed appointee. The parliament, through the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, will have the right to veto over the government's choice of the Auditor General. Contrary to what the previous speaker, the member for Bruce, has said, this does give the parliament a say through its veto rights in the appointment of the Auditor-General-which, I think all honourable members would agree, shows that this government does recognise the important role that the parliament plays, not just the government, in ensuring that the Auditor-General is someone who is truly independent. At the same time, the safeguards are maintained for the removal of the Auditor-General by the Governor General-a petition of both houses of parliament through the same session being the necessary requirement. Again, that is a very important safeguard. This bill will cement the Auditor-General's mandate in legislation. Under existing arrangements, the Auditor-General's mandate was partly derived from legislation and partly from government policy. The Auditor-General will now have the mandate to audit financial statements of all government bodies and it will also be able to conduct performance audits on them. Under the bill, the Auditor-General will conduct performance audits on government business enterprises only if it is requested to do so by the parliament or by the minister. Of course, it is important that they are subject to accountability, at the same time recognising the importance that a government business enterprise is required to pursue maximum market performance. It is also significant to note that, if a body were a partially privati sed Commonwealth company, it would not be subjected to a performance audit. And the reason for this would be simply that such a decision would be taken in consideration of the interests of private shareholders, recognising that such a report would receive publicity which could be detrimental to shareholders. In order to avoid this, the Auditor-General's role in such circumstances will be as the mandated external auditor of their financial statements. It is also significant to note that the bill will permit the Auditor-General to enter into an arrangement with any person or body to conduct financial statements audits or performance audits for them and to provide them with services of a kind that are normally performed by auditors. This provision would be at the discretion of the Auditor-General and it would occur only if it fell within the Commonwealth's constitutional power to do so and the Auditor-General considered that there was a benefit to the Commonwealth. In effect, this would mean that under the bill the audit office would be the statutory authority with the exclusive functional responsibility of the Auditor-General, and this would then demonstrate the government's commitment to the independence of the Auditor General. For the Auditor-General to fulfil his obligations to the parliament, the bill would allow the Auditor-General and authorised officials full access to information and documents needed to perform the role. It is important to note that these powers are accompanied by strong secrecy and penalty provisions for any person performing this role. Again, that does provide the sorts of safeguards that people would expect under such a bill, and the government is very keen to ensure that we continue to provide those sorts of safeguards. The bill re-establishes the office of an Independ-nt Auditor, and this would be the par:liament's auditor as part of the audit offic.e. But this office would mirror the role o(theAuditor-General in relation to the Coimrionwealth. Clearly, this Independent Auditor would be a part-time statutory officer appointed in much the same way as the Auditor-General. It would mean that the appointment would be made by the Governor General on the advice of the appropriate minister. As I said earlier, this would be expected to be the Prime Minister in this case. Again, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts would have the same right of veto over the government's choice of nominee. Clearly, this bill provides the Auditor General with a great deal of freedom to get on with his task and at the same time it offers the Auditor-General an excellent statutory environment for performing the role required and expected of the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth. An area in which I have a particular interest is Audit Report No.6, which was conducted by the Australian National Audit Office. It was looking into the Commonwealth guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort. This report was tabled in September last year and has since been referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, which I have the honour to chair. I think this report outlines in one way just the sheer scale of the task that the audit office often has to undertake. Quite significantly, in this report the office found that most portfolio departments were unable to provide timely advice regarding their exposure to the instruments listed-in other words, looking at the level of Commonwealth guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort. I think all Australians would be a little bit disturbed to find that this accountability was not as great as we would like to see. This report showed as a result of the audit census that some of the departments were slow to come in with their reports and, when they did, there was often an absence of adequate records on the level of exposure of the Commonwealth to these risks. What was rather disturbing to note was that the audit felt it was unable to provide a definitive statement of overall Commonwealth exposures. It is significant to note that the audit office has estimated the level of Commonwealth exposures in the departments to be of the order of $222 billion. I just repeat that: two hundred and twenty-two thousand million dollars. Of course, this does not include many exposures on which it is very difficult to put a dollar value. While I do not wish to unnecessarily concern people, it is a significant amount of money. Nonetheless, it is well known that in the vast majority of these guarantees, indemnities, letters of comfort and so on the risk is very, very low. But it is a very significant amount of money. The audit office in its report to the committee actually showed that there are a number of exposures there which really do raise very serious questions about the operation of some departments, particularly under the previous government. One such case is the indemnity, which the Commonwealth still carries, out of the sale of Aussat to Optus. When Aussat was sold for $800 million, of which $500 million was paid up front, there was also found to be a series of promissory notes issued for payment in subsequent years. These promissory notes represent bearer securities, but when it came time for the surrender, it was found that the relevant department no longer had them. So, in order to cover this, the Commonwealth has had to carry an indemnity issued to Optus so they could guarantee the payment. In other words, what this means is that if these notes happen to tum up at some time in the future, the Commonwealth has a liability of $300 million. I would have thought that most Australians would be rather disturbed to learn just that one example of the sorts of indemnities that the taxpayers, in the end, could be held liable for, should that risk be realised. It was also interesting to note that the audit office, in looking for the number of indemnities, guarantees and letters of fied 144,000 instruments in relation to thisnot an insignificant amount-which shows, I think, the significance of the amount of guarantees that the Commonwealth is bound to. Mr Deputy Speaker, there are a number of other things I would like to get on to, but as time seems to be running short",116
149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,I am sure you are right.,120
150,Mr HAWKER,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,I would like to just say that I have much pleasure in supporting these bills and I am sure they will get a speedy passage through the parliament.,120
151,Mr VAILE,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"I certainly welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on these bills. They have had a'bit of a chequered career over the last four years. There was an initial introduction of similar bills by the previous government which came through the parliament and were referred by the previous Minister for Finance to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, of which I have been a member. In the previous parliament we put together report No. 331, an advisory report on the Financial Management and Accountability Bill, the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill and the Auditor-General Bill. Those bills subsequently lapsed with the proroguing of the parliament, after going through the House of Representatives and passing through the Senate with an amendment that the House of Representatives was not prepared to accept. So I support these bills before the House tonight and want to congratulate the government and the minister on putting together a fairly wide-reaching package of reform as far as the finances of the Commonwealth are concerned. These bills replace the Audit Act of 1901, bring the financial management of the Commonwealth into the 1990s and prepare for the Commonwealth to go into the next century. Probably most important of all, and the area on which there has been the most public attention with regard to these bills, has been the role of the Auditor-General. The JCPA presented two reports on the Auditor-General, No. 296 and No. 346, the establishment of the position of Auditor-General as an independent officer of the parliament being a recommendacomfort, identi- tion in the latter. It was fairly widely held that, after the activities of the previous government, the then Auditor-General did not have any control over the financial management of his office. I think the previous speaker, the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), alluded to the establishment of the Auditor-General in Centenary House and the exorbitant rent that was being paid. The Auditor-General of the day, Mr Taylor, had no control over that. The JCPA of the day recommended that the Auditor-General have more autonomy over the budget of his department. But I note in this bill the recommendation has been picked up to give the Auditor General more independence, not only in name but more explicitly by being an independent officer of the parliament. I also note that in both reports on both pieces of legislation, in the previous parliament and this one, the JCPA recommended that the Auditor-General Bill should provide that the Auditor-General be appointed as the auditor of all Commonwealth entities and the Auditor-General has a general mandate to initiate the full range of audits in relation to all Commonwealth entities, including performance audits of GBEs, a recommendation that, as a member of the Joint Public Accounts Committee in both the 37th Parliament and the 38th Parliament, I supported. I note that the previous government was reluctant to pick up that recommendation, but in this bill it has been picked up to the extent that it provides for GBEs, both authorities and companies. The Auditor-General may only conduct a performance audit where the Minister for Finance or the responsible minister, or the JCPAA, requests such an audit. So that has been broadened from where it used to be and that is welcome. I also welcome the move by the government to establish an audit committee of the parliament as one of the functions of the JCPA. It will now be known as the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. The measures that we are supporting this evening are very important for the ongoing responsible financial management of the Commonwealth accounts and reflect the way that the Commonwealth conducts its business with Commonwealth corporations and entities, as well as authorities. These bills reflect that. There is also the perception in the community that we need to see more autonomy and independence as far as the Auditor-General is concerned, and his closer connection with the parliament rather than with the executive and that there be less control over the Auditor-ra}!by the executive than there is by the pHrIillment; I commend the bills to the House. I certainly ath not prepared to support the amendment that has been put forward by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). The amendment is a pious one. The opposition, then the government, had the opportunity to negotiate these bills through the House in the previous parliament. They did not succeed in doing that. The current Minister for Finance has done a good job in putting this package together to take the Commonwealth's operations in this area through to the next century. I commend the bills to the House.",120
152,Mr FAHEY,COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES,"I thank members on both sides of the House for their contributions and their support of the bills in their entirety. These bills are very important to provide the necessary formal machinery for the Commonwealth to make an orderly transition from its current ageing and inadequate financial framework. I note that opposition members in their contributions here this evening focused upon the length of time that it has taken the coalition to re-present these bills to the parliament. It is important to say very briefly that these bills were considered very carefully upon our taking government. We reassessed the bills on their merit, and I did this particularly in my role as Minister for Finance. The government has a very high regard for good financial management and, in fact, we did not unnecessarily delay the reintroduction of these bills. The bulk of the government's changes to the bills was in the Auditor-General Bill in which we sought further advice from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which recommended to the government several suggestions for enhancing the independence of the Auditor-General. The majority of these suggestions have been drafted into the Auditor-General Bill as it is now before us. The bill is now a reflection of a fully functionally independent Auditor General in both symbolic and practical ways beyond that which was available under the current laws. With that aside, I again commend the bills to the House. I thank the opposition for its support. I once again acknowledge and appreciate the considerable amount of work undertaken by all sides over a number of years. I particularly commend Mr Maurice Kennedy. I thank the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) as chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the work that the committee has done in these very important proposals presented in the bills.

153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Nehl)Order! It being slightly past 10.30 p.m.. I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Kurri Corridor Mr FITZGmBON (Hunter) (10.31 p.m.)I am delighted to see that the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) is in the chamber tonight while I discuss this issue. This issue is deserving of his support. I noticed that in an adjournment speech last week the member for Paterson bleated about an intersection in his electorate, the problems of which would be overcome entirely if he would only support me on this proposition. I am referring to a road project which links the F3 freeway and a point of the New England Highway just north of Branxton, which is in my electorate. The Kurri Corridor, as it is known, if constructed would provide enormous benefits to my electorate, the electorate of Paterson and many other electorates beyond those. The $220 million project is certainly deserving of the support of all members serving in this House. This would relieve the Cessnock, Newcastle and Maitland councils of problems associated with the presence of national highway traffic. The main roads in the township of Cessnock, including those in the central business district, have effectively been a de facto national highway since Easter 1988. The proportion of national highway traffic which does not short cut-rough Cessnock is a nightmare for resideIlts living on Weekley's Drive, Beresfield, and residents of Maitland East and Maitland West. Those residents attempt to access the national highway via the Chelmsford Drive intersection, which the member for Paterson referred to during his adjournment speech last week. The townships of Lochinvar, Greta and Branxton would all receive relief from national highway traffic as a result of the construction of the Kurri Corridor. The new found proximity of the Upper Hunter, with all its coal and agricultural product, to Sydney and the port of Newcastle would provide an enormous boost to that part of my electorate. What are the chances of the Kurri Corridor being constructed? What are the odds following the coalition's decision to cut $622 million from the national highway budget over the next four years? Mr Speaker, I remind you that this is a cut to a budget which is of the order of $840 million a year. We are talking about a very significant cut. My fear is that the odds are about one million to one. It is a very tragic decision for all the reasons I have already outlined. It is a tragic decision because of the loss of benefits which the residents in the Paterson electorate would have gained from the construction of the Kurri Corridor. The failure of the Howard government to commit itself to the Kurri Corridor is causing more immediate concerns. People living along the path of the road link are in limbo. Mr Bob Baldwin-What about the former government?",122
154,Mr FITZGIBBON,ADJOURNMENT,"The former government was committed to it. People like Keith Thomas on Cessnock Road, Branxton, Valda MCCloughlin of Lovedale and John Pyne and others living on Avery Lane, Buchanan, are in limbo. They do not know whether in the next five years or so a freeway will run over the ground on which their houses now stand. They cannot sell their homes or their properties. Mr Speaker, would you or the member for Paterson buy a property with such an extensive proposal hanging over its head? I think not. In my view, these people should be effectively compensated from the EIS stage of the development of the highway. The RTA would not lose any money because if the freeway did not proceed they could resell the properties and recoup their money. The dilemmas do not end there. Cessnock council's legal advice indicated that whenever it is considering a development application it must consider the implications of the freeway on the development and the effects of the development on the freeway. The council's problems do not end there. The council is desperate to refurbish its struggling central business district but it cannot properly do so because of the existence of that heavy vehicle traffic that uses the main street of Cessnock as a de facto national highway. It cannot attract state government funding for a simple bypass while the Kurri Corridor hangs over its head. It is a real catch 22 situation for Cessnock council. What Cessnock council and the people of my community need is an unequivocal statement from the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) as to whether or not he supports this project. I support the project and I will continue to support the project. (Time expired) Culunga Community School",123
155,Mr RANDALL,ADJOURNMENT,"Swan) (10.36 p.m.)Earlier today, 1 reported in the grievance debate that an Aboriginal community school called Culunga has serious concerns relating to its accountability in educational terms and its many forms of maladministration. This school is largely funded by DEETY A moneys hence the Commonwealth has a great interest in the functioning of this school. 1 would like to point out one of the areas concern. The DEETY A funds are currently also used for homework classes. These homework classes cost something like $35 an hour and are provided after school. I am reliably informed that these funds are not used for homework classes. A BBQ is put on and the rest of the kids roam around the school. The people who are supposed to be teaching do not teach. Even more seriously, one of the people who was to receive these homework class moneys was in gaol at the time. He was in gaol for some time while he was still being paid the funds to teach homework classes after school. Other concerns, which 1 gave a great history of this afternoon, are that the family members of the board pay each other in cash, for which there is, apparently, also no accountability. 29 January 1997, nothing had changed. The school coordinator asked the chairperson of the board, who just happens to be her sister, for a cash advance. She said that she had ron out of money over the Christmas break. She was told, 'I will go and check.' Ten minutes later she was told, 'Yes, you can have it; try and pay it back in December 1997.' Earlier today 1 also referred to two documents. One was the letter from the school principal to the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations and another was the letter from the Australian Government Solicitor, which did an audit into the school. 1 seek leave to table those documents. Leave granted.",124
156,Mr RANDALL,ADJOURNMENT,"Funds of ASSPA, which stands for Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness, are also under scrutiny at this school. There are many allegations that these funds are not being spent on the Aboriginal students there and that in fact funds are being siphoned off in a rather dubious manner. For these reasons and many others that I alluded to today, I call for an independent inquiry into the running and administration of this school, in particular in relation to its funds and the quality of education it provides, so that the children of this school can get a fair go. They are at a special Aboriginal of school to get a special Aboriginal program, and the funds are not going where they are designed to go. Whether this inquiry is initiated through the many committees of this parliament or is determined independently in another forum, I would hope that the minister would take that request on board. There are allegations of gross impropriety regarding the funding of this school in particular. Another serious allegation is that as of last Friday, the remaining two Aboriginal teachers at this school were sacked; they were given notice. These were the two teachers who have spoken out. It seems rather unusual to me that the two remaining very well qualified Aboriginal teachers who have come forward and spoken out are now being told that their services will not be required in six weeks On time. That would leave the school with very few pupils and a skeleton staff to try to run the school. If the school is going to be run on a skeleton staff with a handful of students, why should the school remain open when there are more appropriate schools locally? There is another Aboriginal school up the road run by Robert Bropho; there are Aboriginal programs in surrounding high schools and primary schools where the needs of the Aboriginal children are being met. I call on the minister and all those who are responsible to conduct an inquiry into the running of this school forthwith. Belmont Wetlands  p.m.)-The matter I want to raise is about Belmont wetlands in my electorate. I have raised this matter in the House on a number of previous occasions and I will continue to do so. Between Belmont and Redhead in my electorate there was once a unique coastal wetland. That was until BHP gained control of the surface rights of the land in the 1960s. BBHP-Before BHP-the wetlands, the high sand dune systems backing Nine Mile Beach, the continuous coastal wetland system, collected the run-off from the Dudley, Whitebridge, Charlestown, Gateshead and Tingira Heights ridges and valleys. It filtered down through creeks and ponds into the only coastal wetlands system in our region. The 1892 maps showed that some of the water reached the sea by a creek at the northern end of Nine Mile Beach and some eventually reached Lake Macquarie via Belmont Lagoon and various connecting marshlands. The Australian Army map of 1941 shows the coastal dune system in the area in all its glory, with dune heights ranging from 15 feet along the back of the beach to a hundred feet further inland. The area was a unique coastal dune wetlands system, the jungle like conditions of which were utilised by the Australian Army to train troops for service in the Pacific during World War II. BHP has presided over the devastation of this once beautiful strip of coastal wetlands and dunes. First they mined the coal from beneath at Lambton B and John Darling collieries, which are now both closed. In the 1960s the sand dunes were mined for minerals. Up to this day sand has been continued to be removed and sold from what was once a beautiful section of Australia's coastline. Where the hundred feet sand dunes stood the level is now flat. The fringes of the area are used as a rubbish dump by numerous people. People drive through there and see the rubbish on the edge and think, 'This is rubbish land.' They would never go inside behind the rubbish to see what was once inside. The reaction of BHP has been to mount the feeble excuse that now that the area has been devastated and despoiled, it should be rezoned to enable residential development and some wetlands refurbishment to take place. This would enable BHP to make a limited restoration of some wetlands and to construct some 1,400 homes in a fragile, sensitive, low lying area between the east side of Lake Macquarie and the sea. It would create a huge windfall profit for BHP-in fact, a reward for its supervision of wanton destruction of a precious piece of our coastline. A local government study has been carried out. Public responses were invited by Lake Macquarie City Council. In my view these public responses and concerns have been treated, in the main, in a cavalier and unprofessional manner by council officers. When one reads through them one cannot help but form the conclusion that the council officers see their role as being dedicated to ensuring that BHP's application gets through. No attempt has been made to present an alternative utilisation of that coastal wetlands system and the council itself appears to be compliant towards BHP. In fact, some councillors are in awe of, even intimidated by, BHP. Strangest of all strangeness, the beach is owned by BHP. I cannot discover how BHP came to own nine miles of Australia's beach, but they own the beach. Some of the councillors say to me, 'Don't make too much noise, because they may not give us the beach back.' The beach is riven by undertows. It is a very dangerous beach on which to swim; it is little utilised. It is a good fishing beach with gutters but a very dangerous area for swimming. So my response has been to invite BHP to try to fence off the beach. If you want the beach, put a barbed wire fence around it like you did during the war when it was a defence system. But the company has presided over the destruction of one of our most beautiful areas of coastline. Having made coal profits, beach mineral royalties, sandmining royalties and income from the area, it now asks for more. Suddenly, another arm of BHP, BHP Titanium Minerals Pty Ltd, has lodged an exploration notice for heavy minerals over the same area. I had hoped that BHP would accept a responsible attitude towards this and hand that land, or lease it, back to public ownership so it could be redeveloped over time for future Australians. It has the potential to become a beautiful coastal wetlands system again, a system of national and international standing that could rank as a major tourist attraction and a major recreational and leisure resource for Australians. So I think that BHP should be putting something back into the area it has devastated and that council should be rejecting outright the application for rezoning. Member for Forde: Parliamentary Activities Youth Unemployment",124
157,Mrs ELSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to clarify a few newspaper articles appeared in various daily newspapers this morning. The articles are trying to place some significance on the number of times that I and other colleagues have spoken in this chamber. They have wrongly asserted that I have not caught the Speaker's eye since making my maiden speech. I have in fact spoken in this parliament on 11 different occasions. I have participated actively in question time, which is, as we all know, the most well-attended and lively debate in this chamber. I also strongly refute the implication in these articles that I am in some way the silent type. As anyone who knows me will attest, I am not shy in having my say. My aim is always to achieve results for the people of my electorate of Forde. Since being elected, I have tended to make a more direct approach and very often I have organised meetings and had discussions with ministers directly on issues of concern to my constituents. This tends to get results quicker than waiting for the legislation to be debated in this House. I do not for one moment decry the processes of this House, but I believe it an unreal assessment to look at speeches in this chamber as a measurement of performance. Performance by anyone's measure is about results and, as many ministers will attest, I am tenacious in pushing and achieving results for Forde. As we all know in this place, there are many ways of doing your job in Canberra. I am an active of member of seven committees. There are two standing committees-employment, education and training and family and community affairs-and five government committees, which are health and family services; veterans affairs; industry, small business, science and tourism; environment, sport, territories, local government and social security and primary industries and energy. As we all know, government legislation and policy are discussed at these committees before it is introduced in the parliament. That is where, I believe, I can have the most impact and make the changes that benefit the people of Forde. I am by nature a no-nonsense person. I make no apologies for the fact that I have that concentrated my efforts here in Canberra on where I can make the biggest impact. With the greatest respect for the institution of this parliament, in the vast majority of cases that is not in this chamber speaking after legislation has been finalised. I know that the local residents whom I meet at my regular open days in regional areas around the electorate, those I have helped by direct contact with ministers and departments and the many thousands I have met in my office and at functions will appreciate that my efforts over the past 12 months have been directed at doing my job and producing results. I would like to take the time in this debate to comment on an issue of great concern throughout my electorate and on which I have been working with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training-that is, youth unemployment. It is difficult to overstate the level of community support there is for the government's work for the dole scheme. People recognise it for what it is: the chance to keep young people involved, restore their confiis dence and self-esteem, build their work ethic and give them real hope for the future. I have spoken with many communities and business groups in Forde who are champing at the bit to get involved in work for the dole, and I have encouraged them to do so. I have made a protest to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) asking that the pilot programs be conducted in the regional areas of Beaudesert and Boonah. It is important that as a government we are prepared to tackle the tough problems, those that the previous government left in the too-hard basket. I am pleased to be part of a government which, like me, is results orientated and takes the direct approach people want and expect: common sense and action from their parliamentarians, not just talk. Nursing Homes",126
158,Mr ADAMS,ADJOURNMENT,"It is a pleasure to speak in this adjournment debate, and I would like to discuss the government's new nursing home policy, which I believe is a fundamental attack on the aged people of Australia. I have had a lot of people write to and ring me and people have visited me at my office concerning this policy and concerning what the government intends to put onto the Australian aged population. Recently I had somebody come into my office who is getting on in her life now, but her story is very typical. I knew her husband for many years, but he passed on some years ago. He left home as a pretty young man and worked for many years in the mountain ranges of Tasmania building hydro-electric schemes till he raised enough money to build himself a small business in a country town. He was a small shopkeeper. He and his wife toiled for the rest of their lives. When they sold their small business, they bought a small cottage and a couple of acres so they could run the pony for the granddaughter. That was what he wanted to do, and that was what he did in his life. As I said, he passed on and his wife now lives in that cottage. Now the pressure is starting to come. Her time is getting close to when she will need to go into a nursing home. She is getting very frail and she will need a nursing home bed. Her last dream and her last goals in life, I suppose, are to leave that cottage to her family and to her grandchildren. That dream and those goals have now been taken away by this government. It is stretching it and it is pulling away from commitment that it should have to aged Australia. There are many, many people who cannot, and will not be able to, afford a nursing home bed. The government is not outlining how these people are going to cope. It has not given these people an opportunity to understand its ideas, its policy. It is trying to con the people. This was not a part of your platform at the last election. None of you people went out and said to the people of Australia, 'You will have to sell your house to get a nursing home bed.' None of you went out to the electorate, and do not say you did because none of you did. You failed the people of Australia, and now you are tearing their houses off them so they can get a nursing home bed. That is what you are doing. Mr Hardgrave-You're scaring them.",127
159,Mr ADAMS,ADJOURNMENT,"I am not scaring anybody. People are contacting me with their concerns. What am I supposed to say to them? Mr Hardgrave-Advance the debate, don't try to scare them in the process.",127
160,Mr ADAMS,ADJOURNMENT,I am not scaring them. I am trying to tell them what you people are trying to do. It is very difficult to get information from the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan). It is very hard to get the detail of what you are doing to the aged people of Australia.,127
161,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ADJOURNMENT,No answers.,127
162,Mr ADAMS,ADJOURNMENT,"There are no answers. You talk about accommodation. It is not accommodation these people need. Sixty per cent of them come out of acute hospitals and into nursing home beds--60 per cent of them! This is not about hiring a tlat or going into a tlat. This is not even about going into a hostel. This is about a nursing home bed. This is about decisions that have to be made by these people at a time in their lives which is not easy for them or their families. As I said, trying to get details and information to give to people is very difficult. Your the minister has come along to the table when asked questions in question time, but she has refused to answer them. She introduced a bill in the House the other day, but she refuses to answer many of the queries put to her by members on our side of the House. She is going along but she will not face what she is doing or what this government is trying to force on the aged people of Australia. Those people who will have to deal with this issue are finding it very difficult to get information. I can assure all members of the government that you will cop it from your own electorates, because people are starting to seek out information about what you are doing to them but they cannot get it. That is a failure of this government. This government has attacked the aged people of Australia but they are not producing the detail. (Time expired) Apples and Pears",127
163,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to raise an important issue tonight regarding the fruit industry in Australia. I refer to the President of the Australian Apple and Pear Growers Association, Jon Durham, who has spoken about the proposal by New Zealand to export apples into Australia. A recent newspaper article quoted Mr Durham as saying that fire blight, a disease which is apparently in evidence in New Zealand: ... could hit Australian crops by the year 2006 if New Zealand's application to the Federal Government was successful. The article continued: He said the fire blight clock would start ticking from the first shipment. ""There is a one-in-20 chance that fire blight become established in Australia within the first IO years of trade with New Zealand,"" he said. If introduced to Australia, fire blight has the capacity to reduce net returns for apple growers by 25 per cent and pear growers by 40 per cent. Mr Durham went on to say that: The whole canning industry is at risk, as are full time and casual jobs in the industry. I want to point out to the House that within my electorate is the district of Harcourt, which has one of the biggest apple industries in Australia. That is in the bottom half of my electorate. Just north of my electorate in the federal seat of Murray is a very substantial pear industry. I am concerned about this proposal. I want to say that the government should give this matter their most urgent consideration because, if fire blight does get into Australia, it would be to the detriment of the whole fruit industry. Australia enjoys a very good reputation overseas for having clean agricultural product. If that reputation were tarnished in any way, it would be to the detriment of Australia and particularly our fruit industry. The newspaper article continued by quoting Mr Durham as saying that gross farm income was expected to fall by at least $20 million if their fears were confirmed-that is, if those apples did come in and the spread of fire blight disease did take place. Mr Durham said: . .. fire blight, an exotic disease, could cause troubles similar to the Queensland papaya fruit fly problem. Members from Queensland would understand the difficulties associated with that particular problem. Mr Durham went on to say that: ... the New Zealand application failed to guarantee fire blight would not be introduced if their apples were allowed access to Australia. I raise this issue in the adjournment debate so that it will be considered by the government. I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) is in the chamber, and I am sure he will take note of my comments. He represents Tasmania and they have a substantial apple industry in Tasmania. I know he will take note of my comments and deliver my concerns to the will Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and also to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). This weekend the Harcourt district will be holding their Applefest, which is a celebration of the high quality apples produced in that area. I hope I will be in attendance at that apple festival to help them celebrate the fine quality apples they produce. Member for Forde: Parliamentary Activities",128
164,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"I very briefly wish to add my support to my colleague the member for Forde (Mrs Elson) following that very misleading newspaper article which implied that she had not spoken very much in this chamber. As a new member also, I understand that many members take the course that they can perform far better for their electorate and their constituents by working very diligently on committees, by speaking in the party room and by talking directly to ministers. As all members would know, speaking in this chamber is an art. It is something that has to be honed. It is something that has to be taken slowly and carefully, and the member for Forde is most certainly doing that. I can assure her constituents that they have a very worthy representative who is working tirelessly and getting results for them. I am sure she will be the member for Forde for many, many years to come. House adjourned at 11 p.m. The following notices were given: Mr Adams to move That this House: (1) recognises the risk to the Australian apple and pear industry should the Government allow the importation of apples from New Zealand; (2) considers the impact chemicals used to eradicate the disease will have on the local environment should fire blight take hold in local orchards; (3) acknowledges that despite new research from the New Zealand industry suggesting there is no risk of fire blight entering this country through the export of New Zealand apples, it is not a 100% guarantee and that the most effective no risk quarantine policy would be no imports of apples from New Zealand; (4) calls on the Government to provide certainty to the industry by taking a strong stand on Australia's quarantine standards as the Australian apple industry continues its expansion into the Asian market where the widespread image of Australian apples is that of a clean and fresh industry; and (5) calls on the Government, when making its announcement on this issue at the end of March, to protect Australia's apple industry and reject the importation of New Zealand apples. Mr Hicks to move That this House: (1) expresses its strong support for Australia's teachers; (2) notes its concern at the greater responsibilities and increasing stress being placed on teachers because of many social factors, including the disintegration of many of Australia's families and resulting lack of discipline within the school environment; and (3) recommends that more authority be given to teachers so that teachers and their students are not placed in danger and teachers can get on with the job of educating those students who wish to be taught. Mr Mossfield to move: That this House extends its sincere appreciation to the staff of all Government Departments for their courteous and efficient handling of the public at a time of major staff cuts, increasing demands on their time and expertise and growing dissatisfaction by the clients of the various departments caused by the lack of staff. NOTICES Mr Mossfield to move That this House: (1) congratulates the hundreds of young persons now competing in many ice skating events throughout Australia and particularly in Blacktown, NSW; (2) calls on the Government, through the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, to take an active interest in, and provide strong financial support for, the various clubs throughout Australia who are involved in the many facets of the sport of ice skating; and (3) notes the high standards being achieved by young Australians in ice skating sports. Mr E. H. Cameron to move That this House: (1) acknowledges the importance of immunisation of children against harmful infections; (2) recognises the unnecessarily and dangerously low rate of immunisation of children in Australia; and (3) welcomes the initiatives announced by the Minister for Health and Family Services as a positive step to reversing the low levels of immunisation, and preventing the unnecessary ill health and deaths of children which can be prevented.

(2) What is the forecast number of aircraft movements for the airport for each year to 2006. (3) What is the maximum number of annual aircraft movements which the airport can handle safely using the existing runways. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Federal Airports Corporation, as the operator of Jandakot Airport, advises in relation to that airport that: (1) The number of noise complaints received in each year since 1991 are: 1991-100; 1992-81; 1993-73; 1994-159; 1995-660; 1996-889(December figure unaudited). (2) The latest forecasts for Jandakot Airport 1994/95 (Actual)-372 000; 2000/01-431000; 2005/06-487 000. Average growth per annum is assumed to be 2.6%. (3) Based on the maximum hourly capacity using the existing runway configuration, the ultimate capacity of the airport is around 450,000 movements per annum. Australian Securities Commission: Investigations (Question No. 818) Mr Campbell asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 15 October 1996: (1) Further to a speech made by a former Member for Dunkley (Hansard, 17 December 1992, page 4031) concerning an investigation undertaken by the Australian Securities Commission, (a) how many private houses were visited during the investigation, (b) how many times was each house NA visited and (c) on what days and at what times did the visits occur. (2) Will he provide a copy of the documents served on persons during each visit. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l)(a) I am advised by the Australian Securities Commission that one private house was visited during the investigation in question. (b) I am advised that that house was visited once. (c) I am advised that, due to difficulty in finding an appendix file, the Australian Securities Commission can do no better than estimate that the house was visited during a weekday in January 1993. (2) I am advised that no documents were served during the visit. Australian Securities Commission: Complaint (Question No. 878) Mr Campbell asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 29 October 1996: (1) Is it a fact that a complaint was lodged in February with the Australian Securities Commission are: (ASC) concerning the ramping of Cambridge Gulf Exploration shares; if so, (a) was the complaint lodged by Cambridge Gulf Exploration in the interests of its shareholders and (b) were persons associated with Country Natwest, Messrs Thomas, Newton and Pettorino, mentioned in the complaint. (2) Is it also a fact that the share ramping resulted in profits ranging between $20m and $30m; if so, (a) does the ASC consider this to be a serious complaint; if so, why has it not investigated the matter and (b) does the ASC treat large organisations like Country Natwest different to other organisations. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2)(a) I am advised that the ASC received a complaint from lawyers acting for Cambridge Gulf Exploration NL, by letter dated 8 February 1996, concerning trading in the company's securities. The ASC commenced an investigation into this matter in April 1996. As the investigation has not yet been completed, it is not appropriate for me to comment on, or release information concerning, the complaint that was lodged or the resulting investigation. 2(b) I am advised that the answer is No. All entities operating in the securities markets, regardless of size, are subject to the Corporations Law. In particular, the market offence provisions of the Law apply to all entities and individuals dealing in the market. The ASC is responsible for the administration of the Law. In discharging its responsibilities with regard to the investigation of alleged breaches of the Law, the ASC has a structured process for determining what action it will take. The criteria it takes account of include whether the alleged conduct is serious; affects the integrity of markets; generates a high level of public interest; or involves fraud or dishonesty on the part of company officers. Australian Securities Commission: Dissemination of Information Charges (Question No. 886) Mr Campbell asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 30 October 1996: (1) Does the Australian Securities Commission (ASC), in its case against Mr Conway for alleged dissemination of information, intend using Mr Thomas as a witness; if so, was Mr Thomas the Managing Director of County Natwest at the time of the alleged offence with which Mr Conway has been charged. (2) Is it a fact that (a) at the time the ASC alleges Mr Conway was disseminating information, the ASC knew that County Natwest had 9 days beforehand put out a statement saying that Cambridge Gulf shares would go to $60 and had accumulated 9 million shares and options which they sold in total to Jardine Heming, Hong Kong, for considerably less than the predicted $60 each but took the share price of $4.10 each and (b) because of the issue and similar occurrences about 30 persons have been dismissed by Jardine Heming. (3) Has the ASC investigated the activities of County Natwest; if not, why not. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The decision about who is to be called as a witness at the preliminary hearing of the charges laid against Mr Conway is a matter for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, who will, in accordance with accepted practice, call such witnesses as are necessary or desirable to establish a prima facie case against Mr Conway. (2)(a) As the matter is the subject of criminal proceedings before the court, it is inappropriate for me to comment on the matters raised by the question. (b) I am not in a position to comment on the termination practices of Jardine Heming generally or whether any Jardine Heming staff have been dismissed as a consequence of trading in Cambridge Gulf Exploration NL (CGE). (3) I am advised that the ASC is conducting an investigation into matters connected with trading in shares and options of CGE. As the investigation has not yet been completed, it is inappropriate for me to comment on, or release information concerning particulars of, the investigation. State and Territories Business Enterprises: Taxation (Question No. 891) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 31 October 1996: (1) Has the Commonwealth agreed to the States and Territories retaining the tax equivalent of Commonwealth tax liability on their business enterprises; if so, what are the details. (2) Will the Government apply the same agreements referred to in part (1) to tax equivalents on local government business enterprises; if not, how can the national competition package overcome the tax disincentive to the corporatisation of certain local government functions. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The taxation arrangements for State and Territory business enterprises were agreed at the March 1994 Premiers' Conference, and encapsulated in a ""Statement of Policy Intent"" (SOPI). In effect, the SOPI provides that: the Commonwealth would legislate to exempt all state and territory trading enterprises from Commonwealth income tax and wholesale sales tax (WST); state and territory governments retain the tax equivalent of Commonwealth tax liability for those enterprises which were not subject to Commonwealth income tax nor borne WST prior to 25 March 1994; for enterprises that were subject to Commonwealth income tax or had borne WST prior to 25 March 1994, state and territory governments would pay compensation to the Commonwealth equivalent to the amount the Commonwealth would have collected in respect of that enterprise had it continued to be liable to tax. (2) The previous Government had not negotiated with the States, Territories and Local Government the application to Local Government Businesses of the set of principles encapsulated in SOP!. This Government has yet to address this matter. Australia II (Question No. 951) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 19 November 1996: (1) Has the Government formally agreed that Australia 1/ will return to WA on a permanent basis; if not, when will a decision be made. (2) Has the Government formally agreed that ownership of Australia II will be transferred to the WA Maritime Museum. (3) Has the Government received representations from the WA Government for financial assistance towards housing Australia II in Fremantle; if so, (a) what sum is being requested, (b) by whom was the request made and (c) when was the request made. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Government has formally agreed that Australia II will return to WA on a permanent basis. (2) The Government has not agreed that ownership of Australia 1/ be transferred to the WA Maritime Museum. Discussions are in train to resolve this question and other issues relating to transfer of the yacht. (3) The Western Australian Government has not sought financial assistance towards housing Australia II in FremantIe. Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association: Newspaper Article (Question No. 971) Mr Allan Morris asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 20 November 1996: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the Australian Financial Review, dated 19 November 1996, entitled ""Hand of Dick seen in missive"" and referring to a letter sent to him from the Aircraft Owners and Plots Association (AOPA); is so, (a) did he receive the letter, (b) what was the date of the letter, (c) when was it received by his office (d) what did the letter contain and (e) will provide a copy to Parliament. (2) Is he able to say whether Dr Liddell's resignation letter was not delivered to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority until 9.15 am. on 18 November 1996. (3) What formal and informal communications passed between AOPA and Dr Liddell since August 1996. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, I am aware of the letter. (a) Yes. (b) 17 November 1996. (c) The letter was stamped received in my office on 18 November 1996. (d) The text of the letter is as follows: Dear Minister AOPA Australia is shocked to learn of the resignation of Dr Rob Liddell from the position of Director, Office of Aviation Medicine, Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Dr Liddell, the longest serving manager within CASA, is the very type of person CASA can ill afford to lose. As the administrator of aviation medical policy he has shown qualities that have stood him apart from the general tone of CASA's policy making mechanism. Dr Liddell brought a fresh approach to the Aviation Medicine Branch, no doubt in no small part due to his having worked as a line pilot in the airline industry. His progressive philosophy has perhaps best been demonstrated by his policy towards pilots who have had coronary artery disease treated by bypass the surgery. These pilots would in days past have been barred from further flying activities, but now they may be recertified fit to fly providing they pass certain medical criteria. Dr Liddell has at all times been approachable to pilots and medical examiners alike, but always conscious of his obligation to the safety of the travelling public. He is open to arguments, and open to persuasion, provided the evidence be put logically. In short, he has approached his job in an open and forthright manner. Whilst AOPA does not always agree with the decisions made by Dr Liddell, he is respected by this Association for his integrity. The letter of resignation reveals a deep crisis within CAS A which likely goes far beyond the confines of the Office of Aviation Medicine. AOPA considers it a matter of extreme urgency , in the interest of the safety of aviation in this country, that the matters raised by Dr Liddell be addressed without delay. AOPA similarly, urges you, Minister, to use your influence to reverse Dr he Liddell's decision to resign. If there are to be resignations, those who have brought about the crisis described by Dr Liddell should be leaving not the likes of Dr Liddell. Sincerely (e) See response to l(d) above for the text of the letter. (2) Dr Liddell's letter of resignation to Mr Keith was dated 15 November 1996 and was hand delivered to Mr Keith's office at 9.15 am on Monday 18 November 1996. (3) CASA has no record of any formal communication between AOPA and Dr Liddell since August 1996. I am not privy to private communications and am unable to answer this part of the question. Aircraft Movements (Question No. 978) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 21 November 19%: Intern'l Sydney (OOO's) Jul-95 3434 Aug-95 3406 Sep-95 3302 Oct-95 3478 Nov-95 3596 Dec-95 3848 Jan-96 3876 Feb-96 3626 Mar-96 3810 Apr-96 3714 May-96 3776 Jun-96 3874 Jul-96 4102 Aug-96 3848 Sep-96 3760 Oct-96 3776 Nov-96 3702 NA Jul-95 1478 Aug-95 1486 Sep-95 1440 Oct-95 1547 Nov-95 1502 Dec-95 1604 Jan-96 1612 Feb-96 1524 Mar-96 1594 Apr-96 1574 How many (a) jet and (b) total aircraft movements (i) occurred in each month since July 1995 and (ii) are forecast in (A) 1997, (B) 1998 and (C) 1999 at (I) Brisbane Airport, (II) Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and (III) Melbourne (Tullamarine) Airport. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Federal Airports Corporation has advised that its data base does not provide a breakdown of jet aircraft movements specifically. Aircraft movement data is sorted into four categories: namely; International (wholly jet movements), Domestic (significantly jet movements), Regional (significantly prop movements) and General Aviation (majority props but small proportion are jets). The total number of aircraft movements (including a breakdown into the above categories) which occurred at Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne Airports in each month since July 1995 are as follows: Domestic Regional GA Total (OOO's) (OOO's) (OOO's) (ooO's) 10268 6740 1898 22340 10116 7146 2346 23014 9906 6836 1862 21906 10276 7034 2108 22896 9874 7064 2096 22630 9726 6946 1952 22472 9926 6002 1740 21544 9748 6676 2076 22126 10500 7360 2224 23894 9608 7518 1872 22712 9506 8146 1998 23426 9156 7496 1680 22206 9782 8130 1774 23788 9580 8204 1876 23508 9386 8176 1858 23180 9896 8544 2248 24464 8994 8118 2616 23430 6826 3376 1886 13566 6374 3022 2184 13066 6186 2994 1948 12568 6380 3344 1712 13010 6188 3202 1618 12510 6218 3248 1456 12526 6214 3332 1386 12544 5944 3136 1510 12114 6390 3550 1746 13280 6076 3518 1556 12724 Intern'l Domestic Sydney (OOO's) (OOO's) May-96 1636 6238 JUli-96 1700 5964 Jul-96 1958 6422 Aug-96 1806 6414 Sep-96 1698 6240 Oct-96 1608 6566 Nov-96 1534 6122 NA Jul-95 1406 8168 Aug-95 1408 8106 Sep-95 1406 8046 Oct-95 1432 8502 Nov-95 1408 8306 Dec-95 1488 8158 Jan-96 1468 8370 Feb-96 1350 8156 Mar-96 1408 8766 Apr-96 1360 8336 May-96 1394 8558 Jun-96 1466 8070 Jul-96 1658 8708 Aug-96 1544 8896 Sep-96 1506 8650 Oct-96 1550 8934 Nov-96 1504 8390  movements are sourced from the Corporation's operational data base which records movements according to the date of service, whereas the Corporation's annual report discloses movements according to the invoice data. Consequently, the sum of monthly figures from July 1995 to June 1996 are marginally different to the total figures published in the FAC's annual report.  ments.  total aircraft movements (comprising international, domestic, regional and general aviation movements) for Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane Airports for 1997, 1998 and 1999 are still subject to consideration and approval by the FAC Board. Australian Taxation Office: Interest (Question No. 998) Mr Campbell asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 3 December 1996: Does (a) the Government have a policy of reducing interest rates and (b) the Australian Regional GA Total (OOO's) (OOO's) (OOO's) 3736 1766 13376 3298 1596 12558 3454 2236 14070 3586 2000 13806 3240 1980 13158 3426 2196 13796 3238 2050 12944 2122 884 12580 2148 1078 12740 2064 786 12302 2090 892 12916 2198 728 12640 2230 670 12546 2164 718 12720 2094 754 12354 2182 776 12132 2076 676 12448 2230 714 12896 2016 632 12184 2182 614 13162 2132 696 13068 2080 612 12848 2226 668 13378 2032 760 12686 Taxation Office charge 19.5 per cent on money due since the 1995 tax year; if so, why. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) As indicated in my joint statement with the Governor of the Reserve Bank on 14 August 1996, the Government strongly supports the monetary policy framework which requires the Board of the Reserve Bank to set official interest rates with the objectives prescribed in the Reserve Bank's legislaof tion. The Government has welcomed the three reductions in official interest rates which occurred in the second half of 1996. (b) The automatic imposition of additional charges for late payment is a response, by way of legislation, aimed at encouraging payment of taxation debts by the due date. The additional Charges charges also deny late payers an advantage over those who do pay on time. For some taxes, an additional interest component operates to compensate the revenue for the loss suffered during the period the amounts were outstanding. This interest may be compared to what is acceptable commercial practice for use of funds and it is calculated on a base using the thirteen week Treasury Note rate of interest. (Hence, changes in market interest rates are reflected in the additional interest rate penalty, albeit with a lag.) The charge for the late payment of an income tax, franking deficits tax and provisional tax debt consists of:(i) a penalty component of 8% per annum; plus (ii) a per annum interest component, based on the thirteen week Treasury Note rate plus four percentage points. A new per annum interest component normally applies for a six month period, commencing on 1 January and 1 July each year and is published in the Gazette by the Commissioner of Taxation before the new rate takes effect. The rate for each period since the 1995 tax year is as follows:July 1995 to December 1995 was-12.0% per annum January 1996 to June 1996 was-ll.5% per annum July 1996 to December 1996 was-l 1.5% per annum January 1997 to June 1997 is-1O.5% per annum The interest component of the additional charge paid to the Commissioner is allowable as a deduction to taxpayers in the year of income in which the interest is paid. Telstra: Discounted Local Telephone (Question No. 1073) Mr Eoin Cameron asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 10 December 1996: (1) Does Telstra offer discounts to customers for local telephone calls; if so, (a) what discounts are offered, (b) since when have they been on offer, (c) do they apply in all States and (d) what percentage of customers in each State has applied for and is receiving discounts. (2) Does Telstra advertise discounts available to local telephone calls; if so (a) how, (b) in which States is advertising conducted and (c) what does it cost in (i) total and (ii) each State. (3) Has advertising in some States been greater than in others and resulted in higher utilisation of discounts in those States; if so, will Telstra offer retrospective discounts for customers who have been discriminated against tluuugh a (4) In which States does Telstra (a) have a monopoly on local calls and (b) face competition with local calls, and in those States in which it faces competition, what is the market share of each carrier in the local call market. (5) Will Telstra consider giving all customers one of the applicable discounts; if not, why not. (6) Will Telstra consider replacing the discount structure with an across the board reduction in the cost of local calls; if not, why not. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by Telstra: (1) Yes. (a) The following optional discount plans are available to customers for local telephone calls: Local Call Saver 5o/a-provides a 5% discount once a threshold spend of $10 per month is reached. Local Call Saver is available to residential and business customers. This plan was previously known as Call Saver 5. Local Call Saver 8%-provides a discount of 8% with the $25 a month threshold spend. It is available to business customers only. This plan was initially med as Corporate Centre Local, and Call Saver 10. Local Call Saver 15-the first $15 spend of calls per month receive no discount, the next $85 receive a 15% discount, and all remaining calls receive no discount. This Call Saver is available to residential customers only. Calls (b) Each of these plans became available as follows: Call Saver 5-May 1993; Call Saver 100August 1995; Corporate Centre Local-May 1995; and Local Call Saver 15-February 1996. (c) Yes-these plans apply in all States. (d) Telstra regards this information as Commercial in Confidence. (2) Yes. Telstra does advertise discounts applicable to local telephone calls. (a) Telstra advertises its optional discounts under the general Flexi-Plan brand in a range of mediums (for example, radio, television, press, magazines, phone books (see White Pages WA, page 29), press releases and telemarketing). (b) All States have been included in the advertising. (c) Telstra regards this information as Commerla:k of information. cial in Confidence. (3) Telstra's advertising has generally been on a national basis. Telstra regards information on the take-up rates of services as Commercial in Confidence, however, Western Australia actually has a higher penetration than other States for optional discount plans for local calls. Telstra has actively marketed discount plans using methods such as inbound and outbound telemarketing, shopping centre displays and sales representatives visiting customers. As Telstra has widely promoted these plans to eligible customers, Telstra does not consider it has been discriminating in these actions. (4) Both general carriers, Telstra and Optus, and service providers operating under the Service Providers Class Licence, are permitted to provide, and/or resell, local call services. Telstra regards information on market share as Commercial in Confidence. (5) The discount plans are available to customers on the bases noted against question (1). Telstra has promoted plans in a variety of ways (see answer to question 2). Telstra does not believe that automatically bestowing the plans is an appropriate strategy. Telstra's experience is that customers take exception to Telstra automatically placing Flexi-Plan or other pricing packages on their accounts without their knowledge or consent. (6) No. Telstra prefers to offer customers a choice of plans that allow them to select options that best meet their overall communications needs. For the reasons outlined in response to question (5), this approach is believed to be consistent with customer requirements. This approach is used by Telstra's competitors in Australia, and is the general practice in other countries where optional calling plans are offered. Royal Australian Navy: ADI Lithgow (Question No. 1086) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Defence upon notice, on 11 December 1996: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an advertisement appearing in the Cumberland Classifieds on 26 November 1996, stating that the Naval Support Comma,nd of the Royal Australian Navy is building a machme shop at the Defence facility located in Orchard Hills, NSW, to manufacture weapon components, fixtures, tooling and material handling gear. (2) Why is it necessary to establish a new plant at Orchard Hills when a Government owned factory capable of such work exists in the form of the Australian Defence Industries' (ADI) small arms factory in Lithgow, NSW. (3) Did his Department investigate the capacity of AD! Lithgow to complete the type of work intended for the Orchard Hills factory; if so, what were the findings; if not, why not. (4) Is his Department engaged in regular discussions with the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel on how defence industry resources can best accommodate the needs of his Department; if so, what have been the results of these discussions; if not, why not. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) The plant is not new. Defence is simply relocating an existing plant and activity previously performed by the RAN Torpedo Maintenance Establishment into a new building at Orchard Hills. (3) Given that Defence is relocating an existing activity, the capacity of AD! to undertake the work has not been investigated. (4) Yes. I do not propose to reveal the details of such discussions. Gallipoli Historic Site (Question No. 1108) . Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 12 December 1996: (1) Is his Department responsible for the conservation of historic wartime sites apart from war graves? (2) Has he received representations about the deteriorating condition of the Gallipoli historic site and in particular the Australian trenches? (3) Has he sought and obtained a report on the condition of the Gallipoli site, if so what are the findings? Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Apart from the War Cemeteries in Australia ' and Papua New Guinea, the only historic wartime sites for which my Department, through the Office of Australian War Graves, is responsible are certain sites of very limited extent in which have been erected Australian Battle Exploit Memorials. Typical among these are the Bullecourt Memorial Park and the 'Windmill Site' at Pozieres on the Western Front of Northern France. (2) I have received representations from persons who have visited Gallipoli in the recent past. Those representations have noted the weathered state of the battlefield earth works. (3) I obtained the advice of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission regarding the status and condition of the Gallipoli Battlefield. The battlefield sites at Gallipoli are contained within a Turkish National Park. The Commonwealth War Cemeteries that have been established on Gallipoli are the responsibility of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission with its Head Office in London and with resident maintenance staff in the Gallipoli area. The main area of the Gallipoli battlefield today bears a close resemblance to the rugged unspoilt landscape that confronted the ANZAC's on 25 April 1915. Since establishment of the war cemeteries on Gallipoli in the 1920s the Commonwealth War Graves Commission has' taken the view that the battlefield should be allowed to remain in its natural state and that no attempt should be made to preserve or reconstruct the wartime earth works. That approach was adopted in respectful recognition of the blood that has been shed on those battlefields and the many symbols of tragedy that the earth contains. The Commission takes the view that to allow the battlefield to remain as far as possible in its natural state is to lend added dignity to the many war cemeteries that are contained within it. The Turkish Government has recently invited the ANZAC nations to join with it in establishing a Peace Park on Gallipoli that would include the ANZAC battlefields. Should that proposal envisage restoration of any features of the battlefield, the Australian Government, in consultation with our New Zealand and British colleagues, would be prepared to consider such development. (Question No. 1154) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 12 December 1996: (1) Did the answer provided to Senate question No. 266 (Senate Hansard, 26 November 1996, page 5865) state that the Commonwealth may offer or be required to give certain warranties, guarantees, undertakings or indemnities to facilitate the execution of airport sales. (2) With respect to the sale of Melbourne (Tullamarine) Airport, will he indicate the nature of any warranties, guarantees, undertakings or indemnities which have been or will be, offered to potential purchasers in relation to the Commonwealth permitting the continued operation of Essendon Airport. Mr Sharp---The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) No warranties, guarantees, undertakings or indemnities have been made to potential purchasers of Melbourne (Tullamarine) Airport in relation to the Commonwealth permitting the continued operation of Essendon Airport. Potential purchasers have been informed of the Government's position that Essendon Airport's future is currently under consideration. Emergency Management Australia: Reporting Structure (Question No. 1163) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 4 February 1997: (1) What is the reporting structure from Emergency Management Australia to the Prime Minister in the event of a national emergency. (2) When was the current reporting structure introduced. (3) Has the structure changed; if so, (a) what was the prior reporting structure, (b) why was it changed and (c) who requested the change. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My office is informed whenever there is a possibility that the States or Territories might request Commonwealth physical assistance to deal with an emergency. Once a formal request is received, EMA seeks my approval. EMA has no direct reporting chain to the Prime Minister, however, the Disaster Service Liaison Officer within the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet is provided with timely advice on national Airports emergencies. (2) The reporting procedure was introduced with the establishment of the Natural Disasters Organisation (now Emergency Management Australia) in 1974. (3) The reporting system remains unchanged. However, as a result of the recent experience gained during the Mars Space Probe incident, officials are more acutely aware of the need for timely advice to Government of emergency or disaster events which would involve a response by the Commonwealth. Armed Services Bands (Question No. 1164) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 4 February 1997: (1) How many (a) bands and (b) band members are there in the (i) Navy, (ii) Army and (iii) Air Force. (2) Does the Government plan to reduce the number of (a) bands and (b) band members in the Services; if so, which bands will be affected and why. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I)(a)(i) Navy-There are two permanent Navy bands; one in Sydney, the other in Melbourne. The Navy also has six Naval Reserve bands which are located in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Fremantle, Hobart and Brisbane. (ii) Army-There are 10 regional Army bands. Five of these are Australian Regular Army bands which are located in Canberra, Sydney, Brisbane, Kapooka and Melbourne. The other five are General Reserve bands located in Perth, Adelaide, Hobart, Darwin and Newcastle. (iii) Air Force-The Air Force has two bands. (b) (i) Navy-The permanent bands have a total complement of 91 personnel against an authorised strength of 98, while the Reserve bands have a complement of 109 personnel against an authorised strength of 144 personnel. (ii) Army-There are currently 208 Australian Regular Army musicians against an authorised strength of 208. The five General Reserve regional bands are authorised to employ a total of 158 members. This number is influenced by the recruitment/resignation rates from the General Reserve, however, the number is generally close to this figure. In addition to the 10 regional Army bands, there are 19 Army Reserve units which have an integral band of up to 25 personnel. However, these personnel have an operational role within their parent units and are not therefore considered to be full time band members. (iii) Air Force-The RAAF Central Band which has 33 personnel, and the Air Command Band which has 50 personnel. (2)(a)(b) There are no plans in place to review Defence bands. However, this is an area which may be addressed by the Defence Efficiency Review. The Government will assess all Defence Efficiency Payment Type Job Search Allowance 1 021 Newstart Allowance Mature Age Allowance Age Pension Wife Pension Disability Support Pension Carer Pension Review proposals once the report of the Senior Review Panel is handed to the Minister for Defence on March 10, 1997. Social Security Recipients: Electoral Division of Prospect (Question No. 1239) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 4 February 1997: (I) How many recipients of (a) Job Search Allowance, (b) Newstart Allowance, (c) Mature Age Allowance, (d) age pension, (e) wife pension, (f) disability support pension, (g) carer pension, (h) youth training allowance, (i) the sole parent pension, (j) widow allowance and (k) partner allowance reside within the postcode areas of (i) 2145, (ii) 2161, (iii) 2163, (iv) 2164, (v) 2165 and (vi) 2176. (2) How many households within the postcode areas of (a) 2145, (b) 2161, (c) 2163, (d) 2164, (e) 2165 and (f) 2176 have as their primary source of income a person on (i) Job Search Allowance, (ii) Newstart Allowance, (iii) Mature Age Allowance, (iv) age pension, (v) wife pension, (vi) disability support pension, (vii) youth training allowance (independent) and (viii) widow allowance. (3) How many recipients of rent assistance reside within the postcode areas of (i) 2145, (ii) 2161, (iii) 2163, (iv) 2164, (v) 2165 and (vi) 2176. (4) How many of the persons referred to in part (3) were either on (a) a disability support pension or (b) carer pension within each of those postcode areas. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable Member's question: (1) The following table provides the latest available data on the number of recipients for the requested payments and postcodes. Department of Social Security Benefit and Pension Recipients for selected postcodes, September 1996 Postcode 2145 2161 2163 2164 2165 2176 574 398 489 1446 1039 692 582 448 319 1404 857 113 46 33 54 99 74 4934 2490 1209 1542 313 1730 487 284 123 268 399 493 1986 918 608 768 1229 1I64 81 40 55 50 89 96 Youth Training Allowance Sole Parent Pension Widow Allowance Partner Allowance (2) The information sought is detailed and is to authorise the use of the considerable resources the information requested. (3) The number of rent assistance recipients residing was: Postcode (i) 2145 (ii) 2161 (iii) 2163 (iv) 2164 (v) 2165 (vi) 2176 (4)(a) The number of rent assistance recipients pension within the specified postcode areas was: Postcode (i) 2145 (ii) 2161 (iii) 2163 (iv) 2164 (v) 2165 (vi) 2176 (b) The number of rent assistance recipients referred the specified postcode areas was: Postcode (i) 2145 (ii) 2161 (iii) 2163 (iv) 2164 (v) 2165 (vi) 2176 Harry M. Miller: Victoria Barracks (Question No. 1266) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 6 February 1997: (1) Further to her answer to question No. 1159, Hansard, 5 December 1996, page 206, is she Postcode 44 37 22 36 72 68 987 502 390 332 786 634 96 68 50 26 132 104 201 119 104 111 319 293 not readily available. This Government is not prepared of time and money that would be involved in assembling in the following postcodes, as at September 1996, Recipients 3,118 1,434 750 1,027 3,861 1,994 referred to in part (3) who received a disability support Recipients 717 17 96 160 328 156 to in part (3) who received a carer pension within Recipients 11 4 8 8 26 16 anticipating further proposals from Harry M. Miller regarding the use of Victoria Barracks. (2) Have other proposals been advanced by Harry M. Miller; if so, (a) what is the nature of these proposals and (b) how does she propose to handle those proposals. (3) Has she issued instructions on how proposals from Harry M. Miller are to be handled; if so, what are those instructions. (4) Has Harry M. Miller approached her with proposals involving the use of Defence facilities other than Victoria Barracks; if so, (a) what is the nature of these proposals, (b) what Defence facilities are involved and (c) has any proposal been approved. Mrs Bishop-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) No. (3) No. Any proposal received from any individual or organisation is dealt with by Defence on a case-by-case basis on its relative merits. (4) No. Canungra Land Warfare Centre (Question No. 1282) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 10 February 1997: (l) Does his Department own, lease or otherwise occupy land in the vicinity of the Canungra Land Warfare Centre known as Killarney Glen. (2) Was or is this land owned by the Fitzgerald family. (3) Do any Fitzgerald family members currently live on the property; if so, under what arrangements. (4) Does his Department have any plans for the area; if so, what. (5) Is the area currently Heritage listed; if not, his Department aware of a proposed listing. (6) What advice has his Department provided to the Australian Heritage Commission regarding a possible listing. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Department of Defence compulsorily acquired 25 properties in the vicinity of the Land Warfare Centre at Canungra in 1971. The property previously known as Killarney Glen was one of those acquired.  gerald. (3) It is understood that family members occasionally live on the property. Defence has agreed  the area referred to as Killarney Glen for as long as he has a personal need for the property. This arrangement is not transferable to other members of his family. (4) Defence has recently constructed additional training ranges to the north of the area in question. The area which was Killarney Glen is now designated as part of the buffer zone surrounding the new range areas. (5) Except for the administration and accommodation area, and a small area of about fifteen hundred square metres in the south east sector of the training area, all of the Land Warfare Centre, including the area in question, is currently listed on the Register of the National Estate. (6) In November 1996, the Australian Heritage Commission advised Defence of the intention to separately list the area described as the Back Creek Landscape and sought comment as appropriate. Defence indicated that it had no objection to the is proposed listing but did seek to clarify the incorrect inference that Killarney Glen and Land Warfare Centre were two separate properties. The Heritage Commission has now indicated its agreement with the Defence position. This new listing will result in a segment of Land Warfare Centre appearing in two separate listings in the Register of the National Estate.",153
