2,Mr TICKNER,HEALTH AND OTHER SERVICES,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (9.33 a.m.)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. I indicate that the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Bill is designed to prevent double dipping by people who receive Medicare or nursing home benefits which are subsequently covered by a compensation payment. The government's amendments aim to simplify the administrative obligations of insurers and other compensation payers. They deal with concerns raised by organisations such a. the Insurance Council of Australia and the Law Society of New South Wales about the bills. The government's amendments introduce bulk payment arrangements which will come into effect 18 months after the legislation commences. This will allow compensation payers to avoid the need to report on individual claims as they arise by providing bulk payments on an agreed basis with the Health Insurance Commission. The 18-month delay is crucial to enable the Health Insurance Commission to collect sufficient data upon which to base an agreement price for individual insurers. The amendments also simplify the administrative requirements and reduce delays by removing the obligation for insurers to provide a full copy of the judgment or settlement; by removing the requirement to notify of a forthcoming hearing; by deeming that, in most cases, a current notice of past benefits can also be regarded as a notice of charge; and by allowing parties to settle claims provided the compensable person has been informed that he or she may have a debt to the Commonwealth for Medicare or nursing home benefits. The government amendments address all of the concerns identified by the insurance industry and the legal profession. The opposition amendments are essentially consequential amendments to the other bills arising from the rejection of the administration fee bill. The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Administration ree Bill provided for compensation payers to pay an administration fee to the Health Insurance Commission to cover the cost of the scheme.

3,Mr TICKNER,HEALTH AND OTHER SERVICES,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (9.36 a.m.)-I move: That the requested amendments be agreed to. The provisions of the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges Bill essentially duplicate those provisions of the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Bill 1994 that relate to the recovery of Medicare or nursing home benefits. They are intended to have effect only to the extent that the parallel provisions in the main bill could be regarded as imposing a tax. Section 55 of the constitution requires that proposed laws imposing taxation should be in a separate bill. The Office of Parliamentary Counsel believe that this duplication is a necessary precaution. The government amendments to the bill mirror the amendments in the main bill. Question resolved in the affirmative.

5,Mr FREE,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Lindsay-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training) (9.39 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Commonwealth funding for the vocational education and training sector for the years 1995 and 1996 has already been appropriated under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. This bill would provide for the supplementation to these amounts in line with price movements. In 1996 the Commonwealth's funding would enable further growth in the number of student places, continue the level of infrastructure support in real terms and enable an expansion in funding for national projects in areas of strategic national importance. The bill would also appropriate funding for 1997, in accordance with the Commonwealth's undertaking in the heads of government agreement that established the Australian National Training Authority, ANTA, to provide triennial funding for the vocational education and training sector. 1997 also sees further evidence of the government's commitment to expansion of the vocational education and training sector through the provision of a further $70 million in growth funds. This would bring the total growth funding provided by the Commonwealth government over the period 1993 to substi1997 to $1.55 billion. The Commonwealth, in tum, expects states and territories to honour their undertakings in the ANTA agreement, including maintaining their own effort in vocational education and training. The additional growth funding is expected to result in an additional 35,000 student places being made available in 1997. The Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992 allows for the responsible minister to make determinations as to the actual level of funding to ANTA within the annual amounts appropriated under the act. This bill also contains a technical amendment which would clarify that the responsible minister can vary previous determinations made under the act. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and commend the bill to the House.",21
6,Mr RONALDSON,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Ballarat) (9.40 a.m.)I am sure the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) is as pleased as I am that this has finally got to the gate after about four or five false starts. Mr Free-A difficult birth.",21
7,Mr RONALDSON,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Indeed, very much so. I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1995. This bill provides the House with an opportunity to allocate resources to vocational education and training, while the debate provides us with the opportunity to reflect on the government's record in this area. I will not spend too much time on the detail of the bill, given that the minister has already done so in his second reading speech. I believe it is important to understand that the bill provides increases of $9.469 million in 1995 and $9.192 million in 1996 to the current legislated amounts. The biIl also provides a total of $949.88 million in general funding, which includes $22.7 miIlion for the off-the-job training to ANTA in 1997 under Working Nation. The coalition is strongly committed to the vocational education and training sector, we fully support the allocation of resources to the sector and, as such, we support the bill before the House. With substantial sums invested in the vocational education and training area, it is appropriate to look at what results this expenditure is achieving. Simply, the government's training initiatives are failing. They are failing because they are not leading to full time long-term jobs. They are failing because they are not adequately meeting the needs of business and industry. More importantly, they are failing because they have not provided Australia's young people and all who undertake training with a sense of hope for the future. These are the underlying themes of recent speeches, reports and articles about the government's vocational education and training agenda. The common theme running through all of these is that the government's training program is not delivering the jobs or the expertise promised, nor is it directed to any specific aims. I am sure that all of us in this House would agree that only through a world-class training system will Australia be able to have a worldclass work force which would not only lead our nation but also the region to the next century. Regrettably, Australia in 1995 is not well placed to take this lead. This view was confirmed by the release early this year of Enterprising Nation, or the Karpin report as it has become known. What this report showed was that all the rhetoric and chest beating of the last 12 years about opening up Australian markets and making us internationally competitive was just that-rhetoric and hot air. The report states: Although Australians still have a relatively high standard of living, commentators and policy makers have become increasingly concerned that the nation's economy is not growing as fast as those of many of our neighbours. As a result, Australia is sliding down the league table of economic performance, most recently being overtaken by Singapore and Hong Kong. This is a disturbing conclusion, given that the future of Australian business does or rather should lie in the Asian region. The reason our businesses cannot be competitive is that under the policies of this government our training system is not competitive. Again, Karpin states: . .. it appears incontrovertible that Australian enterprises, training providers and educational institutions are not moving quickly enough to address the new paradigm of management. Many of their counterparts overseas, and especially the leaders in the various fields of industry and education, are changing more rapidly and more extensively, and will be better prepared for the next century. Research undertaken by the Australian National Training Authority quite clearly shows that Australia's international competitiveness is related to work skills. The warning bells are well and truly ringing. If we do not make our training system and institutions world's best, then Australia will fall further behind the Asian region. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in his address to the ANTA conference on 10 February this year, announced: ... we need to ensure that training reform keeps up with the astonishing rate of industrial change. We therefore need to ensure that training reform is industry driven. The Prime Minister's comments are an admission that this is not happening. Yet on May 3 last year, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training told the House, 'TAPE places are meeting business needs.' This is not what the Karpin report found nor apparently does it accord with the Prime Minister's view of things. The Karpin report concluded that there was a demonstrable need for 'aims to make TAPE more responsive to enterprise needs'. The views expressed by Professor Karpin about the state of the vocational system in Australia have since been seconded. In August of this year, the Committee for Economic Development of Australia released the outcomes of its review of the national training reform agenda. The review made it clear that the government's training reform failures far outweigh its successes. The only person in reality assuming escape is the minister who, in an extraordinary answer to a dorothy dixer to the House on 30 August 1995, said, 'CEDA is overwhelmingly supportive of the directions of the reforms.' But what did the review really find? What, for example, did it say about the national training reform agenda? The report found: Progress has been slow and the new training structures are too bureaucratic, overly complex irrelevantI repeat, irrelevantto the needs of many enterprises. Does the minister seriously expect us to believe that this conclusion is again, to repeat his words, 'overwhelmingly supportive of the government's initiatives'? It was the report's conclusion that the national training reform agenda suffers from a lack of industry involvement-another overwhelmingly supportive comment. Perhaps the minister thinks the report's finding of a lack of emphasis on quality in assessment issues is yet another overwhelmingly supportive comment. How overwhelmingly supportive, you may ask, Mr Speaker, is the report's call for a need to improve links between vocational education and general training? Far from being overwhelmingly supportive of the government's reforms, the report is overwhelmingly critical of the increasingly bureaucratic way the reforms have been dealt with, the reforms' complexity and their irrelevancy. The fact that the minister thinks such blatant criticism is supportive shows just how out of touch he and his government have become. In the ANTA address I quoted from previously, the Prime Minister unhesitatingly stated that 'We are doing well' - we are doing well, he said. So, at the same time as the reports of Karpin and CEDA were finding that the training system in Australia was becoming increasingly complex, bureaucratic and irrelevant to the needs of industry, the Prime Minister believed that 'We are doing well.' But the Prime Minister did not stop there. He went on to say: No-one should doubt our resolve or our belief that the direction we are taking is the right one. 'Our belief that the direction we are taking is the right one', the Prime Minister said. This sits uncomfortably with his previous comments that to date the training reform was not industry driven. What is quite clear is that, in fact, the government's direction is increasingly becoming the wrong one. It is tragic that the conclusions reached by Professor Karpin and the CEDA report are and nothing new. If anything, they are only an update on what was found a year earlier. In June 1994 a report was released by Dr Vince FitzGerald of the Allen Consulting Group, called Successful reform. The FitzGerald report, as it became known, was a review of the implementation of the training reforms and was commissioned by ANT A. The report's conclusions were just as damning as those previously stated. Not only did the report find that: . .. it is unclear, under the reforms, what the objectives of public funding of training are ... but it also went on to say: ... the National Training Reform Agenda is seen as for the benefit of government and unions. I repeat: not for the benefit of Australia's young people, nor business, nor industry, nor any other forms of production-but rather for 'the benefit of government and unions'. The report further found that there is no overall national strategy; training objectives are imprecise or obscure; reforms are driven from the top down; it is a high cost system with a lack of attention to the demand side; information is lacking about what clients actually want; there is an inadequate knowledge about the small business market; there are administrative and organisational weaknesses at government level producing conceptual confusion; and there is a failure to integrate services, and a focus on inputs instead of outputs. In conclusion, the report found the system is overly bureaucratic, has no national mechanism for implementation and has no assessment process. These conclusions were reached eight months after the Prime Minister arrogantly declared that our belief in the direction we are taking 'is the right one'. If the Prime Minister and the minister seriously believe that the findings of FitzGerald, Karpin and CEDA, just to name a few, show that we are doing well, then Australia is in serious trouble. Perhaps, however, on the Prime Minister's benchmarks, he may be right, because let us remember that this is the Prime Minister who believes that this is as good as it gets. He is right-this is as good as it gets under the present government's policies. The government would very much like to be measured on their outcomes and the results of their 12 years in office. Despite Working Nation, ANTA, the national training reform agenda and the billions of dollars poured into vocational eduction and training, the result is disappointing to say the least. The CEDA report-the same report Minister Free said was overwhelmingly supportive-concluded, 'As a proportion of the labour force, the number of apprentices and trainees is now at its lowest point in a quarter of a century.' I heard a huff and puff from the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training then. The minister, in an answer to another dorothy dixer in this House yesterday, repeated claims that the government's ongoing apprenticeship program has been a success and, relative to other times, a great success. The reality is-I will not go into this today, but I will do so at a later stage-that the minister is quite clearly unaware of the CEDA report and the significant implications for Australia's apprentices and trainees. I will repeat the conclusion found in the CEDA report: 'As a proportion of the labour force, the number of apprentices and trainees is now at its lowest point in a quarter of a century.' That is adequate proof, I would have thought, that the direction the Prime Minister is so proud of is not, to use his words, 'the right one', nor, again to use his words, 'doing well'. This apparently is the pinnacle of 12 years of Labor's policies and the legacy our children and young people have been left with by a totally out of touch government. The crux of the problem is that the government are so deluded by their own rhetoric that ministers do not want to listen to any views other than their own. They do not want to listen to the industry, the opposition, those in the training sector or, it appears, even their own members. It is totally unacceptable that, in a time of record youth unemployment, there is a real chance that Australia is facing a skills shortage. The member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), who is the chair of the caucus social justice committee, alluded to this in an interview on radio station 2CN on 5 May 1994 when he stated: Two-thirds of Australians work in the services sector and many of those work in human services like education and health, and care for the aged, the young, the environment and the arts. And all of those areas desperately need additional people working in them because there are lots of unmet needs. They're not being enabled do so because there isn't adequate funding for TAFEs. And that's because, in large part, the Commonwealth has cut funds available to the States and Territories. Before the minister goes feral on that statement by one of his own people, I admit that the government may challenge the validity of the latter part of that claim. Here is a prominent government member disillusioned with his own party and obviously disillusioned with the direction the government is taking in this area-and that member is not alone in his views. In an article in the Financial Review on 28 April last year entitled 'Here it comes again-a skills shortage', Philip Cornford warned that there was a very real chance Australian employers would start to import labour. Cornford wrote: . .. because of a dismal training record, employers have had no difficulty doing this in the past. The future looks like being no different. Basically, Cornford was warning us that unless our training system was at a higher standard Australia would continue to have high levels of unemployment, as other workers were brought into do the jobs which could and should be carried out by Australians. Mr Cornford is not alone in his assessment of a potential skms shortage. In March this year, the Institution of Engineers Australia, warned that the number of new engineering positions available threatens to outstrip supply. Dr Michael Dack, from the institution, has warned: Australia will probably go back to the position of not being able to graduate enough engineers to meet the need. Surely our priorities should be filling Australian jobs with Australians who are fully qualified through a vibrant and industry relevant training system. What we need to do is widen the field in which vocational education and training can take place. Perhaps if we had greater opportunities to provide this training we would not have young people feeling that the situation for them is hopeless. If you really want to know what is happening in Australia it is always good to go to those short snippets from Australian papers where people write in or ring in with their views about life. There was one in the Daily Telegraph Mirror of Tuesday, 17 October, in '50-50 Words or Less'Mr Sawford-Did you say 'the Terrorgraph'?",21
8,Mr RONALDSON,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"I actually do not read the Telegraph. I take it the honourable member likes the Telegraph. I do not know much about it but the words in 50-50 are pretty appropriate. Indeed, if this bit is any indication, it is probably not a bad read. It says: Congratulations Rupert Murdoch for making the Prime Minister sit up and listen. There may well be some dispute about that, I suspect. It goes on: I've been trying to get an apprenticeship since leaving school two years ago. Mr Keating says our economy is not a disgraceI disagree. That was from a B. Hillman of Dundas. I suspect there may be many people, not only from Dundas but throughout the countryMr Free-That's one of Phillip Ruddock's constituents. His member has failed him.",25
9,Mr RONALDSON,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"I had better check on that. I am sure Mr Hillman is not a friend of the honourable member for Dundas. I take at face value that his comments about getting an apprenticeship are accurate. This government has lost sight of the fact that training programs should be designed not only to make people more employable but, more importantly, to make them employed. This cannot occur if vocational education and training does not prepare participants for the work force. That theme has been reiterated by the Business Council of Australia in its 'Achieving Australia 2010' 1994 scorecard. The findings are just as damning as those in the reports I previously mentioned. The BCA found that 'training reform is yet to make a major contribution to improved training performance'. The report by the BCA reiterated other all too familiar messages, such as: . .. outcomes from education are not well matched to the future cultural, intellectual and skills challenges facing Australia. The report acknowledges that the government has attempted to make some progress in this area. Although acknowledging that a major effort is planned in vocational education and training to achieve world-class education and training targets by the year 2001, the report is quick to note that 'the quality of the implementation of the reforms has been a negative factor'. Clearly, the achievements in vocational education and training are not at the level Australia needs, and there is very little evidence that the government will make the changes necessary to bring about a worldclass training system. It seems that every time you pick up a publication regarding the training portfolio, the same concerns are repeated. The Australian National Training Authority's economic newsletter for the September quarter 1995 detailed the outcomes of a series of industry workshops in agriculture, food processing, manufacturing, finance, property and business services. In a frank assessment of its own performance, the ANTA newsletter showed how inadequate training is for industry's actual needs. The newsletter said: Australia needs to deliver work skills more strategically than in the past to meet industry needs. It also stated that we need to 'bridge the gaps between industry priorities and the education and training system more cost effectively than in the past' - and this is not something that was said two or three years ago. I notice that, in answer to a dorothy dixer in the House on 30 August, the minister was trying to paint the best picture of the CEDA report. He talked about seminars-when they were held, et cetera-but, despite his apologies for the CEDA report, here we have ANTA, in its newsletter of September this year, repeating the same thing, that the training agenda is simply not meeting industry needs. And this comes from industry workshops held in the last three to six months, ascertaining the needs of industry. The newsletter said that Australia needs to deliver work skills more strategically, but it was really saying that we are still not doing it. The newsletter had further startling revelations. We learn that approximately three years after it was established, it is apparently only now-you have to take it at face value in its own newsletter-that the authority has tried to identify industry training needs by a series of workshops. The newsletter states: The authority has attemptedand I repeat 'attempted'to develop a better understanding of industry training needs. The authority is constantly talking about the need to ascertain industry needs. But, if you believe the rhetoric, read what has been written in the past and listen to what the minister and the senior minister, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), are saying about it, you would think it has all been done and that we are on the road to recovery. But it is simply not being delivered at all. The comment begs the question as to whether such work has ever been carried out previously. One of ANTA's key roles surely is to provide this link with industry and to give industry a greater role in training, but only now is the authority, to use its words, attempting to identify what industry training needs are. I would have thought it a bit late for the school leavers of 1993 and 1994 and, in all likelihood, 1995, and regrettably even beyond. To make matters worse, it appears this process has only been completed for some sectors. According to the newsletter, the workshops are still to take place in the wholesale and retail trade-an area of enormous employment in this country-and in the communications and community services sectors. In light of the view of the member for Fraser that there are unmet needs in these areas, surely work regarding industry training needs should have been carried out well before now. The major theme common to every training commentary over recent times is that a gap exists. Again, the newsletter states: . . . between industry needs and education and training systems. In September 1995 ANTA admits that one of the main problems faced by industry is: . .. the main gaps identified were between industry needs and education and training systems. When it is all said and done, all the assurances and all the fuzzy language have meant nothing. Some in the government would have us believe that this is the right direction for Australia. If we are to accept that Australia's international competitiveness is related to work skills, clearly this present approach is not good enough for this country. Without a successful training system we will not have a successful work force, and we will hinder the successful transition to adulthood of many young Australians. A recent speech by senior university lecturer Mr John Freeland to a conference on the future of work outlined that approximately one in seven 15to 19-year-olds is at grave risk of failing to become a successful adult. He found that the collapse in the job market for teenagers meant that this group were more disadvantaged than in 1983. Mr Freeland said that those at grave risk in the transition to adulthood were teenagers who were not full-time students and who were unemployed or permanently outside the labour force. Mr Freeland states: ... it is reasonable to assume that approximately 15 per cent of teenagers are at grave risk of not making an effective transition to adulthood and active citizenship. Fifteen per cent! A country we are all proud of will have 15 per cent of these kids not making that transition. Mr Freeland went . .. increased schooling can defer the manifestacountry tion of the transitional problem, but it has not, will not, provide a solution to the collapse in employment opportunities. The government can boast about its record retention rates all it wants-and I notice it is quoting 1993 figures; it is not quite keen to quote more recent ones-but this not take away from the fact that it has been unable to provide young Australians with proper full-time, long-term employment. It has only been in recent weeks that again quesif tions have been raised as to whether the government's $1.55 billion, five-year plan boost the country's TAFE system is achieving its aims. There have also been questions raised as to whether this funding has led to the promised dramatic increase in T AFE places. The honourable member might not quite as fussed about this comment as he about his previous one. Mr Richard Sweet, a member of the ANTA research advisory council, has predicted that the soon-to-be-released TAFE statistics for 1994 will only show an increase in enrolemployment. ments of one or two per cent during the previous year. I challenge the minister to people. assure the parents and students of Australia that this will not be the case. Mr Sweet has gone so far as to query whether all the money that has been put into T AFE has been well spent. There is absolutely no doubt that. Richard Sweet is a highly respected participant in commentator on the training agenda in this country. That he has been driven to make such a comment should be a cause of deep concern. The T AFE system desperately needs leadership-the type of leadership that a government which is serious about training this country should be providing. Many in the T AFE sector are looking for direction and many teachers within the sector are feeling confused and, in some cases, the threatened by the training reform agenda. As the largest non-industry training provider in this country, the T AFE sector is in need of an urgent restatement of the pivotal role it plays in the provision of the nation's training and the vital role it plays in equipping our work on: force with the skills we need to make our competitive and to make our young and people able to participate in the work force. It is the T AFE teachers who are at the forefront of both the technological and adminon istrative changes which have been made to that the sector. All of us in this House should so commend them on the dedication and comwill mitment they have displayed during these changes. The system will only be as good as the people whf) teach in it. The best equipment and the best facilities will mean nothing we do not have teachers who feel part of the reform process and who feel confident to about meeting the challenges which lie ahead. We should also remember that training for training's sake is not an alternative to employment. It never has been and it never will be be. What the government's reforms and was training have done is keep many young Australians in the limbo land of training but with no job at the end of it. Surely it is not too much to expect, in a country with the resources and potential of Australia, that our young people can look forward to full-time On any measure, the government has failed in its commitment to these young Clearly, Australia needs a vocational education and training system that is flexible and offers choice and quality in post-secondary training programs and post-compulsory education. This can be achieved by gaining relevant skills based training and ensure a and competitive training sector through an open and flexible training market. We also need to maintain the integrity of the TAFE system and allow T AFE to maintain its strength and its rightful role as the central training body. It is obvious that when it comes to training in we are not doing well-far from it-nor are we on the right track. Indeed, if anything, we are on the wrong track. It is too late for soothing words and false assurances. Even on best case test, the training sector in Australia is at the crossroads and the challenge is clearly there. How we answer this challenge will determine how we stand as a nation. In the couple of minutes I have left, I will go through a couple of further points. If you look at Working Nation, which the Prime Minister is so proud of talking about, you will see that it actually makes some fairly disturbing commentaries. Page 90 states: We have one of the lowest rates of participation in apprenticeships in the DEeD. It is simply not good enough for the minister to come in here and talk about levels of apprenticeships and attack those making comments about the level of apprenticeships in this country. The CEDA report has quite clearly shown, despite what the minister says about this, that as a percentage of the labour force we are doing very badly. Indeed, that percentage is at its lowest in the last three decades. Is the minister attacking the authors of that report? He said yesterday that anyone who dared take him on about his comments on the level of apprenticeships and traineeships in this country is lying and telling porkies, but the CEDA report quite rightly shows that this has been a failure. The minister is making comments about the size of the labour force. Mr Sawford-That is correct.",25
10,Mr RONALDSON,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,That is right. You are both right because you are admitting that the opportunities available are now significantly fewer than they were. That is the fallacy of what you have been saying in this House. That is the fallacy about your public comments. It is pointless coming out and calling the authors of the CEDA report liars or telling porkies because the simple fact is you do not like what it has said. This CEDA report quite clearly shows that you are denying these Australian kids the opportunities they should be given. There is no point makin'g excuses about it or talking about matters that are irrelevant. Talk about those job opportunities. (Time expired),28
11,Mr SAWFORD,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Before I go to the substance of the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill, I would like to refer to the comment made by the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) about the low proportion of apprentices in the labour force. He forgot a couple of crucial points. He never mentioned anything about traineeships. He never mentioned anything about the labour force increasing from six million to eight million. If his comment were serious, I would have thought he would have mentioned those integral figures and that he would have mentioned something about traineeships. The opposition has an appalling record on education in this country. As I have pointed out in this House many times, issues relating to education and training are usually met with a derisive yawn from those on the opposition benches. However, you can tell an election is in the air. During the previous debate ori higher education and this debate on vocational education and training, we see a belated attempt by marginal Liberal and National Party members to become aware of educational issues. If they think for one minute that belated contributions will fool the Australian electorate, they will be sadly mistaken. The Australian electorate are calling out to their federal members to exercise consistency, common sense and loyalty to their beliefs. They assume that they have some. The Australian electorate are rejecting the stunt manufacturers, the penchant for the one-line grabs, the image makers in which any substance or genuineness and long-term commitment are totally absent. The Australian electorate also reject the media reporting in print and television in particular in which consistent critical analysis and objective reporting are totally absent. Labor has created a decade of expansion of opportunity in education and training. This bill, the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill, provides additional funding to the vocational education and training sector in order to upgrade the nation's skills. The increased funds will enable further growth in the number of student places, maintain infrastructure spending in real terms and enable the key objectives of the Australian National Training Authority agreement to be achieved. ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority, was established to develop and administer a national vocational education system. Its objectives are to create a national vocational education and training system to foster close interaction between industry and vocational education and training providers, to create an effective training market and an efficient and very productive network of publicly funded providers, to provide increased opportunities and improved outcomes for individuals and target groups, and to improve links between schools, higher education and vocational education and training. In short, its objectives seek to guarantee that young people have the opportunity to get the skills they need to get the jobs they want. Since Working Nation commenced, the results prove its success. Unemployment is unacceptably high at 8.5 per cent nationally compared to 11.1 per cent in 1993-a significant decline of around nine per cent. The number of long term unemployed people has fallen by over 20 per cent. The government's promise to create more than 500,000 new jobs has already been achieved. The provisions in this bill are designed to build on these successes. The government's commitment to the expansion of the vocational education and training sector is proven. The further $70 million in growth funds committed here brings the total growth funding provided by the federal government over the period 1993 to 1997 to $1.5 billion. I would have thought that figure showed a government that cares about vocational education and training. The government is providing a total of $940 million in direct funding for vocational education and training this year. That.is a 7Y2 per cent increase over 1994-95, and that does mean more student places. You would think that the opposition would welcome that increase instead of being mean spirited about government initiatives. The federal government's recurrent funding in 1996 will provide 300,000 student places over and above what the states and territories are providing. The growth funds will provide a further 35,000 places per year. Does the opposition welcome that? Of course not. This commitment contrasts starkly with the opposition, which has demonstrated no such commitment to vocational education and training, nor to higher education, nor to schools, nor to child care, nor to anything of consequence to this nation's young people and to this nation's collective future. When the Liberals were last in government, federally seven out of 10 young Australians left the education system without completing high school. It was criminal neglect which left too many people, particularly young people, very vulnerable to the changing needs of the economy as it modernised. Now their colleagues in the state governments are turning the clock back. They are denying opportunity rather than enhancing it. When Mr Dean Brown became Premier of South Australia two years ago he promised more money for education and training. The facts, of course, are very different. The truth is very different. By 1996 he will have chopped $100 million out of the education budget, and the TAFE system is being similarly gutted. Mr Ronaldson-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. With the greatest of respect to my colleague, I think he has strayed well off this bill; he might return.",28
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,I will listen closely to what the honourable member has to say. I was not paying the strictest of attention.,29
13,Mr SA WFORD,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"I take the point, Mr Deputy Speaker. I know your fairness, so I will accept your guidance. Vocational education and training are 90 per cent administered by state governments. So what happens in state governments is very relevant to this debate. The TAFE system-the vocational education and training system-has been similarly gutted in South Australia, despite the desperate need for education and training opportunities in the most depressed state in the country. It is the state with the highest unemployment in the nation. That is Premier Brown's legacy after two years. Mr Brown talks about creating high-tech industries and a skilled economy-a leading edge economy. That is very important and I acknowledge its importance, yet he fails to grasp the simple fact that the foundation of a successful worldclass economy is a successful world-class education system, including higher education, vocational education and training and schools to provide the economy with the skills base it needs, especially in these times of rapid technological change. Mr Brown returned recently from his tour of America and various other places. He said that he was told by leading industry figures America that they had heard that South Australia was a world leader. Mr Brown smugly paraded that piece of nonsense; after all, he had nothing else to show for the trip. There are no prizes for guessing that this bit of nonsense was peddled by someone hoping to pick up a valuable state-owned assetmaybe the waterworks. It is nonsense because South Australia is not leading the world; I wish it were. In fact, it is coming last nation. The Liberals have virtually closed the state down. A couple of days ago the Court government closed Western Australia down. Brown is doing the same thing in South Australia in slow motion. For the record, South Australia now has the worse unemployment figures and the weakest economic growth figures in the nation. Between the December 1993 election and June 1995 the rate of job growth was one-third that achieved nationally. In June there were 3,000 fewer South Australians in work compared to a rise of 52,000 nationally. The habitual deceit and secrecy of the Brown government has been recently exposed. That is important because it is the state government that manages and administers T AFE in South Australia. The Auditor General in South Australia, Mr MCPherson, recently severely criticised the Premier and the government for the secrecy surrounding the deals the government is making with private enterprises in the current fire"" sale South Australia's assets. Justice Olsen, in a judgment in the Supreme Court of South Australia, cast severe doubts on the credibility bill. of the Premier's testimony and as a witness in the court. Mr Ronaldson- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I know it is a fairly important, wide ranging debate, but I really think that my colleague is straying to areas that are totally unrelated to the substance of this bill.",29
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Yes, I think the member for Port Adelaide has been getting a little bit away from it for too long. Tie it into the bill.",30
15,Mr SA WFORD,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Dr Bob Such is the TAFE minister in South Australia. He is a in pretty good fellow and he has a genuine concern for young people in South Australia. Among the corridors of power in Parliament House in South Australia, it is well known that the Premier is trying to shove him out of the ministry. It is important to note that the Premier dictates what is happening in vocational education and training in South Australia and to note what sort of fellow this person is. I refer to the case and use quotes-it is not in this my information-from Justice Olsen and some quotes that were in the Adelaide Advertiser.",30
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,As long as they are relevant to the bill.,30
17,Mr SAWFORD,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"They are very relevant, because the Premier has great control over what happens in vocational education and training in South Australia. The case concerned a former chairman of the South Australian Health Commission, David Blakie, who was forced to resign shortly after the Brown government was elected. The judge's comments confirm the view that Mr Brown is perhaps a habitual misleader. I will quote from the judgment",30
18,Mr CADMAN,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,What has this got to do with the bill?,30
19,Mr SAWFORD,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"It has very much to do with the bill. Mr Ronaldson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I again take a point of order. I am only three or of four doors down from the honourable member and I like him, but he really is getting into areas that I think are totally irrelevant to this",30
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,Order! The honourable member has made his point of order. I do ask the honourable member for Port Adelaide to get back to the bill.,30
21,Mr SA WFORD,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,I think this is very important to the bill. It is important because it tells something about what a judge thinks of the Premier of South Australia.,31
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for Port Adelaide might be contesting the ruling I have just given. If he is, I bring him to order.",31
23,Mr SA WFORD,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"No, I am not. I am just trying to explain why it is important.",31
24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,You have to do more than that; you have to tie it into the legislation.,31
25,Mr SA WFORD,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"-In the lead-up to the last state election, the Premier, Mr Brown, promised more money for education. This is about promises. This is about commitments to young people.",31
26,Mr CADMAN,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,The Labor Party! You can stand and say that!,31
27,Mr SA WFORD,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"He cut $100 million and just about everything else. This is about the credibility of the Premier in South Australia, who has been accused by a judge of ex post facto reasoning, and we all know what that means. He said to the electorate in South Australia that he would expand the education system. He has gutted it. He has ripped out $100 million from education. The only beneficiaries of the Brown administration are foreign companies which will pick up state assets for a fraction of their value and Australian companies which will pick up handouts simply to direct a bit of business towards South Australia. In all this time hundreds of teachers and school services officers have gone from the schools and the TAPEs. Our once excellent student-teacher ratio has been blown away, and retention rates have fallen from 93 per cent in 1993 to 76 per cent in 1994.",31
28,Mr CADMAN,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,He is going to fight this election on state issues.,31
29,Mr SA WFORD,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"We have noticed that you are in this debate. We have never heard you say anything consequential about education. There must be an election in the air. Oh, very good. Mr Brown has a deceitful attitude towards the people in South Australia, and his ongoing vindictiveness against many professional administrators",31
30,Mr CADMAN,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: we must comply with standing order 145-relevance to the legislation. This is Commonwealth legislation dealing with Commonwealth programs.",31
31,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,Order! The honourable member for Port Adelaide was in order in the remarks that he was making just then.,31
32,Mr SA WFORD,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Since 1993 the rate of job growth, if you can call it that, achieved in South Australia was one-third of the national average. In June there were 3,000 fewer South Australians in work compared with a rise of 52,000 nationally. Yet, despite this miserable record, the Brown government has abandoned the youth strategy project. Youth programs delivered by TAPE have been savaged. Those in the most disadvantaged groups, including Aborigines, have been the most severely hit. South Australia once had the best education and training system in the nation. In fact, it was internationally recognised as one of the best in the world. Today, after just two years of the Brown government, it is one of the worse. It is not only Mr Brown who has been caught out performing some ex post facto reasoning. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has also been caught out attempting to deceive the electorate. I quote from the column of Philip White, an independent commentator, in the Saturday Advertiser a few weeks ago. I will quote his comments virtually in full so that those opposite can appreciate the prose: You'd think that given all the great intellect and conservative wisdom on the entire federal opposition front-bench, we could expect a better performance than John Howard's cheap truck trick. If he can be as cynical as this before an election, the devil only knows how he'll regard us once he grasps the levers of power. Mischievously designed to instil a deep dread and misunderstanding of Australia's international debt in an already jittery, confused and suspicious community, the truck came out on the day honest Johnthe Leader of the Oppositionaddressed a business gathering to encourage more foreign investment. But he failed to mention what this investment would do to the debt. He failed again to outline hint of his own party's policies. And he also failed to mention that the vast majority of the debt has been incurred by our biggest businessmen, certainly not by the community at large, and most certainly not by the government, whose foreign debt share is four per cent. The debt is incurred, in fact, by the sorts of people who traditionally, if not habitually, vote Liberal. Who does this man think we are? I remind the House that these are the words of Philip White, an independent commentator, from the Advertiser.",31
33,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Order! I have allowed the honourable member for Port Adelaide to get those words on the record, but they are not relevant. I would ask you to get back to the bill.",32
34,Mr SAWFORD,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"It is always the same story-whether it be Kennett in Victoria, Brown in South Australia or Court in Western Australia. The opposition will do anything and say anything in order to get themselves elected.",32
35,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,Order! I remind the honourable member that this is a bill to amend the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act.,32
36,Mr SA WFORD,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will get back to the bill. The Liberals do not have any commitment to vocational education and training and they have no commitment to higher education. They still fail to grasp the critical link between a strong education and training system and the building of a modem, efficient economy which this nation demands. In contrast, the federal Labor government's ·record is proven. Labor has created a decade of expansion of education opportunity. It has increased opportunity for individuals, lifted our economic performance and provided the skills and flexibility needed in our emerging modem economy. When the opposition were last in government, seven out of 10 young Australians left the education system without completing high school. Now their colleagues in the state governments are repeating the same policies. They are quashing opportunities for our any young rather than enhancing opportunity. The opposition are promising nothing to the future students of this country. They do not support equitable access to education and training. They do not support growth iT} the higher education and vocational education and training sectors. Judging by the record of the Liberal governments in the states, they still fail to grasp the link between education and training and the nation's economic performance. If the Australian public, particularly Australian youth, could be so unlucky as to have the opposition win government at the next federal poll, students, schools and others involved in higher education and vocational education and training can expect, as has happened in the states, a dismantling of educational values. The federal opposition would make the same savage cuts as have been made by their counterparts in the states. They would contract opportunity rather than expand it. They would tum students out of the education and training system rather than fund their futures. I mentioned before that retention rates in South Australia have fallen from 93 per cent to 76 per cent at the end of 1994, after 12 months. This year, 4,000 students have already left the education system in South Australia. The opposition of course will deny this, but the facts prove they are prepared to tell untruths to the Australian people in order to get elected. I believe Australians deserve better; South Australians deserve better; the people in my electorate of Port Adelaide deserve better. This bill funds the future for young Australians. It does not promise funding for their education and training; it guarantees it. That is why this bill is so important. I commend it to the House. (Time expired)",32
37,Mr CADMAN,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"I want to use this opportunity to pay tribute to the people of the Hills and Hawkesbury districts in Sydney for the efforts they are making in providing education and training opportunities for business, for employers and employees, for educational and training programs that have been developed for people seeking to improve their opportunities and status, and also for their support for those in need and those who are without jobs. The program in the north-west section of Sydney has come under an organisation called the Hills Hawkesbury Initiative for Excellence. It has received some funding for job clubs from the Commonwealth government, attached to this legislation. However, the funding program has been minimal because there is a mind-set within the government that, because it is considered to be a high income area, there is no need for support. That is far from the truth because, as the House would be aware, during the recession the last group in our community to suffer retrenchment was those in middle management. As organisations flattened their management structures, people pushed onto the unemployment queues were those in middle management-often middle aged males with teenage families and heavy mortgage commitments. Because the government appeared to lack interest in this problem, the community took charge of the process and established the group. Within that group, all the Rotary and Lions clubs, the churches, the chambers of commerce and the educational institutions50-odd organisations-joined together to see what could be done to improve the capacity of the community both to create jobs and to place people in work. The process has been very successful and is moving ahead. There is now increased interest from some excellent officers in the Department of Employment, Education and Training to see whether, in that district of Sydney, innovative programs can be introduced to allow training for the long term unemployed. It has not been easy to devise programs that meet the government's goals because, in part, they appear to be unrelated to the workplace, the bureaucratic necessities for accountability-all of those things which are hardly objectionable but which are difficult for a community group to assess if they are unsupported, as we have been, by professionals. However, things are moving ahead. I want to pay tribute to the community that I represent. They have been superb. They have been generous in their provision of money to help those who are unemployed. They have been generous with their time in seeking to expand opportunities. In particular, I pay tribute to the board of the Hills Initiative for Excellence and to the chairmen of the various councils of the board-Jeff Strong, who is the chairman of the business council, David Adam, who is chairman of the welfare and support council, the education council and its various chairmen over a period of timefor the results that have been achieved. It is interesting to note the government's sudden renewed interest in the needs of the unemployed as the election approaches. Much of this remedial funding should have been put into the system two years ago. You are too slow with your response. You have been doing things, but the renewed interest has increased as you approach an election. The initiatives taken this year are just amazing when one compares them with the lack of action prior to that.",32
38,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,You're got to be joking-millions of dollars; Working Nation.,33
39,Mr CADMAN,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"You talk about Working Nation. You were two years late with that introduction too, Minister.",33
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member for Mitchell will address his remarks through the chair.,33
41,Mr CADMAN,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is very interesting to find how defensive and sensitive the Labor Party is in relation to their lack of concern and support for those who are unemployed. Mr Sawford-How sensitive you are with the truth.",33
42,Dr THEOPHANOUS,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,What are you talking about? Millions of dollars.,33
43,Mr CADMAN,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Here they come. Listen to them come into the debate. They have done nothing in the recession we had to have, as the Prime Minister put it. There were no programs to support those who were unemployed at that time. Now, as we approach an election, sure enough-<mt comes the funding, out comes the pork barrel. I believe this pork barrel is directed in a good direction. It is fine to help those who are unemployed and to have qualifications. I am making the complaint that you are two years too late to help many people who deserved support two years ago and have had to suffer in the interim. It is typical of my area and the people of my electorate that, despite governments, despite any support-or lack of support-they have taken initiatives to put in place assistance for families and those who are unemployed. If there is government funding to establish, for instance, a software support training program for people seeking to equip themselves to run a help desk, or if there is a training program to establish administrative, publicity and accounting skills for job creation or program support for the business community and for incubator businesses and all of that sort of thing, that will be gratefully received. I am not going to say that, because an election is approaching, we should not accept the funds and take advantage of what the government is doing. That would be churlish on my part. I am making the remark that you guys are too late and it is interesting how you can suddenly have an interest in the vocational area when an election is on the way and extra funding flows then. It is very interesting the way you manipulate the community to suit",33
44,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,Order! The honourable member will address his remarks through the chair.,34
45,Mr CADMAN,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"It is very interesting the way in which the Australian Labor Party manipulates the community and the flow of funding to suit the election cycle. That is the way you operate, and I think the community sees that. You make commitments that you do not live up to as a government, and then when there is electoral imperative the government responds. I do not think that is good management, and the Australian community sees it. I refer in particular to an area of education research that relates in part to vocational education and to higher education. We have had two educational bills in a row, so it is difficult to completely fit my remarks into the total ambit of this bill. But the link between higher education and vocational education is something that many speakers have referred to. I refer the House to the growing concern in Australia of the capacity for us to conduct agricultural research, education and outreach in Australia at all levels of education in a way that is appropriate to Australia's status in education and as a major exporter of agricultural products and value added products from an agricultural base. We have not been successful in having governments focus on this area of agriculture. We have, however, looked at new technology, waste disposal, environmental sciences and a number of very worthy areas. But I believe the agricultural industries of Australia need to be, as one of our major exporters, better served by a new emphasis and a new focus on world best practice in both education and export effort. We will lose much of the impetus that we have gained by excellent research, by excellent education and by outstanding outreach over the last 20 or 30 years unless we apply a fresh and dynamic initiative to these areas of agricultural production and science. It is interesting to note that in Victoria and Queensland there is beginning to be a focus on these areas, but there is no initiative from the Commonwealth. I would like to see the Commonwealth take an initiative to integrate, to draw together and to provide visions and goals for agricultural research, education and outreach at a national level. In my state of New South Wales, despite numerous reports for the need for there to .:>e change, successive governments have been reluctant to apply any direction whatsoever. The problem with agricultural research, and particularly agricultural education, is that it is an expensive part of the educational cycle and it is very tempting for governments to cut and cut, thereby reducing the quality and increasing the diversity and the lack of cohesion in agricultural education. There are 27 institutions in Australia teaching agriculture at a higher level. Then we have a further diversity in the vocational areas, through TAFE and other instrumentalities mainly administered by the state. It seems to me that with greater focus it would be possible to pick up and apply at a national level some of the processes the integrated system in Victoria has identified. In South Australia there has been a move to closer unity so that we are focusing on agricultural industries and we are giving opportunity for and drive to employment and research. The trouble I see confronting Australia is that, if we drop off in our application to agricultural education and research, we will find in 20 years time that, instead of leading the world in what we are doing, we will be overtaken by emerging countries or maybe by the existing high quality practice countries of Europe and the United States. I think that would be dreadful. Australia is at the forefront in agricultural production and processing. Our food processing industries are some of the best in the world and are growing at the fastest rate of any industry within Australia. So I believe we should be capitalising on this process rather than saying, 'We have performed well in agriculture. There is no need to give it our attention. There is no need to focus on agricultural education at a vocational or higher education level because we have done well in the past.' There is no real impetus there. There is no new thought. There is no new application. I have letters from state and federal ministers, including the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Simon Crean. He said that he did not want to touch anything in this area, that it was just all too and that it had to be left to the states and the institutions. There was not even the willingness to have a working party or task force examine these issues. If something of that nature were done, I think it would create discussion and interest right across Australia. In this vein, a number of interesting papers have come to my attention. One is a paper by Lindsay Falvey and Barrie Bardsley addressing the integrated system for Victoria which I understand is going into place. South Australia has been successful with an integrated system. I understand that, as recently as in the last three months, that process has been put into place in Queensland. But there is no national direction or incentive. I draw the House's attention to an article by David Smiles in the January edition of Agricultural Science. The article is entitled 'A vision and challenge for agricultural science' . Much of it relates to the educational processes and to the fact that we need to have an open educational process. Agriculture is one of Australia's major export earners and new opportunities exist for our agricultural exports to grow significantly. These opportunities will tend to be specialist. They will not be quite as they were in the past. They will require greater skill of production, processing, packaging, marketing, financing and transportation. We must be able to realise these opportunities. We need a national impetus. I know, from talking to a diverse range of people on all sides of the parliament, there is a view held that that should happen. But there appears to be just complete inertia on the part of the educational establishment and the bureaucratic establishment. The caucus chairman in the Labor Party, for instance, endorses the views that I am expressing today. John Kerin endorses those views. Senator David Brownhill endorses those views. Many people across Australia endorse the view that we need a new impetus, a new vision and a new challenge for agricultural education and research. Yet nothing appears to happen. I am just making a plea, putting down what I hope will be only for the first time my concerns in this regard. I intend to pursue this hard matter. I believe that, without first-class education and research to teach future generations of highly motivated students, the potential for Australian agriculture will not be achieved, and we will all suffer by that-there will be fewer jobs in the cities as well as in the bush. That change has been, I believe, greatly and very clearly enunciated by one of the doyens of Australian agriculture, a brilliant plant breeder, recognised by the Queen and his fellow Australians, Mr Nick Derera. He has contributed so much to the production of wheat and cotton in Australia. He is a superb man. Nick Derera has outlined the need for better agricultural education needs and restructuring in an article entitled Reform of university education in agriculture, which was published recently in an Australian Institute of Agricultural Science publication. Nick Derera basically has dealt with university education, higher education, but he averts to the need for the integrated approach to flow right into the vocational area as well. I refer the House also to articles from the Crawford Fund for International Agricultural Research. That group also gives emphasis to the need for Australia to be dynamic in its relationship with our neighbours and the international production of food, by drawing on the skills that are within our community and extending them. In a recent letter to me from the Crawford Fund for International Agricultural Research, it was pointed out that the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) and John Kerin had all agreed on the significance for Australia's outreach into international circles at all levels. That will mean a completely integrated approach in this area of agricultural science and education vocational levels at TAPEeven at a high school level TAFE-at college, at university higher education and above. The people who have the knowledge and the will are there. The people who have the capacity to educate and train are there. All that is needed is an emphasis, a pressure, a commitment from government-this government and state governments-to be able to achieve our objective. There is a need for a vision, and the challenge is there. I would draw to the attention of all members of the House the need for us, as a parliamentary community, to push this imperative both on the educational hierarchy, who feel threatened if they are challenged with new ideas, I am afraid, and on the bureaucraticDr Theophanous interjecting",34
46,Mr CADMAN,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Yes, they are. You have not spoken to them. I do not know what you are mumbling about. It has been so long since you have been in academia you have forgotten what it is like. People tend to protect their own area. So there is a reluctance to move ahead in this great challenge of the future that is offered by the need to extend and change agricultural education and research. I thank the House for their willingness to accept my remarks, which cut across the whole area of agricultural education, both at a vocational level and a higher education level. I trust that ministers and the educational bureaucracy will accept the challenge and come forward with programs that will allow Australia to take advantage of its great potential in such a way that there will be opportunities at all levels-at very high levels, at international levels and out on the farms-for Australians to present a new and dynamic image of agriculture for the next 20 or 30 years.",36
47,Mr OCONNOR,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"It gives me great pleasure to rise in the House to support the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1995. The bill gives further expression to the government's strong commitment to expand vocational education and training in Australia. The Labor government, when it came to power in 1983, resolved to restructure and re-energise the vocational education system in Australia which had become quite moribund through years of tory neglect. The Labor government has always placed the highest priority on the education and training of Australia's human capital basethat is, its people-and the measures contained in the bill are designed to provide additional resources to institutes of technical and further education and to expand the educational and training opportunities available to Australians. It is very much in line with the philosophical approach that we have always pursued to education in this country. The bill will provide for supplementary appropriations for 1995 and 1996 to take account of price movements, as well as appropriating some $950 million in 1997. This represents a dramatic increase in funding to the sector since 1983. I am not quite sure where members of the opposition are coming from or where they are gaining their information as far as the government's allocation of resources to the TAPE sector is concerned, but I would point out to the House that in 1983 around $232 million was allocated to the TAPE sector. In 1995, after some 12 years of Labor government, that has been increased to $778 million, with a commitment in 1997 to around $950 million. The mark of the Commonwealth's commitment in this area can be appreciated from the following: Commonwealth recurrent funding in 1996 will provide around 300,000 student places over what the states and territories currently providing. We are also providing $70 million in growth funds for 1996 and 1997 which will provide an extra 35,000 places per year. Part of that is capital expenditure. In 1995, some $227 million will be spent on upgrading and expanding colleges of technical and further education. Later on in this address to the parliament I will reflect on the contribution of the Gordon Technical College to vocational education in the Geelong region in my electorate. I do not think there would be too much disagreement on both sides of the House on the necessity for the nation to put resources into vocational education and trainingindeed, education generally. As always in politics, there can be a common agreement on the objectives and the underlying principles. The differences really emerge around the means we employ to achieve those objectives. So far as vocational education and training is concerned, for individuals there are the obvious benefits. Individuals who undertake vocational education and training courses suffer a lift in their self-esteem as they come to grips with the acquisition of new skills. It is a pathway along the road to their social maturity. As far as the economy is concerned, technical and further education is a key to the achievement of greater efficiencies in our enterprises and to the achievement of substantial lifts in productivity which enable our industry to compete better in the global marketplace. As far as society is concerned, a society which has its people engaged in the quest for the acquisition of new skills and new education and training is a society which is internally dynamic. As we know, education and training expands the economic and social opportunities of a society's people and plays a very important role in achieving greater equity and equality in our society. The nature of modern economic systems is such that we need a highly trained and skilled work force to adapt new technologies and to come to grips with the new realities that are emerging in the global marketplace. Production, distribution and exchange systems in modern economic structures and industrialised are countries are increasingly sophisticated and they require extremely skilled people to operate and improve those systems. While many of us might bemoan the increasing complexity of modem-day living, few of us appear ready to forsake the benefits that come from an increasingly sophisticated economic system. Listening to members of the opposition in the debate on this bill, and to their comments on education and training, there does not seem to be a real appreciation among them of the enormous structural changes that have been visited upon the Australian economy in the last two decades. We have seen the emergence of new markets, new consumer tastes and the exponential proliferation of new technologies. We are in the midst of a revolution which many of us do not fully understand. I do not think that understanding is there on the benches on the other side of this House. Australia is in a new industrial and global economic environment, and the key to the sustenance of our standard of living over time will be the efficiency of our vocational and educational training system and the access provided for Australians to avail themselves of that education. If we look at what industrial firms need to survive in this modern economic environment, the principles are very simple. But it is in the quest to achieve those objectives that we are provided with the real task. Firms need to be better and more efficient in the use of their resources, be it the land, materials extracted from the land or what is grown on the land. Firms need to improve the productive capacity of the people they employ and they need to expand their technology and capital base. I might just speculate for a moment on the characteristics that modern enterprises will require to hack it in the new global marketplace. Those enterprises must have a capacity to adapt to changing economic environments, which, as I mentioned before, are the changing taste of consumers, the various market pressures that are brought to bear on enterprises and the legal and economic structures in which they operate. The modem enterprise needs to be inherently innovative in the products that it develops ed. for the marketplace, in the ways it has to do things and, of course, in the management the work tasks within the enterprise. Another important characteristic of the modem enterand prise that will survive in this global economy is the need to decentralise its decision making and to flatten its structures of management. has to display a capacity to adapt to new technologies and the capacity to humane working environment. Profit comes from cooperation rather than from exploitto ation. I mention these things because the key the innovative, modem enterprise is the resources that it allocates within the enterprise to the training of its employees and the grams. manner in which it avails itself of the educathe tion and training that is provided to it government through the vocational training and educational structures. I think here Australia we have made some giant strides this area. We have made enormous gains in the vocational education and training area. Overall, in society, I think there is a greater awareness of the need for individuals in work force to acquire and expand their skills. As far as the system is concerned, this government has dramatically expanded access of Australians to skill acquisition by expanding the institutional places. The delivare ery institutions themselves have been revoluin tionised in their structures and their outlooks and, of course, the obvious linkages between those institutions and industry have been further developed, expanded and strengthened. These are the real achievements of Labor power in the last 12 to 13 years. The government has given expression to its belief in the need for better vocational educaourable tion training resources through its Working Nation program, which has been discussed already here in this debate. That particular program had two primary aims-to increase economic growth and to expand the job opportunities that were available to Australians. The statistics speak for themselves. Some 655,000 new jobs have been created in the Australian economy since this government was returned to power in 1993-655,000 jobs that the opposition said could never be creatLet us in this House not forget that the of opposition said that Working Nation was a waste of money, that it should not be spent that the government would never achieve its target of creating 500,000 jobs in its term of office. Here we are, 2Y2 years in, and we It have exceeded that expectation by 155,000 jobs with the creation of 655,000 jobs in the create a more Australian economy. A major objective of Working Nation was reduce unemployment, especially among the long-term unemployed, and we have been to spectacularly successful in doing that. A major element of Working Nation was the reforms that it made to labour market proIt represented a massive attempt to lift skills of the nation, and it represented a by comprehensive attempt to introduce greater flexibility into those programs to meet indusin try requirements. Those labour market proin grams are now delivered in close partnership with industry. The achievements in the employment area, as I have mentioned, have been spectacular. We have seen long-term the unemployment rates go down by 23 per cent, and of course the unemployment rate has been reduced from its peak of 11.2 per cent down the to 8.3 per cent in August. As far as vocational education and training concerned, more people are participating entry level training now than at any time in the previous three decades. Apprentice and trainee commencements as a proportion of the 15to 19-year-old age group are now at the record levels that were reached in the late in 1980s. There have been spectacular improvements in those areas. I note the return to the House of the honmember for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), who led the debate for the opposition here today on this particular bill. I do not agree with his proposition that the training that is being undertaken by young Australians is far removed from industry experience. The Gordon Technical College in my electorate is one of the major institutions for delivery of vocational education and training. That institution has very extensive links with industry. I would suggest to the honourable member for Ballarat that he read the August-September edition of the college's publication, The Gordon, to see what it is doing. That edition describes the degree to which the institution is making a very real and practical effort to meet the training needs of local industry in Geelong. Of course, the honourable member for Ballarat and other members who sit opposite really do not have any real claims in this particular debate. The honourable member for Ballarat, as we know, hangs on to his seat by a hair's-breadth. I guess at the next election the young people in Ballarat will not forget his support for the $3 per hour youth wage. What a solution! I would have thought the honourable member for Ballarat would have been highly embarrassed at having supported that particular proposition. Yet honourable members opposite went along like lemmings and fell over the cliff with 'Honest John' Hewson and 'Honest John' Howard. They fell over the cliff like lemmings. We are sneaking up to that cliff in 1996. Over they will go. The lemmings will all go over again. Last time it was Fightback; this time it will be industrial relations. The young people in Ballarat will not their member's support for the massive cutback to the jobskills program and the LEAP program, which was suggested in Fightback. I guess they will not forget either his support for zero tariffs and how that would have thrown out of work a lot of people in Ballarat in the automotive industry. I went to school in the same town as the honourable member for Ballarat. I know, as he knows, that Ballarat has a very good educational infrastructure, in both the private industry. and public sectors. But I have not read anywhere in the Ballarat Courier the honourable member for Ballarat sinking the slipper into the Kennett government over its deliberate run-down of the educational infrastructure in Ballarat, Geelong and other regional communities. If you are fair dinkum about the points you are making in these debates-I speak about not just the honourable member for Ballarat but also all members opposite-you have to display a bit of credibility. When somebody like Jeff Kennett hoes into the education system in Victoria, you have got to stand up and be counted. As far as vocational education in Geelong is concerned, I mentioned the Gordon Technical College, which is one of Victoria's oldest technical institutions and it has a long and proud history in that state of delivering vocational education. The federal government's commitment to Geelong has been some $30 million to refurbish that institution and to build a manufacturing industry training centre to service the needs of Geelong manufacturing enterprises. I reject the charge by honourable members opposite that this government is not addressing the training needs of industry. Let me say this about the comments that have been made in this debate thus far by members of the opposition. Listening to you, you would think that training was only the responsibility of government. You know and I know that Australian industry has one of the most pathetic training records of any Western country. It was only when the Labor government held the gun at Australian industry'S head that it woke up to the fact that its survival in the long term depended very much forget on putting resources into training. I commend the Gordon Technical College on the initiatives it has taken in China and Indonesia to expand the export of its educational services. It is doing some excellent work in that field. Time does not permit me to reflect on the Alcoa experiment. I will do this at a later date. But it really puts paid to the lie that is being put by the opposition that the training programs that are sponsored by this government do not relate to Australian",36
48,Mr ALDRED,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"In rising to speak on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1995, I must point out that to support the appropriation in this bill is in one sense to condone the failure of our education system under Labor over the past 12 years to provide Australian youth with an education and training that will provide at least, firstly, secure entry into the work force; secondly, a secure base from which they can organise their lives and relationships; thirdly, confidence in the government and the private sector of Australia that the economic and social fabric of our society will endure; and, fourthly, an ongoing upgrading of skills, educational services and job opportunities in an ever changing work environment. Statistics have shown that among the world's leading economies Japan and Germany are outstripping all other highly industrialised and technologically advanced nations in efficiency, productivity, the application of technology and vocational education and training of the work force. Japan and Germany place heavy emphasis in their education investment dollars on vocational training. The United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and other debt ridden economies slant more of their education investment dollars at the tertiary and higher education sector. During the period 1972 to 1995, we have seen the traditional concept of the university in Australia change to include all colleges of advanced education, T AFE colleges and other educational institutions following on from secondary school. To enter a higher educational institution in Australia, young Australians need to achieve a tertiary entrance standard. What do these tertiary entrance standards tell us? They tell us this: our youth need to attain 12 or l3 years of general education and an age of 17 to 18 years before being offered specialist vocational training. The government is deliberately delaying the education of youth and their preparation for the work force. Educational policies of the Labor government act to keep official unemployment figures down. Non-academic students over 15 years of age are prevented from leaving school because of lack of jobs, lack of preparedness to enter the work force, as a direct result of inadequate policies on vocational education and training. The courses of higher education offered to and accepted by most Australian youth are determined by their ranked performance in a general academic education and not their specific abilities and talents. The delay in preparing young Australians for the work force and their independence with adequate financial means is totally out of step with the social, psychological and material ways in which we prepare them to enter society. Modem Australian youth are just as ready, if not more ready, to enter the work force as their counterparts of 20 to 30 years ago. We, the parents and grandparents of the postwar era, have successfully raised the aspirations of our children to achieve a higher social and educational standing and awareness. Today's youth have the following improved attributes: a greater knowledge and information at their fingertips, a greater social and democratic consciousness of their rights and entitlements in an affluent society, and a greater initiative and desire to achieve the aspirations drummed into them from birth. Labor has failed them. Labor has, for the last 20 years, overseen a decline in the real living standards of the average Australian family, a massive increase in the gap between the rich and poor, the erosion of our industrial base, the disintegration of our international competitiveness and the total disregard by the Hawke and Keating Labor governments of the health and future of our youth. Labor's legacy to Australian youth is no jobs, delayed and often irrelevant education during years of secondary schooling, poor social mobility and, above all, poor vocational mobility. In the industrial suburbs of Australia Labor's legacy has manifested itself into serious cultural problems that are quickly spreading out to all elements of Australian their society. These cultural problems have now been a norm for as many as two or more generations of the one family in the industrial dormitories of Australia. It is these traditional areas that Labor has relied upon for rank and file membership and votes, but no more. The youth of Australia and their parents and grandparents have had enough of Prime Minister Keating and Labor's appalling legacy, which can be detailed as follows. Australia's youth suicide rate is amongst the highest in the Western world. The social problems facing Australian youth include serious alcohol and drug abuse, morals breakdown and permissiveness. There are significant mental health problems among our youth-youth are very much our futureincluding lack of self-confidence, anger at continual failure and rejection, desperation at scholastic irrelevance and failure, lack of positive self-concept, poor self-discipline and so on. Domestic violence is a further concern. Domestic violence is due very much to the policies of this Labor government. It appears that our society now accepts husband-wife and parent-child abuse as a norm for domestic violence in Australia. But Labor, through its deliberate lack of relevant and appropriate vocational education and training policies and its forced delayed specialisation of youth education has forced the average age of adult children staying at home due to economic circumstances to be 23 years. One of the latest and most disturbing statistics in domestic violence in Australia is that of frustrated, desperate youth, with no future, bashing their parents. This is Labor's shame-Prime Minister Keating's shame. It is his reward to ordinary Australians and their families for supporting his level playing field economic rationalism which has dispossessed their children. This dispossession is tearing the fabric of Australian society away from our youth during their adolescent years of 13 to 17 when the professionalism of teachers throughout the country is prevented from assessing their suitability for academic studies in higher education. During the years 13 to 17 approximately 60 to 80 per cent of our youth fail to make the grades for higher academic learning. Labor has created a system in which vocational education is not available to meet the needs and abilities of our youth until the age of 17 to 18 years after they have generally experienced total personal failure and persecution for two, three, four or even five years of their high school education. This is the majority of the population that Japan and Germany spend much of their education investment dollars on. The standard of professionalism of the Australian teaching profession is so high that the academic abilities of students can be accurately assessed at ages as low as years 1, 2 and 3 in primary schools. The trend in our schooling system under Labor is to totally suppress such progressive assessments and to have students wallow in failure and low selfesteem for years until vocational education comes their way, generally more by good luck than by good educational management. As a matter of fact, the massive problems facing youth today in our education system are a direct result of state education systems following a line of Labor Party direction to retard educational opportunity in order to suppress the facts about true unemployment and economic decline in Australia. The health of the nation's education system is a direct indictment of the health of its economy. The best example of Labor's failure to provide the truth to parents about a lack of vocational educational opportunities to our youth, the retention of 15to 17-year-olds at secondary schools to keep the real unemployment figures from blowing out and the victimisation of any teacher who speaks out on behalf of the real educational needs of youth is the Queensland state Department of Education. The Goss and Keating Labor governments will fall on their record of a lack of vocational education and lack of preparedness of Queensland youth for the work force at their next respective state and federal elections. Here is a true and extraordinary account of a teacher's experience in the Queensland education system who has been speaking out about the lack of vocational education programs in Queensland secondary schools for 22 years. Since 1973, as a young teacher during the Whitlam Labor government, he saw tens of millions of dollars thrown at education with little or no direction or accountability towards the real needs of the youth of Australia. In 1991 Bob Wilson ended up at Ferny Grove State High School in the safe state Labor seat of Ferny Grove and the marginal federal seat of Dickson, held by the present Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). Labor will lose both of these seats at the next respective elections. Ferny Grove State High School was a large school with approximately 1,500 students which was totally preoccupied with its perceived public reputation for academic excellence rather than the individual needs of its students. In April 1992, Bob Wilson asked the principal, Ralph Took, to consider looking at the topics of 'unemployment' and 'the real needs of non-academic students' for in-service training of staff. The principal ruled that unemployment had nothing to do with the school's education programs. In 1993, the principal admitted that it was beyond his abilities 'to link the educational needs of the individual students to courses that reflected the realities of the work force beyond school'. Surely, this type of attitude, as expressed by educational leaders in our society, has contributed to the downfall of standards and opportunities for our youth. It follows that during 1991, Bob Wilson expressed the need for vocational education for students-some as young as 13 years-to Principal Took. He also complained that the academic reputation of the school fudged by some teachers who issued revision sheets that were mirror images of the test papers in classes before exams. This practice has been reported as widespread in many schools in Queensland and is a major failing and unfairness of the internal examination system. Mr Wilson, who is reputed to be an excelassess lent teacher with an exceptional ability interact with and manage adolescent students, was seen as a threat to the Principal of Grove State High School and its policies conservative academic education. The princiresultant pal, Mr Ralph Took, put Mr Wilson on a to diminished work performance procedure and threatened that he could lose his job if continued to contest it. The concerns of Mr school. Wilson were twofold: firstly, he was concerned for his own career and financial security, which is understandable, and, seceducation ondly, he was concerned for those students who were disadvantaged at Ferny Grove State High School simply because they were not academically oriented. Mr Wilson recalls going to supervise a grade 8 class whose teacher was absent. When he arrived the students said to him, 'What are you doing here, sir?' He replied, 'Your teacher is away and I've come to teach your class.' The students then replied, 'But all of sir, you teach only good grade 8 classes; we're vegies, sir.' Those students were 12 and 13 year olds streamed into a lower ability class. Physically, socially and mentally-in every way-they were normal sons and daughters of everyday Australians, except they were not academically bright. Their true strengths and abilities were unknown because the education system does not assess them. In an academically oriented system, students such as those already failing in year 8 will experience total failure in all years until leaving or year 12. They will progress even with failures. I point out that four classes out of the 12 grade 8 classes at Ferny Grove State High School in that year were in that category. It was for those students that Bob Wilson 1992 and 1993 had been fighting. Mr Wilson took stress leave in March 1994 to fight his case through the Goss governwas ment's Public Sector Management Commission's accountability legislation. He went to a level 3 grievance. Principal Took was ordered to withdraw the diminished work performance unconditionally among other directions of the report. Mr Wilson's sin was to speak out about the need for vocational education and training for most students during their high school years and the need to students again at 13 to 14 years. It was to not the policy of Ferny Grove State High School to meet the real educational needs of Ferny the students. Obviously, Mr Wilson was of making valid points and pointed out the discipline problems in the school due the existing academic educational programs for all students. He was seen by Principal he Took as a threat to the reputation of the During the level 3 grievance process, senior department officers closed ranks to protect Principal Took from charges of professional misconduct. As a result of serious breaches of statutory duty by officers of the government superannuation office and the education department, Wilson was unlawfully retired by the education department so that Principal Took and others did not have to face an investigation of their breaches of statutory duty under public sector management standards. Wilson was retired because all investigations concerning an officer of Public Service lapsed when he exited the service. Wilson then reported over 55 breaches of statutory duty by 14 departmental officers and two cases of official misconduct by Principal Took in his duties at Ferny Grove State High School to the Criminal Justice Commission to keep the system honest. The CJC merely rubber-stamped the actions of the education department until Wilson, with fully substantiated evidence, forced them to reopen the case. The CJC and the Crown Law Office advised the Director-General of Education, Mr Frank Peach, that Wilson's retirement was unlawful. Director-General Peach then changed the retirement of July 1994 to dismissal in July 1995 in case Wilson was reinstated. The Commissioner for Public Sector Equity does not hear dismissals and the time limit for an industrial court hearing had lapsed. In July 1995, Director-General Peach sought crown law advice and options from the Government Superannuation Office, if he were to approve the re-employment of Wilson. Only after he took to the streets of the Public Service precinct in public protest during the recent Queensland state election campaign did Wilson receive a conference with education department officials. At the conference on 11 July this year, the delegates of the director-general rejected Wilson's offers for reinstatement. Wilson's offers fell within the parameters of the crown law sanctioned options of the Government Superannuation Office given to Director General Peach. Peach's delegates misrepresented the legally sanctioned options of the Government Superannuation Office at the conference. Wilson signed a deed of settlement based on information misrepresented by the delegates of the director-general. Wilson vitiated the deed. Documents obtained since have shown that senior executive officers, including Director General Peach, have deliberately lied to the Minister for Education and the Criminal Justice Commission about the Wilson case in order to prevent his reinstatement. Wilson is still seeking justice. What chance do the youth of Australia have the to gain relevant assessment of their abilities and access to vocational education at an appropriate age if teachers like Bob Wilson are banished from the teaching profession for simply advocating vocational education for non-academic students? The Director-General of Education in Queensland, Mr Frank Peach, along with the Principal of Ferny Grove State High School, Mr Ralph Took, should be condemned for their breaches of statutory  was little more than a political appointee of the Goss Labor government. The Criminal Justice Commission must also be condemned for its breach of statutory independence and fairness in the public interest for its role in rubber-stamping the unlawful action of the Department of Education. The CJC delegated its authority to the Department of Education for the executive to investigate its own peers. In conclusion, this bill reflects the funding of an inadequate and inappropriate system of vocational education that does not meet the appropriate educational needs of the youth of Australia. In the national interest, it is a problem that must be addressed. I seek leave to table the FOI documents and other material relating to the Bob Wilson case, which I have shown to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous), who is at the table. Mr Bob Wilson is quite happy to have it made publicly available. Leave granted. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

49,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRIMARY INDUSTRIES LEVIES AND,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (11.29 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this package of bills is to rationalise into a single framework the 59 separate levies and charges acts currently imposing levies on primary industry products. It complements the significant rationalisation of the levies and charges collection legislation that took place in 1991 and is consistent with the Blewett report that sought to reduce the parliamentary legislative program. It is designed to overcome past problems caused by the volume of primary industries and energy portfolio legislation and the logjam the levies and charges legislation created by requiring constant amendment in the parliament. We have analysed the problem, consulted extensively with industry and concluded that amalgamating all the levies and charges into two framework acts will make more effective use of parliamentary time dealing with levy legislation. It will also assist industry to changes to levies put in place more rapidly than on some occasions in the past. The levies and charges in question are not unilaterally imposed by the government, but rather are sought by representative industry bodies, on behalf of the industry. Their purpose is to fund activities such as marketing and research and development that would be beyond the scope of individual farmers on their own. I would expect that more levies will be requested by industry in the future, particularly in new and emerging industries and most probably for R&D. 1995 The levies bill and the charges bill set up a framework for imposing levies on primary industry products by regulation. They will allow new industries or new products to be included quickly on the request of the industry concerned, while at the same time protecting parliament's powers to decide on these matters. It is important to recognise that this streamlining process will not change the practical impact of the current legislation but only the way levies are established or amended. There will be no discernible difference from the industry point of view in the way that the levies and charges processes operate, other than that any changes they wish to make to maximum levy or charge rates will be able to be completed in a much shorter time frame. Previously, maximum rates for levies and charges were included in each individual levy or charge act to give parliament control over any arbitrary imposition of taxation. Because of the wide variety of bases for the calculation of the levy and charge rates it was not possible to find a suitable formula covering all industries to include in the framework legislation. The bills therefore require the maximum rates of each levy or charge to be set out in special regulations. Normal regulations come into effect on gazettal before they are tabled in parliament. These special regulations will not come into effect until after the parliamentary disallowance period is completed. This still gives the parliament the ultimate role in determining maximum rates. Impositions of levy or changes to levy have matters such as maximum and operative rates can only be made on the recommendation of the designated body and after the required consultation with the relevant industry. The bills also require any increases in maximum rates to be published in a daily newspaper in the states and territories to ensure that individuals in an industry are aware of them. Initially, the maximum rates to be included in the special regulations are likely to be the same as those currently applying in each industry, unless the industry has specifically sought a different rate. The bills allow the minister to declare a designated body or bodies for each industry to make recommendations regarding the setting of levy or charge rates. Where there is more than one designated body for a particular industry, these bodies will be required to agree on any recommendations they make to the minister. Designated bodies are also required to consult with other representative bodies. For example, if the designated body for a particular industry is a peak grower body, it is required by reference to section 22 of the Primary Industries Levies Bill 1995 to consult with any other eligible industry bodies set out in the relevant statutory marketing authority act before making recommendations to the minister. The relevant industry or product regulations will contain the detail of the particular levies or charges; who is liable to pay them; how and when they will be collected; and what they will be used for. The regulations for each industry will be very similar to the regulations currently in force, but will include some provisions from the old levy or charge acts that do not appear in the new bills because they were too specific for the framework nature of the new bills. We will be circulating draft copies of the regulations to industry organisations for comment when they are drafted. This continues the consultative approach we have adopted with industry through the development of this streamlined levy package. A third bill is included in this package-the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1995. This bill includes the repeal of the old levies and charges acts and a number of amendments to other acts that make reference to the old levy and charges acts. These amendments are necessary to ensure that levies and charges can still be collected and the correct amounts can be paid to the correct organisations. The commencement date for this legislative package is 1 July 1996 to allow time for the regulations for all the relevant industries to be made and tabled in the parliament. However, certain sections of the legislation will commence on royal assent to allow designated bodies to be declared and maximum rates to be set in time for the commencement of operation of the levies and charges acts. Regulations relating to operative rates of levies and charges will also be able to be made and tabled for disallowance following royal assent, but these regulations will not come into force until the remainder of the act commences on 1 July 1996. A wide range of representative bodies in all the primary industries covered by the current levy and charge arrangements have given broad support to the approach being taken. Draft copies of these bills have been made available to these bodies for comment. Let me remind honourable members that this legislation was inspired by two things: industry's need for a streamlined and more responsive process; and a need to make better use of parliamentary time. There are advantages on both sides by making this process work. I commend the bills to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.",44
50,Mr ANDERSON,PRIMARY INDUSTRIES LEVIES AND,"The coalition will not be supporting this package of primary industries bills. We will in fact be opposing them. While we understand the intention of these three bills is to streamline the process by which levies and charges are imposed on primary products principally for research and development, we have serious reservations about what is proposed. The nub of our concern is that these bills would allow levies and charges to be imposed by regulation instead of having the present system, which requires legislation to establish levies and then to vary them. We know that the levies and charges in question are not imposed by the government but are sought by industry in order to undertake research and development and other activities beyond the scope of small scattered enterprises to organise and to put in place on their own. The government's rationale in changing the process is to reduce the amount of time parliament spends amending levy and charge acts by introducing a standard framework that streamlines the process. But, so far as the coalition is concerned, this allows the government to fulfil an objective: it seems to want to remove one of the few opportunities afforded this parliament to debate the circumstances of industries whose efforts are fundamental to the economic health and prosperity of all Australians. This is not our principal reason for opposing the legislation, important as it is. Our primary objection is to be found in the problems identified by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which has clearly identified the problems that primarily concern the coalition. The committee found that both the Primary Industries Charges Bill 1995 and the Primary Industries Levies Bill 1995 effectively delegate power to the minister to impose a tax. Quite simply, they remove from the primary legislation the power to establish a tax. The coalition believes that this is inappropriate. The standing committee suggested that, if the actual level of the charge could not be set for practical reasons in the primary act, it should at least prescribe a maximum rate or a means of calculating it. But in legislation before the House the maximum levy is set by regulation. The Senate committee recommended several options for dealing with this undesirable proposal of allowing ministers to effectively become responsible for setting the level of taxes. It suggested that the bills could be amended to provide that a regulation is adopted only after an affirmative resolution of both houses of parliament within a similar time frame to the proposed disallowable instrument. But, unfortunately, the government has chosen to ignore these serious concerns, hiding behind assurances in the explanatory memorandum that levies and charges will be set only at the request of industry bodies but failing to enshrine this principle in this legislation. We regard that unsatisfactory . The coalition is also concerned that switching from legislation to regulation will significoncerned, cantly reduce the amount of time available for the parliament to consider the impositions of levies and charges. I note the second reading speech says that we need to make a better use of parliamentary time. Perhaps that reflects one of the problems in this place: there is an unfortunate lack of awareness, in general terms, of the very important nature of primary industry to the national economy and, in specific terms, of the critical role of research and development and promotion in securing our future in economic terms, given that that future is very heavily dependent upon our primary industries and their export performance. I suggest that we will be more dependent, rather than less dependent, in the future. So it needs to be acknowledged that not only are these industries and their research and development and promotion efforts very important, but also it is extremely important that they can be fully and properly explored in this place. Often there is disagreement within an industry and disagreement between different states-as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) should well know-as to the desirability of introducing such levies and charges or altering levies and charges once they are there, irrespective of the merits of the program that they are to fund. No better mechanism exists than allowing for these very important matters-and in some cases you are imposing very real obligations on people who may not want to wear them against the majority wishes of their industry-to be properly debated in this place by the representatives of the various parts of the country, of those very industries and of the sections of those industries that are likely to be affected. As far as I am aware, in terms of the amount of parliamentary time involved, to date all matters we have seen since the introduction of the second chamber as a mechanism for dealing with legislation have ended up in the Main Committee and not here. So we believe that ensuring debate takes place is a very healthy thing to. We believe it does as not unduly hold up procedures. We think it is an important part of accountabilitysomething that, so far as this parliament is seems to be often overlooked by those opposite. In a very important way, it is a mechanism for ensuring that this House is safe from the charge of having imposed arrangements unreasonably or without adequate consultation on industries. It is a protective mechanism, if you like, for the parliament. For those reasons I have outlined, we will be opposing this legislation. I now tum to the wool industry, which knows a great deal about levies and charges. Wool growers are still paying heavy taxes to cover the stockpile debt, as well as to contribute to research and development and promotion. I hope that tax burden can be relieved, despite the current problems of the industry, inasmuch as the debt servicing proportion of the tax-that 4.5 per cent-can be either significantly reduced or abolished altogether in the near future. That is going to depend very much on what happens in the industry over the next few months. Regrettably, we find that the wool industry is facing a new crisis, which is causing quite a few of us to lose quite a bit of sleep at the moment. The indicated price has crashed from a high of 830c a kilo in May to 582c at sales today. Prices are now well below the cost of production for many, if not most, wool growers; yet, ironically, the underlying market fundamentals are, in the view of most of the industry, sound and the International Wool Secretariat believes that the situation will around early next year. I know that all of us in this House sincerely hope that, for the sake of wool growers, that recovery comes sooner than next year. Growers have done it tougher than almost any other primary producer, perhaps tougher than any other primary producer in recent times, and they really are in an extraordinarily difficult situation. In talking yesterday with those involved in the south-west Queensland farm build-up strategy, it was heart wrenching-and that is the only way to describe it to hear of the plight that many grower families are finding themselves locked into at the moment. Some of them are really in absolutely impossible circumstances, owing vastly more than their leases are currently worth and in situations where one wonders how they are able to make any rational management decisions let alone personal decisions in an attempt to keep their personal lives together. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know you will forgive me for making that observation about the extraordinary personal pain that many of those people are feeling. Indeed, it has been an incredibly rough few years for the wool industry. Firstly, of course, they copped Labor's deliberately engineered, debilitating record high interest rates and the wider rural depression, which still has not ended despite some of the extraordinarily beat-up rhetoric that we hear from those opposite. Then we saw wool growers suffering a situation where their own industry collapsed and prices collapsed, tumbled, to record low levels, magnifying the hardship that most were already experiencing. Then, just as things were beginning to tum around, the worse drought in living memory has struck eastern Australia, again denying those who have been left with the opportunity to consolidate and secure their futures in the industry a reasonable chance of securing their own best interests. Now those growers face a new chapter in the crisis, this one triggered by the continuing absence of key buyers from the market despite, as I have already said, the industry broadly agreeing that the market fundamentals tum are sound. There is good evidence for believing that the fundamentals are set to provide good hope of a reasonable recovery; we just hope it comes quickly enough. The supply of wool is significantly below historical demand and on a par with total sales in 1994-5 of about 770 million kilograms, including stockpiled wool. There has been a lot of focus on the activities of Wool International in handling the stockpile, the fixed release schedule. That was put in place at a time of enormous uncertainty-when the price of wool was below 400c a kilo, when the industry was just going backwards out the door so fast that you could not see it for dust. It removed the uncertainty of that dark cloud of the stockpile and the suggestion that noone knew when or how it might be dumped onto the market at a critical time in the industry's future. That approach undergirded a resurgence of confidence in the industry. The industry purchasers of wool, in particular, came to see that there really was an intention this time to provide confidence, security and a definite way forward to end the chopping, the changing and the uncertainty that had occurred in the period surrounding the collapse of the reserve price scheme. I think that confidence played a major part in the substantial recovery that the industry made and which we had all hoped to see continue unabated from the time of around two years-plus ago that it was introduced. Of course, we saw the price rise, as I said a moment ago, from those sub-400c levels up to its peak in May of this year of a reasonably respectable 800c a kilo-plus sort of level. So, as I have already mentioned, in terms of Wool International's activities there have been some concerns. There is no doubt thatjust as any stockpile sales will depress the market, even in a rising market-restricting the amount of wool coming onto the market helped to secure confidence and did not see the market dampened by the flooding of wool onto it out of the stockpile. Unfortunately, in a falling market, it continues to have that depressing effect but it becomes much more marked, and the issue of the actual mechanisms involved in the sale of wool becomes much more controversial. So we find that, indeed, there has been an unfortunate amount of speculation about the activities of Wool International in the sense that, whilst I understand there have been some concerns-and I have shared some of those concerns and have talked to Wool International about them and will continue to talk to Wool International about them-the idea of public speculation, public disagreement, I suspect, has been very unhelpful in some of its more extreme forms. I think the industry needs to think long and hard about that particular aspect of the industry as it exists 1999. I suspect that other industries with similar difficulties would be much more careful about their public airing of those difficulties. The other point I want to make is this: it needs to be remembered that it is not as though Wool International is putting vast amounts of wool onto the market. In fact, if you looked at the declining fresh wool supply, you would see that we are actually well below what the marketplace might reasonably have been expected to absorb. That, in itself, is quite concerning-although it does highlight one point: the relatively modest amount of wool being placed on the market by Wool International is far from the problem and, even if it were not there, one suspects that the market would be facing problems of an almost similar magnitude to those we are now facing. The trade is now speculating that the 199596 clip-forecast to be just 640 million kilograms-may now be even lower, at around 580 million kilograms, while another 130 million kilograms will be sold from the stockpile under the fixed reduction schedule managed by Wool International. That underlines my point that the total volume of wool coming onto the market is well below what any of us might reasonably have assumed the market would have been prepared to purchase at reasonable prices. To put it another way, the market might have been at a level where supply and demand factors would have been such as to guarantee reasonably firm and acceptable values. We are looking obviously at some broader problems. Just briefly, the generally weak demand for wool in the key markets of Europe and Japan and the continuing absence of Australia's biggest customer of recent years-that is, China-from the auction room are the key factors behind the price collapse. However, the market is expected to tum around as the trade begins to look seriously at the supply outlook and realise that there simply will not be as much wool around next year. All this serves to highlight one problem that I want to look at for a moment-that is, the in inadequate development of selling options available to wool growers. I have to say that, to date, the industry has developed these alternative mechanisms at a very slow pace, despite the obvious need for them. In virtually any other industry, growers would have locked at least a proportion of their production into forward contracts. I think, by any agreement, that would have offered growers the option of significantly reducing their exposure to the current downturn. I know it is often said that there are differences between the industries and so forth. Nonetheless, the fact is that cotton growers do it and grain growers do it. I am a grain grower. I have locked in a considerable amount of my production this year. There is always an element of risk in that but, in my assessment, there is an even greater risk in not going down that road. I have forward sold a reasonable amount of my grain, which we started doing as early as June this year. We do this because it makes, on balance, good sense. The problem for wool growers is that their options are not as freely available or as well understood and developed as they might be. A bit of prodding is needed, a fact that was widely acknowledged when Wool International was created two years ago. Perhaps this unfortunate reminder of the vulnerability of being substantially locked into one selling system might kick the progress along a bit further. The availability of forward contracting is widespread at every level of the wool industry, except at the farm gate. There is a responsibility incumbent upon those in the trade, in very blunt and simple terms, to fix the problems. Therefore, I issue a challenge to the players-the brokers, the buyers and the exporters-to get in there, have a go at this and make things happen. Growers need better access to forward selling mechanisms. It is not in the interests of anyone in the wool industry for growers to be left to the wolves-to the vagaries of the spot market-on the salesroom floor. Let us be realistic about this-in the absence of any statutory arrangements for price stabilisation, it is up to the industry and the private sector to develop mechanisms that allow growers to plan ahead, budget and rule out that extraordinary volatility. I suppose you could say that that volatility is usually the vehicle that drives the development of marketplace mechanisms to hedge and smooth out price volatility. Let us hope in this case that these mechanisms start to develop a bit quicker. It also has to be said, in fairness to the rest of the industry, that if there is no certainty for growers there is no certainty for anybody else in the wool trade. The industry's middle men may like a system in which growers take all the risk but in a free market that is unsustainable. There is a clear message for all players--change or perish. To return to the present crisis, I want to stress a point made very succinctly and very importantly last week by Charles Armstrong, the President of the Wool Council of Australia, when he said that the trade had to recognise that the wool supply is dwindling. It is, of course, ultimately responsive to market supply and demand signals. Mr Armstrong-I do not think I can overemphasise the importance of this-said: Sooner or later processors have got to realise that if they want to keep machinery running they are going to have to start sending some signals to growers to start producing some more wool. An end to industry infighting and a return to the market by buyers waiting to see how far the price will slump would be a very good start to restoring the industry and its confidence. I thank the House and emphasise that the coalition will be opposing the bills before us this morning.",45
51,Mr SNOW,PRIMARY INDUSTRIES LEVIES AND,"Eden-Monaro) (11.56 a.m.)Primary industry in Australia has moved in a very interesting way over the last century. The first member for Eden-Monaro- Sir Austin Chapman, a racehorse breeder and hotel owner who lived in Braidwood, which is still in the electorate-was a member of the protectionist party. It is hard to imagine a member of the protectionist party being elected, but, as I recall, he was a member for 21 years. From a very strong attitude of protectionism there was a move to what was called orderly marketing. That was a very good way of government trying to get some order into some very big problems that existed in primary industry. Nevertheless, orderly marketing was not the end to advancement in primary industry. I can recall wheat being raffled by the local branch of the Labor Party in Nhill, where I once lived. The wheat was being sold over the state border so that it could avoid the orderly marketing procedures at the time. Then many farmers and farming industries-the farming organisations well before many of the farmers-moved to a free trade attitude. I can recall only a couple of years ago an old farmer coming to see me, suggesting that Australia should forget about worrying about overseas markets and should try to sell its produce in Australia. He was a wool grower. I pointed out that Australia uses no more than two per cent of the total wool clip so we cannot avoid taking into full account our overseas markets. We have a very strong relationship. At the present time we sell to Asia a total of $14 billion more in goods than it sells to us, but we still have a long way to go. We can add value to our primary products. As our colleague the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) often suggests, we should talk about import replacement. There is plenty that we could be doing here that we are not doing. There is a long way to go. None of the previous answers-protectionism, orderly marketing or free trade-are the complete picture if we want to do our best and maximise job opportunities and productivity. Our primary industries have a pretty good record of productivity and for that reason I can understand why governments are often exhorted to reduce government interference and to have a policy whereby government can leave as much as possible to industry. But when we look at the items we are dealing with-levies and charges-we can understand why there is government involvement. I know that government has said to industry, 'Look, you raise your own funds. If you want to levy people, do it yourselves and leave us out of it.' Of course, industry has said, 'Well, there are some people in our industry who will not cooperate unless you actually pass legislation that will put these levies and charges in place.' The government has said, 'All right, we will do that, but we will appoint a body to administer these levies and charges.' So we have the various industry bodies that have been appointed to do just that. But still there are problems; there are people for whom levies are not suitable and there are people who do not want to be involved with them. There are others that it does suit. For instance, in the meat industry, people have gone so far as to take legal action to try to avoid levies, even though their industry has promoted the idea. There is much we can do in individual production areas in primary industry, and I will refer to four or five of those areas in the electorate of Eden-Monaro where there is government involvement but where we can still do more, and also where we can do less. In the area of beef production and beef exports, we have a potential to develop markets, particularly in Korea and Japan. We also have the potential to improve productivity in Australia by having more efficiency in our meat inspection system. I believe this is the way we ought to move to develop our beef policies. The Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Anderson) has talked about the need to keep up our production of wool. That is a very important point because, as we found in the mchair industry, once the mills stop producing a particular product and divert to something else-whether it is man-made or animal fibre-it takes a while for the producer to get back to producing the fibre that they were originally producing. So it is very important that we look at that delicate matter of getting wool production right so that we can keep mills around the world wanting this still outstanding fibre. We must also make sure that, as the government gets out of the activity, there is a proper say for farmers. For instance, we need to ensure that, if Wool International is privati sed, farmers will have a say in what happens. I welcome the actions of the farm organisations. In the electorate of Eden Monaro the New South Wales Farmers Association has been moving around talking to farmers about the alternatives available to them with a privati sed Wool International, and people have been able to have their say. Unfortunately, for some years the New South Wales Farmers Association was seen as a politically biased organisation; farmers started to fall away from it as they lacked faith in organisation. Now I can say that the New South Wales Farmers Association is genuinely getting around to get the views of all farmers. It will increase its membership if it gives farmers and other people a say and takes attitude which is perhaps less partisan politiwhich cally. The dairy industry is another industry which has supported the idea of levies and charges, which is what this legislation is about. They also need to be given a say, as they are regularly given a say through Ausdairy. Pat Riley, the head of the dairy industry, television just this week saying that the dairy industry was very dependent on the success of the Uruguay Round. Before I conclude, there are other commodia ties produced in the electorate which I ought to mention briefly. In the fishing industry have the old-fashioned system carrying on common farming and going out, almost in a nomadic fashion, hunting and gathering, one could say, in the different sectors of the fishing industry. We have quotas, government involvement and interferforest ence. There needs to be more flexibility here. In relation to that quota distribution, instance, I know that the government is giving sympathetic consideration this year to sentations from the tuna industry, which saying that it has not been able to catch fish and yet it has a deadline of the end of ber to catch its quota for the end of this year. I am pleased that the government are conI sidering extending that deadline. representations that they extend the deadline to the end of November and that the new start on 1 December. I hope that happens. I am urging the minister to allow that to hapia pen so that the tuna industry can take advanThis tage of the stocks that are moving around. I also welcome the fact that the United Nations has now come to some agreement with a whole range of countries. I believe that about 37 countries will probably, by the end of the year, have ratified an agreement on southern bluefin tuna conservation. It is that the tuna industry has been harmed by some countries-Indonesia, Taiwan, Korearemind that have not been involved in any agreement the in fishing stock, and overfishing stock in some cases. Then those countries are involved with another country which is involved in the agreement and which appears to be taking some of their fish; that is, Japan. So there is an now agreement through the United Nations I hope will bind all those countries, although Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations at this stage, unfortunately. I hope those countries will come to agreement so that the tuna industry is approached with that very important condition that there be a quota set by the various countries involved in was on fishing southern bluefin tuna. I pay full credit to the commercial fisheries and, in particular in the electorate of Eden Monaro, to Ron Snape, who has spearheaded claim on government that we ought to be taking action against other countries when we we are putting restrictions on our own people in of people the fishing industry. I briefly mention the timber industry. It is extremely important that reserve forest agreements come as soon as possible. It is extremely important that we abide by the national policy. It is extremely important that we say to the environmental groups where we for draw the line, even though they continually say, 'No. We will not come to any conclusive repreagreement with anyone because we never is know what new agenda might come up.' With all these industries we can have a prosperous Octoregion, which includes the ACT and southwestern New South Wales, if we get it right. believe that efficiency in each of these I have made industries is high. I just learned at the Commonwealth Parliayear mentary Conference that recent satellite pictures taken of the world show that Australlooks more green than any other country. is astonishing when you consider what the countries of the world were like when satellites started going around not so very many years ago. It was about 35 years ago that satellites started taking pictures of the world and it was a much greener world then. But Australia is holding its own. We need to true remind people about this when they are talking about our timber industry . We need to people that we are importing a huge amount of timber and will import even more as we restrict production here in Australia. It is very important that the farm organisations, particularly the National Farmers Federation, pursue a multipartisan approach within this parliament. I believe part of the reason they have been able to get agreement with government is that the government has a lot of rural members within it-many of them with a fairly independent streak who are prepared to speak out for primary industries, and many of them who are prepared to listen to the people in their electorates and bring view here to government. I believe we ought to support the legislation.",49
52,Mr TUCKEY,PRIMARY INDUSTRIES LEVIES AND," in This primary industries legislation is legislation which, as our shadow minister for priabout mary industries, the Deputy Leader of the ated National Party of Australia (Mr Anderson), has clearly indicated, the coalition opposes. One of the reasons we oppose it was just demonstrated by the member for Edenrequired Monaro (Mr Snow). Legislation of this nature has frequently created the opportunity for the sort of wide ranging debate the member Eden-Monaro was able to indulge in with no objection. I think it is one of the few opporhave tunities that people who represent electorates with rural interests have to make contributions of this nature which, hopefully, will be helpful to the people of their electorate. I am concerned that we are gradually streamlining this parliament out of existence. Clearly, legislation that imposes what is technically at least a tax should have exposure in this parliament and should give opportuniquently ties to members to discuss the issues and possibly represent the arguments of their constituents which might be in conflict-and I want to go further on this subject-with those of their so-called farmer representatives. industry. We have a very peculiar view of the word 'industry' in this parliament. We think it the Wool Councilor the Grains Councilor one of the major farmer organisations. It is my own understanding-and the evidence that comes to me is legion-that quite frequently the people out there who produce the grain and produce the wool and produce these other commodities do not necessarily support views that are expounded by the half a dozen or so who claim to be the 'industry' in those terms. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary that some commodity group secretary cannot just pick up the phone and say to the minister for agriculture or primary industry or whatever, 'Listen, we want you to put another couple of cents or one or two per cent on this particular commodity.' It is appropriate that those matters come to the parliament for debate. You might say to me, 'There is always the the disallowance power in regulations.' That is a negative approach, not a positive approach. For instance, someone might want to stand up this place and say the levy is not enough. Furthermore, and notwithstanding there are 59 separate pieces of legislation associwith this so-called streamlining, the facts are that when the legislation is brought in, as we all know, the levy-whatever it is-is usually set substantially higher than what is immediately. Regulations are then provided for in that legislation to crank it up to that top figure, but at least the parliament for has approved that top figure. I see no need for this legislation. In fact, I concerns that it is a mechanism to allow a very limited number of people to come forward and start taxing their fellow producers. Many of them, as we know in this day and age of the Canberra lobby, are not producers at all-the ones who pick up the phone and ask for the levy to be increased. They might be the recipient of some of that levy by way of their salary. They are frepeople with academic backgrounds, et cetera, who are hired to run the various lobby groups, or whatever their label might be here in Canberra. They are not primary producers. They seldom consult the wider The Primary Industries Charges Bill 1995 is and the Primary Industries Levies Bill 1995 tend to replace 59 separate levy and charge acts for a variety of primary industry products and allow the operative rates of those charges to be set by regulation specific to each industry or product, as is the case at present. My first point is that there is nothing wrong with the that process. My second point is that we created the Main Committee. I can see myself standing up in this parliament supporting the government initiative of the Main Committee on the grounds that it was to be used for classic bills which frequently had quite long speakers lists but which were nevertheless not opposed. But people wanted to speak because it was the pig levy bill or the wheat levy bill or something and they wanted the opportunity to represent the interests of their constituents on that issue. As was the case with the member for Eden-Monaro, nobody jumped up and took a point of order and said he was not relevant to the legislation. It has been a convention of this place that on those pieces of legislation there can be a wide ranging debate and the participants are usually from both sides of the House. Why knock that opportunity out? It is silly. In a disallowance you cannot do that; you cannot make those positive contributions. You could not certainly, in trying to disallow some levy on wheat, make some references to the tuna industry, as the member for Eden-Monaro just did and to which I have no objection. The Australian Farm Journal of October 1994 ran this headline on its cover-'Farm levies: The 750m tax 'grab'.' That particular grab extends somewhat past the particular issues of promotion and research that we are dealing with today. What did it say in that article? It said: Australian farmers were taxed $750 million-an average of $5,000 each-last financial year to fund the multitude of statutory bodies that control rural marketing, promotion, research and export inspection. So it's little wonder that some farmers are to hack away this costly Federal Government bureaucracy that has flourished despite the decline in farm profits. Major rural commodities such as wool, beef and wheat are knee-deep in statutory bodies, each sucking tax from farming incomes. Wool growers, most with the backsides out of their trousersand those who got them stitched up a year or so ago are now seeing them being tom apart againpaid $216 million in 1993-94 to fund a wool bureaucracy even though wool marketing is now completely deregulated. FARMERS TO BLAME: But farmers largely have themselves to blame for this large-scale bureaucratic intrusion into their lives and bottom lines. I have just made the point and I would like to repeat it. I am not sure that individual farmers are the ones who have been asking for many of these levies, nor are they too keen to pay them. They are simply not consulted. I will give a classic example relating to these commodity groups-these so-called farmers' representatives. I noticed in correspondence I received from Victoria the other day that they call themselves the voice of the wheat and meat industry. I will tell you about their voice. These various farmer groups went off to get a briefing from Wool International. They are the people who would be demanding these increases by adding these increases by regulation. Before they were allowed in the front door they voluntarily signed confidentiality agreements stating that they would not come out and tell their constituents what they were told in there. Who is Wool International? It is a statutory body created by legislation of this place. It could be considered a government institution, but it is conducting the affairs of wool growers. It has the temerity to try to ambush its own constituency and sit down and make plans behind closed doors, which it knows very well the general wool growing community does not want to have a bar of. I am talking of some private company arbitrarily funded by wool growers' money that is to be used to give some very cushy jobs and possibly substantial financial profit to a few people who currently have the job of disposing of the wool stockpile. Why would these people believe that anything they are doing or trying thinking about should be held under a confidentiality agreement? Any information emanating from that place is the property of the wool growers of Australia. We should not see this sort of performance. Yesterday I received a letter from Rod Thirkell-lohnston, President of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association, who reckons it is a great idea to keep his members in the dark. I got a similar letter from Victoria. If I had it with me, I would quote that name too. I find it totally outrageous that so called representatives of the rural industry believe that they are entitled to conduct negotiations behind closed doors on matters directly affecting the future welfare of wool growers and keep them a secret. You wait till you have got all you guns loaded and then you pull your poor constituents out and shoot them down. The same thing is going on with the wheat industry fund and the Australian Wheat Board. The position of the coalition is that the Wheat Board can remain as a statutory authority and conduct the business of wheat growers in the export market-and I guess in the local market, although I believe that that has not been beneficial to grain growers. But, putting that aside, our policy is not only that the AWB will survive in its present form but also that we will continue to give it loan guarantees of advance harvest payments prior to the sale of grain of up to 95 per cent of the international price of that grain. That is our position, and that is quite acceptable to me. The very people who run the Wheat Board are telling farmers that it has got to be privatised, but only on one condition: that they get the sole monopoly to manage the single desk operation of all wheat exports within Australia. Why would you give a private company that responsibility? I think the Wheat Board is a very interesting example. To me, years and years ago, the Wheat Board was not a company; it was not a seller of wheat. It was the grounds upon which I got the guaranteed minimum price for my grain. It was the body which handled the single desk operation. Of course, we have seen the guaranteed minimum price whittle away; it does not exist in the form that it did. Under the previous formula, back in February and March, a grower could sit down at the kitchen table and draw up a budget for his bank manager. He was able to say, 'If I harvest this much wheat, this is the price I'll get for it, irrespecknow tive of the world market.' That formula also reflected the world market so that it did not distort planning intentions. That was a good formula. The wheat growers are now being told that in order to protect the single desk operation, which is the only good thing left about the Wheat Board in its present form, they have got to put $500 million of their own money into shares to keep the Wheat Board alive. This is the only way the Wheat Board will have enough money to pay them a first advance. But it is not paying them a first advance; they are paying their own first advance. Furthermore, that money could be lost because those who currently run the Wheat Board want to expand their business activities into some very dangerous areas. A little while ago they were trying to buy Graincorp in Queensland. One of their intentions was to go into lot feeding. What a nice place that would be to invest shareholders' money at the moment. These are the things that wheat growers do not want. Furthermore, the wheat growers do not like having to pay the WIF levy, which to many represents something like 125 per cent of their net returns. There are wheat growers in the electorate of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) whose WIF levy is more than their net return. An article in the Australian Farm Journal mentioned the fact that these levies add up to substantial amounts of money when they are measured against the net farming return, not the gross farming return. Let me run through who pays what levies according to that article: wool growers, $216 million; dairy farmers, $160 million; AQIS, $140 million; grain growers, $66 million-that amount would probably be covered in this legislation; beef producers, $57 million; sheep meat producers, $25 million; pig farmers, $11 million; fruit and vegetable growers, $10 million-that is an absolute dog's breakfast; cotton growers, $4 million; sugar producers, $3 million; and poultry producers, $1.5 million. Here we are trying to bring in something that, for all intents and purposes, is going to hide this process from parliament. We all how these particular levies and disallowance motions work. There is no formal announcement that certain regulations are being brought before the parliament. Most members of parliament, unless they study the Notice Paper assiduously, unless they understand what the actual levy proposal is or unless they get a phone call from someone saying, 'We have just come to discover that a new levy is going to be added on some particular rural commodity and we would like you to oppose it,' do not even know that they are there. Let us compare that with the parliamentary debate we are having at the moment. We are properly notified of it. There are first reading speeches, second reading speeches and explanatory memorandums, and we get the opportunity to come in here, make a contribution and support or oppose it. The parliament, through the creation of the Main Committee, has plenty of time to do these exercises, even if they are supported by both sides and there is no opposition. One of the problems we have is that these so-called industry groups have started to get the feeling that it is not so easy to con their constituencies into these levy increases, that people have had enough of them, and it is they that are demanding of government that a mechanism be put in place so that the operation is not as transparent as it used to be. This is the mechanism. They call it 'streamlining'. I have never, in 15 years of membership of this place, perceived any great difficulty in dealing with these matters. I frequentin ly contribute. I make sure, as did the member for Eden-Monaro a few minutes ago, that I take the opportunity to raise some of the broader issues-which my constituents welcome-which gives the opportunity for issues to be considered in the wider community. It is an opportunity to achieve change. We all know, particularly backbenchers, that you do not get the opportunity to stand up in the parliament and propose motions on different issues. This is a great opportunity to do so. All in all, the legislation is unnecessary. The parliament does have the time to debate these matters. It is right and proper that the matter should be dealt with by legislation, particularly when it has never been the case that we come in here and add every half a cent, or whatever, by a new piece of legislation. Time and again it comes in and is presented as a 5c levy, of which 2c is to be used immediately. We have got the streamlining at an adequate level, and it is wrong of members of parliament to vote to support to hide the processes of government in this manner. It would be interesting to see how much thought the caucus gave to this issue in terms of either need or propriety of this measure. But I do. I think it is all around us, and I am an open critic of the performance these days of so many of the commodity councils and farmer organisations. We saw them come out through their bureaucracies at the NFF and attack the coalition when it suggested that we should reinstate the fodder subsidy . We saw that stop dead in its tracks. What was the outcome? The government had its own inquiry as to the adequacy of its measures. What did the inquiry come out and say? 'You should have had a fodder subsidy.' One has only to go back to the history of the Fraser fodder subsidy . Yes, we had some problems with some people abusing the process, but there were thousands of beneficiaries, and one of the greatest happened to be the Hawke Labor government. It inherited the rain after that particular drought. Of course, that is referred to as bad economic management. This drought is a drought. The last one 1982-83 was bad economic management. They were both droughts, of course, and they had similar effects. The simple fact is that, because Fraser had protected the breeding flocks through his fodder subsidy, when it rained there was an immediate expansion in the breeding program and everything got back to normal. This time, as we know, it is going to take a long time. It is another example of how the various farmer organisations are losing their way in representing the interests of the rural community. It is not appropriate that we give them another measure to tax their own constituents without the proper scrutiny of this parliament. As I say, this is not the only occasion on which this has occurred. We see it all the time. We see question time being abused through the roster process, and everywhere you look in this parliament we are being streamlined out of existence. (Time expired)",52
53,Mr CAMPBELL,PRIMARY INDUSTRIES LEVIES AND,"My office tells me that today is my 15th birthday as a member of parliament. It is a fact I have not checked; it is depressing enough just to be told it. With regard to the Primary Industries Levies Bill and cognate bills, I have to say that I actually agree with some of the comments by the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). I certainly agree more with what he said than with what the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) said. He came in here in his usual style, which I think is best described as eloquent waffle, and very quickly moved from the bill itself to a very wide ranging discussion on the wool industry. I note that the member for O'Connor chided the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) for doing that. The truth is that you cannot speak for more than two minutes on this bill because there is not really a lot to discuss, so I think it is important that we have a wide ranging discussion. To suggest that we are inhibiting the discussion of agricultural problems by taking this measure to amalgamate 59 separate levies into one bill is fully absurd. I point out to members that the things we have inflicted on the industry were all done under the process which they now say is so vital and which they are now making an act of principle in order to try to maintain it. Clearly, it is just plain nonsense. I do not think this legislation is particularly important legislation. It certainly will not have the dire consequences that the opposition talks about. The member for Gwydir told us that he was opposing it. Having listened carefully to him, I still do not know why he is opposing it. What he said certainly made no sense. I believe this bill will have a beneficial impact if it starts to get growers in Australia to take a genuine interest in their industry and start to fight for their industry. So many times, growers have taken the attitude that they will just do their little bit-they will grow the product and what happens to it is not their concern. I know that in the wool industry in particular the level of information that growers had about their industry was simply appalling. I add that the level of information that their so-called representatives had was often equally appalling. What we are looking at here is a power to legislate to collect levies or taxes on an industry. I believe, as the member for O'Connor does, that too often the industry itself does not know the full ramifications of the levies and charges raised against it. But that is a problem that the industry has to face. There must be a lot more discussion within the industry. It is absurd to say we are going to advance that simply by having this debate in the parliament when, as the member for O'Connor has already said, the present legislation in most cases allows for changes in the tax level to be done by regulation in any Case. There is just no internal consistency in their argument. I suspect that we find ourselves talking for 20 minutes or so on this piece of legislation today simply to fill in time. However, it does, as the member for O'Connor pointed out, give an opportunity for members to raise concerns about the industry. I listened to the member for Gwydir. I have never heard, quite frankly, so much agro-socialist drivel. He came in here, as he does, and said most piously that everybody in the wool industry should be taking action to ensure that wool growers are looked after. There is only one group that has the responsibility for looking after wool growers, and that is wool growers. They can do this. They have to recognise what their industry is about. When I was a wool grower in the early 1970s I actively supported the Wool Board very strongly in the establishment of a guaranteed price. I now realise that I was mistaken. However, in the early days, when the board was pitching its price at a cost something below the average cost of production, it probably did not do a great deal of harm. The member for Gwydir seems to think that growers must have some guarantee of returns. This is not the problem for wool growers at all. It is not the occasional bad sales that affect wool growers. It is the continual application of prices that are only marginally above their cost of production over a long time. That is what destroys the wool industry. That is what takes the incentive out of it. That is what makes it impossible to find the capital to keep their infrastructure in place and up to scratch. If we look at the price of wool in 1986 terms, we see that it has cycled through 700c, 21h times every 10 years, and it has done that for as long as records have been kept. In the good years, that has enabled growers to get the benefit of these higher returns and to refurbish their infrastructure. Holding the price at a lower level for a prolonged time has simply denied that. Many growers have now come to realise that that is the case. I have heard growers say, and this has been said to me on many occasions, 'This is outrageous! Myers or David Jones make more money out of my wool than I do.' Of course they do. They have a lot more money invested in the farmers' wool than the farmer does, so of course they are going to be seeking greater returns from it. I do not have any philosophical commitment to free trade. In fact, I have argued very strongly against it and, in some circumstances, I would argue that it simply does not exist. In reality, there is no such thing as a level playing field. But there are clearly some industries which are better served by a free market approach than they are by regulation, and I submit that wool is one of those markets. That is because the product is a unique product for Australia. It is, in a sense, the only product we have which has any form of uniqueness. We control a very significant part of the garment fibre market throughout the world, but what do we see happening? We see an inability to recognise the advantages we have-the enormous advantages we have from 150 years of luck and 150 years of selective breeding-to develop this unique fibre, which is not just wool but merino wool. We are busily giving it away. I cannot think of anything more crazy. This is going to do far more damage to the industry than how these levies here are implemented, yet is there any discussion? Yes, there is discussion. If you go out and talk to farmers you find that, overwhelmingly, they want it stopped-and stopped immediately and completely. Last year I spent some time talking to stud growers in New Zealand. It is quite obvious that New Zealand has a well-established fine wool business. It is quite pointless Australia stopping the supply of genetic material if New Zealand is going to continue to do it. I found overwhelming support from the stud breeders in New Zealand who said, 'Look, the only reason we are doing it is that it is legal and, if we don't, somebody else will. But we would like to stop it. We recognise the long term danger that this poses to Australia.' We talk about wool dwindling. Wool production in Australia is dwindling and will continue to dwindle while the returns on wool are as they are. But that is not necessarily the case overseas. China is seeking-and remember that China is presently our biggest customer-to upgrade its wool so that it is more useful for export garments. How do they do that? The quickest way is to buy Australian genetic material. It is clearly not in our interests to help them do this. We are told by the economists that the Australian merino is a product of the cost of land in Australia and the climate. Obviously that has been a factor. But these situations are duplicated in many other parts of the world. The cost of land in some eastern European countries is now cheaper than much more inferior land in Australia. The Italians, who are certainly no fools in the wool business, are taking renewed interest in South America. I notice that the flocks have had a bit of a bashing in South America in recent times, but they are going to expand again. With Italian technology, or the use of Australian technology by the Italians, you can expect to see a rapid increase in the quality of South American wool, undermining once more our market niche in the world. Yet we are told that this legislation denies primary producers an opportunity to have things discussed. The truth is that we do not listen to them anyway. We never did. On serious issues, they are ignored. I actually brought into my caucus a motion to ban the export of merino genetic material. After a lot of trouble and going through all the due forms of the caucus I got it through the caucus, only to have the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) come in and overturn it. Obviously he was advised by people from Wool International and the Wool Council, which, as the member for O'Connor has acknowledged, simply do not represent wool growers. You see this in many other areas as well. To suggest that this legislation is going to make that problem worse is simply nonsense. It is a device which tidies up the existing legislation. It saves some time in this House, although I do not think that is of great importance nor the main reason for its introduction. We have to look at the long-term future of primary industries. What is happening? Let us take the timber industry as an example. The member for Eden-Monaro is absolutely right: the truth of the matter is-and this ought to be rammed down the throat of every man, woman and child in this land-that Australia has arguably the best forest management in the world. Western Australia probably has the best of that, although Tasmania is also very good. There has not been one single acre of land lost to forestry. Forestry has not caused the demise of one single acre of the forest. The forest land lost has been lost to industry and overwhelmingly to farming. Forestry has always sought to restore the land that it cuts because that is its very lifeblood. It is also true that when you hamper or hinder the forest industry in Australia you drive it offshore to countries where there are no environmental standards. That has to be recognised and that ought to be drummed into the head of every school child in Australia, instead of feeding them the sloppy mixture of green lies that seem to be a substantial part school diets today-and it is certainly an indictment on primary school teachers. This is where lies the great danger to Australia's national interest, particularly to the interests of rural producers. In the timber industry we have a $2 billion a year deficit. We import $2 billion of timber products which we could easily produce in this country. We could easily produce more and more and have it as a net exporter. It is a substantial industry. When you close it down, you close it down in areas where there is no alternative. So you tum thriving rural communities with a work ethic into communities simply of recipients of social security where the work ethic is quickly destroyed and pride is taken over by despondency. That is not the sort of Australia. I want but that is the sort of Australia that is happening. It is happening not because of this sort of legislation but because we are not listening to what producers are saying-and we are, in fact, distorting the facts. My mind goes back to 1974 when I approached leading people in the environmental movement in Western Australia with a view to getting some interest in soil erosion salinity. It is now the most important environmental problem. I was told not to worry about erosion-'Nobody goes out to look at erosion on the weekend. Get with the trees; that's where the power is.' The forest debate has never been about the environment; it has always been about power-and that should have been recognised. But those are the sorts of things that are tearing at the fabric of rural Australia. I have quoted in this place before-and they are worth quoting again-the words of one of America's great presidents, President Lincoln. He said that, if every city in America were destroyed, rural America would rebuild them; but if rural America were destroyed, it would be passed over by grass. That is true of America, but it is even more true of this nation-and that is not recognised. The truth is that both political parties know that if they win big in Melbourne and Sydney the rest of the country really does not matter. If you ask yourself, 'What do Melbourne and Sydney of actually produce?' the answer is, 'Not very much.' I urge opposition members to think about their position and to support this legislation. It is not legislation of great consequence. It certainly will not have the dire consequence they are talking about. It does streamline proceedings and it may have a beneficial consequence in that it may force farmers, rural producers, to take a real interest in and have real discussion about their own industry. In concluding, I just want to say that what we ought to be discussing and looking at in this parliament is how to deal with the recurring problem of drought. It was said by the member for O'Connor that feed subsidies are the answer. Feed subsidies are not the answer. They are clearly inefficient, they are clearly a very incompetent way of using the dollar and they are clearly open to a lot of fraud and exploitation. We need to have a look at income equalisation. We need to have a form of income equalisation that really does benefit farmers so that they can take responsibility for their own future, just as in wool. Wool futures are a very useful tool. But they are not a tool for gambling; they are a tool for individual farmers to protect their income. If you leave those wool futures in the hands of an organised body, it will not be able to resist using them for gambling, and that is what they will become. They are a tool not for making the quick quid but for guaranteeing a level of desired income. That can and should best be done by farmers. If the farmer himself does not feel capable, he should go and see a broker. If that broker's performance is not satisfactory, the farmer should simply sack him and try someone else. Income equalisation bonds that really do give farmers the ability to utilise their good seasons, instead of paying their income off in taxes and the next year becoming recipients of government grants, would be by far the best way to do it. But it cannot be done overnight. Given the cyclic nature of the seasons in Australia, I think what you have to say is, 'In five years time this will be the rule, but in the meantime we are starting today with the process' - just as we did with gold producers. We said to gold producers in 1986, 'We're going to tax you. We're going to apply the company tax regime to you. We won't do it until 1 January 1991 but, until that time, you can claim all your expenditure as deductions.' That is the sort of thing we ought to be providing to farmers. If we did that, it would protect the breeding stocks far more than the proposal put forward and lauded by the member for O'Connor. I would certainly urge the government to look at this in respect of protecting the beef herd. Once again, I will be putting to the Treasury a scheme which I believe will provide protection for the beef herd-protection which is absolutely necessary for the well-being not only of industry but, in my view, of the nation as a whole.",55
54,Mr WAKELIN,PRIMARY INDUSTRIES LEVIES AND,"I have no intention of taking up the full time of the House today. I will speak for a maximum of 10 minutes. I want to say a few things about the Primary Industries Charges Bill. The shadow minister has laid down the reasons for our opposition to the legislation. Simply put, it is based on the fact that the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills identified problems. The main problem was that a dangerous practice was involved in allowing ministers to effectively become responsible for setting the level of taxes. That is the basis of our opposition. The proposal to have a single framework for 59 separate le'Jies and charges, which are currently imposed on primary industry products, on the face l)f it may appear to have some merit. But, based on the Senate committee, the opposition cannot support the proposal. That said, I think there is a deeper reality about agriculture in our country. We wax lyrical in this place regularly, but we cannot deny our past and the fact that for 200 years agriculture has been predominant in the growth of this country as a trading nation, in our history, our culture and our economics. Something we have never come to terms with particularly well is the great variation that exists. I suppose it has something to do with distance and our urban based population. But there is not a very good understanding of that great variation. For instance, we see negative pictures of the drought. We see the stark pictures of dying or dead stock and crops that did not come to fruition, but we do not think about it any further. The extent of our interest these days is a 30-second news grab on the television screen, and that's it. A fundamental thing has affected the very basis of our nation. I can demonstrate that as simply as I can by saying that 37 of the 147 seats in the House of Representatives represent those with the lowest income in this country and all but two of those are in regional Australia. It was even more remarkable to me when I realised that of those bottom 37 seats, in terms of income, nearly three-quarters were represented by the coalition. The true low income people of Australia are represented by the coalition and come from regional Australia. There is in Australia what I would call an urban dominant culture. The challenge lies in dealing with what can be described as the national schizophrenia; that is, this nation's schizophrenia and its inability to recognise, the one hand, a CPI economy-which these levies and charges no doubt reflect in many cases, when there is a CPI increase-and, on the other, the productive base of agriculture. This huge variation which I have spoken about in this place on many occasions can, when you combine yield and price, have a factor of 10. You imagine your income is $10 per hour one day and $100 per hour the next day. It is more likely to be $10 at tops and a dollar in a drought, if you want to make comparisons. In other words, a variation of 10 at least is the factor to remember. There is a huge dynamic which we as nation do not really understand. I guess most of us do not care because, after all, most us are on CPI-linked salaries. It is one of most remarkable experiences for me to come to this place and be on a very good salary see that salary increase in line with the I must confess that I am somewhat embarwhole rassed by it when I consider the industry have come from. It does not recognise that huge impact. Another impact on the CPI costs is the famous fuel excise that the government collects so much revenue from$10 billion in the current financial year. When this government came to office there was collection of about $1.4 billion, but that only part of the story. Import parity pricing was then the order of the day. When the price of oil dropped on the international market, government said, 'We cannot do without that revenue so we will get it through excise.' In one go, the Labor government of the day said, 'Sorry, we believe in the level playing field, we believe in the international marketplace, we believe you should get only what you can get for your commodity from the international , market, but we have to ignore the cost side because we need the revenue.' Remember that in production, in small business, all indirect taxation comes off the top-it comes before people make a profit, before they make a living. That is the inequity. And what does that lead to? It leads to depopulation. People, particularly in metropolitan areas, are saying that much of on regional Australia will be depopulated as generations go by. I find that very hard to accept, and I give my electorate of Grey as an example. Fifty per cent of South Australia's exports come out of my electorate yet it ranks in the bottom 10 per cent of electorates by income. It has double the number of social security beneficiaries. It has 50 per cent above the national unemployment rate. So there are some key issues for me in the divide between metropolitan and rural and regional Australia. The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) touched on IEDs, the income equalisation a deposits. He acknowledged that he had been here for something like 15 years. I wish he of had been a little more persuasive with exthe Senator Peter Walsh 10 years ago when this current Labor government abolished that very and mechanism. I can only agree with the sentiCPI. ments he expressed about the drought. The premise of my case today is that there I is a strong ignorance of the huge variation within agriculture in our country. But all we see are those 30-second grabs on television. We do not acknowledge the long-term impact and agricultural of depopulation. I give another example. Why alIa, which is in my electorate, is the largest regional city in a South Australia. It has seen a depopulation was over the last 10 or 15 years from something like 34,000 or 35,000 down to 25,000 or 26,000. You might say, 'That is a BHP, steel the industry, secondary industry type of city. Whyalla is about shipbuilding; it has nothing to do with agriculture.' The reality is that it has quite a lot to do with agriculture. Much of the economy of Whyalla and the surrounding towns is dependent upon agriculture. There is the old story that it was the cockies forced off their land during the Depression who very much helped to build the modem steel industry at Why alIa. My constant complaint about my nation and this parliament is that there is insufficient recognition of the dominant urban culture and its effect on regional Australia. The biggest export producers have the smallest incomesyet there used to be debate in this country about distribution of wealth! I accept that there will always be great variation in agriculture. But the reality is that Langmore,1. V. to this point we have not come to terms with how we stop our urban sprawl and the unwise investment in that urban sprawl, and how we might build our regions and at least use-I have mentioned the case of Whyalla-the existing infrastructure. Whilst there is always some schizophrenia in politics, there is a great challenge for us to come up with policies which are more devoid of this schizophrenia which says that CPI is okay for those of us who are going all right but it is no good for those of us who happen to work in international market commodity areas. So we oppose this legislation, but predominantly for the machinery reasons that we do not think it is appropriate for ministers to become responsible for setting the level of taxes by regulation.

The purpose of these amendments is to add a new schedule to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1995, which will have the effect of amending the Dairy Produce Act 1986. The proposed schedule will amend the Dairy Produce Act 1986 to remove references to the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Act 1986 and the Dairy Produce Levy (No.2) Act 1986, and to reflect that, from 1 July 1996, dairy levies and charges will be imposed by regulation under the Primary Industries Levies Bill and the Primary Industries Charges Bill. The amendments to the Dairy Produce Act 1986 are required because of the repeal of the Dairy Produce Levy (No.1) Act 1986 and the Dairy Produce Levy (No.2) Act 1986. These repeals are already included in the consequential amendments bill. Because the dairy levy acts were in the process of being amended in the parliament when these bills were being drafted, the draftsmen did not draft the schedule in this consequential amendments bill, as the final cross-references would not have been correct until the amendments were passed. The proposed amendments are similar to other schedules in the consequential amendments bill for other commodities. The National Residue Survey (Dairy Produce) Act 1992 is being added to the list of acts to be repealed. It was not previously included, because of the uncertainty surrounding the dairy legislation undergoing amendment in the parliament. I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Elliott)-by leaveread a third time. NA NA Consideration resumed from 20 September. Second Reading",62
58,Mr GEAR,AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill 1995 will provide legislative authority for the entry into force of the comprehensive double taxation agreement between Australia and the Czech Republic. The bill will insert the text of the agreement into the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 as a schedule to that act. The agreement with the Czech Republic was signed on 28 March 1995. The agreement allocates taxing rights over all substantial forms of income flowing between Australia and the Czech Republic. Details of the agreement were announced and copies made publicly available at the time of signature. The agreement generally accords with the other comprehensive taxation agreements concluded by Australia in recent years. A feature of the agreement with the Czech Republic is that it is the first new agreement to include a revised dividends article which will have the effect of reducing Czech dividend withholding tax to five per cent in all cases where dividends are paid to an Australian resident company which holds directly at least 20 per cent of the capital of the Czech Republic company paying the dividends. The government believes that this new policy will go a long way to meeting the concerns expressed by the Australian business community that Australia's former tax treaty policy of limiting each country's foreign dividend withholding tax to a maximum of 15 per cent was a major disincentive to the repatriation of overseas earnings in the form of dividends to Australian resident shareholjers. The government also believes that the agreement will contribute positively to the strengthening of trade, investment, and wider relationships between Australia and the Czech Republic. The agreements will enter into force when 1995 diplomatic notes are exchanged advising that the necessary constitutional processes to give the agreement the force of law in both countries have been completed. The enactment of this bill will complete the processes required of Australia for those purposes. It is not possible to accurately predict the eventual effect of the agreement on the revenue, but it is not expected to be significant. Full details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House.",66
59,Mr ANDREWS,AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL,"Menzies) (1.22 p.m.)The International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill 1995, as the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has indicated, gives the force of law in Australia to a comprehensive double tax agreement signed with the Czech Republic on 28 March 1995 for the prevention of double taxation and the prevention of avoidance of taxes on income flows between the treaty partners. The agreement prevents double taxation by allocating taxing rights to Australia or the Czech Republic on all forms of income flows between the two countries. The basis of allocating the rights is substantially similar to adopted in Australia's other modem double taxation agreements such as that with New Zealand earlier this year. The agreement affects all taxpayers who, for the purposes of the double tax agreement, are residents of either Australia or the Czech Republic and who derive income, profits or gains from the other country. The double tax agreement applies to Australian income tax and resource rent tax in respect of offshore petroleum products. It does not extend to sales tax, fringe benefits tax, wool tax and levies, customs duties, state taxes and duties and the Medicare levy. It applies to taxes on income in the Czech Republic. The agreement will automatically extend to any identical or substantially similar taxes which are subsequently imposed by either country in addition to or in the place of existing taxes. Without going in great detail to the mechanism which is provided in the bill, the special features of the agreement relate to dividend withholding tax, interest on royalties, capital gains and the exchange of information. Under the agreement both countries are allowed tax dividends flowing between them but limits are imposed on the level of tax that the country of source may impose. The Czech Republic will reduce its dividend withholding tax rate to five per cent where dividends are paid to an Australian resident company which directly holds at least 20 per cent of the capital of the Czech Republic company paying dividends. In all other cases the normal Czech Republic dividend withholding rate of 25 per cent will be reduced to 15 per cent. Australia will impose a maximum dividend withholding tax rate of five per cent where Australian companies pay franked dividends to Czech residents provided the Australian domestic withholding tax on franked dividends is five per cent or less. Australia will also reduce its normal rate of withholding tax on franked dividends paid by Australian residents to Czech residents from 30 per cent to 15 per cent. The practical effect would seem to be that the terms are that Australia's domestic nonresident dividend withholding tax exemption that for franked dividends will continue to apply to dividends paid by Australian resident companies to Czech Republic residents. When you tum to the agreement itself, article 10 deals with dividends. In the first part of article 10, it is stated that dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a contracting state for the purposes of its tax, being dividends to which a resident of the other contracting state is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other state. Part 2 of article 10 then goes on to state: However, those dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident for the purposes of its tax, and according to the laws of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed: (a) in Australia: (i) 5 per cent of the gross amount of so much of the dividends as has been franked (with imputed company tax payments) in accordance with the laws of Australia relating to tax, where under those laws the rate of tax on franked dividends paid to a non-resident by a company which is a resident of Australia for the purposes of its tax does not exceed 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends; The question I have for the government and the Assistant Treasurer or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) in relation to that particular article is that it would appear to leave open the possibility of tax being imposed on franked dividends in circumstances where that tax is not imposed at the present time. I understand that a reading of article 10 indicates that it does not actually impose that tax, but it does seem to me that that possibility of tax being imposed in circumstances where it is not at the present time is certainly open on any reasonable interpretation of what that means. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, whether that means that there is some contemplation on the part of the government to change the tax treatment of franked dividends in relation to not only double tax agreements such as this but more generally franked dividends. The other major parts of the agreement, as I said, related to interest and royalties, gains and exchange of information, which I do not propose to address in any great detail. The final matter which I wish to raise in relation to this bill is that in July the government indicated that other double tax agreements might be finalised prior to the introduction of the bill, including double tax agreements with the Slovak Republic, Romania, Russia and Malaysia. So far as I am aware, there has not been any public announcement concerning the signing of any of these agreements. In June a joint statement was issued by the Australia-Russia Joint Commission for Trade and Economic Cooperation stating that a double tax agreement between Australia and Russia was 'almost ready for signature'. There has been no announcement regarding the signing of this particular agreement and I again take this opportunity of asking the government if the proposed agreements with those nations, notably the Slovak Republic, Romania, Russia and Malaysia, are in fact close to completion and when we might expect that such agreements will be made with those nations.",67
60,Mr LANGMORE,AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL,"Fraser) (1.29 p.m.)This International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill is entirely sensible and valuable. The system of double tax agreements is now well established and it is important to extend it to any country with which we have substantial economic relations, and therefore I completely support the bill. But I want to use this opportunity to talk about a broader issue within the general area of international taxation, and that is to do with the consequences of the effect of globalisation. Perhaps the dominant feature of the world at present is increasing integration of many aspects of the global economy. That is particularly clear in relation to financial markets but it is also true of the extent of growth of trade. Trade is growing at roughly double the rate of economic growth on average in countries. There are increased financial flows between countries and the consequence of that kind of integration is that there are other results relating to the environment and to societies which are also a direct result of capital globalisation. Many people are concerned about the increase in the number of people wanting to migrate. There is growing concern about the international trade in drugs. There are all sorts of aspects in the economic, social and environmental spheres which are demonstrating that the world is a more integrated place. The question is: how does the international community respond to that globalisation? A lot of people would recognise that there have to be international responses to some of those activities. Some of them can be adequately addressed only through cooperative international action. There are all kinds of examples of that, a very obvious one being the need to reduce the threat of war through international peacekeeping. The UN of course is attempting to address the problem of peacekeeping but is really constrained by the lack of funds. In an entirely different area, the retention of biodiversity, there is a growing international concern about the rate at which the natural world is being eroded as a result of population growth and economic growth, yet the retention of biodiversity is being left entirely to individual countries when the benefit would be a global one. That is another area where international cooperative action is important. It can be argued that a part of the answer the unemployment problem in many countries depends on a degree of international cooperation. In that area it is mostly national policies that are involved, but to the extent that there is more effective cooperative economic policy aimed at stimulating employment growth it will be possible for many nations to increase employment opportunities faster. It is certainly true that in the area of drug trade international cooperative action is essential. In relation to terrorism, cooperative action is necessary. It has been obvious for decades that many aspects of the global infrastructure relating to civil aviation or the postal services-let alone telecommunications or the use of the radio spectrum-require international cooperation, and that occurs through the United Nations agencies that work on those areas. However, it is true that many of those kinds of international cooperative actions are inadequate, and that is partly because of what economists call the 'free rider' problem, the problem of everyone waiting for everyone else to take some action which would be in everyone's benefit because they hope that the others will take the issue up. It would be very nice if other countries prud more for peacekeeping or other countries increased their overseas aid so that there were more funds flowing for disaster relief and development to developing countries. It would be lovely if other countries were more active in trying to suppress the drug trade or to encourage the retention of forests and so on. But every country-and within a country every individual-is to some extent affected by this free rider problem, so nations have had to introduce during the last century a compulsory taxation in order to provide collectively those infrastructure services and human services which would otherwise be inadequately provided if they depended on voluntary activity. The point that I am obviously trying to move towards is that such activity may well be necessary internationally in an increasingly integrated global community. It may well be that simply depending on voluntary contributions to the UN for peacekeeping, or inadto equate subscriptions to the UN, or strictly limited subscriptions to the IMF, the World Bank or lATA or whatever it happens to be, may not provide sufficient funds for everything that needs to be done on a global basis. It may well be, therefore, that we are getting to the stage where some form of international charging, or even international compulsory taxation, is necessary. People have been saying this for a couple of decades, but I think-because the pace of globalisation is now much faster and the effect of globalisation is much more widespread-that the need for global action to reduce dangers, volatilities, instabilities or damaging effects is now becoming much stronger. So the case for international collective action is also much stronger. It is for that kind of reason that Gareth Evans, amongst other international leaders, has been starting to talk about the need for some form of international taxation. There are many forms that could occur. It obviously is best if they are targeted at the problem they are meant to address, because that makes them more readily acceptable, but that may not always be possible. A particularly good example would be a very small charge on airline travel in order to offset the effects of greenhouse gas emissions that air travel causes. Another kind of tax which has been talked about in Europe is a carbon emission tax to discourage the continuing rapid growth in the level of greenhouse gas emissions in that continent and, with that, acid rain and the damage to forests that that causes. Another idea that is receiving some attention at present is the idea of a small levy on foreign exchange transactions. That could, if it were introduced, be appropriately used for improving the functioning of financial markets, for establishing emergency funds for dealing with crises, for increasing the training and sophistication of capital markets in developing countries in ways that would be of benefit to financial markets themselves, and for improving the effectiveness of the flow of capital between the countries where there are large reserves of capital and the countries which need them greatly. There are proposals for small charges for the use of the global commons: oceans, space or the electromagnetic spectrum. That is another form of international tax. There are proposals for small charges on international postage or telephone communications as means of funding the organisations that have responsibility for coordinating those activities and ensuring that standards are maintained. These may sound like visionary ideas, but they are not in fact because we are getting very close to the point where steps along that line are going to be necessary. It is not that these issues are ones that we are going to be able to handle adequately voluntarily much longer. It is an area where charges are going to be essential and where small levies may well also be essential in due course in order to fund necessary cooperative global activity. I suggest that it is time for us to start to think in such terms. Some things can be adequately provided only when they are provided for everyone, because everyone will have access to them when they are provided, and that means that everyone should make some contribution to the funding of them through a compulsory tax system. The rationale, as I began by saying, is exactly the same as for national taxation and the provision of national public goods such as education, roads and health services. Such things are not going to be provided internationally, but other things are. If we are going to be able to control the spread of disease, for example, for particular kinds of diseases, some kinds of international action are going to be necessary. There is a growth in concern about the danger of global epidemics. We have evidence of them in the AIDS epidemic; international action earlier could have contributed more to containment of that epidemic. Other epidemics will occur. That is another area where cooperative international action is going to be necessary. I put these ideas on the public agenda in the parliament because I think we are going to have to think about these things much more carefully over the next few years than we have had to do so far. We are inevitably going to have to do so because of the nature of what is happening, particularly in the global economy. We must respond collectively in modest, careful ways. Of course, it is only necessary to do internationally what cannot adequately be done nationally. It is not a question of arguing for world government; I am not in the business of that at all. But I am arguing that some forms of international cooperation are becoming essential and that adequate funding of those on a compulsory basis is going to also be essential. We have to start to think about how that should occur.",68
61,Mr GEAR,AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL,"in reply-I would like to thank both speakers who took part in the debate today on the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill. The member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) asked a couple of questions which I am happy to respond to. The first was to this effect: does the fact that article 10 of the Czech agreement leaves open the possibility of imposing dividend withholding tax on franked dividends mean that the government is contemplating changing the domestic law relating to taxation of franked dividends? No, it is not, at the present time. The second one he asked was about double tax agreements with Malaysia, Romania, Slovakia and the Russians, and when those double tax agreements would be implemented. There are still a number of areas to finalise. There are a lot of technical checks and translations in progress, in preparation for the signatures. But, obviously, we cannot make these agreements unilaterally-they are bilateral agreements-and we do have to rely on other governments to cooperate with us. So I cannot, unfortunately, give him a time on those. All I can say, from Australia's point of view, is that we are putting in all of the effort that we can, but we rely on cooperation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Gear) read a third time. CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL 1995 Consideration resumed from 28 September. Second Reading",70
62,Mr LINDSAY,AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (1.45 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Customs Tariff Bill 1995 introduces the new Customs Tariff Act, to come into effect on 1 July 1996. The act will replace the Customs Tariff Act 1987, as announced in the context of the government's 1994 white paper, Working Nation. The new customs tariff will incorporate some 350 changes to the international convention on the harmonised commodity description and coding system proposed by the World Customs Organisation. Australia became a signatory to the convention in 1987 and in 1993 the World Customs Organisation agreed to these changes. Australia is now giving effect to our obligations to align our tariff structure with the international standard. The bill will also renumber and update the wording of the legal provisions in the current tariff. The bill removes unnecessary tariff splits in schedule 3 and redefines some of the concessional provisions contained in schedule 4. I will now outline the changes contained in this bill in more detail. The legal provisions of the current act have been amended since 1987 on an ad hoc basis to cater for changes to the treatment accorded goods from certain countries and for other purposes. The new act will consolidate these changes and renumber the provisions. There are also textual changes. Schedule 1 provides a new listing of countries which benefit under the Australian system of tariff preferences for developing countries. In 1991 and 1993, the government decided to phase out the developing country margin of preference for goods produced or manufactured in all except the least developed countries. The new listings within schedule 1 group these countries according to the tariff treatment which they receive. Overall, the intention of these amendments is to retain the existing provisions of the current act but to present them in a more logical and orderly sequence. Schedule 3 presents the list of customs classification and duty rates applicable to goods. It is in this schedule that the 350 changes recommended by the World Customs Organisation occur. The changes reflect differing patterns in international trade and technological developments. Their aim is to regroup like products in the same subheadings, and to correct anomalies which have become apparent in the harmonised system. The government has tried to maintain existing duty rates wherever possible. To maintain the existing levels, some additional 200 national splits were created in the tariff. In one case, that relating to snowboard boots, local industry and importers have defined the essential characteristics of the boots for a tariff precedent, and this will allay concerns that other boots, which are now dutiable, could enter duty free. In only five cases have duty rates not been preserved. The rate of duty for graded and ungraded pearls, whether or not strung for the convenience of transport, will be free, in line with current practice. Graded pearls are sold, according to accepted international practice, as 'temporarily strung for transport purposes'. As Australia currently has a duty on strung pearls but not on those unstrung, Australian industry practice has been to import the pearls unstrung. This will no longer be required from 1 July 1996. The duty rate for waste and scrap of batteries will be set at free. While this does not reflect the existing rate for waste of mercury and lithium batteries, it is supported by industry. They have advised that there are no imports of such waste and scrap into Australia, nor are there any plans to do so in the future. Tyre cord fabrics of woven glass fibres and other woven fabrics of glass will be combined in new subheadings. There have been no imports from developing countries over the last five years of these tyre cord fabrics. The duty rate for developing countries will therefore be that applying to other woven fabrics of glass. It has not been possible to identify separately the specific goods which transfer between subheadings in two instances: food preparations containing cocoa and input or output units for computers. The World Customs Organisation has altered the basis of the calculation of cocoa content for certain food preparations. As such, it has not been possible to identify separately these specific food preparations which are transferring to an existing subheading. The duty rate proposed reflects the rate of the predominant proportion of trade, some 92 per cent, within the expanded subheading. Input or output units for computers-for example, keyboards and printers-from five existing subheadings are combining into one new subheading. The proposed duty rate will reflect the rate applicable to 98 per cent of the total trade in those subheadings. Some national splits in tariff subheadings have been proposed that may eventually prove to be unnecessary because there is no trade. These subheadings will be examined when adequate statistics become available. If the situation so requires, proposals will be brought forward to close up the subheadings whose tariff splits are serving no purpose. Following the implementation of the Customs Tariff Act 1955, administrative arrangements will be established within the Department of Industry, Science and Technology and the Australian Customs Service whereby aggrieved parties, including our trading partners, may raise concerns if anomalous situations arise in the context of the government's decision to preserve the duty arrangements. The appeal period will extend from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997. Mr Deputy Speaker, I now draw your attention to amendments to schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Bill. Schedule 4 contains the list of concessional provisions. The three key changes proposed relate to items 17, 18 and 20, which are all reimport provisions. Item 17 allows for goods that have been exported from Australia, other than for repair and renovation, to re-enter Australia without being penalised by having to pay duty a second time if their identity has not been altered. It was intended that under this item goods are returned in an unaltered condition and have not been subject to treatment, industrial processing, repair, renovation, alteration or any other process. It has become apparent, however, that the current wording of the item allows its use for wider purposes. For instance, some goods are re-entering Australia after undergoing industrial processing in another country. The amendments are intended to ensure that item 17 cannot be used where any industrial processing has been undertaken overseas before reimportation. Item 18 permits goods or parts of goods to re-enter Australia duty free in accordance with the provisions of a specific warranty. The changes in item 18C will extend these provisions to goods subject to a global recall for safety or related reasons. Item 20 permits the re-entry of goods sent overseas for repair and renovation but requires that duty be paid on the value of the repair or renovation. These provisions will be retained as the new item 20A. Item 20B contains a new concessional provision. International best practice for repair and renovation dictates that for many purposes batch repair will be undertaken. This means that the faulty product is swapped with an identical unit already repaired. The good sent for repair is then stored until sufficient numbers of the same product have accumulated for economical repair. Under the present operation of item 20, companies are being charged duty on the full value of the items exchanged under such arrangements rather than on the value of the repairs. Australia needs to recognise the move internationally to batch repair processing. The new item 20B, with related by-law, will allow companies to enter into agreements with Customs to introduce batch repair arrangements without penalty. The by-law arrangements will be similar to those applying to the tariff export concessions--or Texco schemeon goods which the company will send overseas for batch repair prior to reimportation. The new item 20B by-law will permit companies to take advantage of batch repair process arrangements whilst allowing Customs to ensure compliance concerns are met. Once a company has such an agreement and is registered, it will be able to use the by-law. Companies will need to retain documentation demonstrating that they are meeting the provisions of the by-law. Customs will employ risk management techniques to ensure that the government's policy intent is being met. As well as proposals to modify items 17, 18 and 20 a number of administrative changes to a range of other schedule 4 items are proposed. These changes are minor and will improve the administration of the schedule. The proposed changes include the rationalisation of numbering to fill unused items and the splitting of items where appropriate. Some of the previous items had coverage of two or more types of goods and it has been difficult to issue specific by-laws for these goods. These have been split into separate items to facilitate their administration. A summary of amendments contained in this bill has been prepared and circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House.",71
63,Mr TUCKEY,AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL,"O'Connor) (1.55 p.m.)The purpose of the Customs Tariff Bill 1995, as has been described in the second reading speech, is to redraft and consolidate the Customs Tariff Act 1987, repeal the Customs Tariff Act 1987 due to this particular consolivanced dation and restructuring of the act, and incorporate the harmonised commodity description and coding system classification modifications that have been agreed by signatory countries. The coalition does not oppose this bill and, in fact, supports the arrangements that have been put in hand. Concerning the financial impact, the bill enacts a number of technical changes implementing a new system of administration and does not incur any expenditure. I would like to make a few brief comments in regard to the harmonised commodity and coding system which was developed in 1988 as a classification system for administering imports and exports and for collecting foreign trade data. This system was established by the Customs Cooperation Council, which is an international body of which Australia is a member. The system was created for three reasons: firstly, so that there is a universal classification and code system for internationally traded goods; secondly, so that customs classifications are in step with both modem technology and recent products that have come onto the international market; and, thirdly, so that the collection and quantification of foreign trades statistics is simplified. The harmonised system is now known as the harmonised commodity description and coding system, HCDCS, and is the international tariff system sponsored by the World Customs Organisation in Brussels. The new system will upgrade the old one providing universal six-digit coding, removing old domestic subheadings and the archaic tailored Australian tariff. The first six figures of each classification are taken from the international system and the seventh and eighth figures are inserted by Australia. These seventh and eighth figures provide a separate category whilst under the same tariff grouping whereby Australia can impose its own domestically determined tariff rates. The World Customs Organisation introduced 350 classification changes to the HCDCS as agreed by the signatory nations. These classification changes were in response to new products coming into the international trade market. Value added, technically adproducts and components emerged without a suitable separate tariff classification to cater for them, which led to the introduction of these new classifications. Australia is adopting these international changes as agreed and to maintain its own tariff program has added an extra 200 national tariff splits. These national tariff splits cover those goods whose tariff classification is subject to the nature of their use or, alternatively, the product of which they form a subsidiary component. With both the 350 classification changes determined by the WCO and 200 different classifications by Australia, this bill introduces 550 changes to the tariff classification index act. In fact, it is one of the main functions of the bill. Nevertheless, the changes all referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) are also of significance. The coalition welcomes the review. It indicates that it should be a simpler process and a more understandable process for those obliged to administer the Customs Act and we believe, in that regard, it is positive.",73
64,Mr LATHAM,AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL,"I am pleased to be speaking on the Customs Tariff Bill 1995. It has a primary purpose of incorporating classification changes agreed to by signatory countries to the harmonised commodity description and coding system. In 1988 Australia adopted a new classification system for administering imports and exports and for the collection and presentation of foreign trade statistics. This new system, the harmonised commodity description and coding system, was developed over a number of years by an international body, the Customs Cooperation Council, of which Australia is a member. The harmonised system was developed for three purposes: first, to upgrade customs classifications to reflect technological developments and changes in goods traded internationally; second, to provide international uniformity in classifying the coded goods; and, third, to simplify the collection, analysis and comparison of foreign trade statistics. The system is now known as the harmonised commodity description and coding system and is the international tariff system sponsored by the World Customs Organisation based in Brussels. Following deliberations of the international body, 350 classification changes were agreed by signatory countries to the system. Australia is adopting the international changes as agreed and, to retain existing tariff levels, provided 200 or so national tariff splits additional to those recommended by the World Customs Organisation. The overall outcome, as contained in amendments proposed in this bill, means about 550 changes. This is quite comprehensive as a piece of legislation altering the classification methods for Australia's customs tariff regime. It provides an opportunity to talk in a general sense about that regime. Over the past 10 years I have been a very strong supporter of the government's tariff reduction program. I think it is fair to say that the program was made inevitable by the globalisation of capital, increases in volumes and the pace of capital movements throughout the world economy. This process started in the early 1970s with the collapse of the Bretton Woods agreement for fixed foreign exchange rates and thereafter followed the liberalisation of the foreign exchange market. Australia experienced a delay in this. We did not liberalise our foreign exchange markets in the late 1970s. We had J.W. Howard as Treasurer at that time. We had to wait for the Labor government's election in 1983 to float the Australian dollar. This liberalisation process has been followed by major reforms opening up the financial investment and capital equity flows into and out of Australia. Those who argue that these things can be reversed, and that this legislation should be reversed, fail to comprehend the scale of capital movements throughout the international economy. I am indebted to the Economist magazine of 7 October this year which provides a guide to the extraordinary growth in capital movements throughout the world. It is very useful for the parliament, which talks so much about globalisation and about the internationalisation of the Australian economy, to get a feeling for the sorts of aggregate capital movements we are talking about. In 1973 typical daily foreign exchange trading amounted to only $10 billion to $20 billion. In 1983 it was still modest, at around $60 billion worldwide, but by 1992, the most recent year for which figures are available from the Bank for International Settlements, about $900 billion a day has was moving around the foreign exchange markets of the world. The ratio of foreign exchange transactions to world trade jumped from 10: 1 in 1983 to more than 60: 1 in 1992. The results of the BIS survey from April 1995 are yet to be published, but figures from national central banks suggest that daily turnover is now an extraordinary $1.3 trillion-an extraordinary amount. The total foreign currency reserves of governments in the rich industrial economies amount to only $640 billion. The stock of international bank lending, net of redepositing, surged to $4.2 trillion last year from a base of $265 billion in 1975. The outstanding volume of international bonds jumped to more than $2 trillion last year from a base of $259 billion in 1982. These figures are incredibly impressive. I was interested also to note a report earlier this year by the MCKinsey Global Institute which said that we are only halfway through the process. MCKinsey have estimated that the total stock of financial assets traded in the global capital market increased from $5 trillion in 1980 to $35 trillion in 1992, equivalent to twice the GDP of OECD countries. The firm forecasts-this is the significant figure to appreciate-that the market will swell to $83 trillion in the year 2000. That is three times the OECD economies' national output, three times the advanced economies' GDP. These figures really do reinforce the inevitability of globalisation and the need to liberalise trade, capital and investment markets. They reinforce the need for legislation such as this, which is very responsive in its tariff classification system to changes in technology, to changes in trade and in the pace and volume of international capital movements. I think there are also some important figures to relate to the parliament regarding capital movements for Australia. These figures also bring home the significance of globalisation and how it is impacting on our small, open trading nation. From the Reserve Bank Bulletin of June 1995 we see the daily average of total foreign exchange turnover against all currencies for March of this year was $56 billion. That is up from $38 billion in 1991-92. The daily average of total foreign exchange turnover against Australian dollars in March of this year was $24 billion. That is an increase from $15 billion in 1991-92. I understand that the Australian currency is the third or fourth most traded currency in the world. But the figures are also quite astounding for Australia's foreign liabilities and assets-of course, indicating the flow in and out of Australia of foreign capital. Gross foreign investment in Australia in the March quarter of this year was $376 billion. Gross Australian investment abroad was $132 billion. We can balance those figures out, I suppose, by an understanding that our gross domestic product is around $500 billion and that our foreign exchange reserves for the end of the financial year 1994-95 equalled $15.1 billion. So the scale is quite comprehensive. That raises the question: how should governments respond? Governments should respond in a fashion such as is indicated in this legislation-that is, international cooperation-to make sure that the liberalisation and globalisation processes are undertaken as much as possible within the public interest. The internationalisation of capital forces the internationalisation of government controls and government policy. It is the only way in which national institutions can properly serve their countervailing role; that is, to protect the public interest and to, as best they can, advance the interests of their national economy and national population. I have just returned from this parliament's delegation to the European Parliament where, of course, the European Union provides the best possible example of this process-how they have moved towards free trade in goods, services, people, capital and ideas, and how they are moving quite comprehensively to a monetary union through the Maastricht Treaty and all that flows from that. A monetary union, with a single currency of course, inevitably results in unity and cooperation in the areas of taxation policy and social policy. I note for the benefit of the member for Wills (Mr Cleary) that even Albania-his model of economic development-has now awoken to the benefits of global trade and investment. They are applying for membership of the Council of Europe. They may well be one of those eastern European countries that apply for membership of the European Parliament and the European Union. This, of course, raises the question in the context of customs, tariffs and Australia's trade position: what are we to do in our part of the world? Of course, this government is taking the initiative through APEC, recognising the importance of free trade and free investment movements as consummated in the Bogor declaration, that is, to have free trade and investment in place in the Asia-Pacific by the year 2010 for developed nations and 2020 for non-developed nations. In a debate like this it is very important-I am sure National Party members will recognise this-to appreciate that there are still major problems, particularly with regard to Australia's access to agricultural markets in Asia, Europe and the United States. It is distressing indeed to read reports of arguments presented by the Japanese government about excluding agriculture from the APEC arrangements. It is distressing indeed to learn of talk in the United States about expanding their agricultural subsidies into Asian markets and thereby restrict the penetration and trade access that Australian producers would enjoy in those markets. These are sobering things which reinforce the point. When we are talking about customs tariffs, when we are talking about trade liberalisation, the need to remain vigilant is all important and forever present. Even looking at the success of the Uruguay Round of GATT, which produced a 40 per cent reduction in tariffs, it still left a situation in world trade where 56 per cent of trade remains tariff protected. We cannot rest on our laurels post-Uruguay. We need to keep the ball rolling, we need to keep the wheel turning, towards trade liberalisation, appreciating the fact that 56 per cent of world trade, even after the implementation of the Uruguay Round, will remain tariff protected. For Australia, there are few more important issues for our national growth prospects than to secure free trade access for our agricultural products. In Europe there are some reforms to the common agricultural policy under way. Those reforms are twofold. The first is to bundle all the non-tariff measures into bound tariffs-that is, bound tariffs that cannot increase. Whether they are non-tariff or tariff protectionist measures, it is still protection. So much more work needs to be done in that area. The second reform to the common agricultural policy of the EU is to transfer output based subsidies on agriculture to income based subsidies-that is, to remove the incentive for ever growing output and production in the agricultural sector knowing it will be constantly subsidised. Whether the subsidies are on income or output, they are still subsidies. I know the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson) would appreciate the fact that in Australia we do not have those luxuries. We do not have relatively large income or output subsidies on our agricultural produce. If we are going to talk about a level playing field and free trade access, much more work needs to be done with the European Union, as it does through APEC, as it does through the United States. These are difficult issues, but I think there are some signs that public opinion is changing. In the past agricultural reform has been resisted because of the electoral force of the rural lobby. It happened here in Australia, I suppose, through the 1960s under MCEwen, but it is still there in Europe in the 1990s. European public opinion is changing. Why should the internationally competitive manufacturing and services sector in Europe not receive protection or subsidies, yet the agricultural sector does? There is a massive inconsistency to which public opinion in Europe is aWakening. Also the inefficiency of European agriculture, which is so protected, adds to the basic cost to consumers in Europe. That is not to the public good. All these protectionist measures shelter away untenable, completely inefficient agriculture. Look at France, for instance, where the problem is not so much technology or management; it is the small size of the farm holdings. There is a very strong need to rationalise the size of farms. We have seen in Australia over the years the increasing size of farm holdings to give economies of scale that are all important to success on world markets. Why should the French and the Europeans be subsidising and protecting their agriculture when the benefits of reform have been shown right here in Australia? The rationalisation makes the industry more efficient. You will never make the industry more efficient by allowing agriculture to rely on subsidies and protection in the European market. The inconsistencies are there. The European Union talks about micro reform. It talks about competition policy in all sectors bar agriculture. Australia constantly needs to be asking the question in legislation like this, with initiatives like those of APEC and in our relations with the EU: why exempt agriculture? Why should that be different in the world trade environment? Why should Australia be locked out of those important markets? The second inconsistency-and I am sure the opposition will relate to this-is between business welfare on the one hand and social welfare on the other. Business welfaresubsidies for agriculture, subsidies for any other industry sector-is said to be okay but social welfare is deemed to be unacceptable. One only needs to comprehend the sorts of draconian reforms that have been undertaken by the United States Congress, spearheaded by the Republican majority, to cut down on the welfare sector, to literally deprive people of the safety net role of government. One only needs to look at some of the reforms now being passed by the Danish parliament or look at Britain at the Thatcherite revolution. One only needs to go back to the comments two days ago by the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) to understand that there is a massive inconsistency. You cannot argue on the one hand that business welfare is in the public interest, and on the other hand argue that social welfare needs to be totally cut away. These sorts of arguments are taking hold in Europe, as I think they have been expressed here in Australia. There are some signs of hope on these issues-signs of hope expressed in European public opinion. There is also the very strong argument that, because of the ever changing nature of the world economy, today's protection wall can be tomorrow's act of folly. With liberalisation in a dynamic economy and with vast and increasing movements in capital it is in every nation's interest to try to open up markets, particularly in those sectors where they are increasing their competitiveness. I would have thought that this compelling argument will be so impressive in international forums for years to come that I am quietly optimistic that world trade liberalisation will continue to move in the right direction. As I mentioned earlier, there is the need to be forever vigilant and present these arguments and understand the benefits of free trade arrangements. I also note with regard to my own vigilance that there are some backsliders on these questions of tariffs in the parliament. There is an interesting unity ticket between the extreme Left and the extreme Right in the comer of the House between the member for Wills and the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). There is at) unusual alliance between a Labor defector-a sort of disenchanted type from the western suburbs of Melbourne-and the National Party member for Kennedy. I cannot understand the argument-and I do not think it holds up-that there should be this sort of unity ticket between the extreme Left and the extreme Right. On a left-wing perspective, quite truthfully, what do tariff and protectionist measures protect? They do not protect jobs. The job losses were highest in Australia in the 1970s in highly protected industries. Tariff protection protects capital and profits, not jobs. From the perspective of the extreme Right, particularly a National Party member, how can he support tariff measures that add to the costs in manufacturing and services that are met by all farmers in Australia? These things are exceptionally difficult. The arguments of members such as the members for Wills and Kennedy are totally inconsistent and totally false. Turning to the substance of the debate on protection and tariffs, my own view is that we should not be arguing a proor anti-interventionist debate. I think that government intervention on industry policy makes a lot of sense, as long as it is restricted to the short term. Short-term measures and short-term government intervention on industry policy make a lot of sense. It can do a lot of good in clearing away market blockages in capital and equity markets, clearing away market blockages for information and export market penetration and access in training and research and development. That has very much been the direction of this government's policy. Long-term intervention has a range of disadvantages. It builds up reliance and a culture of dependence. I had a beautiful example of this on a visit to New Zealand earlier this year when I visited Mace EngiImportantly, neering-a metal and engineering company Christchurch. The proprietor there said, 'When New Zealand was tariff protected, we had guaranteed profits. We had no competieasier tors. We were a large firm in the domestic market. It was a licence to print money.' When the tariff walls and the reforms came into place, of course, the need to compete the need to upgrade and build a culture of cooperation and innovation became very important. Now the company is right leading edge of output and innovation. It is in the business of forming an alliance with an inventor in New Zealand to construct a plastic engine for motorbikes. This is the sort of impact you get once industry no longer relies on protectionist measures such as tariffs. The second problem with long-term interlegislated vention is that it is a very blunt instrument. have addressed that in the House on previous occasions. The third problem is that it is hard to plan ahead and very hard for governother, ments to have five-year industry plans when the economy is so dynamic and changing so rapidly. That is my summary, ranging far wide in geography and subject matter, overall I support the legislation before us. (Time expired)",74
65,Mr LINDSAY,AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL,"Herbert-Parliamentary after Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (2.19 p.m.)-in reply-I would like to thank the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) for his usual excellent contributhis tion to debates of this House, and the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) for the support of the opposition for the Customs Tariff I indicated in my second reading speech, the main purpose of the bill is to incorporate some 350 changes to the harmonised commodity description and coding system, which has been recommended by the World Customs Organisation. The intent of the new legal provisions is the same as before, but the bill now sets this out in a more logical and systematic format. As forthwith. I said earlier in my second reading speech, some of the provisions contained in schedule 4 have been redrafted-sometimes to tighten third time. the provisions but mainly to make the administration of the concessions more efficient. as I said earlier, the bill updates in and renumbers the legal provisions of the Customs Tariff Act. In essence, it is a consolidated act. This will make the act far more to deal with than hitherto. The current act was enacted in 1987. Since that time quota restrictions have been phased out and the conditions pertaining to how Australia and applies the margin of preference under the Australian system of tariff preferences have been changed dramatically. That is another at the reason for this measure. One matter that was not raised in the debate was the effect on rates of duty. I believe it is necessary to place on the record the fact that the government instructed the Australian Customs Service that the rates of duty already for 1 July 1996 were to be mainI tained. This has been achieved in all instances except for five commodities. Where goods very have moved from one tariff heading to anthe rates have been maintained through the creation of about 250 national tariff splits. As I said, I have already listed in my second and reading speech those commodities for which but the rates of duty will change. The Australian Customs Service will administer an appeals mechanism for 12 months the implementation of this bill through which allegedly aggrieved parties may appeal situations where they believe they have been adversely affected by changes contained in bill. This is a measure of equity, so to speak, to enable anomalies in the legislation to be identified and, if necessary, corrected. Bill. As I commend the bill to the House.

66,Mrs CROSIO,COUNT,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (2.24 p.m.)-I move: That the requested amendments be made. The purpose of requesting the introduction of amendments is to amend the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989. In line with the five-year time frame of the exotic animal disease preparedness program, a number of sections of the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989 cease to have effect from 30 June 1995. The amendments to this act are to rectify the unintended consequence of the cessation on 30 June 1995 of the sections the act dealing with levy collection and payments into the trust account. They also correct anomalies in trust account administraby tion and closure arrangements. The exotic animal disease preparedness program has been funded by the CommonPromotion wealth and the livestock industries on an equal basis, with industry providing funds an exotic disease levy. As not all levies from industry were due for collection and payment into the trust account before the provisions the act ceased, there is need to restore the authority to enable this to occur. These amendments will ensure that any exotic animal disease levy received by the Commonconsequences wealth is paid into the exotic animal disease preparedness trust account and try funds are invested until the closure of the account. The amendments will also clarify procedures for closing the account and the industry research bodies to receive the residopposition ual industry funds at the cessation of program.",80
67,Mr ANDERSON,COUNT,"The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) has before this House before. It is back here time because the government has chosen to make a series of amendments, which I have to say were very hastily put together, allowing little time at all for consultation and for the coalition to consider the changes proposed. am concerned that this happens quite often, and in this case it has made life quite diffiportfolio cult. Whilst under duress and under some degree of pressure concessions were made, and we were given the time to take this back for consideration by our joint parties, the fact is that it ought not to have been necessary to pursue that issue. The original clauses of this omnibus bill seek to do three things: firstly, to change the way export inspection charges are imposed on certain fish exports to accord with industry wishes to ensure equity; secondly, to remove the need to register wool tax payments on sales of small amounts of wool; and, thirdly, to provide a rollover of tax collected for research and development in one year to later of years. We considered all that quite a long time ago and determined to support it all. However, the further amendments proposed the government, which were considered at very short notice, will also be supported. They allow the Australian Wool Research and Organisation-AWRAP as it has become known-to continue its role in chemivia cal residue monitoring and education. They give the minister the power to set charges to recover the cost of monitoring compliance of with the conditions attached to woodchip export licences issued by the Commonwealth. There is a series of administrative amendments which will rectify the unintended of the cessation of sections of the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989 that the induson 30 June this year. There are also three amendments to the the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, and these will be dealt with in detail for the by my colleague the member for the Gippsland (Mr MCGauran). These further amendments will, firstly, ensure that persons conducting offshore petroleum operations under the act respect, and not unduly interfere with, native title rights and interests when been conducting these operations; secondly, this strengthen the minister's ability to make safety regulations under the act; and, thirdly, give legal force to the system of awarding offshore petroleum exploration permits to ensure that it is fully effective and adequately I protects the rights of explorers. I return to those which fall within my area. The amendments to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 will provide for the continuation of AWRAP's chemical residue monitoring and education programs which were to cease at the end of this year. I had a bit to say about wool this morning. I am not going to recap it, but I will say that the activities referred to in this act will now be specified functions of AWRAP, although AWRAP will not have regulatory powers in this regard. Under the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 these activities were to be divested to industry before the end of 1995. However, the wool industry has not been able to identify a more effective and efficient means of undertaking residue monitoring and education programs than currently exists through AWRAP. The wool industry supports the amendments. I record my appreciation that the minister has been prepared to listen to common sense and act on this one. The government announced in December last year at the time it issued the 1995 hardwood woodchip export licences-we all remember that time; it was a very controversial time and one which saw a very unhealthy fracas which I suspect is likely to be repeated, given the mess the government is again making of forestry policy-that it would recover the cost of monitoring compliance with its licence conditions from industry. This was confirmed in the budget with the announcement that a dedicated and independent monitoring unit would be established within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. The amendments to the Export Control Act 1982 will enable the Minister for Resources to make regulations to cover the cost by way of licence fees. Once the amendment is passed and royal assent granted, the minister will be able to make ministerial orders to recover the cost of monitoring. It is the government's intention, as I undersections stand it, to establish fees for monitoring the 1996 hardwood woodchip export licences, which were supposed to have been issued this month. Heaven only knows now when they will be. We have seen an extension of this whole debate in the most extraordinary way in recent months. Whilst the National Association of Forest Industries accepts that the Commonwealth compliance monitoring and cost recovery mechanisms will be implemented, they will join us, I am sure, in seeking a commitment from the minister that charges will be minimised by ensuring that the Commonwealth does not duplicate state monitoring procedures. I know this government often finds it very hard to trust the states, particularly in the delicate area of forestry, but in this area we see no reason for them to duplicate what the states already do. So the coalition wants the DPIE monitoring unit to effectively audit, without going unnecessarily beyond that principle, the state processes. The other amendment sought by the government relates to the exotic animal disease preparedness program. It has run now for the past five years. It has been funded by the Commonwealth and the livestock industries on an equal basis, with industry providing funds via an exotic disease levy. The program will terminate at the end of this year and its activities will be taken over by the new Australian Animal Health Council, which has a wider focus. The AAHC will be jointly funded by the Commonwealth, the states and industry. A number of sections of the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989 ceased to have effect on 30 June 1995, with the unintended consequence that levies due but not collected until after this date cannot be paid into the exotic animal disease preparedness trust account. That is, if you like, an unintended consequence-one of the things, I daresay, which happen from time to time. So the amendments to this act will ensure that any exotic animal disease levy collected by the Commonwealth is paid into the trust account and for the industry funds to be invested until the account is closed, when the remaining of the act cease to have effect on 31 December 1995 and funds are distributed to industry bodies. Further amendments correct anomalies in the trust account administration and close the arrangements which are not consistent with the Audit Act 1901. It stipulates that a trust account must have a zero balance before it can be closed. The amendments will allow funds to be distributed to industry prior to the closure date. The coalition supports this bill, with the reservation that we believe the consultative process could have been more effectively handled. Question resolved in the affirmative.

69,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,ls leave granted for the third reading to be moved forthwith?,83
70,Mr KERR,PAIRS,Denison-Minister for Justice}-I move that the bill be now read a third time.,83
71,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I understand that the minister had amendments to move. The House will now consider the bill in detail. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.,83
72,Mr KERR,PAIRS,I seek leave to move government amendments 1 to 17 together.,83
73,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Is leave granted? Mr Ruddock-No, it is not granted. The minister has failed, clearly. The opportunity to move amendments was earlier, when I'was about to leave the chamber. We had moved on to the third reading. You are matter to be recommitted. There might be a procedure for recommittal. If there is, that should be followed.",83
74,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I understand that the minister has sought leave to move the government's amendments. Mr Ruddock-He moved to the third reading. He had failed to move the government's amendments, unless he is moving them in the third reading.",83
75,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,No.,83
76,Mr KERR,PAIRS,I thought I had moved the amendments.,83
77,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"We are dealing with the bill, as a whole, in detail. Mr Ruddock-No, the minister had moved to the third reading. My ears did not fail me, and that is why I was prepared to leave the chamber. I would have remained if we were dealing with the amendments.",83
78,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The minister has sought leave to move amendments Nos 1 to 17. Mr Ruddock- Mr Deputy Speaker, I make the point that, if there are any procedural defects in legislation that involves people's liberties and what can occur to people, they could have quite significant repercussions. I suggest that the bill ought to be dealt with in accordance with the procedures that are laid down for the handling of legislation.",83
79,Mr KERR,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a trivial and time wasting process that the opposition has sought to indulge in. The amendments have been circulated. The honourable member is aware of those amendments. Those amendments have been known to the honourable member for a very long time. There have been long consultations and briefings. He is simply making a selfindulgent but futile point which should not be tolerated. Amendment No. 1 deals with previous commencement provisions",83
80,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I understand that leave is not granted to move government amendments Nos 1 to 17 as a whole. I take it that the minister is now asking for the moving amendment No.1.,83
81,Mr KERR,PAIRS,"I will move each amendment singularly. I move amendment No.1: (1) Clause 2, page 2, lines 1 to 8, omit the clause, substitute: Commencement ""2.(1) Subject to this section, this Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent. ""(2) Item 8A of Schedule 2 is taken to have commenced immediately after the commencement of the Crimes Amendment Act 1995. ""(3) Subject to subsection (4), Schedules 1 and 3, and the remaining items of Schedule 2, commence on a day to be fixed by Proclamation. ""(4) If the provisions specified in subsection (3) have not commenced under that subsection within the period of 6 months beginning on the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent, those provisions commence on the first day after the end of that period."". [Note: Subsection (2) will require alteration when Schedule 2 is renumbered. The heading to Division 2 on page 3 needs to be changed] Mr Charles- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I clearly heard it announced that we had moved to the third reading of this bill. We cannot tum around at this time and start amending the second reading of the bill when we are already on to the third reading. That procedure is not right. To say",83
82,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I will rule on your point of order rather than have you debating it. The minister inquired whether leave was granted for the third reading to be moved forthwith and leave was not granted. The minister then moved to the consideration in detail. Mr Charles-But leave was given. I clearly said yes.,84
83,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Leave was not granted.,84
84,Mr KERR,PAIRS,"I have moved amendment No. 1. I nowMr Ruddock- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the procedures need to be clear. We had already moved to the third reading and leave was being sought for the third reading to be dealt with. That question had been disposed of. We then went back to the question of whether or not leave would be granted to deal with the committee stage, and it was at that point that I said leave would be granted. So the question of leave did not relate to the third readingMrs Crosio-You lost that. Mr Ruddock-No, the government had already proceeded to deal with the committee stage without submitting its amendments. We were proceeding to the third reading. Mrs Crosio-They were circulated. Mr Ruddock-I am sorry, but you cannot deal with amendments on the basis that they have been circulated without also having a vote on whether or not they are to be accepted-and such a vote was not taken. If you had done that, you would not be going through the facade now of trying to deal with them. Clearly, there is a procedural fault and the government needs to deal with this matter by seeking an appropriate form of recommittal. It has not sought to do this. It has made a procedural error in the way in which the matter has been dealt with. That procedural error could well lead to the legislation being flawed and challenged in the courts by people who may have been subjected to these criminal law forensic procedures. It is unfair to leave individuals subjected to these procedures because there could be a flaw in the legislation.",84
85,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The question is that amendment No. 1 be agreed to. The minister has the call.,84
86,Mr KERR,PAIRS,"I make no comment. Mr Ruddock- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. If you have made a ruling in relation to this, could you make it fully so that I can hear what the ruling was.",84
87,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I just did. Can I say, having been watching what has been going on from the sanctity of my own room, that the minister did not in fact move that the third reading be proceeded with. Leave was sought to deal with government amendments 1 to 17 together. Leave has been refused and, therefore, the procedure, which you are rightly concerned about, is to deal with each amendment singly. The minister has moved amendment No. 1 and I believe he has spoken to it. not The question before the chair is that amendment No. 1 be agreed to. Amendment agreed to.",84
88,Mr KERR,PAIRS,I seek leave to move government amendments Nos 2 to 17.,84
89,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Is leave granted? Mr Ruddock-I am prepared to consider that, but let me make this point in relation to the procedure that is being followed. With respect to you, Mr Speaker, I was here at the time the matters were dealt with. I heard clearly what had happened and I daresay we will have a Hansard record of that. We have certain rulings in relation to procedure. If they sit uncomfortably together, I may well want to raise the matters of the efficacy of this legislation at a later point in time. But I do accede to the question on this matter, noting that I still believe the procedure to be flawed. Leave granted.",84

Do you consider the current battle over Coles Myer an occasion for the exercise of institutional muscle in the trade union movement?",89
99,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, no, I don't. But do I think, by the way, that there are some voices from on high coming into the investment management of the AMP Society, some infinite wisdom? Of course I don't; otherwise they wouldn't have taken such massive losses on their bond program in the last 12 months. There they are, all the lemmings and the fund managers-out they went with the bonds at 10Y2 per cent yields. And guess what? They are back to 8Y2. If they had waited a year they wouldn't have cost the superannuants anything. So let's not mess around with this notion that there is some sort of wise holy grail sitting inside AMP or National Mutual or any of these other shows. These are outfits which mostly take their cues week by week and monthly. There is no long run investment strategy for them. And didn't we see it in evidence with Pacific Foods and Pacific Dunlop? Here is Pacific Dunlop trying to put together a sensible diversification package, a sensible diversification of their business, to develop a food industry in this country, to develop a food business in this country. And what happens? Their share prices are marked down continually by the local superannuation investment fund managers to the point where finally Pacific Dunlop have to sell their Pacific Foods interest. And guess what? They got very high prices for it. In other words, the international investors who bought it endorsed their strategy. And then the superannuation fund managers all said in radio and TV interviews and in dodgy columns in business magazines, 'It wasn't us.' Of course it was them-the same as when they hopped into CSR over its coal interest in the 1980s, when it diversified away from sugar. So, Mr Speaker, let not the shadow Treasurer hop up and talk about how shocking it is that someone who actually represents the savings of millions of Australians might dare have a view about these godlike practices that go on amongst these people who are hearing voicesMr Costello---They should not intervene?",89
100,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I don't think they are intervening. It is as simple as that. But they are entitled to the view. And so, by the way, is anybody who has got tuppence worth of brains in observing these donkeys selling down bonds and flogging Pacific Dunlop shares.

He went on to say: ""I recognise that taking the big stick to the unions is good for the conservative parties' vote ... but I am also the Minister for Commerce and Trade and I have to, on a daily basis, assure people that we have an industrial stability and we can get the job done,"" Another member of the National Party, the member for Collie, Hilda Turnbull, said that the legislation should be scrapped. Then we had the energy minister and deputy leader of the Liberal Party, Mr Colin Barnett, saying: ""Collectively, the State shot itself in the foot yesterday, it was a silly thing to have happened and we should avoid it in the 1990s,""",90
111,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That's you.,90
112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for O'Connor!,90
113,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'Collectively' meaning his government and the work force. That is underneath an article which states: Premier Richard Court has refused to say whether the State Government will make it a crime for essential services workers to strike. It's like the old saying: 'Never nurse a mug. They will die in your arms.' There are these ministers saying, 'It has all been a mistake,' and there is the Premier saying, 'I don't know yet whether to make it a crime for essential services workers to strike.' It is worth, I think, recalling again the context in which this is put and the changes which have been enacted in Western Australia. Essentially, what we have here is a coercion of people to work. This is a democracy. People have rights in this country. The right to work and the right not to work are the rights Australians have. This would make it illegal for people to refuse to work-not with the force of, say, a national plebiscite or even the legislation of the Parliament of the Commonwealth but with the legislation of a state government. These are the things they have. In awards they have four minimum conditions only, which do not include overtime, penalty rates or holiday loadings, in which the adult minimum wage is $317 only",90
114,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The highest wages in Australia.,91
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for O'Connor this afternoon. I have tolerated you three days this week.,91
116,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minimum wage for very young people is $3.34 an hour. Does that sound familiar? That is the old $3 an hour of the member for Bennelong, adjusted for inflation. So four minimum conditions, which do not include overtime, penalty rates, holiday loadings, for $317 a week. They had a big advertisement in the West Australian last week advertising this fact, and basically your old $3 an hour for young people with a bit of adjustment. The WA legislation does not have a no disadvantage test for enterprise agreements that depart from award provisions. This will result in new employees being compelled to agree to inferior workplace agreements as unscrupulous employers seek to reduce labour costs. There is no effective unfair dismissal legislation. The Western Australian legislation does not require an adequate reason for termination of employees or comply on other grounds with accepted international conventions. Thankfully for Western Australian employees, the Commonwealth legislation overrides the Western Australian legislation in relation to unfair dismissal. But remember what Mr Kennett said last week: 'When the federal coalition come to office and we introduce the federal legislation the employees will have nowhere to go.' Under the Western Australian legislation minimum pay is fixed by the minister without full consultation with worker or employer representatives. Recently, the minister-this is a state minister-fixed the adult rate at $317. Not some tribunal, not an industrial relations tribunal, not a broadly representative body; a state minister fixed it at $317. Under the Western Australian legislation, workplace agreements are not open for inspection and related information must be kept secret. In other words, nobody can find out the extent to which employees are being disadvantaged. In other words, the deal between the employee and the employer must be kept secret and is not open for inspection. You cannot believe this stuff.",91
117,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We have the highest wages in Australia. It is a big secret.,91
118,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"WA legislation has draconian preconditions for strike action. For example, immunity for engaging in industrial action is contingent upon giving seven days notice and does not extend to picketing. In other words, if some employer treats a person or group of employees badly, they have to provide seven days notice before they can possibly walk off the job. The WA minister can strip a state union of its rights",91
119,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We do not want you to know we have the highest wages in Australia.,91
120,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But look at the industrial laws.,91
121,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is all irrelevant. People are making money hand over fist. They are all coming out of New South Wales. People are rushing over there all the time.,91

124,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for O'Connor and the member for Maribyrnong, who are conducting the debate across the chamber, I will give you the chance to continue it outside.",91
125,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The WA minister can strip a state union of its rights and dictate which union will take over its coverage simply because the union seeks the protection of the federal award. In other words, the legislation gives a minister of Western Australia the right to chastise and punish a union seeking federal award coverage and to strip it of its rights and say what other union might take its place. In taking these steps, the WA minister does not have to seek the views of the employees, employers or the unions affected. The WA act will have impractical pre-strike balance-that is, it would take weeks for unions to take legitimate industrial action including the requirement that unions provide a list of members participating in what may be proposed industrial action. So unions have to provide a list. As soon as someone conducts a ballot, union members who intend to take industrial action not only must go on the list but also have to advise their employer that they are going to take industrial action. It is just incredible. The WA act will place severe restrictions on union rights of entry to workplaces, inhibiting award enforcement. Without inspection of records by unions, enforcement of conditions becomes nigh on impossible. There will not be deductions of union fees. That will no longer be a right and the Western Australian act will place restrictions on political donations by unions but not on companies or business associations. This is the sort of draconian sleight of things-all about the rights of ordinary Australians to go to work or to not work as the case may be. These rights are being cut across viciously not by some voice of the nation, by some national plebiscite or by some new order, but by a minister of a state government. These are the sorts of things that the Leader of the Opposition endorsed when he endorsed the Western Australian legislation. When announcing the $3, he said: There will be no backing away from the proposal to have a minimum of $3 for young people between 15 and 17 and $3.50 an hour for young people over 17. That is the new minimum and there will be no backing away from it. He said this in July 1992 when he introduced it. Here you see it bobbing up as $3.34, which is the old $3 adjusted for a bit of inflation. He went on to say this last week: People who see industrial relations as just wage reductions are missing the point'just wage reductions'; get thatthat is, wage reductions are essential but there is more to it. Let's get rid of some other conditions while we're at it. These are the sorts of notions that the Leader of the Opposition puts about. That is why there has been a reaction in Western Australia by the community of Western Australia to the government of Western Australia.",91

127,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,92
128,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is why today in the West Australian two ministers-the Deputy Premier and the deputy leader of the Liberal Party-have both said the things they have said and why those on the other side of the House say, 'When you have industrial disputes at the lowest level since 1940, with good productivity and low inflation, why would you want to do this other than simply for ideological reasons against employees and people who you believe have to take their place?' This is your view. They are the punishers and the straighteners of Australian life. They say, 'Know your place and keep your place. If you want to exercise the right not to even present your labour, we will penalise you by legislation.' That is why the legislation is so objectionable to people on this side of the House.

136,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yesterday he was threatening the AMP Society, but today he isn't? If he hasn't, what is the point of asking me the question? Industrial Relations",93
137,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the government any intention to legislate minimum conditions of employment using the corporations power of the constitution? What dangers could its use pose to state award employees?,93
138,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government's industrial relations legislation is primarily based on the conciliation and arbitration power of the Commonwealth constitution. To protect workers who do not have a guarantee of an award as a genuine safety net-that is, to guarantee protection right across the work force-the government has also used the external affairs powers of the constitution. We did so under the Industrial Relations Reform Act to provide protection for workers in the areas of minimum wages, equal pay, unfair dismissal and maternity leave. By contrast, t?e coalition is very keen to use the corporatIOns power to impose its own industrial relations agenda on workers in all states of this country. The opposition's policy, Jobsback, says: It will, if necessary, use whatever constitutional power is available to it, excluding the external affairs power, to ensure that the benefits of this policy are as widely available as possible. It is very important to understand that they want to extend these powers and extend the benefits of their policy 'as widely available as possible'. We know that Jobsback is still its policy because on 30 January this year-a very significant day; the day that the Leader of the Opposition took up his duties-the Leader of the Opposition is on the record as saying: I think jobsback is basically right ... I saw it as a very sound policy. Let us not have any doubt that Jobsback is still well and truly locked in there. Nothing has been said by either the Leader of the Opposition or the member for Flinders since then that has in any way altered that position. Nothing they have said has changed their position on the use of the corporations power as well. In respect of that, the Leader of the Opposition has been quite unusually candid. He went to the National Press Club on 7 October 1992 and said: Our advice is that the corporations power would enable you to legislate in relation to minimum conditions of employment. You are looking at about 70 to 80 per cent of the entire work force. That is the estimate they give of what they can cover with their policies. He went on to say: That's without the benefit of having a like-minded government at the state level. So it is not just in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania; this is - ustralia-wide. This, by his own reckoning, IS 70 to 80 per cent of all workers in Australia. Until now, conventional wisdom has always had it that the federal coalition's IR policies would be most felt in those conservative states which have the sort of system that John Howard says he admires, the sort of system he said only in August of this year in the case of Western Australia was his very model. That was two months and two days after Kierath tabled his second wave. That is what you said: it was your model. Everyone needs to understand that the determined position of the coalition to override the states-that is what they would be doing with the use of the corporations power-and to impose these meagre minima on state award workers would flow right across the country and has a particular application in the case of New South Wales and particularly Queensland. Those two states enjoy the protection of a no disadvantage test and minimum underpinning by a comprehensiveMr Reith-They are dropping them.",93
139,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, they are not. They have a minimum underpinning by a comprehensive award safety net and a comprehensive and see application of a no disadvantage test. Mr Reith-You have got it wrong-again.",93
140,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Flinders!,93
141,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is worth looking at what this would mean in the case of a worker in Queensland, because no worker in Queensland would be safe. Look at what happens in the case of Gai, who is employed as a cook grade 2 in a Brisbane hotel. Under her comprehensive award, the hotel resorts and hospipoll? tality award, she is entitled at the moment to $401.50 per week. That is her basic entitlement. Then she is entitled to penalty rates which increase her wage by another $106.55. On top of that she receives overtime of $73.96 for the average week. On top of that she receives under her award a tool allowance guaranteed at $4 per week. In other words, the average gross weekly wage is $586. That is for Gai, a grade 2 cook at a Brisbane hotel. Have a look at what she would get. Because she would be a new employee under John Howard she has no guarantee of overtime, no guarantee of penalty rates and no guarantee of loadings. Under the coalition she stands to lose her penalty rates of $106.55, her average overtime of $73.96 and her tool allowance of $4. She stands to lose $184.51 per weekmore than 45 per cent of her average weekly salary. But of course that is not all. Her annual leave loading of $281.05 is no longer guaranteed. So she does that cold as well. The best she could hope for under the coalition would be 10 days non-cumulative sick leave each year. Under their support for the Tweed Valley case, they will be sweating as to whether to trade that in as well. Mr Tim Fischer-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I draw your attention to standing order 144(g), which says that questions should not contain hypothetical matter. I accept that is on the question side. But, equally, under the guiding of that section of the standing orders, it clearly means that answers also have to take some cognisance of that. That was clearly a hypothetical example and should be ruled accordingly.",94
142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Regrettably, Speakers have in fact ruled that those specific' issues that you have gone to apply to questions. There is no guidance as far as answers are concerned.",94
143,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Of course they do not like the answer because the answer reveals what would happen to workers Australia wide. Gai is but one example of what would happen to everyone on an award if it were replaced by the coalition's four miserly minimum standards.,94

159,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The first year of the implementation of Working Nation has promoted some very successful initiatives. In the first year we have seen 370,000 jobs created and the long-term unemployed numbers fall by 20 per cent, more than double the numbers for unemployment generally. Now the probability of exit from long-term unemployment is the highest it has ever been for a decade. That is the first year of Working Nation. But, as we all know, this government",95
160,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,95
161,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those down at the far end of the chamber!,95
162,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"made a commitment in the Working Nation program not for one year of activity but for four years of activity, and we are only one year into that four years. One of the reasons why this program has been successful to date is that we have been able to allocate substantial resources, the most resources ever committed by a government to getting unemployment down-some $2.2 billion of resources this year. In addition to the resources, we have effectively established a network for the implementation of these resources, a network that is the combination at regional level of area consultative committees-62 of them around the countryworking in partnership with the CES, the government's delivery network on the ground, to actually apply the programs the way regions want them applied. That is why we are getting such enormous response from the regions. I know members in this House from both sides have talked with great pleasure about the initiatives that the area consultative committee network has been introducing. This structure is not just there for the purpose of implementing the programs. We have also said to the committee, 'Give us input into how the programs can be changed. If they can be made to work better, we want to hear about it. We want to make these programs responsive to the needs of regions, responsive to the needs of enterprise and responsive to the needs of individuals.' The package of initiatives that I announced today reflects that consultation. It reflects the fact that these are groups that not only have seen the benefit and opportunity in the first year but also have risen to the challenge. To summarise these initiatives, what we have done has been to simplify the subsidy arrangements-reduce the number of programs available from 77 to 10. In the main, this number has been reduced because we have cut out subsidies that used to apply lower amounts for people under the age of 21. This will be a major boost for youth unemployment because now, effectively, full wage subsidies can be obtained for young people seeking work. We have also extended the subsidy regime to ensure that people in the sixto 12-month category can now get access to jobstart. Because we have made the impressive inroads into long-term unemployment in the first year, which was the objective that we set ourselves, we are now able to address the flow. Despite the fact that we have extended the subsidies to the shorter term unemployed, there is no diminution in commitment or resources available to the long-term unemployed. Another important initiative is that we have recognised the fact that certain unemployed people face multiple barriers to entry. It is not just the fact that they need training or have lack of recent experience in the labour force. They face a number of reasons why they cannot get back into work. We have now enabled much more flexibility in the way the resources available for them can be applied beyond just the labour market programs. have also added more places to contracted case managers, the competition to case manwho agement by the CES. These are initiatives that have been welcomed by welfare groups and business groups today. They have been welcomed because they have been listened to. They have been listened to because the government is saying, 'We are prepared to respond; we are prepared to be adaptive in relation to these hidden. programs in response to your identified needs.' The reality is that if we have made this progress in one year think what we can do in the remaining three years. It is these initiatives that will enable us to knock that huge hole in the unemployment problem. I make this final point: this has only possible because of a government commit resources to Working Nation. It is only those on this side of the House who are prepared to guarantee those resources. Those on the other side of the House would slash this program if they were to get to office. What we have been able to say to regions individuals would go out the door. Working Nation",95
163,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. With regard to the minister's last answer, isn't the truth about Working Nation more accurately stated by the Community and Public Sector Union in its September newsto letter? In that newsletter the union claimed 'we have clear evidence that much of Working Nation isn't working' and that 'the department is still telling the community that we can achieve things we just can't'. Given that expose of the truth, Minister, why should anyone believe that the changes your government have announced today are aimed at anything more than taking as many unemployed people as possible out of the statistics in the run-up to the next election?",96
164,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Here we have a person on the other side of the House supporting the most draconian industrial relations measures ever introduced in this country, prepared to introduce them if his party got into power, getting up and quoting a trade union in We defence of his miserable position.

170,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Those on my left, just relax.",96
171,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We all know the context of and that statement in September-their campaign for additional resources. If that is the best you can rely on, let me quote this back to you: we have had employment growth in the first year of Working Nation of 4.7 per cent-370,OOO jobs. That figure must be seen against the background of the statement by the Leader of the Opposition, who said that to argue for 500,000 jobs at the last election was an insult the intelligence of the Australian population and could never be achieved. He had given up before he ever got to office. But we have produced 655,000 jobs. This is the same Leader of the Opposition who has given up on the target for getting unemployment down. The other day he was asked about setting a target. He said he would not do it and he did not believe we could get down to five per cent. We believe we can, and we will-and we will do it under these programs. That is the jobs growth-4.7 per cent, or 370,000 jobs. Unemployment is now down to 8.5 per cent from a peak of 11.2 per cent. Long-term unemployment is down 20.1 per cent in a year and is now at its lowest level in trend terms since October 1991. In relation to case management, we have seen 477,000 unemployed people go into case management since July 1994, and nearly half of these have achieved outcomes. Competitive case management is in place, with over 250 private community organisations now helping 53,000 people. In relation to training, trainee commencements have increased rapidly, with 6,345 traineeship vacancies lodged with the CES in the September quarter-almost 200 per cent higher than the September quarter a year previously. More young people today are participating in entry level training than in any of the previous three decades. Apprentice and trainee commencements, as a proportion of the 15to 19-year-old age group, are now at record levels similar to those reached in the late 1980s. The 62 regionally based area consultative committees are all up and running, all developing their job drives. Some failure! This is the level of achievement of Working Nation in one·year of operation. When the shadow spokesman for employment is asked about what he would do to generate employment in this country, his stock answer is, 'We'd get off the back of small businesses.' That is great comfort to the unemployed out there. If he is really interested in knowing what small business has taken up, let me just tell him some very interesting information I learned today. We set up a trainees hip scheme for small business. Before Working Nation, traineeships never existed for the small business industry in this country. In New South Wales and in Victoria we set a target of 1,000 trainees in both of those states by the end of this year. TQday that target has been reached and exceeded in both Victoria and New South Wales-three months ahead of schedule. So small business is recognising the relevance of Working Nation. Small business is picking up the trainees. So we do recognise that small business is going to be the engine for growth in this economy. Again I say that I would not mind if a constructive suggestion came from the other side, because the programs are flexible enough to pick it up. We get this carping, this pretence at concern, this mock anger in terms of you expressing some concern for the unemployed and training, but you wanted to introduce university fees and vouchers when you were spokesman for education on the last occasion, and that is the reason you got dumped from that shadow portfolio when you got back. That is your approach: you would make people pay for it. Then you are an advocate for re-introducing Austrain, which is a discounted wage rate-discounted by 10 per cent if you have been out of work six months, 20 per cent if you have been out 12 months and 25 per cent if you have been out 18 months. Your solution to unemployment is to cut youth wages. They will not have a bar of it, and nor should they. Do not ever say that you do not believe that this program has been succeeding. It has, and we will ensure it continues to succeed. We will meet an objective. We are committed to getting unemployment down to the five per cent target. You on that side of the House have given up on it. Home Buyers",96
172,Mr OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House to what extent non-traditional providers of housing loans are entering the market? Can he also indicate what benefits these developments are having for home buyers?,97
173,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a fact that there is certainly a significant development in terms of new players coming into the home mortgage area. Traditionally we have seen banks and building societies as being the key lenders for housing. But what we are increasingly seeing is an array of new players coming into that area-credit unions are certainly exercising much more muscle in that area than they have before, but there are especially mortgage originators. These mortgage originators obtain their funds from a variety of wholesale funding sources including banks, insurance companies and other organisations. These funds are secured against the mortgages issued, sometimes via the issue of mortgage-back securities. The originator acts as an intermediary. The ultimate lender takes the risk that the mortgage will be repaid. This system of mortgage origination is something which is relatively new in our scene, but it is becoming quite significant. In the last year and a half the share of new home mortgages being taken up by these new players has gone from 2.1 per cent to 7.8 per cent. So it is increasing rapidly as a source of home finance for Australian home buyers. There is enormous scope for that. In the United States something like two-thirds of the home loan market is satisfied from this area of mortgage origination rather than from what we would see as the traditional home lending area. So there is enormous scope for these mortgage originators to become much bigger players in the area of home lending. The significance of that is that their interest rates are significantly less than those charged by the banks. The general bank rate at the moment for a variable home loan is 10.5 per cent, but the rates of the mortgage originators are down to as low as 8.7 per cent-about 1% per cent or 1.8 per cent less than that general bank rate. Generally they are in the order of one per cent or so less than the average bank rate. The number of these mortgage originators is about 20 at the present time and the number is increasing continually. Yesterday the AMP society, certainly one of the most powerful financial institutions in the country, announced that it is going to establish a new financial services company called Priority One, which will be involved in home lending with a variable interest rate of 9.4 per cent-I.1 per cent less than that general bank rate. We are seeing superannuation funds being used in this way, particularly through the industry funds and some other particular funds combining with National Mutual in the superannuation members home loans scheme which began a year ago. That scheme has since then lent some 3,100 home loans involving over $300 million, and its home loan rate is 8.7 per cent. So we are seeing superannuation funds using their funds for investment in housing, along with all the other avenues for investment, and making those funds available to superannuation fund members at rates which are very much below those being charged by the banks. The benefit of these lower interest rates is very substantial. On a $100,000 mortgage over 25 years, a one per cent saving means the reduction of about $70 a month or $21,000 over the life of the loan. So it is a very significant difference that is being built into the system through the development of these alternative home loan providers. Of course, that is having its impact on the banking system. Although the general level of rates has not moved appreciably, we did see that, when official rates were increased by some 2% per cent last year, the banks did not move their variable mortgage rates by 2% per cent-they absorbed one per cent of that and it went up by 1% per cent. We are also seeing it having an effect in terms of refinancing. The banks are admitting now that, when people come to them and say that they are looking at home loan alternativ s in relation to mortgage providers at lower rates, they are prepared to do some refinancing. In the Business Review Weekly of 9 October a senior bank executive said: When our existing borrowers let us know of their intention to switch to a mortgage originator, we might better the rate being offered. Just the mention of Aussie Home Loans can bring our rates down. So these alternatives are opening up to home buyers in Australia in terms of new lenders, new home buyers and those with existing home loans. In terms of new home buyers, the banks are increasingly utilising honeymoon rates to try to provide a more attractive product up front with very low rates in the first year or two to attract the business away from these mortgage originators. What we have then is a much more competitive system than has historically been the case, one which is increasingly providing alternative lower cost options for home buyers, and that is providing increasingly substantial benefits to home buyers in this country. Compare all that with the system which prevailed before this government came into office, when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer, and we got a highly regulated system with the cabinet setting the mortgage interest rate for banks. Despite the fact that they were doing that, when they went out of office that mortgage rate was 12Y2 per cent, even though that was a sort of superficial number because, to get a decent home loan, you had to go out and cocktail it with personal loans to try to get rest of your home loan as you could only get so much on the basis of that regulated rate. Of course, we were seeing the opposition, when they were in government, pursuing a system which gave us not only higher interest rates but also much less capacity at those regulated higher rates to actually get hold of a decent loan. What we have now is a much better system-a system which is increasingly bringing benefits to home buyers and, importantly, putting increasingly more and more pressure on the banks to be competitive in relation to their variable mortgage interest rates. We can expect that development to provide increasing pressure on the banks and to provide increasing benefits to home buyers in the future. Working Nation: Employment",98
174,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I refer the minister to the statement of Professor John Quiggin that: ... the target of Working Nation is not achievable with 3.7 per cent growth. It is dishonest of the government to maintain that five per cent unemployment by 2000 is its target. Given that seasonally adjusted employment is falling and that seasonally adjusted unemployment is rising, just how will the government achieve its five per cent unemployment benchmark if the trends are all going in the wrong direction?",99
175,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The trends are not going in the wrong direction. The trends continue to show, if you want to look at the statistics, continuing employment growth. So I think you have the question a little bit mixed up. As for the other part of your question which I think, as I recall it, asked how we can still say we will achieve our five per cent target, we will do it this way: what is required between now and the year 2000 to achieve the five per cent is, on average, 200,000 jobs per year-200,000. You know what we grew last time? Do you remember what I just said in the House five minutes ago? We grew 370,000 last year, and we have grown 655,000 in a little over two years. Do you start to understand how we might be able to the get there? You know, it is called economic growth leading to the jobs. Don't you understand that? It is not going the wrong way at all. Dr Kemp-No, because it is going down. Mr MCGauran-Down, down.",99
176,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! It is not a debate.,99
177,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What is required to secure that 200,000, roughly, number of jobs each year is economic growth in the order of 3Y2 to four per cent-and that is what we are on track to achieve. That assumes, on the analysis that has been done by my department, even an increase in the participation rate-a record participation rate. So I am quite happy to defend the ability of this government to achieve its five per cent, based upon the forecasts that are in the budget and based upon where the trends are still signifying within the employment statistics. I simply say this: I have never argued, nor has the government, that the five per cent would be an easy target-never argued that. Of course it is going to be difficult, and it does depend on being able to secure the economic growth. But we are in a position, in economic management terms, where there is now increasing recognition of the ability to secure that economic growth in the region of 3Yz to four per cent. We have not been able to do that before. I think that is one thing this government does need to be recognised for having achieved: sustained economic growth; low inflation; a wages accord that will underpin that low inflation; and a Working Nation program that will make sure that, as the economic growth continues, the long term unemployed will not get left behind. One other interesting dimension of the Working Nation programs is that, because we have been able to re-engage the long-term unemployed-that 20 per cent drop that I talked about before-we have seen not only an increase in the demand for labour but an ability to expand the supply. Of course, that is absolutely essential for keeping out inflationary pressures from any strong surge of growth in the economy. So the reality is that Working Nation is not just about social justice and about responding to the societal problems; it also makes great economic sense. This is a government committed to the five per cent target and we will achieve it. It is a disgrace that on your side of the House you are prepared to give up before you even try. We will not give up. We will persist with what we have achieved to date and we will get there. Tourism",99
178,Ms HENZELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Tourism and I inform him that some of the crocodiles he viewed recently at the Koorana crocodile farm turned up as guests on the 7.30 Report last night, snapping at the heels of the Leader of the National Party. What is the government doing about reports that the tourism industry is losing its market share of Japanese tourists because of Australia's visa requirement.",100
179,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Capricornia for her question and for arranging the crocodile pie lunch that I shared with her in her electorate recently. I am sure there are one or two crocodiles in here who might also enjoy a crocodile pie.,100
180,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister might get to Japanese tourist visas.,100
181,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased to be able to report to the House that we are still getting very positive growth in the number of Japanese that travellers coming to Australia. There is a slight decrease in our market share, but we are still getting an eight per cent per annum growth-something that is of great delight to the Australian tourism industry. But, because we would like to do better than that, we have had a summit, which has been taking place in Japan this week, of peak industry leaders from both the Japanese and Australian tourism industries, talking about ways that we can increase the number of Japanese travellers to Australia. This morning on radio one of the participants in that summit, Mr Bruce Baird, the Managing Director of the Tourism Council Australia and a former minister in the Greiner and Fahey governments, accused me of having a blind spot on visas. He said that he was disappointed that I was not championing the cause of visa free travel from Japan to Australia. He cited the example of New Zealand and said that should be the model for Australia; that New Zealand had abolished visas for 32 different countries and that Australia should take the evidence from their success in promoting tourism to their country. Mr Baird argued that we should therefore adopt visa free travel to Australia. In fact, New Zealand is not a good example for Mr Baird to cite. As I have said, New Zealand has abolished visas for 32 different countries, yet since 1987 Australia has had an average annual growth rate of 18.8 per cent in Japanese travel to Australia, yet New Zealand has been able to achieve only 10 per cent. So Australia, by maintaining visas, has been able to achieve a growth rate almost double that of New Zealand. The second point to make is that, if we abolished the visas tomorrow, we would be simply moving the processing from the country of origin to the airport counters when people arrive. We would end up with massive queues at the airports, language difficulties and arguments with customs officials, and it would create all sorts of inconvenience for people. There are people on both sides of this House, including the honourable member for Moncrieff, who have argued that they would like even tougher character checks carried out because of concerns that they have about criminals and others who they believe might be coming to Australia on tourist visas. The point I make is that there should be a proper policy debate on this issue. The reason there should be a proper policy debate is that last Friday at the Australian tourism awards Mr Baird told me that the Liberal Party had told him that they had changed their policy before the next election and they would allow tourists from some countries to visit Australia visa free. Mr Bruce Scott-You must believe in fairies. You must still put your teeth out for the tooth fairy.",100
182,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is what Mr Baird told me. He also said that Warwick Parer, the shadow minister for aviation and tourism, had said that the opposition had changed its position after complaints from the RSL. Mr Bruce Scott-You are in the land of the fairies.",101
183,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Maranoa!,101
184,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I understand the Leader of the Opposition has denied the story today, but it is interesting to note that Senator Parer is not taking any calls today. We do not have a denial from Senator Parer certainly to date. But we do have a statement from Digger James saying that he was contacted by the Liberal Party and asked for his views and he told them that the RSL would be opposed to any relaxation of the visa policy. Certainly, Bruce Baird told me that the opposition was going to abolish them but then did a backflip, and Digger James has said that he was in the loop as part of this discussion. I think this is a legitimate public policy issue, and we would like to know where the Leader of the Opposition stands on whether we should abolish visas for visitors to Australia. I think we have a right to know where he stands. But this is just another example of his weak leadership, where he will not tell us where he stands on this or other issues. The opposition start to head in a particular direction; they get some negative feedback; and they head in the opposite direction. He will not tell us where he stands on this or so many other issues. Traditionally, we have had a bipartisan policy of support for universal visas. We would like to know whether the Leader of the Opposition is going to walk away from that policy. We certainly have not had any commitment from him as to whether they will be revisiting this issue before the election. All the evidence is there that they are flip-flopping all over the place on this particular policy. The government has tried to make the issuing of visas as speedy and as easy as possible. We now have 16 countries where people can apply for visas through agents acting on behalf of the department of immigration. The department of immigration is working on a way to develop an electronic visa, almost an invisible visa, that can be applied for through the use of airline computer reservation terminals. That will make sure there is no detriment whatsoever in maintaining that visa policy by carrying out those character checks, by making sure that people coming to Australia are those whom we want. The last point I would make is that Mr Baird also called for a relaxation of the limits on foreign tour guides who are allowed to come to Australia. This is the area that I find most disturbing of all. At the moment, the reason the federal government and most of the state and territory governments are pushing the tourism industry is that it is about new jobs, especially for young Australians. Why would you be out there arguing to relax one of the rules that keeps the pressure on the Japanese inbound companies to keep training young Australians to act as Australian tour guides? We are here trying to argue that more Australians should study Asian languages, should build up their skills so that they can get jobs in the tourism industry. So why would you be arguing to relax the rules that keep the pressure on them to do the right thing? Earlier today in the Senate, Senator O'Chee complained that the government should be getting tough on working visas. Yet we have Senator Parer running around saying that he wants to abolish tourist visas. On this, as on so many other public policy issues, we do not know where they stand. We do not get any leadership whatsoever from the Leader of the Opposition. It is time they stood up and told us where they were. Employment and Unemployment",101
185,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is, once again, to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. In view of the minister's fixation with statistics, I refer him to his claim that the government has created over 600,000 jobs since the last election and I ask: is it a fact that the recession destroyed over 337,000 jobs; is it a fact that the net growth has not been sufficient to kee- up with the growth in the labour .force smce 1990; is this massive failure on Jobs not the reason why unemployment was 6.2 per cent five years ago and is 8.5 per cent today? Given the Prime Minister's claims last week that the economy is now growing strongly, are Australians not entitled to conclude that this is as good as it ever gets under your government?",102
186,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know which set of statistics you read. Don't you understand what the labour force was in 1983, when you left power? It was six million people. Today it is 8.3 million people. It has gone up by more than a third under this government. It is true that in the recession there was, obviously, a job decline. But the reality is that, in the period 1983-89, this government created 1.6 million jobs and in this recovery, 1993 through to now, we have created 665,000-more than two million jobs. Yet you have the gall to come in here and tell us about employment policies. Come off it! Where have you ever made a serious contribution to debate in this place? Everything you have put up on that side of - he House has been rejected by the AustralIan electorate. The simple fact of the matter is t?at th-re has been solid job growth, extraordmary Job growth. I have quoted the figures previously: 655,000, 4.7, over the last year. No other country in the world is growing like that. Dr Kemp-That is why it went up.",102
187,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Goldstein!,102
188,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Unemployment has gone down from 11.2 per cent to 8.5 per cent, with a rising participation rate. I think you are incapable of analysing any set of figures. Mr MCGauran-Like the CPSU statement.",102
189,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Gippsland! Are you running a double act?,102
190,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I observe that the only time you have ever asked questions in this parliament is when there has been an adverse circumstance in the seasonally adjusted figure, job and that was over the last month. On every other occasion we have had the press releases out; we have had 58,000 growth in one mo?th and 90 000 in another. What were you saymg then? :This is job growth that is unsustainable. We can't keep going in this direction because what we'll get is inflation. This is terrible. We'll have interest rates going up.' That is what you were saying. Not only ha-e we consistently produced jobs growth; we WIll continue to do it. I tell you this: if what this country does is revert through a change of government to your policies, unemploym-nt will surely go up. You have got no capaCIty to control wages-none whatsoever. I am just reminded of a figure, gi.ven t-at the shadow minister is so preoccupied With statistics. Compare the 655,000 jobs that we have created in 2'12 years in this government with what was achieved in the whole five years that the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer when he created, under his reign, 270,000--twice the time and half the number. It was pathetic. It is no wonder you have given up on achieving five per cent. This government, as I have said before, will not give up. I believe that our track ,record will stand us in inestimable stead With the electorate where, if employment is the major issue and I believe it still is, they will be voting for us and not for you. You're duds, you're failures, and you've got not one original idea on the front bench. Native Title",102
191,Mr LES SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Special Minister of State and it concerns native title issues. I ask the minister: what progress has been made regarding native title in conjunction with the states and territories?,102
192,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much for that question. There has been considerable progress on the question of native title and our relations with the states-not with all states, unfortunately . Yesterday I made a determination that the South Australian Environment, Resource and Development Court and the Supreme Court of South Australia would be recognised as state bodies for the purposes of granting native title. That means that applicants can go to those two courts to seek native title or, of course, come to the Commonwealth, as they would choose. I also made two further determinations yesterday so that alternative right to negotiate processes could take place as they suit South Australia, sitting within the confines of the Commonwealth systems. This means that, if the South Australian government wants to compulsorily take land or if, in respect of mining activities, people want to get access to native title land or land that has been claimed, they can do so through South Australia's own system. This is a state, I remind you, that seven months ago had the Commonwealth before the High Court, wanting to deny the existence of the Commonwealth's Native Title Act. They have now nimbly, I might say, reentered and given to us their own regime which yesterday I determined was acceptable to the Commonwealth government so that South Australians who wish to get access to native title land can, with due and proper regard to those who want to apply for native title or in fact have native title. The situation Australia-wide is as follows on the question of native title: all states and territories have validated past actions according to the Native Title Act scheme and all governments, except Western Australia and the Northern Territory, have accepted the Commonwealth's financial offer. South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria have produced or are working on their own proposals to suit their own needs. There has been a major shift in the way in which people regard native title today, compared with the way people regarded it seven months ago. Now, most Australian states have accepted not only the fact of native title but also that the other issue-that is, people getting access to land, say for explorationcan be dealt with quite readily within the Commonwealth system. That shift is so much so that in Western Australia, the state that will not accept the Commonwealth's position, 81 per cent of all future acts-that is, things like granting a permit to explore on potential native title land-are accepted and are not being held up by the national Native Title Act processes. Let us keep in mind that nearly all the states are now on board on the question of the grant of native title and access to that land. And, even in those that are not, there is very good access for those who need land under the current national Native Title Act. I congratulate South Australia for its good work and I look forward to other states falling into line. Australian National Line",103
193,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. The minister would be aware that the Maritime Union of Australia has rejected outright the sale of ANL to P&O. Will the government now put an end to the absurdity of giving the MUA a veto over the sale of ANL by making it clear that any strike action by the MUA will be strongly opposed by the government? Or will the sweetener to the MUA, foreshadowed by the Minister for Finance yesterday, now become a king-sized bribe to add to the $145 million already wasted by the government's incompetence? Why is the government prepared to waste even more taxpayers' money in an attempt to end the embarrassment of its bungled and incompetent handling of ANL instead of going to the cause of this fiasco by sacking the Minister for Transport, who is responsible for this complete and utter farce?",103
194,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government will make a decision on what it will do about ANL by the end of this month, as we indicated previously on the timetable that was announced by the Minister for Transport and me about a month or so ago. As far as we are concerned, we will stick to that timetable. There are two alternative courses of action. One course of action is to sell the entity to P&O. Another course of action is to massively restructure it. Both of those courses of action are available to government and one of them will be pursued by the end of the month. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission",103

199,Mr DODD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Could the minister inform the House what the government is doing to enhance accountability in his portfolio area?,104
200,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. If there is one thing that distinguishes the government and the opposition, it is that on this side of the chamber we have a consistent series of policy reforms rolling out. Invariably, those policy reforms are directed towards social progress. At this stage I am pleased to answer the member's question by highlighting the fact that yesterday I issued a media release announcing the government's intention to proceed with some very significant reforms to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act which, in the main, are focused towards advancing issues of public accountability and openness. There are a number of amendments which will be the subject of consultation with indigenous people, including proposals for a register of pecuniary interests of regional councillors, the opening up of regional council meetings and the opening up of the papers and records of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, to the greatest practical and reasonable extent, to public scrutiny. I am also pleased to say that today I made it clear that the government would initiate a review of the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act and that review would be undertaken by the Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies in association with the Aboriginal Law Unit from the University of New South Wales and the North Australian Research Unit. I think it is important that there be a review of this act in view of the fact that it has been in existence for some 20 years. Despite some piecemeal reforms, I think there are very good reasons now why there ought to be such a comprehensi ve review of the act. Again, in part, that review will be directed towards enhancing public accountability. Finally, I can say to the honourable member that, pending the final outcome of that review, the government will seek to make some shortterm interim, but nevertheless significant, amendments to that legislation to enhance public accountability. It would be the hope of the government that the opposition would support the necessary reforms to bring about that accountability. The tragedy is that the last time the opposition entered into debate on issues of public accountability in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs it was in the course of the land fund debate when the coalition advanced two main propositions, both of which were regressive and both of which were a blow against issues of public accountability because they effectively called for grants of land to individuals and then with no constraint, no limitations, on the ability of those individuals to sell the land. This government has a proud record of reform and reform directed towards social justice in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. But in doing so, we regard issues of public accountability as non-negotiable, unlike the opposition. Wage Levels",104

As a consequence, we have seen a substantial and dramatic improvement in household disposable income by 40 per cent over the period, an increase of household disposable income per capita of 21 per cent and real wages grow by 7.3 per cent in the period. This year in the management of the economy we have seen the budget go back into surplus and as well as that the presentation Accord Mark VIII, which, as the minister has said, deals with the difficult problem of running a wages system in tandem with a modest rate of inflation to maintain our core competitiveness and to keep the growth going.

Mr O'Brien said: You'd have to concede that on the face of it it gives ammunition to the government's claims that the coalition is a policy free zone. To which the Leader of the National Party said: But we do have policies-policies of substance, policies in the pipeline and policies, some aspects of which have been already announced.

What is it? The black spots program. Then we had the Leader of the Opposition on the same subject. He was asked in Adelaide last week: The major issue will be industrial relations, think?

He said: ... whether or not it really isn't time for group ... It is on the basis of a rotational basis. It on the basis that you are worthy; it is not the basis that the nation needs you. It is a case of: 'They've had five turns; it's now our tum.' The new group would include the new minister for trade, Mr Fischer; the new minister for foreign affairs, Mr Downer; the new minister for industrial relations, Mr Reith; the new minister for employment, Kemp; and Mr Newness himself, the member for Bennelong-the new old Right. Sixteen of the 19 members on the front-bench who endorsed Fightback are still there. I was talking about their Paulian conversion on road to the Damascus last weekend when they allegation. were referred to in the popular debate. There have been only a few modest addidaytions to the front-bench. The member for Mackellar is one of the additions. Did you see what she had to say during the week about compassion and social policy? She said: I think it's an important principle bring children into the world you have to remain responsible for them and that it's not the taxpayers' responsibility to pick up the remnants of a family when it breaks up.

The Leader of the Opposition would try to cut youth wages back to $3 an a new hour and would try to rip away at the wages of working Australians.

I honestly do not believe you heard them and that is the reason you have dismissed the point of order.

Here we are now six months from the national election, and what is dribbling out of the opposition-black spots, the GST, wage cuts and the draconian legislation in Western Australia and the support of them. On that side of the House, the only policy development is the further development of all their prejudicial disposition.

276,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Yesterday the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) raised a matter of privilege in connection with reported industrial actions concerning the operation of certain members' electorate offices. In support of his argument, the honourable member referred to a newspaper report and a copy of what he said was a facsimile message sent to his electorate office. As I read it, the newspaper report, which was dated 7 October, referred to an exchange between the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear)  industrial action. It also referred to the matter in dispute and it quoted comments by Senator MCKiernan. The second document the honourable member referred to was a photocopy of a fax purporting to be from Mr MCKerrow which appeared to urge electorate office staff members to support others in taking industrial action. I have to advise the House that I have today received by fax a letter from Mr MCKerrow stating that he believes the document tabled by the honourable member is a forgery and that he, Mr MCKerrow, will be taking action to have the matter investigated. I table a copy of Mr MCKerrow's letter to me. So much for that aspect. On the substantive issue, I have no difficulty in accepting the honourable member for Cowan's claim that an industrial dispute of some nature concerning electorate offices has occurred. It is not at all clear to me, however, from the information the honourable member has presented that there is evidence of improper interference or attempted or intended improper interference with the free performance by members of their duties as members. Accordingly, I am not willing to allow precedence to a motion. NA",109

A personal explanation should not be used to mislead the House.

Quite frankly, he should be reprimanded by you, Mr Speaker, for doing so.",109
286,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I am indebted to the honourable member for Flinders because he always gives me an opportunity to say a couple of things. The first is again to remind members that if they believe they have been personally misrepresented there is a form in which they are to seek to explain that, and there is a form in which they are to do that. Just reflect on that. Secondly, with regard to the whole matter of points of order, again I say to people that they must be genuine, they must be succinct and they must put the question clearly to the chair.

A matter arose a few minutes ago when I happened to be in the lobby watching the proceedings of this chamber on television. Certain things were said that I think you may not have heard. Can I say to you-and it is a genuine question-that it seems to me the effect of what you said was to give a ruling that if somebody said something that was unparliamentary and it was then withdrawn they were then at liberty to repeat it because they had already withdrawn it. I am not questioning your ruling. I think it is probably quite possible, because the 1994-95. Prime Minister had his back turned to Hansard and his head was down-but it was caught by the audio--that you didn't hear it and Hansard may not have. But that was the effect of your ruling. Can I ask you to please check the audio and perhaps give some thought to what happened subsequently-the offending words were in fact repeated and had not been withdrawn.",110

294,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of Working Nation to offer effective assistance to unemployed people. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number a/members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",111
295,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have just seen the humiliating instance where the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has felt forced to extend question time in order to make up for the blundering, humiliating confusion demonstrated by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) in his answers to the opposition. I think every member of the House heard the Minister for Employment, Education and Training struggling to decide what the effect of the opposition's policies would be on wages. They go up; they go down. It is like one of the rides at a fun park. It is like the mad mouse: sometimes it is up and sometimes it is down. Mr MCGauran-He says it's both now.",111
296,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He says it is both but his leader does not agree, and that is why question time was extended. Question time was extended so the Prime Minister could get up and say that our policies would drive wages down. Have you got that message now, Minister? The leader thinks they are going to drive wages down, but you say they will drive wages up. That kind of confusion is what we have seen over the last 15 months under Working Nation. That kind of confusion is what has led to such a high degree of demoralisation amongst the young people of this country. Your policies, as everybody knows, have not been working. No-one knows that better than the members of your own department. Last year in September, a year ago, the Community and Public Sector Union stated quite clearly what was happening in the department. I quote what it said just in case anyone has forgotten: The result of this is the current chaos as DEET management try to frantically rearrange staffing resources to meet Case Management targets, as well as fudge statisticsthese are the people employed by the departmentto make it look as though targets are being met. A year later the union has again repeated these charges. They say in their September 1995 newsletter: ... we have clear evidence that much of Working Nation isn't working. The department is still telling the community that we can achieve things we just cannot. Both the minister and I recently attended the Jobs for Young Australians conference in Adelaide. I was very moved by the comment made there by Natalie Stansfield after hearing the minister, who was widely criticised to me, when I reached the conference, as having ducked away afterwards, not bothered to talk with the young people there and not waited around for questions or for consultation. He was in there with the official statement and out of there in his official car as quickly as he could. The message people gave me was very clear. They said, 'We're sick of being shuffled through Simon Crean's training programs one after the other. We want real jobs.' We and of course they understand--even if you do not, Minister-that those jobs will come primarily from the small and medium sized businesses in this country. Natalie Stansfield said: We are young, and maybe we are naive, but we are not stupid. We want meaningful work, not just meaningful words. Meaningful work is not what is provided by the training programs and the subsidised employment programs, particularly this new work opportunities program that you are funding to the tune of billions of dollars. Young people in this country want genuine opportunities. Your staff have blown the whistle on you. Indeed, they ridiculed Working Nation. I can see today why they refer to you as 'Squeaky'. It is this mad mouse problem. It has infected the entire structure of Working Nation. Sometimes it is up and sometimes it is down. We add a little bit here and we take off a little there. Everybody can have a good ride through these programs. Indeed, the rides increased last year. The amount of recycling went up and the number of people who were helped went down last year. In the first year of Working Nation, the bottom line-the line against which we assess Working Nation-was that that program helped fewer people and put them through poorer quality programs than the government provided in the previous year, the year before Working Nation. The government says that it has created 600,000 new jobs. I want to repeat this, Minister, because you obviously did not understand the question when you attempted to answer it in the House-and the Prime Minister of course had to get up and give an answer that he thought was a great deal better and a great deal clearer than yours. The government says that you have created 600,000 new jobs. But the recession destroyed 337,000 jobs and the new jobs that have come into existence, the net new jobs when you subtract that very substantial number of jobs which just went down the drain because of the recession we had to have-I want you to write this down-are not great enough to cope with the growth in the labour force. As a consequence, unemployment has gone up. Five years ago, when the government went to the electorate in 1990, unemployment was 6.2 per cent. Now it has ratcheted up again to 8.5 per cent. Another quarter of a million people unemployed over the last five years! So when you and your leader are going around the country talking about this wonderful job creation, the people out there are thinking, 'Hang on a moment. Isn't it more difficult to get a job now than it was five years ago?' They are right. Unemployment has ratcheted up again. As you know, job growth has now flattened off and long-term unemployment has gone up again, despite all the efforts of your programs to redefine the long-term unemployed. Your problem is that you treat unemployment as a statistical problem. You think that when you get to the election campaign the important thing is that the statistics look right, bit not that people have real jobs. You think the important thing is that either the statistics look right or people should not be allowed to see them at all. That is why you have stopped the publication of the regional youth unemployment statistics. Those statistics were giving a very clear message. That message was that there were many regions of this country where youth unemployment was up at 45, 55 and 65 per cent, and that is a statistic you did not like. You do not like those kinds of statistics. Behind everyone of those statistics there is a tragedy; there is somebody wanting to start off on a decent life-and your programs are not helping them. You say, 'Working Nation has created training. We've put lots of young people into our traineeships and apprenticeships. Commencements are the highest for three decades.' Let us look at the reality of that. The truth of the matter is that you get the numbers up only because the labour force has grown. But let us correct that. Let us look at apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the labour force. They are at the lowest level for three decades. Mr Crean-Rubbish!",111
297,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The minister says that that is rubbish. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to table a chart, prepared by the Dusseldorp Skills Forum, which demonstrates this fact unequi vocally. Leave granted.",113
298,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"These young people have not been able to get the opportunities that they need. At the heavy engineering dinner last night, the example was given by the chairman of the association that his company advertised for some 30 apprentices and received 928 applications. That is a story that I have heard right around this country. Young people out there simply cannot get into these schemes. About 10 years ago, Laurie Carmichael brought down Australia Reconstructed-you would remember that very well, Minister, because that was the document that linked training to your centralised industrial relations agenda, the fatal strategic decision that destroyed the training system in this country. What happened? You had targets then of 75,000 trainees a year. You never reached them. You never got above 15. The usual figure was nine. What did you try in Working Nation, this bold ambitious program of yours? What was your target? It was 26,500. What did you manage to reach, with all the bureaucratic chaos in that department-the chaos the union correctly identified? You managed to reach 16,000. When you looked at the unemployed last year, you thought one thing only: how can we get the numbers down, the statistics down? What is the best way to launder these statistics? So you set up a program. You thought: we will have a go at the long-term unemployed; we will have a go at getting that down. Nobody can dispute that a special effort was needed to help long-term unemployed people. We endorsed the fact that an effort should be made and was made. But what you did was to set up programs which created long-term unemployed people. You said, under your job compact strategy, 'We're not going to admit people to these major employment programs until they are long-term unemployed; they'll have to wait around now until they're long-term unemployed.' Sure, these programs were set up, but you only focused on the other end of the queue. You thought: with these programs, we can redefine these people as short-term unemployed; we can take them off the other end of the queue because, after they have been through these programs, they no longer will be long-term unemployed--even though six out of 10 of them are unemployed again after participating in your program. You are pumping people through these programs at a great rate. There were 20,000 people who went through your subsidised employment programs in June alone. Every month somewhere between 11,000 and 20,000 unemployed people are coming off these programs and they are all defined-those half or perhaps 60 per cent of them who do not have jobs-as short-term unemployed. No wonder these long-term unemployment figures have come down in the last year. But the problem has been that those figures have been stuck for the last five months. What is going on? A lot of other unemployed people who were short-term unemployed have now been forced to wait around until they are long-term unemployed before they qualify. So at the other end of the queue you have been turning people into long-term unemployed people. That is why the figures have been stuck. And that is why you have changed the eligibility guidelines in your announcements today. You know that we have been right. I identified that strategic flaw over a year ago. I have been telling you for a year that that is the problem with Working Nation at its corethat it is actually doing harm to a lot of people. You said, 'Oh no, it's not.' I said, 'Targets are not being met.' You said, 'Oh yes, they are.' What happened to the jobstart targets? You set a target in Working Nation of 189,000. How many did you get? You undershot by 94,000 unemployed people who did not get assistance because of your bungling. This mad mouse approach to Working Nation-it is just crazy! We told you about it. We were very constructive. All our criticisms of Working Nation have been constructive. Virtually every change that you have made to Working Nation has been a change that we have recommended. But the flaw you have not been able to correct, the major blunder of this government, is that you have not been able to create enough real jobs. That is what Working NationMr Crean-You're joking!",113
299,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You think you have? The minister thinks the government has been able to create enough real jobs. This is the very best they are able to do. They think they have been able to create enough jobs and those 763,000 unemployed people on the ABS statistics should recognise that the government has created enough jobs. The government thinks there is no problem. Even though growth is flattening out now and unemployment is stabilising at 8.5 per cent, the minister thinks this is as good as it is ever going to under this government. That is the message the Labor government is giving unemployed people in this country. The minister can talk for as long as he likes, but around this country young people know that he has failed them. They know that that is the reason why teenage unemployment did not decline at all in the year to August and why the number of young teenage unemployed males went up. They know that a lot of the people who are counted by the government and the ABS as being employed are really so grossly underemployed that they regard themselves as still being unemployed. Minister, through your incompetence, you have betrayed a generation of young people, and these changes today just confirm your failure.",114
300,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I in fact welcome the opportunity that has finally been given to me by the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) to actually debate the success of Working Nation in its first year of operation. The member for Goldstein has been very quiet on that side of the House in asking questions. I saw him trying to get his darg up today. He actually got in three questions in a row. So congratulations to him. The simple message that we have been conveying not just to the young people of this country but to the electorate at large is that we have an objective of getting unemployment down and we have a strategy to achieve that. The message is quite clear: we will achieve five per cent unemployment by the turn of this decade and we have the policies to do it. In the 2\12 years since we were returned to office, we have achieved 655,000 new jobs and a drop in the unemployment rate from 11.2 per cent to 8.5 per cent. Yet the member for Goldstein wants to ignore all of that. I have never said that 8.5 per cent is where we should sit and that we do not need to do any better, and I have never said that the task of achieving our objective would be an easy one. We do recognise the magnitude of the problem, but we also recognise that, without active labour market programs actually out get there assisting to get the long-term unemployed re-engaged, those long-term unemployed people will simply not have a chance in this recovery. The stark reality is that in the recovery of 1983 to 1989 when this economy produced 1.6 million jobs under Labor, which the member for Goldstein wants to ignore in his additions, only 100,000 of those jobs went to the long-term unemployed. In this recovery, which has seen the creation of 400,000-odd jobs since Working Nation was introduced, some 140,000 jobs have already gone to the long-term unemployed. That is the difference between having the targeted measures that we have introduced with Working Nation and just leaving it to the marketplace. Those on the other side want to argue that they are concerned about the long-term unemployed, but they would do nothing to help them. They would not develop these proposals and programs to get them jobs. When we introduced Working Nation, we had three objectives in mind: one, to reduce long-term unemployment and achieve that five per cent target; two, to boost the effort entry level training to ensure that our young people were engaged in the work force as soon as possible after leaving school; and, three, to lift the skills of the nation. We all know that the jobs of the future are increasingly going to require skills, but what is the strategy in place to achieve that? Until Working Nation came along, there was no such thing as traineeships in all of those sectors in the economy which have produced the jobs. The big job growth sectors in the economy have been finance and banking, construction, the environment, sport, arts and entertainment and community services, but not one of those sectors had a traineeship before Working Nation. If the argument is right that we have to develop the skills of people so they can compete for jobs, we need training programs in place so they can actually develop those skills. But the member for Goldstein would cut out all those training programs because he says they are useless. He says that they do not lead to jobs. Let me remind him of the fact that one of the most successful labour market programs is traineeships. Eighty-four per cent of people who go through a traineeship are in a job-an unsubsidised job-12 months after the traineeship is finished. That is the effectiveness of traineeships. The difficulty is, if you cannot get an apprenticeship or if you do not want to sign up to four years without knowing in advance whether you really want to pursue a certain vocation, how do you get into training? The whole exercise has been to open up the options for training in recognition of the fact that training increases employability. Working Nation came along and funded the places for additional traineeships but, most importantly, it has engaged industry in marketing those traineeships. All of the industry sectors are now actively behind the NETTFORCE operations marketing the traineeships. I mentioned before in the House the success we have had with small business traineeships. This is a program that the member for Goldstein would ridicule. But in New South Wales and Victoria over 1,000 traineeships were achieved, three months of ahead of target. You say that people are not going into traineeships and apprenticeships these days. I do not know what rock you hide under when this information and these figures come out. The other thing that is terribly important to understand, and why it is essential that we keep young people involved in school and try to develop school as a more relevant means through which they can enter the work force, is the stark statistic that the chances of unemployment are twice as high for a person who does not complete year 12 as for a person who does. The difficulty these days is that until Working Nation came along we had no mechanism by which we were offering more choice in schools so that students could complete year 12 while actually getting a qualification that was recognised other than for entry to university. We developed the vocational training system. We ensured a means by which schools could offer subjects in years 11 and 12 that were not just recognised for entry to university but also recognised for entry to the workplace. We have seen all the writings, all the analysis, that says we have to use schools far more effectively. But relying on the states to do it was not producing the results. It was only when Working Nation came along that we had the leverage to develop this program because we funded a new initiative called the Student Traineeship Foundation. As for the youth unemployment conference in Adelaide that the member for Goldstein referred to, I met with that group on three occasions. I do not go there just to lecture the people involved. I think they have a legitimate concern. They say, 'We accept that training is important, we accept that training increases employability, but will the training lead to a job?' I think they are entitled to an answer, but that is why we developed and announced a month or so ago the school to work guarantee. Effectively, we have combined the vocational application in schools with the guarantee of a job for 12 months if they successfully complete. It did not need substantially new money; it needed the linking of programs. But the programs did not exist before Working Nation. We did not have the traineeship scheme or the Student Traineeship Foundation and we had not given greater encouragement to group employment and all those other initiatives. I have also heard from the other side that this program has not produced the sort of flexibility that is needed to respond to enterprises in training. Before Working Nation the only form of training for the workplace was an apprenticeship and a structured traineeship. That required people to be off the job for two to three days a week, depending on the sort of training program they were in. This is not what small business wants. Small business does not know when it needs the peak load in its business. It cannot afford the disruption of people being away regularly for two days a week. But it does need the training. That is why there has been a big pick up in the small business traineeship. But when we developed the training wage we said that the training could be delivered on the job. That is why this small business traineeship has been so well picked up. It offers flexibility. Employers can now take on young people and pay them a training wage, which is award and competency based. It has to lead to a qualification-not like the opposition's Austrain, which is completely poles apart-and must be accredited. Not only can employers get people under the training wage but also the training can be undertaken on the job. In addition to that, they can get access to a range of subsidies. What we are offering employers these days is an ability to develop a person in the job as the business grows. They can have the option of the person working for one day a week or four days a week. It is up to the employer. There has never been a more flexible offer to employers in relation to training, skill development and employment. If they pick up the people through the skills program, they can employ them a day a week. Even if they cannot employ them a day a week fully themselves, through group employment we can offer them people to work-a practical application: getting training and skills at the same time-for part of the day. This never existed before Working Nation, so don't tell me that this has not been significant in terms of response. We have responded to the enterprise needs. We have responded to the individual needs. But, more importantly, we have responded to regional needs. I am happy to say, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, that I am attending your electorate tonight to recognise an important program that has been put in place in your area-the jobsnorth campaign. This is the product of an area consultative committee that the member for Goldstein wants to dismiss. You know how effective it has been because you have argued in the House in support of it. Mr Bilney-Yes, I've heard that.",114
301,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Everyone has heard it. We brought the Notice Paper on so we had a chance to talk about it. The reality is that people out there are telling us that they know they want to expand their tourism sector, that they can bring economic activity to the region without having to spend more on infrastructure because the existing hospitality infrastructure is underutilised. So they came to us and said, 'Can the Working Nation programs fit our needs?' We sat down with them and developed a tailor-made program to satisfy their needs. They have exceeded their target too. Do you understand that? Do you understand why the programs are working? They are working because they are responsive to what employers, individuals and regions are saying. I have personally visited 50 of the regions covered by the area consultative committees, so I know that the regional structure works. It works because we have resourced them and we have a network in place to deliver the programs. It is the regions that say, 'These how we want the Working Nation programs to work for us.' In essence we say, 'You know what your economic development strategies are. What Working Nation can do is to fund the employment and training needs to underpin that economic development.' Similar initiatives have taken place in Adelaide. It was interesting the other day when, speaking in Adelaide, Rupert Murdoch said how tragic youth unemployment was. I am reminded of the fact that the day I went over to Adelaide subsequent to that youth conference, we announced important new initiatives for Adelaide: 1,500 new jobs in the Salisbury area; a guarantee of employment for each year 12 student completing successfully vocationally; and 490 jobs in the automotive industry, 400 of them at GM at Elizabeth. Do you know where the Murdoch paper reported that? Page 21 of the Advertiser. The point I am making is this: the regions are responding. The regions do understand the advantage and opportunity in Working Nation, and I am delighted they do. Really, Working Nation is a national initiative which is regionally implemented. That is why it has been very successful. I do accept that we still have a long way to go, and we will get there because of the changes we have introduced today by way of listening to what the regions have been saying to us and adjusting the programs accordingly. I mentioned in question time the list of initiatives that had been undertaken. I say in conclusion that we will get unemployment down in this country by continuing the Working Nation strategy-by engaging and empowering individuals, enterprises and regions with the resources. But we will only get there with the combination of economic growth and the Working Nation programs. It is only this government that can keep delivering the growth, and it is certainly only this government that is committed to Working Nation. The only programs that have been nominated by the opposition when asked to identify where the cuts would occur are Working Nation programs, but the opposition's own backbench is out there saying, 'Oh yes. We support Working Nation.' The Depuare ty Speaker says he supports Working Nation, but the opposition will not support the programs. (Time expired)",116
302,Ms WORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) talks today of the success of Working Nation, but the rumours along the corridors and in the press gallery have been that he has been very worried about the failure of it and has been trying to get to see the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) but that the Prime Minister has been in his bunker. Why the changes today and a cabinet meeting held that others in the industry did not even know about? The minister needed to get these changes up. Why did he need to get these changes up? Because there is chaos in the government and panic and desperation are setting in. That is why Dr Russell is being brought home: they know there is an election around the comer and unemployment figures are going up, not down. So how can they now be fixed? The minister has said time and time again what a great success Working Nation is. On only 23 August, in response to a question here, he said: The opposition, of course, says that Working Nation has been a flop. Some flop! The fact is that Working Nation is working, has worked to date and will continue to work. Yet today he is admitting some of the failures and by the changes he is announcing is recognising that it has been, to some extent, a failure. I would argue that these changes represent the same theory as the sports rorts. Remember sports rorts just before the 1993 election? Money was thrown everywhere to get votes. After the election, when there were worthy programs in need of funding, there was nothing left in the kitty. Now, with money being thrown around desperately trying to get unemployment figures down, hopefully it will look better for the government. What is the true extent of long-term unemployment? It has been argued, Minister, that you delude yourself or that you, at worse, mislead the public because Working Nation programs have allowed government to mask the extent of long-term unemployment. The long-term unemployed are removed from the register of unemployed, placed in labour market programs and at the end of the program are reregistered as short-term unemployed. It would seem from this that Labor's true aim is to reduce the statistical level of unemployment. The national executive director of skillshare, David Thompson, recently told a Senate committee that it is not the number in programs that counts but rather the employment outcomes from these programs. Most current labour market programs leave six out of 10 participants in unemployment queues at the conclusion of the program. Between now and the next election you can just bet we will see more people being churned through these programs because that is the way unemployment figures will be tampered with. We need economic growth and we need real job creation. Having people job ready will only work if there are jobs for people to go to. We need to be addressing the key, core problem, which is economic growth and true job creation. It is not good enough to shuffle unemployed people through training and labour programs which do not lead to sustainable jobs or bear any resemblance to the skills, qualities, expertise and aspirations unemployed people. At present 763,100 Australians are searching for work. But this number of unemployed is simply the tip of the iceberg because there is hidden unemployment in training and labour market programs and underemployment because there are so many people in part-time and casual jobs. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that over 500,000 time workers do want more hours. Over 100,000 people are so discouraged that they no longer register with the CES and over 600,000 people are waiting in education or training courses looking for work. The government, in self-congratulation mode about unemployment figures, talks of unemployment coming down from that disgraceful level of 11.1 per cent to now 8.5 per cent. But 8.5 per cent is too high. The unemployment rate is rising from the low of 8.2 per cent in July. This is no time for the government to be celebrating. It is a government with no control over the situation. What about school leavers? Do they have to wait around to become demoralised and demotivated before they are offered assistance? What about those young people hiding in our education system? I would agree, as the minister says, that it is good if those who can complete year 12 do so. But what about those who are being inappropriately kept at school longer? It sounds good to say young people should remain at school and be better educated. But keeping some young people at school longer is not necessarily good for them and an increasing number of professionals are saying it is setting them up for failure. It is a failure these people are experiencing that was not experienced by previous generations. When I entered the work force there was two per cent unemployment and many would argue that was full employment. I spoke recently to an executive of a large company who is earning in excess of $60,000 a year. He told me that he left school as a 15-year-old but was immediately able to gain practical experience and learnt everything he knew on the job. He is now concerned for his children. He is concerned that they are being kept in a of system in which they are being set up to be failures. People need a fair go and they need real job experiences. What of the costs of unemployment? I was relieved that in the minister's speech he mentioned the dimensions of unemployment. He mentioned drugs, crime and social and family breakdown when he spoke to the meeting this morning. He mentioned that partthese were in addition to the significant economic costs. I am pleased that these changes will allow job seekers with severe and multiple barriers to employment to be considered-barriers that include factors such as substance abuse and psychiatric or serious behavioural disorders. Apparently there are to be case management changes to design packages to assist these people. That would be a good thing because these are the types of issues that impact dramatically on families. Young people who are unemployed are far more likely to suffer from loss of esteem and lack of motivation. They are more likely to be victims of violence. They are more likely to be involved with drugs and crime, and young men, especially in rural areas, are more likely to commit suicide. The Prime Minister had an opportunity this afternoon when asked a question by the member for Port Adelaide about families, but I did not hear him say too much about that. In his usual arrogant style he was looking for an opportunity to bucket people on this side of the House. But there are families in Australia for whom unemployment is a true tragedy, whether young members of their families are suffering and having an impact on the entire family or parents are worrying about how those children are going to be remotivated. As caring mothers in the Italian community in my electorate say, we need to have them in jobs; we need to have them occupied; we need to have them out of mischief. There are real tragedies for families and even more so when it is the parents who are unemployed and those children are being brought up in poverty. I noticed in the Age only a couple of days ago that the leading youth organisations were drawing attention to the massive social problems because of the thousands of young people who risk being unemployed all their lives. It was described as a national tragedy. Mr Michael Lynch, chief executive of Oz Child, said that the situation was akin to a national disaster. He said: If 250,000 people were stranded or injured as a result of a natural or man-made event, government would term it a national disaster and respond alacrity. But where is the public outcry about the 250,000 young who are condemned to life on the fringe of society by lack of work. He also argues about the extent of hidden unemployment in schools and the inappropriateness of some of this, and that young people between 15 and 24 account for more than 37 per cent of unemployed people. The minister claims to have listened to the consultative committees, and I commend him for that. I think that these consultative committees are doing quite a bit. But in our electorates we hear of tragedies. Young people write to us saying things such as: I also do not think that the government's program of subsidised employment is working. I have a friend who has one of these jobs and is getting the absolute minimum they can get for their line of work. I don't really think it is a fair thing. The other problem with this is that at the end of the period when the subsidy disappears so does the job. Why does everyone ignore this fact because it is really what happens? The minister may congratulate himself on the success of some of these programs. He has claimed, as the Prime Minister has claimed, that the unemployment rate will reach five per cent by the year 2000. Mr Nehl-It's a joke.",117
303,Ms WORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is quite a joke. The Prime Minister is now hung up by his own rhetoric. On' 31 March 1992 the Prime Minister said: ... if we cannot make 4 per cent growth a year, the whole lot of us ought to give it away. The growth rate is only 3.5 per cent and unemployment is rising. The Australian newspaper was correct in its editorial of 8 September 1995 when it wrote: Employment Minister Mr Crean claims(Time expired)",119
304,Mr SAWFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There is no doubt that unemployment in this nation is a great tragedy, as it is throughout the developed world. But I really do get angry when I hear contributions from the other side, particularly in my own state of South Australia from the state Liberal Party. with I had to read the signatory to this matter of public importance twice. It was signed by the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). The great champion of the unemployed? I do not think so. He actually had the gall to reject Working Nation-a strategic plan of giving effective assistance to the unemployed. His speech was really a bit of a blank nadir of intellectual contribution and certainly was not an exposition of any alternative policy. These people in the opposition will say anything to the people of Australia to get themselves elected. 'The opposition bleeding for the unemployed'-I think that was a quote by Ross Gittins made months ago. You must be joking! All they want to do is transfer the unemployed to the working poor. They want unemployment growth like the USA-a working poor with wages below minimum levels. Dr Kemp-You obviously prefer a nonworking poor.",119
305,Mr SA WFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stated in this House, in your own state, the member for Goldstein, it is even worse than that. I am sure that all members remember his example of a librarian, currently on $35,000 a year, being offered a new job without any protection at the new rate of 19,000 a year for exactly the same work in Victoria-your state. What hope is there for the unemployed if the opposition get into power in this country? We know where the unemployed will be. They will be as they are in the United States, as they are in the United Kingdom and as they are in France. They will be evicted into the streets of our cities, disenfranchised and without any hope for the future. You do not have to take my word for it. Take, for example, the words of the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), none other than the Victorian state colleague of the member for Goldstein. Here are the words of the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party in answer to a question from a journalist at a press conference on 20 June this year. I am sure everyone is waiting for these words to see the member for Goldstein cringe and perhaps the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) cringe-in fact, for all the opposition to cringe. No, are not cringing. I forgot: they do not have any shame. The journalist asked the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party this question: Well, will you tell us what you'd be prepared cut? The Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party answered as follows: Well, I've already told you that we think that in relation to many of the Working Nation programs that there's room for savings. I've said it all along. What is that? A code for helping the unemployed? What is that? Compassion and care for the unemployed? What is that? An opposition trying to expand its assistance for the unemployed? Of course not. Do not give us that hypocrisy and cant. It is an opposition plan to slash assistance to the unemployed. That is what it is. It is a plan to cruelly crush the unemployed into despair. This opposition stands for no glory and they have no shame. They will say anything to get elected. In my home state of South Australia, we have had almost two years of Dean Brown's Liberals. He promised more jobs. He delivered the worse unemployment in Australia. He promised an expansion of education, the prerequisite for a skilled labour market. He delivered a $100 million cut. What about the state youth affairs minister, Dr Such? He said: I am not prepared sit back and do nothing. For the record, South Australia-people need to understand this-has the worse unemployment figures and the weakest economic growth figures in the nation. Between the 3 December 1993 election and June this year, the rate of job growth was one-third of that achieved nationally. In June there were 3,000 fewer South Australians in work compared with a rise of 52,000 nationally. Mr Bitney-That's the Liberal model.",120
306,Mr SA WFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is the Liberal model. It is important for Australians to know just what sort of people are leading the Liberal Party in this country. You have to ask these questions because they do not give us any policies and you really have to examine what they stand for. If the opposition is elected, these people will be responsible for the assistance to unemployed people. The they Australian electorate does not just need to know what I think or what the government thinks. It needs to know what independent people think of the leaders of the Liberal Party in Australia. Take the habitual deceit to and secrecy of the Brown government that has been recently exposed. The Auditor-General in South Australia, Mr MCPherson, severely criticised the Brown government for secrecy surrounding the deals the government is making with private enterprise in the current fire sale of South Australian assets. What about Judge Olsen? In a judgment in the Supreme Court of South Australia, he cast severe doubts on the credibility of the Premier's testimony as a witness in the court. The case concerned a former chairman of the South Australian Health Commission, David Blakie, who was forced to resign shortly after the Brown government was elected. The judgment reads: As the oral evidence unfolded, it rapidly became apparent that there were significant divergences in factual detail which arose as between the applicant (David Blakie) and the Premier (Mr Brown). In the event, I unhesitatingly prefer the evidence given the former (Blakie) to that given by the latter (Brown). There is more. The judge goes on: I entertain no doubt that the evidence given by him (Blakie) was both credible and accurate. He projected as a most impressive and dispassionate witness. He displayed an excellent recall of events. Moreover, the evidence which he gave was consistent both with that of the other key witnesses and certain documentary material. Here is the critical part: I am also of the impression that some aspects of histhat is, Premier Brown'sevidence may have been influenced by a degree of ex post facto reasoning. Isn't that a wonderful term for an untruth? My interpretation of that is that Mr Brown sought to mislead the court. That is exactly what is happening in this debate today by those opposite-ex post facto reasoning. Judge Olsen goes on: The premier's memory of what transpired simply cannot be reconciled with the evidence. The judgment is littered with such remarks about the Premier's behaviour. I quote: What ultimately occurred was little short of unconscionable. The sanctity of contract (was) jettisoned to the four winds . . . the gun was pointed at his head. This is the behaviour of the Premier of South Australia. He has been caught out doing some ex post facto reasoning in court. This is the leader who promised assistance to the unemployed by promising more jobs. It is not only Mr Brown who has been caught out attempting to deceive the electorate. I quote from Philip White's column in the Saturday Advertiser of a few weeks ago. I am sure the member for Kingston, the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), who is at the table, knows this quite well. I will quote it virtually in full so that those opposite can appreciate the prose, and I am sure the member for Adelaide has read this. It reads: You'd think that given all the great intellect and conservative wisdom on the entire federal opposition front-bench we could expect a better performance than John Howard's cheap truck trick. If he can be as cynical as this before an election the by devil only knows how he'll regard us once he grasps the levers of power. I quote again: Mischievously designed to instil a deep dread and misunderstanding of Australia's international debt in an already jittery, confused and suspicious community, the truck came out on the day Honest John addressed a business gathering to encourage more foreign investment. But he failed to mention what this investment would do to the debt. He failed again to outline any hint of his own party's policies. And he also failed to mention that the vast majority of the debt has been incurred by our biggest businessmen, certainly not by the community at large, and most certainly not by the government, whose foreign debt share is four per cent. He continues: The debt is incurred, in fact, by the sorts of people who traditionally, if not habitually, vote Liberal. 'Who does this man think we are?' Philip White asks. I remind the House that these are the words of Phillip White, who is an independent commentator for the Adelaide Advertiser. In fact, Philip White has well expressed that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, and the member for Goldstein-in fact, almost anyone in the opposition-would do anything to deceive the Australian electorate in order to get themselves elected. The facts are these: in the first year of Working Nation we have made very strong progress towards achieving a goal of five per cent unemployment by the tum of the century. Long-term unemploymenfis down 20 per cent on 12 months ago. Since Working Nation was put in place 370,000 new jobs have been created, and trainee and apprenticeship numbers are approaching record levels. The probability of exit from long-term unemployment is now higher than it has been for 10 years, and employers are enthusiastically embracing the national training wage. I acknowledge, as the minister has, that we still have a long way to go, and that is why Working Nation is a four-year, fully resourced commitment. The key to the success of Working Nation is flexibility. Working Nation is flexible. Programs can be adapted to fit the needs of the people it is there to help-the unemployed, the employers, young people, and regional and community groups. Just 12 months down the track of the fouryear Working Nation project, the government is delivering on the commitment to assist the unemployed. After one year of Working Nation, the government is further improving Working Nation's effectiveness with a series of enhancements, announced by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) today.

East Timor: Murder of Australian Journalists",122
308,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,"It is 20 years since the then Labor government acquiesced in the murder of five Australian journalists in East Timor. I would like to focus on the role of two key organisations in this sordid affair, the Defence Signals Directorate and the Department of Foreign Affairs. DSD has a deservedly high reputation. From Shoal Bay in Darwin it meticulously monitored the Indonesian armed forces in Balibo, East Timor. DSD officials or their emissaries leaked information to selected Labor parliamentarians and journalists. They were understandably concerned at the Labor government's acquiescence in the murder of five Australian newsmen. DSD also informed the government that the decision to dispose of the bodies of the five murdered Australians was taken by the Indonesian field commander in Balibo. A former member of DSD, Mr Jim Dunn, has published two highly critical accounts of the Timor tragedy. As he is a close friend of Mr John Bowan, former international affairs adviser to former Prime Minister Bob Hawke and adviser to the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), Mr Dunn's critical accounts of the Indonesian role in this tragedy must be taken seriously. I tum to the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Its management mode can be summarised in two words: cover up. In 1976, a 20-page classified 'secret' cable written by the then Australian Ambassador to Indonesia, Richard Woolcott, was leaked. He argued that Indonesia sought, and Australia should accept, its invasion and incorporation of East Timor. Predictably, DFA, as it then was, launched an internal inquiry. However, what is not publicly known is that the DFA officer in charge of the inquiry was himself responsible for the leaking of the Woolcott cable to the media. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, and DFAT spokesmen have in recent days stated that the truth of the circumstances surrounding the murder of the five Australian journalists would probably 'never be known'. Senator Evans meant that the Australian people will never be told the truth. The grotesque attitude of the Department of Foreign Affairs to the murder of the five Australian journalists was summarised in their callous comments to Shirley Shackleton, the wife of one of the murdered journalists. In 1983, Mrs Shirley Shackleton published her account of her dealings with Foreign Affairs officials. Mrs Shackleton received a telegram from Foreign Affairs informing her that the Indonesians had sent for identification the 'remains' of her husband and his murdered colleagues. In Mrs Shackleton's words, 'The most the Australian doctor could say when he attempted an autopsy was that the remains were ""possibly human"".' Subsequently, a Foreign Affairs officer asked her whether she wanted the remains forwarded to Australia. She was informed that she would have to pay the costs of transport. Even more grotesquely, all the remains or bodies were in the same size box. Mrs Shackleton inquired as to the size of the box. The official stated that it was not very large. Mrs Shackleton inquired whether it was as large as a coffin or an overnight bag and. the official replied 'No'. After further questioning of the Foreign Affairs official, she was told that the box was 'closer to the size of a shoe box'. To her credit, Mrs Shackleton refused to participate in this grotesque charade and the remains-which fitted into one small box-were buried in Indonesia. The government must demand a full explanation from the relevant Indonesian authorities as to the circumstances of the murder of the five Australian journalists. Above all, the Indonesian government should pay compensation to the relatives of the five murdered journalists. If we have the close and cordial relationship with Indonesia which the government claims, this should not be a difficult task. Mr Jim Dunn and his close friend the Prime Minister's adviser, Mr John Bowan, are in an ideal position to assist in this process. It will certainly test whether the Australian-Indonesian relationship is strong, as the government claims, or whether Australia's acceptance of the murder of the five journalists will be the basis of its relations with Indonesia. North Shore Football Club",122
309,Mr OCONNOR,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would appreciate, football clubs are the lifeblood of local communities. This fact was brought very strongly home to me when I attended the North Shore Football Club presentation night last Friday night. The club gathered to celebrate winning the Geelong Football League premiership in 1995. The North Shore Football Club has a long and proud history in the Geelong Football League. The Seagulls have won many grand finals and this is the second one that they have won in two years. The festivities were especially exuberant because the club was celebrating a premiership win also by the reserves team in 1995. I must say that I was very impressed by the professionalism of the club on this occasion. Throughout the speeches and the presentations to players two things stood out. One was the professionalism of the club and the second was the pride of the players and supporters in their achievements. The presentation took place in the club's newly renovated premises. I am particularly proud of the federal government's role in the renovation of the sporting facility. The House might like to know that the federal Labor government provided over $100,000 to the club through the cultural, sports and recreation program-a program which was basically knocked off by the Liberal opposition in this parliament. The grants that were provided to the North Shore Football Club have had significant benefits for the club. They have provided an upgraded facility and of course significant employment, both in the construction of the renovations and for people who were employed later. When the club lodged its application under the cultural, sports and recreation program, we anticipated that around three full-time and three part-time people might be employed in the club as a result of the extension and the renovation. That figure now stands at 22, because the club has expanded its total area allocated to the restaurant. It now has a gaming area, and it has provided access for the disabled, and creche facilities for young families and young supporters of the club. All in all, this club is now playing a very important role in the Norlane community in Geelong. It is a focus for entertainment, it certainly is a focus for sport and it is fast becoming a focus for socialising. The most important thing about it is that the money that the working people spend in this facility is staying in the Norlane area. I pass on my congratulations to the president and the committee of the North Shore Football Club for their great achievement this year, and to the coaching panel. Coaching young players to premierships can be a difficult task, but it is obvious, both on and off the field, that these young players are really proud of the achievements of their club and they want to see its success continue. To the players go my congratulations. This is a major provincial football league in Victoria, and not many clubs in a major provincial league throughout the length and breadth of the state can claim to have won the first grade premiership and the reserve grade premiership in the one year. To the loyal supporters, who are very proud of their club, I say 'keep that support going'. I wish the club every success in the future. Diabetes",123
310,Mr NEVILLE,ADJOURNMENT,"This afternoon I would like to talk about diabetes. I am sure I do not have to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, or other members of the House that this is a chronic condition. It is not something that gets any better for the patient. If it is not treated properly, it can become a very debilitating condition. Good medical practice requires that careful monitoring and staged treatment be employed to achieve a controlled situation. Monitoring devices and reagents are all part of the best practice regime. Constant oral medication and/or injections are frequently employed in the control of the condition. I remind members that seven to eight tablets a day or four to five reagent tests a day are a quite common occurrence. When looking at a normal tablet allocation of 60 tablets on a prescription, we see that some patients would have to go to a chemist every seven or eight days to top up. My colleague the shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), said in his National Diabetes Week press release: A Coalition government will work closely with Diabetes Australia and its State affiliates, which we would expect to continue administering the National Diabetic Supplies Scheme. This is a very important Scheme in allowing people access to vital supplies at reasonable cost. Although that helps with syringes and with reagents, it does not cover all the medical costs. I have a letter here from Mrs Nicolson, the Secretary of the Bundaberg and District Diabetic Support Group Inc., about the selfimposed nature of the condition that some addicts have. Out of this self-imposed condition they get free syringes and free medical treatment, whereas diabetics, who did not inflict this condition on themselves, do not. She writes: We as diabetics feel that we are being discriminated against, because unlike the drug addict, we did not choose our disorder and treatment for diabetes can be quite costly. Some of our members tell me that it costs them up to $100.00 a month for tablets and other items needed for the treatment and control of this disease. Other items include a blood glucose monitor and the testing strips needed for it and lancets for the finger pricking device, plus there are visits to a dietitian and podiatrist, neither of which are refundable under Medicare. We know that there is a PBS Safety Net scheme and that people are entitled to a concession card after paying the 407.60. But when you need three or four prescriptions filled at the one time every three weeks or less, it is a big drain on family finances until safety net requirements are met. In relation to this safety net, you now have to be twice as sick as you were five years ago to be caught by the net. A lot of these people obviously have fallen through. The letter continues: Our support group has come up with three options to ease this financial burden, that we would like the Commonwealth government to consider and although you are currently a member of the opposition, we wonder if you would present to the government on our behalf. The options are as follows: 1. Issue a Health Care card for the diabetic member of the family. Other members of the family still pay full price for their prescriptions until PBS Safety Net requirements are met. 2. The amount of medication available on a prescription be increased to double of current amount so that prescriptions need not be made up as often. 3. A Medicare rebate of 50% be paid for diabetic and other medications needed because of the diabetes and also for visits to dietitians and trists. Visits to these health professionals are an essential part of our treatment as they can help minimise some of the side effects of the diabetes. She then points out that that suggestion was made by my state colleague. I appeal to the government and indeed the opposition to take account of Mrs Nicolson's suggestion in their policy and budget deliberations. Mobile Phone Base Stations",124
311,Mr CHYNOWETH,ADJOURNMENT,"You will be aware that in the past I have made a few comments about Jeffrey 'Glib' Kennett and his ministers. Now I would like to make one about a specific minister who has attacked me in state parliament. In our local paper there is an article headed, 'MHR cornered on towers: Lib'.. It states: MORNINGTON, MLA, Robin Cooper, has raised in State Parliament the issue of communication towers ... Mr Cooper asked Minister for Planning, Mr Rob Maclellan, whether he was aware of what he termed 'the death bed conversion' of Federal Labor MP for Dunkley, Bob Chynoweth on this issue. ""Suddenly on what appears to be the eve of a federal election, Mr Chynoweth has a death bed, conversion and has started to tell people on the Mornington Peninsula that he is opposed to this degradation of the natural habitat and environment and has called for a moratorium on the construction of mobile telephone towers."" Robin Cooper, of course, is famous for what are called 'Coopergrams'. When he was first elected to parliament he sent telegrams to all the members of his party, costing the state government thousands of dollars. He also attacked me in state parliament some time ago about the fact that I had said there was some toxic waste buried at Hastings. He said that I really did not know where it was and therefore it was just a stunt. So the next day I got up here, some years ago, and announced where it was. It was dug up and the owner of that land, who was a supporter of Robin Cooper, was fined many thousands of dollars and had to shift it. So he did a good job for him then. By raising this issue in state parliament, he also has done a job on his state minister. He has caused the minister to mislead the Victoripodia- an parliament. I will be asking for the minister's resignation, as he has misled parliament and caused a breach of the Westminster system and its fundamental principles. I will go on and read what was said in state parliament. Mr Cooper referred to 'Parliament in 1991'. He is talking about the debate on the Commonwealth Telecommunications Act, which was guillotined in federal parliament in 1991 by the Keating government. I did not think the Keating government was around in 1991; I thought it was the Hawke government. So there is his first mistake. Then he goes on about this death-bed conversion, et cetera. Then the minister, Mr Maclellan, responds. He says: ... Mr Chynoweth, who in view of the impending federal election has had a death-bed conversion on the question of telecommunication . . . Mr Chynoweth is a loyal and supportive member of the federal Labor government. That is correct. I am very proud to be that and I will always be that. Then he goes on: Obviously, sensing the heat and anger of the people of the Mornington Peninsula and Frankston regarding this matter, Mr Chynoweth has now deserted his party on the issue and tried to palm himself off as having an independent view on the matter. I was the first person to raise this matter in February 1994 in the House of Representatives. I was a member of a committee that gave advice to the minister for telecommunications; he changed the national code on 30 June 1994. So I have been around for quite while working on this issue. Mr Maclellan goes on: When legislation was before the federal Parliament he supported it. The legislation was there on 20 June 1991. I was not a member of parliament on 20 June 1991; I was on sabbatical for a couple years. This is where Mr Maclellan has misled the parliament. He has taken advice from Robin Cooper, who is notorious for giving wrong advice. Robin Cooper is the state politician for the seat of Mornington. On issues like the mariequate na-and that was a big issue-he just sits the fence. We have a big development issue at the moment; he is sitting on the fence that. He came out recently and attacked the doctors at Rosebud hospital because would not work there for nothing. His government closed the emergency services section down-and you have probably read recently about what happened to a young lad down there because they were closed. Mr Maclellan goes on to attack me and he also attacks people of Mornington. He says: LOCAL people should ""face reality"" and accept development on the Momington Peninsular, Planthey ning Minister Rob Maclellan said last week. ""Typical of the narrow minds in the planning area is the controversy raging in Sorrento now . . . years. ""What a wonderful prelude to investment that is He goes on: Council sells the land, then 500 people in a local hall are unanimous in wanting it bought back something else. What he is on about is this land down in Sorrento which the council wants to sell, to develop. Above the views of all the' local people, Mr Maclellan gets stuck into the local people and says, 'Well, they've got no say it.' He calls us the chattering middle classes, and I am pleased to be a member of them. (Time expired). Sarajevo",125
312,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"It is a bit like a cracked record when the honourable a member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) speaks: he always speaks about the same old tired subjects from Victoria-in particular, the Kennett government. But I will not dwell on that. I make an urgent plea on behalf of the residents of the formerly besieged and still of besieged city of Sarajevo, a city which I visited recently by road for the first time, having been on two previous occasions by air. Those residents are faced with the prospect of a winter with temperatures which go down to minus 20. Of course, with the lack of adprovisions, supplies and clothing, they on were not looking good several weeks ago, before the most recent movements toward a on cease-fire and having had only some bare relief during the siege which has taken place they for the last three years. Interestingly, on the visit I was told a story by a young student who lived in Sarajevo. He was telling me that, when they want to heat coffee to have a cup of coffee-they have it in a little metal holder that holds the coffee the powder or grounds and water-they bum an audio cassette tape to get the amount of heat necessary to give them a cup. That is because have intermittent electricity supplies and they have had no gas. Gas, as some members would know, has just been restored to the city after an absence of supplies for almost three At that stage this was a city that was dying-a city in which many of the people were living in a shell-shocked and emotionally disturbed state. I spoke to the Cardinal of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cardinal Pulic, who told me that he feared greatly for his people, who for he believed had suffered so badly during three years that many had given up wanting to keep the city of Sarajevo alive. There seemed to be a spirit in the city of despondency so strong that many felt that the city would die. Notwithstanding the difficulties of leaving the in city, there were people who were just quietly spiriting themselves away from what was one of the showpieces of a multicultural, multiracial lifestyle in the region. Of course, in the 1980s Sarajevo was the showpiece for the Winter Olympics in 1986. On the third visit I was very distressed to see just how much things had declined. Now we have a glimmer of hope with the cease-fire. We have perhaps the opportunity to restore the supply of the most important basic commodities that people require: food, clothing and medical supplies. In many cases people have not been paid. Most people w()rked for the government in Sarajevo, of course formerly under a communist regime. Most have not been paid since the city has been under siege. In fact, the doctors and medical staff at the hospitals were receiving about $50 a month to provide them with the bare necessities, on top of being able to live in accommodation which was owned by the city of Sarajevo. Of course, they have no public transport anyway because it has been closed down. One of the things I did on returning to Australia was to urge people to try to supply the basic necessities for a cold winter, the most obvious of which is, of course, warm clothing. I have been very pleased to see that that calJ has been taken up by people, outside of my electorate as it turns out-people from Bunbury and others from throughout Western Australia-who have responded to this and put together a colJection of warm winter clothing. I now caIl on the minister responsible for AIDAB, the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), to consider a grant to assist with the transport of these important winter clothing materials to Sarajevo. The city has endured one of the worse sieges of the 20th century. Certainly there not been a siege as long as the siege of Sarajevo in modem Western history in the 20th century. They are in dire need of help, assistance and the sympathy of all of us. I urge the minister to consider providing a grant to allow this important clothing and materials to be transported to the people of the formerly besieged city. (Time expired) Unemployment",126
313,Mr CLEELAND,ADJOURNMENT,"MCEwen) (5.53 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are aware, I carry with me this black folder. It is reaIly a folder of horrors because in it there are press clippings which cite the horrors that occur in Victoria on a daily basis, be they horrors of hospital closures, deaths caused by lack of ambulances, school closures or whatever. While listening to members of the opposition during the debate on the matter of public importance today, I opened this folder. What did I find? I found the Age newspaper report of 13 October 1995 which states: More than 23,000 jobs were lost in Victoria during September, taking workforce numbers back to February levels and spiking the state's jobless rate back over 9 per cent. We get a lot of crocodile tears from the other side of the House about the tragedy of unemployment in Australia. But, in looking for the causes of it, we have only to look at Victoria. We have totally lost count of the number of jobs that have been lost as a direct result of conservative policies being implemented in this country; there are over 85,000 at least. If you look at smaIl country towns in Victoria, the situation is even worse. In my electorate, in the town of Alexandra, near Lake Eildon-a lovely part of the state-there is economic devastation. The Victorian Department of Conservation and Natural Resources had a staff of 25 under the former Labor government. It is now down to seven in just over two years. The State Electricity Commission office has been closed and regionalised causing massive job loss. We have something in Victoria caIled amalgamation of local councils. I have always been a supporter of amalgamation and the restructure of local government, but in Victoria that just means massive job losses and has cuts to services. When you add amalgamation in the Alexandra area you add more job losses in that area. Approximately 15 schools-rural schools catering for rural people-have been closed in my electorate with more loss of jobs for rural teachers. When you add all these job losses together in a town the size of Alexandra, you find economic devastation. Every small business in that town is losing money. Wages are diminishing. The money available to be spent in the town is diminishing. You cannot sell a house for love nor money and property values have plummeted. This is the sort of policy we expect from the opposition. When they talk about jobs and cry crocodile tears, expressing concern at the tragedy which is unemployment, and we ask them for policies and ask what they will do about it and get no answer, we just look at Victoria. It was Jeffrey Kennett who said in the 1992 election, 'No Victorian will be worse off. Trust me, Victoria. I will solve the major debt problem that I say you have. I will create more jobs and you will all be better off.' Mr O'Connor-But the debt has gone up.",127
314,Mr CLEELAND,ADJOURNMENT,"You are right; it has gone up by over $3 billion, and Victoria, with a conservative government, has the largest foreign debt of any state. When we see these crocodile tears and ask, 'Where are your policies on employment?' we in Victoria know exactly what they mean. When we hear there is going to be a commission of audit, as the shadow Treasurer said, we know what that is because that was a policy of Jeffrey Kennett in 1992. You get a situation where Kennett mates are appointed as auditors, they go in and say, 'Things are so much worse than I thought when you elected me so I have to be tough.' That is what they do and say. So we know exactly what you will do. You have no policies and you obviously do not trust people to look at them and dissect them. When the opposition talks about jobs and when they discuss matters of public importance, crying their crocodile tears, expressing their concern about jobs, we look at Victoria. When they talk about a commission of audit, we know what that means. When they say that no-one will be worse off, we know what that means. You come down to rural Victoria and tell the people that the tories give a damn for rural Victoria, because they do not. They are devastating the bush in that state. They should be ashamed of themselves and people in this House should be embarrassed to support them. Forestry Industry",128
315,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I have some good news. I am on the verge of unifying a number of groups in this country which have been seen in the broader context as being at loggerheads. For 2Y2 years I have been trying to get plantation forestry established in my electorate of Gilmore. For over 100 years the forestry industry was one of our major industries. Following from that, there are something like 78,000 available hectares in my electorate that are class four-class five land cleared. I am hopeful that within the next two or three days we will find that through a couple of local timber mills combining with the local unions-the CFMEU-and local landowners through the area consultative committee, and with the agreement of the local people, we will have a large number of local land-holders involved in the plantation system to be developed in my seat. That would show one thing: if we quietly go about the work of putting things together-put the rationale and get together with the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) on the new work opportunities program-we can build our industries and our own environments.",128

I note that these the Law Reform Commission's days, in the 2, and reaffirmed in greater detail, after thorough report of the Review of the Commonwealth Criminal raised in 1975, were the subject of further a number of other reviews and comments. One wonders why, in the context of the beyond the recommendations of many of its expert this bill, we are being pressed to debate this that an inquiry has been instituted by the Senate Committee. That committee was due to report completing its work it has obtained an extension is now to report by 26 October, next Thursday. The situation is that the Senate, through examination of the bill. It has been able presumably from other groups interested in privacy from other interested bodies.

We are asked, in the House of Representatives, second reading, and to consider government the Senate committee's observations on this is the House of Representatives to be excluded has been in genesis since 1975? Is it suddenly to say that out aloud demonstrates the patent government has set.

As the Parliamentary Secretary in his second reading speech, this bill has matters were first raised in 1975, very early in Australian Law Reform Commission report No. examination of the issues, in the fifth interim Law in 1991. So these matters were first elaboration in 1991, and have been the subject of government having taken positions which were bodies that have given advice in developing bill in this chamber today when it is well known Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation yesterday but because of the difficulty in of time to undertake its deliberations and it its committee, has been able to have a detailed to hear from ministers, from the Law Council, such as the councils of civil liberties, and the House of Representatives, as is usual (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for its committees to undertake a similar review for to debate the bill, to allow it to have a amendments before we have had the benefit of bill. Why is that the case? Why the haste? Why from this process, particularly when the bill so urgent that a week is going to matter? Just nonsense involved in the timetable that the government an opportunity to put this matter have the second reading postponed until the Senate Committee has reported to the Senate on the bill. used its numbers, notwithstanding what I of some of its members about the efficacy opportunity to reconsider this matter and I a view to substituting the following words: NA MC 2576 ""the debate on the second reading of this Bill an order of the day for the first We will ask that that vote be taken at the are listed here today to participate in this of the Senate committee deliberations, want information, an opportunity to do so, and it detail stage to be deferred until I will ask that after the vote is taken in the matter be referred back to the House of In that way we can see whether or not those in the civil liberty issues have something further disagree with the government but at least people minds to these issues.

In the view of the opposition the bill is not, inquiries have recommended the enactment police powers and forensic samples. However, balance the need to authorise the gathering of on individual rights. Many claim that the balance legislation. I will take the Committee through expressed to us in relation to this legislation. Firstly, in authorising the taking of forensic the bill gives police powers contrary to the Coldrey committee.

As I noted, of a number of comprehensive laws dealing with any legislative scheme must appropriately probative evidence against unnecessary intrusion has not been appropriately struck in this a number of the concerns that we have had procedures before a person has been arrested, recommendations of the Gibbs committee and the and now the second reading speech seem criterion for authorising the taking of a sample to arrest the person. In fact, the criterion on reasonable grounds that the person has NA MC 2578 committed the offence. That is lower than the opposed to a suspicion. If those forensic had been arrested, that would occur on a lesser to have been arrested. Secondly, the bill authorises a constable suspect does not consent.

It has been that this would confine the bill too narrowly. Fourthly, it has been suggested that the operation and systematic audit. Fifthly, it has been argued that the bill should to exercise the powers contained in the bill words, there should be some offences to deal that the bill says ought to be followed. The criminal liability has been the subject of criticism. Where a suspect resists the taking of a adverse inference from that resistance, notwithstanding Council of Australia and the Law Society being drawn. The bill allows for the taking of swabs and it is difficult to imagine an offence where forensic It has been suggested that the bill is likely areas it will take much longer to obtain authorisation supervise the procedures. It is argued that government has indicated that it intends maximum time limit of four hours for detention, will still make those in isolated areas worse off. While the bill contains specific protections Islanders, Aboriginal groups have criticised noted that in order to be consistent with the Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, the maximum of section 23C(4) of the Crimes Act of 1914 Strait Islander people to a maximum of two hours. The bill gives a magistrate a general power sample.

This is contrary to the Commission, the Gibbs committee and the Coldrey of police powers, and I will say a bit more about that.

As I have already noted, the definition of includes persons in addition to those charged in court in relation to the offence. It reasonable grounds has committed the indictable before there will be grounds for arresting a to arrested persons would be to build in an important of the suspect. In order to arrest a suspect, believe-not suspect but believe-that The bill requires the constable to satisfy he or she can ask a suspect to consent to conducting a forensic procedure on a suspect will obtain evidence that will assist in their one of the matters on which the constable must reasonable grounds to believe that the forensic to confirm or disprove that the suspect committed 'relevant offence' to mean not only the offence but also any other indictable offence in respect as a result of a proposed forensic procedure probative value. The drafting of this definition is unsatisfactory result. For example, in its present form, procedure on a person for the purpose of gathering the person is not suspected of having committed, committed that offence. Similarly, the present wording of the provision procedure if he or she is satisfied that it disprove that the suspect committed an offence committed.

This is a lesser test than that required person. To restrict the use of forensic procedures procedural safeguard of the civil liberties the constable must have reasonable grounds to the person committed the offence. himself or herself as to a number of matters before a forensic procedure. Clearly, the reason for is that the police believe that, by doing so, they investigations and in securing a conviction. Thus, satisfy himself or herself is that there are procedure is likely to produce evidence tending a relevant offence. But the bill defines in relation to which the person is a suspect of which the evidence likely to be obtained carried out on the suspect is likely to have because its application gives an ambiguous it would allow the police to conduct a forensic evidence in relation to an offence which in order to prove or disprove that the person allows a magistrate to order a forensic would produce evidence tending to confirm or which the person is not suspected of having and I urge the minister to make the appropriate that this provision creates. a suspect against a magistrate's order allowing a view, there ought to be some appeal mechanism rights are protected. the constable must be satisfied, on a balance of to consent to a forensic procedure.

(2) Does the Council receive public funding of more than $1 million per annum to carry out work on behalf of the Aboriginal community. (3) Is it a fact that widespread misuse of public funds by the Councilor its officers has been uncovered including (a) the payment of cash cheques worth approximately $26,000 to Don Davidson during the two months before his death and (b) spending of grant money in 1992 on private home repairs, florists' bills, hire cars, upmarket hotel accommodation and funeral bills. (4) Did Elizabeth Ditton attempt to have a receiver appointed to the Council; if so, was she overruled by the Board which was dominated by her relatives. (5) Did other Board members resolve to approach the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) for financial assistance. (6) Had ATSIC assisted the Council to overcome financial difficulties on previous occasions; if so, (a) when, (b) why, (c) what were the circumstances and (d) did the assistance conform with the relevant accountability requirements. (7) Did a receiver appointed to the Council (a) advise the Queensland Supreme Court that the Council had turned a $1.2 million surplus into a $600,000 deficit in less than a year and (b) call for a fuller investigation. (8) Has the Council been fully investigated following the receiver's recommendation; if so, what are the complete details of the outcome. (9) Is it a fact that ATSIC has known the results of a full investigation of the Council's affairs since September 1994 but will not discuss them; if so, why. NA (10) Does the Government impose the same levels of accountability in the handling of public funds upon Aboriginal organisations as upon other organisations. (11) Is the Government continuing to fund the Council; if so, (a) to what extent, (b) in what manner and (c) why. (12) Is he taking action with respect to the Council's affairs; if so, what action; if not, why not. (13) What action has he initiated to protect persons who suffer as a result of seeking to expose mismanagement or fraud in certain Aboriginal organisations. Mr Tickner-The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided the following information in response to the honourable member's question. (1) Yes. (2) The Council has been in receipt of funding from several different agencies, including one or more of the Queensland Government. My answer is therefore confined to funding by ATSIC. In the financial year 1992/93 ATSIC provided over $1 million to the council, which included the purchase of a youth bail hostel ($755,000 for purchase and operating costs). In other years, funding was well under this figure, viz: 1990/91-$276,068 1991/92-$290,396 1993/94-$316,591 There has been no ATSIC funding beyond 1993/94. (3) An investigation by the Australian Federal Police released in February 1995 concluded that it may be possible to substantiate misappropriation in respect of Don Davidson for a number of personal services. It quoted an audit report which indicated a figure of $52,861 for invoices of doubtful authenticity in relation to cash cheques. The references to upmarket hotel accommodation and hire cars appear to refer to funding provided to Gwandalan Halfway House, which I understand was approved by the Queensland Corrective Services Commission. (4) Yes, and I understand that there was opposition to the appointment from some members of the Board. I am informed that there were relatives both for and against her action. Eventually, a new Board was elected, and it appointed the receiver/manager. (5) The new Board initially sought financial assistance from ATSIC. (6) No. On previous occasions, the council operated within its grant allocation. (7) Yes. (8) An investigative audit was undertaken by Arthur Andersen and copies were provided by ATSIC to the Australian Federal Police, the Queensland Police Service and the Australian Securities Commission for further investigation. All three of these organisations decided not to pursue the matter. (9) Yes. ATSIC has received advice from the Australian Government Solicitor that the report should not be released because some parts of it may be defamatory, and to release it could render ATSIC liable to damages. (10) Yes. (11) No. (12) I believe that it is most important when Commission identifies serious financial mismanagement within a funded organisation that the matter be referred to the appropriate regulatory authority with responsibility for the incorporation of that organisation. ATSIC does not have the power to rectify the situation or the responsibility for such matters. This rests with the regulatory authority. In the case of the Brisbane Tribal Council, the appropriate authority is the Australian Securities Commission. The Australian Securities Commission completed its inquiries and concluded that there was no evidence of any breach of corporation law such as would warrant further investigation. (13) Such matters are currently being considered as part of the Government's response to the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing. Instances of threatening behaviour will be referred to the State Police. Woorabinda Aboriginal Council (Question No. 2237) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 27 March 1995: (1) Has his attention been drawn to irregularities in the financial administration of the Woorabinda Aboriginal Council in Queensland including the non-payment of $400,000 in wages to workers in the Woorabinda community. (2) Is it a fact that the sum was deducted from the workers' wages (a) to pay various liabilities of Council employees and (b) for other purposes; if so, (i) for what other purposes, (ii) what action is the Government taking and (iii) will the workers be reimbursed for the wages they did not receive. (3) Have allegations of other fraud involving more than $1.5 million of the Council's funds been investigated; if so, what was the result. (4) Is the Government continuing to fund the Council; if so, (a) to what extent and (b) why. Mr Tickner-The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided the following information in response to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. There has been no failure on the part of the Council to pay wages. What in fact happened was that payroll deductions of $160,000 for Council employees were not posted to a number of credit organisations to which the employees owed money. These deductions were supposed to be paid automatically to the creditors. (2) The Council should have been paying this money for various liabilities of its employees but the instead retained the money for its own purposes. What exactly these purposes were is not at present clear. Since August 1994, a grant controller has been engaged to ensure that funds of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) are used for the purposes for which they were intended. The grant controller is still in office. (3) The Council is currently under investigation by the Australian Federal Police as a result of action initiated by ATSIC. I understand that the Queensland Police Fraud Squad is making a separate investigation. The result of these investigations has not so far been released. (4) ATSIC continues to fund the Council for the following in the currently financial year: Subsidy for Council operations-$642,592 Broadcasting for remote communities-$32,368 Employment of a youth worker-$115,313 Employment of Community Police-$167,440 Water/Sewerage maintenance-$287, 777 Community Newsletter Subsidy-$9,710 This funding is released through the grant controller, to maintain these services to the Woorabinda community. Optus Vision (Question No. 2585) Mr Abbott asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 28 August 1995: Does the Government treat Optus Vision as a general carrier under the Telecommunications Act; if so, under what conditions can Optus Vision suspend pay television cables from power poles. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No; Optus Vision is not a general carrier under the Telecommunications Act 1991. The Telecommunications Act 1991 reserves the right, except in certain circumstances, to install and maintain reserved line links (including pay television cable) to general carriers. The Act permits agents to be appointed to do anything for or on behalf of a general carrier. I am advised by Optus Networks Pty Ltd (a licensed general carrier) that it is undertaking and managing the role out of a broadband cable network which will support the delivery of Optus Vision's pay television service. In many instances actual installation is being carried out by contractors (on behalf of the general carrier). The provision of telecommunications infrastructure, including the mounting of telecommunications cable on power poles by telecommunications carriers (or agents acting on their behalf), is subject to The Telecommunications (Exempt Activities) Regulations (the Regulations) and the Telecommunications National Code as provided for under the Telecommunications Act 1991. The Regulations allow carriers to engage in specified activities without being subject to certain State and Territory laws. The laws are detailed in the Regulations. The carriers' activities covered by the Regulations relate to the development of telecommunications network infrastructure, for example mobile communications towers, lines or cables. The carriers must comply with the Telecommunications National Code when undertaking an activity exempted from certain State and Territory laws by the Regulations, other than minor maintenance or an activity of a recurring nature. The Telecommunications National Code imposes environmental obligations and consultation procedures between carriers and relevant authorities, such as local councils. Mobile Phone Base Stations (Question No. 2586) Mr Abbott asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 28 August 1995: (1) What steps is the Government taking to encourage co-location of mobile telephone base stations. (2) How many existing mobile base stations sites involve co-location of two or more carriers' facilities. (3) How many cases of co-location have resulted from the intervention of (a) Austel or (b) the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Under the Telecommunications National Code carriers are required to co-locate towers and similar structures on existing towers or as close as practicable to an existing tower unless it is not technically feasible; is incompatible with the network configuration; or is likely to have a greater adverse effect on the environment than putting a new facility in place. Austel is currently conducting a review into the operation of the Code. Co-location is an issue being considered in this review. Austel will report to me on completion of this review. (2) I am advised that as at September 1995 the carriers had co-located at around 135 sites. (3) (a) I am advised that there has been one case (Torquay, Victoria) where after Austel intervention, the carriers involved agreed to co-locate. (b) DEST has advised that it considers the possible co-location of mobile base station facilities as part of its assessment process. Government Advertising (Question No. 2608) Mr Lieberman asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 18 September 1995: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2451 (Hansard, 28 August 1995, page 659), what sums did (a) government business enterprises and (b) other organisations owned partly or fully by the Commonwealth spend on advertising in (i) Australian, (ii) metropolitan, (iii) suburban, (iv) regional and (v) country area (A) newspapers, (B) radio and (C) television in (I) 1989-90, (II) 1990-91, (III) 1991-92, (IV) 1992-93 and (V) 1994-95. (2) What criteria are used to determine the placement of advertisements by the entities referred to in part (1), particularly in respect to local, regional and country outlets. (3) What sum was spent by advertising by each entity referred to in part (1) in each year referred to in part (1).",168
354,Mr WALKER,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Commonwealth departmental advertisers are required to arrange advertising through the central advertising system for which my Department has responsibility. However, as Government Business Enterprises do not arrange their advertising through this system, records of their expenditure are not maintained by my Department. The major eligible Statutory Authorities which arrange their advertising through the central advertising system are the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The sums spent on advertising by these bodies are included in the attached tables.

355,Mr CONNOLLY,MEDIA EXPENDITURE THROUGH THE,"the Minister for Finance, upon notice, on 26 September 1995: Did ComSuper fail to allow for the increase in the Medicare levy when calculating pension payments from I July 1995; if so, (a) how many pension recipients were affected, (b) were those affected informed of the error before receiving their entitlements; if not, why not, and (c) were banks and other institutions into which Commonwealth pensions are paid informed of the error before receiving pension payments; if not, why not.",177
356,Mr BEAZLEY,MEDIA EXPENDITURE THROUGH THE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: ComSuper did not make any error in its calculation of superannuation benefit payments from I July 1995. ComSuper's benefit payments were increased correctly in line with CPI from the first superannuation benefit payday in the 1994/95 financial year, which happened to fall on 6 July 1995. In accordance with normal processing procedures, details of these increased benefits were passed to the Department of Finance Pay System for deduction of taxation and normal processing to recipients. Although the Medicare Levy increase from 1.4% to 1.5% was to take effect from I July 1995, at the time benefit payments for 6 July 1995 were processed by the Department of Finance Pay System, this increase had not received Royal Assent. The Department of Finance could not apply the increase to payments made through the Finance Pay System until the increase had received Royal Assent. Royal Assent for the increase was received after payments for 6 July 1995 were processed but before payments for 20 July 1995 were processed, therefore the increase in the Medicare Levy was applied by the Finance Pay System from superannuation benefit payday 20 July 1995. Peel Landcare Group (Question No. 2661) Mr Simmons asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 26 September 1995: (1) What Commonwealth funding has been provided to the Peel Landcare Group in the electoral Division of Calare since 1992. (2) What funding has been made available for river care and land care to individual property owners within the Peel Landcare Group. (3) What are the names and addresses of the property owners referred to in part (2). (4) What was the level of landholder contribution in each case referred to in part (2). (5) What are the program policy requirements in relation to landholder contributions to the river care and land care programs. (6) Who administers the management of the programs referred to in part (5) and determines the program priorities. (7) What selection criteria are used for funding approval. (8) What procedures govern the administration and distribution of public funds to the community groups involved. (9) Are there any (a) outstanding projects or (b) landholder obligations with the Peel Landcare Group. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Peel Landcare Group has received Commonwealth funding of $27,896 since 1992. These funds have been provided under the Murray-Darling Basin Commission Natural Resources Management Strategy (NRMS) for two projects: Peel Catchment Landcare Program: $2,750 in 1993-94 to carry out river corridor tree planting activities; and Peel Corridor Project: $16,646 in 1994-95 for river corridor fencing and erosion control works .. this project has received further Commonwealth funding through the NRMS of $8,500 in 1995-96 to continue these activities. (2) The NRMS funding referred to in (1) was provided through the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. The NSW Department of Land and Water Conservation, the NRMS administering agency in NSW, managed the provision of funds to the Coordinator of the Peel Landcare Group, Mr John Fry. The activities undertaken by the group in each project cover most properties in the catchment. Rivercare is a separate program run by the NSW government and no Commonwealth funds are involved. (3) Individual property owners have not received any Commonwealth funds under the NRMS or through the National Landcare Program (NLP) generally. (4) see (3) above. (5) Under Rivercare, NSW officers have advised that landholders are normally expected to contribute at least 50% of the cost of the project, although this requirement can be reduced if the project has significant demonstration benefit. Under the NLP, community groups and other local contributors should contribute at least one dollar (in cash or kind) for every two dollars provided by the Commonwealth grant. (6) The National Landcare Program comprises several elements administered by different organisations. The Community Component of the NLP consists of: Land and Water element, administered by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy; One Billion Trees, Save the Bush and Waterwatch elements, administered by the Australian Nature Conservation Agency; Natural Resources Management Strategy (NRMS) element, administered by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. Community groups are encouraged to develop integrated land, water, vegetation and biological diversity management projects. To assist this process, all of the program elements under the Community Component of the NLP use the same application form, a common lodgement date for applications and a common assessment process. Priorities for each element of the NLP are determined by the relevant Commonwealth Department administering that element, or by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission in the case of the NRMS, in consultation with major stakeholders. Most States also conduct separate funding programs for natural resource management issues. The Rivercare program in NSW is one such example. The Commonwealth has no role in the administration or program priority setting for these programs. (7) Applications for funding under the NLP are assessed by community dominated Regional and State Assessment Panels in each State and Territory according to guidelines set down each year by the Commonwealth in consultation with major stakeholders. These guidelines include the objectives and priorities for funding for each component of the NLP. As stated in the Guide to Community Group Applications, projects are assessed against the following eligibility criteria: the appropriateness of their objectives; the feasibility of their methods; the contribution of the project to achieving long-term ecological sustainability; and the degree of community ownership. Preference is given to projects: which deal with the causes and prevention of a problem, not just the symptoms; which are assessed to be of greatest benefit the community in implementing natural resource management; which involve local people taking responsibility for sound ongoing management of natural resources; where the group is considered competent to undertake the work; where the project involves community participation or a cooperative approach by group members; where the benefits are to be shared by the local community (that is, the project provides a community benefit rather than a private benefit); which involve properties that have property management plans or that form part of area, catchment or regional, vegetation or other management plans; where the stated aims are specific and achievable; where the results are measurable; where the most suitable and cost effective methods are being used; and where the results will be communicated to others who could benefit from them. (8) Under the Land and Water element of the NLP the Commonwealth allocates financial assistance to landcare groups under the conditions set out in formal agreements made between the Commonwealth and each State and Territory under the National Resources Management (Financial Assistance) Act 1992. The lead agency in each State or Territory is responsible for the financial management of the program under these agreements. The State agencies enter into an agreement with the landcare groups for each project receiving funds, and these agreements set out the terms and conditions of the grant. Recipients of grants are required to report annually on the progress of projects before ongoing funding is approved, and to report on the final outcomes of projects. Audited statements of program expenditures are provided annually to the Commonwealth by each State and Territory. Similar arrangements apply to the Natnal Resources Management Strategy. The lead agency in each State is responsible for the financial administration of this element of the NLP. Project proponents enter into agreements with the State agency and are required to report on project progress and outcomes. (9) The Peel Landcare Group is receiving funding under the Murray-Darling Basin Commission Natural Resources Management Strategy element of the program to continue with its Peel Corridor Project in 1995-96. The group is contributing around $8,000 in kind ($5,000 in materials and to $3,000 in labour) to the project in 1995-96. The group has no other outstanding projects with respect to the National Landcare Program.",177
