Private Nursing Honies: Pensioner Patients To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled, the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That many pensioners who are holders of the Health Benefit Card, have suffered inmates of Private Nursing Homes, because the Federal Government subsidy was insufficient to meet the charges as laid down. Many pensioners whose spouse was an inmate of the Private Nursing Homes suffered poverty in an endeavour to susTo tain their partner while in the nursing home. Only in rare cases was the statutory minimum patient tribution as laid down adhered to. That the telephone was a matter of life and death to many pensioners, but because of the cost of installation of the telephone many are unable to afford the installation. That those pensioners who have only their very little else to live on and are forced to pay high rents, are in many cases living in extreme poverty. The foregoing facts impel your petitioners to ask the tralian Government as a matter of urgency to(1) Make sure that subsidies paid to Private Nursing Homes are such that each pensioner holding Health Benefit Card will pay the Private Nursing Home no more than the statutory minimum patient contribution, which will allow six dollars per week to be retained by the pensioner patient for their personal use. (2) That a pensioner holding a Pensioner Card shall have a telephone very nominal charge.

PETITIONS Broadcasting and Television Programs To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That because television and radio: (a) affect our social and moral environment, (b) are family media watched and heard by many children at alltimes,and (c) present too much explicit violence and sex, the they therefore need stronger control than other media and the exisiting standards need stricter enforcement in both national ABC and commercial sectors.

Uranium Mining: Moratorium To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned showeth: We are calling for an independent moratorium on the mining of uranium because: 1. There has been no exhausuve debate, in the Parliament or public, on the question 2. The suggestion has been made that Australia could act as a waste disposal dump fbr other countries. 3. The Fox Report makes it clear that the mining of uranium will create few jobs wealth. 4. There is no safe method of disposal or storage of high level radioactive waste. 5. The increased availability of plutonium will magnify the terrorist threat. It is impossible and immoral to think of mining uranium only in Australian terms. Uranium mining contributes to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increasedriskof nuclear war. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Hunt. Petition received. Replacement Constitution To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we believe that Australia's cratic and should bereplacedby a democratic constitution. This new constitution should directly elected people's convention, following extensive public debate, and then put to a referendum of the people.

The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: citizens of Australia respectfully That those who have retired and those who are about to retire, are being severely and adversely affected by inflauon and Australian economic circumstances.

3,Mr CALDER,BENEFITS,Can the Minister for National Resources and Minister for Overseas Trade say how soon the economic benefits from the mining of Australian uranium will be felt in the community?,16
4,Mr ANTHONY,BENEFITS,"I was very interested to read that some remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition in his address last weekend when he said the economic benefits from uranium mining would not come forfiveto ten years. The economic benefits from the development of uranium mines would be almost immediate. The Peko-EZ company which has a memorandum of understanding with the Commonwealth to mine Ranger is in a position to commence immediately. Of course, as soon as it commences it will have to start to employ people. The company has to prepare the site and the roads and that means that people would be put into work immediately in the Northern Territory. As the mine proceeds a work force of something like a couple of thousand people would be directly involved in construction work. Of course there would then be benefits to all those people who supply the services for the people employed. The economic benefits for the Northern Territory would be immense. The Northern Territory is suffering at the moment because of low prices for meat and minerals. The reconstruction of Darwin has almost been completed and a fillip such as the development of uranium mimng would be of immense importance to Darwin and its economy. So it is utter nonsense to talk about there being no economic benefits for from five to ten years, as was stated by the Leader of the Opposition. NA",16
5,Mr HAYDEN,OVERSEAS LOAN BORROWING,"I direct my question Treasurer. Is it a fact that Reserve Bank holdings of gold and foreign exchange in the last fortnight of August fell by a rather dramatic amount of excess of $137m-that is following the $685m revaluation of gold holdings? Is it a fact that Reserve Bank holdings of gold and foreign to exchange are now down to the low levels of about June this year? Is it a fact that the loan the Government is seeking to raise in Germany, announced as $200m and increased to $250m, part of a government program to defend the moderate Australian dollar? Is it a fact, as reported from some German circles yesterday, that the Governing ment has indicated that it is prepared to increase this loan to $600m and to perhaps as much as $ 1,000m? If so, is this part of a determined government bid to defend the Australian dollar? In any event, in the light of the continuing and dramatic drain on Reserve Bank holdings gold and foreign exchange, will the Treasurer make a firm and unequivocal statement of the Government's strategy for defending the Ausall tralian dollar so that the Opposition can consider the degree to which it is able to extend support for what is a most important objective in econrevaluation omic management?",17
6,Mr LYNCH,OVERSEAS LOAN BORROWING,"I can only say to the honourable gentleman that no question could be couched in more hypocritical terms than that asked by him today because he is very much awareMr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, the last time that the Treasurer used unparliamentary words you wanted to check with Hansard and he was able, therefore, to withdraw those words a few days later after you were able to check the record. He has just used some other unparliamentary words and I ask that you have him withdraw them immediately.",17
7,Mr SPEAKER,OVERSEAS LOAN BORROWING,I ask the right honourable gentleman to withdraw those words.,17
8,Mr LYNCH,OVERSEAS LOAN BORROWING,"I used the words 'hypocritical statement' or 'hypocritical question', Mr Speaker, and if those words are unparliamentary I withdraw them. In substitution for them may I say that I find it absolutely ironic that the honourable gentleman who was more responsible than anyone else for the pre-devaluation speculation during the course of last year should come forward with continuing questions of this type and should be very articulate on the question of the exchange rate in public dialogue throughout the general community. He knows full well that this is not a matter which ought to be discussed publicly by a Treasurer or by a former Treasurer. I believe that it is not a matter to be dealt with appropriately by means of questo the tion and answer in this House. The honourable gentleman knows the facts. in The borrowing program has been subject to a very clear and definitive statement by me. The Euro-dollar loan has been increased from $200m $250m as a consequence of negotiations in the Euro-dollar market by a Treasury official who is that over there at present. We have made it perfectly clear, against the context of the earlier statement is about the Government resuming its policy of borrowing on official account, that that Euro-dollar loan of $250m will be exceeded durthe course of the year. The Press statement which I issued some weeks ago made the point that we would have in mind a figure of around $600m or in excess of it. The honourable gentleman should not loosely draw attention to any figure of $ 1,000m which is not in my mind or in of the Government's mind at the present time. So far as the exchange rate is concerned, I invite the honourable gentleman to notefirstof what action has been taken in relation to borrowings and, secondly, to note the action which was taken by the Reserve Bank in relation to the of gold. A statement on that subject was put out by the Reserve Bank some two to three weeks ago. Aside from that the honourable gentleman knows that the exchange rate is chiefly determined by a country's monetary and fiscal policies. It is apparent from the Budget Speech that the Government will be continuing to pursue during 1977-78 monetary and fiscal policies which will ensure a progressive improvement in inflation and in the economic situation generaUy. As far as policy is concerned, I invite the honourable gentleman to read again page 34 of Budget Statement No. 2 where the Government's forward view of the balance of payments position is set out. He will note that at present there are seasonal influences at work. These are not expected to be long term. I think that what I have said disposes of the honourable gentleman's question, but I suggest to him that questions of this type at this or any other time are quite destructive of the country's national interest. If he had any sense of responsibility, he would not be seeking to make a public issue of these matters. URANIUM MINING: DEMONSTRATIONS one",17
9,Mr DOBIE,OVERSEAS LOAN BORROWING,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer him to recent Press reports that certain leading figures in the trade union movement are predicting bloodshed in the streets unless demands to hold a referendum on uranium development are acceded to. Prime Minister in a position to advise this House whether the Government will bow to these Council threats?,18
10,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OVERSEAS LOAN BORROWING,"The short answer is no. Everyone is aware that there is a violent minority within Australia which is opposing uranium development regardless of a decision of a democratically elected government which has examined the Ranger reports with great scrupulousness and care and has overwhelmingly followed the recommendations of Mr Justice Fox and his fellow commissioners. I have noted that, amongst other things, one union leader has said: 'Violent uranium protesters, mad lunatic elements, want bloodshed, want confrontation. They are hypocritical as they say some countries can have uranium'-presumabl y they are the Communist countries-'and not others'. The aside was mine and was not part of the quotation. Such people who want violence are only a minority. I suggest that threats by the executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to ban uranium development if there is not a referendum can only encourage them. I think it is sheer hypocrisy on Mr Hawke's part to try to create confrontation between government and trade unions. It is worth noting that on many occasions the President of the Australian Labor Party has suggested that this Government wants confrontation with the union movement. If the truth be known it has always been this Government that has protected the people of Australia against confrontation by minority union groups of one kind or another which have sought to deny their services to the people. Whether it is action by a few postal workers at Redfern, by air traffic controllers or by people in some other area, when it happens it is those people who seek confrontation with the people of Australia and it is the Government's obligation to protect the public interest and the Australian people in those circumstances. Support of the kind that Mr Hawke has given is only pursuing confrontation and the kind of statement he made in relation to uranium will only encourage those who want violence. I would have thought that he had learned by now in any case to stop pursuit of that particular policy. A point was made very ably last night by of the better debaters in the Opposition when he made some comments about the President of the Australian Labor Party and the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Since I cannot put it better than did the honourable member for Hindmarsh I shall quote a passIs the age from what he said. He said: I want to refer now to the proposal of the Australian of Trade Unions. Already the proposal to the ACTU Congress is a dead letter. Even if the Government had been prepared to accept that proposal for a referendum, what position would Bob Hawke have taken in the referendum? Would he have been in favour of mining or in favour of the Australian Labor Party's policy for a moratorium? He would have had to decide which hat he would wear on the occasion of a referendumI suppose he would have worn two hats and cut himself in halfHe would then have had to decide whether he would wear the Australian Labor Party hat and be in favour of the Labor Party's policy or wear somebody else's hat. Mr Innes-Did you write it for him?",18
11,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OVERSEAS LOAN BORROWING,"I did not write the speech for the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I think he is still quite capable of writing very elegant speeches on his own account. I suppose it is worth noting that it is not only the President of the Australian Labor Party about whom the honourable member for Hindmarsh sometimes casts some inadvertent remarks. There is a public responsibility in relation to these matters to see that Government policy, properly devised and properly performed, is carried through, and the Government of the people of Australia will do just that. NA NA",18
12,Mr WILLIS,UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES,"My question which is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations concerns the matter of seasonally adjusted unemployment figures which the Minister ceased to publish a year ago. I ask: Is the Minister aware that Table 1 of Statement No. 2 in the Budget papers contains ngures derived from a seasonally adjusted series relating to persons registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service as unemployed. Does this not mean that seasonally adjusted ngures for the number of registered unemployed are available from the Commonwealth Statistician and are being used by the Department of the Treasury? If so, why does the Minister continue to suppress the publication of these figures?",19
13,Mr STREET,UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES,"The decision to discontinue the publication of seasonally adjusted figures at the same time as the release of the monthly employment figures was the unanimous decision reached at the conference of Ministers of Labour from all States. That included, of course, three Ministers belonging to the honourable gentleman's party. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has what it regards as a series under trial for seasonal adjustment excluding, as I understand it, school leavers. This matter was raised on at least one subsequent occasion at a conference of Labour Ministers. The unanimous decision again was not to change the stand which had been taken on the earlier occasion. NA",19
14,Mr SHIPTON,AUSTRALIAN GOLD COIN,"I ask the Treasurer a question concerning the currency, gold and the deficit. Will the Treasurer consider changing the Currency Act to provide for the Royal Australian Mint to stike a new Australian gold coin? Does he agree that there is a demand for such a gold coin? Does he also agree that perhaps $50 or $100 would be an appropriate denomination and that the sale of such a coin would, in fact, raise revenue for the Government and attract funds from overseas?",19
15,Mr LYNCH,AUSTRALIAN GOLD COIN,"As the interjectors made clear, that is a very good question. In fact, I welcome the question and the interest of the honourable gentleman in the matter. As a consequence of representations which the honourable member for Higgins has made, the question of the issue of a gold coin is under consideration at the present time. There are, of course a number of technical and legal questions which need to be carefully examined in relation to the production of such a coin, quite apart from the fact that the Currency Act would need to be changed. As the honourable gentleman has made clear in his question, there would be a number of advantages, apart from the numismatic point of view. I recognise that there is a demand in the community. It is a matter of assessing how large and strong that demand is. The issue of the com would be helpful to the revenue. I assure the honourable gentleman that his representations will be borne very much in mind. I shall be in a position to inform him of the policy situation, I hope, during the months ahead. NA ATTORNEY-GENERAL",19
16,Mr UREN,RESIGNATION OF,"I direct a question to the Prime Minister. The honourable member for Wentworth, in his resignation speech on Tuesday, denied the accuracy of a report in the Canberra Times on 16 August this year. Is the Prime Minister aware that his Press Secretary has asserted that he had the authority to guide the journalist who wrote that report in the Canberra Times'! Further, has the Prime Minister seen the report? Does he believe the report in the Canberra Times to be accurate?",19
17,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,RESIGNATION OF,"As I understand the position, my Press Secretary wrote to the honourable member in relation to these matters. I have nothing to add to that letter which, I understand, was read into Hansard by the honourable member for Bendigo. SOVIET MILITARY PREPARATIONS: NA",19
18,Mr WENTWORTH,SUGGESTED WHITE PAPER,"My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. He will recall that recently, in response to a request from me, he prepared certain information regarding Soviet military preparations. In view of the value of that information will he now consider making it available to the House in the form of a White Paper, an incorporation in Hansard or in some other fashion?",19
19,Mr KILLEN,SUGGESTED WHITE PAPER,"The answer is yes. Precisely how that could be done is a matter for some consideration. My expectation is that in the course of the next two weeks I will be able to put down a statement on defence. Possibly the information which I provided to the honourable gentleman will be put by way of annexure to that statement. I will give consideration to it and inform my honourable friend. While I am on my feet, Sir, could I have your indulgence and that of the House to say that it is the honourable member's seventieth birthday today? Taking one look at the honourable gentleman I am sure that if he asked, in his usual courteous way, he would get an extension of time.",19
20,Mr WENTWORTH,SUGGESTED WHITE PAPER,"by leave- I thank the House. I am the oldest member in number of years, but in number of years of service I think I am only third. Looking around, may I be relieved of the obligation of saying whether I am glad or sorry not to have the responsibility of being the father of the House. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Prime Minister: Whatever happened to the national inquiry into drugs which he proposed on 27 July in response to a telex from the Premier of New South Wales three days earlier? Why is it taking so long to set up the national inquiry when the New South Wales royal commission was established some weeks ago?",20
21,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PROPOSED NATIONAL INQUIRY INTO,"I appreciate the honourable gentleman's sense of urgency in relation to this matter. It is one that the Government certainly shares. It is a matter of the greatest possible importance. I have written on behalf of the Commonwealth to Premiers because I want to make sure that, to the maximum extent possible, the States are happy and content with the terms of reference proposed by the Commonwealth. If the national mquiry is to be effective, clearly the full co-operation of the necessary. I think that Mr Wran might have found it slightly easier to obtain agreed terms of reference because he had to agree only with himself. COLLAPSE OF AUS STUDENT TRAVEL Business NA",20
22,Mr CHAPMAN,SERVICE PTY LTD,"Is the Minister for lation. Transport aware of conunuing concern community, particularly among tertiary at the collapse of AUS Student Travel Service Pty Ltd? Can the Minister inform the House 1975? about any further developments with respect to that collapse? Can the Government ensure that all students who had purchased tickets AUS Travel will be able to recover their losses? Will students be able to use the facilities of the Australian Union of Students to undertake travel they had already arranged through the comter pany? Will the Government conduct an inquiry into the afTairs of AUS Travel?",20
23,Mr NIXON,SERVICE PTY LTD,"The collapse of AUS Student there Travel Service Pty Ltd came as a shock to many students around Australia. Certainly it caused some distress to students who were overseas. am able to inform the honourable member and the House that, as a result of the co-operation by the airlines, stranded students overseas were able to complete their journeys. The future is not yet quite clear. The House may know that at the request of the creditors a provisional liquidator was appointed on 10 August. The provisional liquidator has come forward with a proposed scheme of arrangement to trade the company out of its nnancial difficulties. Meetings will be held this week to consider that proposed scheme of arrangement. Of course, as DRUGS the Minister for Transport, I shall have to satisfy myself that there are no breaches of the air navigation regulatons in the proposals. The House will recall that the Government was exploring, with the Victorian Government, a proposition to hold a joint inquiry. However in view of the proposal by the provisional liquidator the Victorian Government has now advised that it does not believe that a formal investigation would be appropriate. Therefore I do not think it is possible for the Commonwealth to proceed with an inquiry of substance at this time. I know that many members of this House and, indeed, Ministers have received representations seeking an inquiry into this matter. It will be a matter of some disappointment that an inquiry cannot proceed at this time, but doubtless the provisional liquidator will inform the appropriate authorities if he finds that something States will be improper has occurred. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Prime Minister a question in the absence of the Minister for and Consumer Affairs who, I believe, is responsible for matters concerning tourist legisto Has the Government yet made a decision reintroduce the legislation to regulate the in the activities of travel students, through this House butagencies not which passed through the Senate in",20
24,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TRAVEL AGENCIES,This matter is before the Government at the moment. I hope dethrough cisions can be made fairly shortly. NA,20
25,Mr OKEEFE,RESOURCES TAX,I ask the Deputy Prime Minisand Minister for National Resources: Is it a fact that in the Budget Speech the possibility of introducing a resources tax was mentioned? Has been a lot of speculation that such a tax would apply to all resources? Can the Minister state how far the proposition has progressed and I inform the House of the present position?,20
26,Mr ANTHONY,RESOURCES TAX,"In the presentation of the Budget it was announced that the Government would be consulting oil companies that are producing oil in Australia-principall y the two Bass Strait operators-abou t the possibUity of a secondary tax being applied at some time in the future. Those discussions have commenced. When we presented the uranium policy decisions it was announced also that we would be looking at the possibility of a secondary tax being applied to uranium development. Of course, the likely application of that tax would still be a good many years away. There has been undesirable speculation throughout the mining industry that a resources tax might apply generally to the mining industry. I want to lay at rest this speculation. It is not the Government's intention to apply a resources tax to other sections of the mimng industry. There are good and sound reasons for looking at a secondary tax or a resources tax in respect of oil that has already been produced in Australia and in respect of areas in which profits will be greatly increased because of government decisions. There are also good and wise reasons for looking at the uranium industry in this respect as it is unique and its potential profitability could be very substantial. NA NA",21
27,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,WITH VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT,I ask the Minister for Health: Why was there no proper and adequate consultation with the Victorian Government before the Federal Government unilaterally altered the cost sharing arrangements with that State in relation to the hospital development program and the community health and school dental programs?,21
28,Mr HUNT,WITH VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT,"The question of the funding of the school dental program was discussed at the Premiers Conference in June. The Commonwealth Government in this year's Budget is making available this financial year 14.8 per cent more funds than it did last nnancial year to assist the States with the community health program. Surely nobody could argue that the States should not make a higher contribution towards the conduct of those programs within their own States. The former Government introduced the community health program and tried to involve the community in the program. It obviously showed an inclination towards asking the States to accept a progressively greater degree of involvement in the program. As regards hospital cost sharing, the Government is in no way retreating from its obligation to meet SO per cent of the net operating costs of hospitals, but we have imposed certain accounting disciplines upon the States to ensure that there is proper accountability for the expenditures which they are incurring in respect of hospital administrauon. We have seen in this country an escalation of health costs, rising at the rate of 30 per cent to 40 per cent per annum. We have seen the health component of the gross national product increase from about S.8 per cent in 1971 to about 7.5 per cent in 1976. There has not been any indication, in spite of the rise in costs in the health care field, that the condition of the health of the Australian people has increased one iota. So we are determined to ensure that in those areas in which we are involved there is proper accountability, particularly in respect of hospital operation costs. Three State Premiers have been in touch with either me or the Prime Minister seeking to increase hospital bed charges in their States. We are not prepared at this stage to increase hospital bed charges because it would be inflationary and would disturb the very sensible Medibank arrangements that we made as from 1 October last year. I want to lay at rest any speculation that the Commonwealth Government is trying to force the States to increase hospital bed charges. The States are trying to impose that responsibility upon us so that we would be left with the odium if we were silly enough to say yes. NA SERVICE: NORGARD REPORT",21
29,Mr BURR,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT,The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations will be aware that the Norgard report on the Commonwealth Employment Service proposed signincant changes designed to improve the effectiveness of the CES. Can the Minister inform the House when we are likely to know what action the Government intends to take on the various recommendations?,21
30,Mr STREET,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT,"I am happy to inform the House and the honourable member of the progress that has been made to date in consideration of the Norgard report. The report makes more than 100 recommendations and provides the basis for the development of the Commonwealth Employment Service over the next decade. Therefore it will take some time before some of the recommendations are implemented. However, action is already in train on several fronts, and I would like to mention a couple of them to the House. Norgard identified as a particular weakness of the CES the absence of an organisation within the Department to enable effective co-ordination and management of its operations. As was recommended by Mr everything Norgard, arrangements have now been made for a Deputy Secretary in my Department to assume direct control of the CES in both its operations and management. In addition a small organisance ation has been established in the Department which will act as the focal point for consideration of the other recommendations, for co-ordinating matters arising from them, and for maintaining the momentum which has been attained so far. Much of the action will be required at the roots level. Each region has put together a from regional management and CES officers themselves to identify the Norgard recommenment dations which can be implemented quickly and what resources are needed to implement them. They are now being reviewed with the object of establishing proper priorities. Finally, issues of the Norgard report will be put before the National Labour Consultative Council special meeting tomorrow along with other items, including industrial legislation. Following the consideration by the National Labour sultative Council of the Norgard report, I will making a submission to Cabinet. I hope to be position to make a statement to the Parliament subsequent to that during this session. NA NA",21
31,Mr BEAZLEY,WORKERS,"I ask the Minister for Emissue? ployment and Industrial Relations a question. It refers to the actual and potential unemployment effect of falling nickel prices. Is the Minister aware that already over 600 employees engaged in nickel mining in the Kambalda-Kalgoorlie area have been dismissed by the Western Muring Company? Has the Government made any anxiety efforts to prevent these retrenchments or any further retrenchments? In view of the need for most retrenched employees to relocate to obtain alternative employment and the high cost of moving from a remote area such a Kambalda, can the Minister explain to the House why the Government has made no attempt to advise those dismissed employees of their entitlement nnancial assistance for relocation under the Relocation Assistance Scheme?",22
32,Mr STREET,WORKERS,"I am aware of the situation arising in the Kalgoorlie-Kambalda region as result of the fall in nickel prices. If the situation outlined by the honourable member is correcthospitals. that is, if no attempt has been made to advise clear. people who have to shift from the area of their entitlements- I shall see that it is redressed. Certainly, I am aware that the Commonwealth Emwithdrawing ployment Service in the area has been doing it possibly can tofindalternative employment for the men retrenched and to offer retraining for those who cannot be re-employed with their existing skills. The Relocation AssistScheme introduced by this Government is designed to cope with precisely the sort of situation which the honourable member has outlined. I shall not go into details of the scheme. They are available. But that information will certainly be made available to those who meet the criteria to be eligible for assistance under the grass scheme. The Relocation Assistance Scheme has team enabled some 400 families to be assisted to relocate to new areas where permanent employis available to them. It has been a major help in such circumstances.

33,Mr COODLUCK,WORKERS,"Is the Minister for Health Conaware of notices being issued by the Health be Benefits Council of Tasmama that the Governin a ment intends withdrawing subsidies to public and private hospital patients and nursing home patients? In view of the undoubted concern that the sick and aged and, of course, their families must be experiencing, will the Minister make a clear cut statement on this extremely important",22
34,Mr HUNT,WORKERS,"I thank the honourable member for Franklin for that question. I am very much aware of the notices to which he referred and also of the activities of at least one other fund which has been indulging itself in an extravagant scare campaign that has been causing great and suffering amongst those people in the community who are sick and in need. I think that those activities should be deplored. I know that honourable members on both sides of the House have received hundreds of letters as a result of the campaign that has been conducted. If the funds have reserves to use in this manner, one wonders whether they should be investo tigated. I am also concerned about the report that the Government is intending to increase bed charges in the public hospitals. I have said this morning that the Government has no intention of increasing bed charges and thus premiums for a private insurance. The Government has no intention to abolish the $16 a day subsidy to private The Budget has made that abundantly The Government has no intention of subsidies for private nursing home patients. In fact the Government has allowed for a greater increase in benefits that will apply to nursing home patients because it has a real concern for the care of aged people in private nursing homes, government nursing homes and charitable or non-profit nursing homes. As a result of the changes that we have made, nursing home patients in this country have entered a new era of security. They certainly have, because we have reduced the gap",22

Let me conclude by saying that the changes we have made should increase premiums by no more than 50c a week, but we are looking to funds to absorb that increase by using some of their reserves where it is possible for them to do so. We would expect funds to use their reserves and resources for imate exercises rather than for trying to scare the people of the community with a lot of ill-founded rumours. NA",23
37,Mr UREN,PRICE INCREASES,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. I refer to Budget Statement No. 2 which the Treasurer forecasts a June quarter confidence increase in consumer prices of 2 per cent to per cent, which is equivalent to 8V4 per cent to IQV2 per cent at annual rates. I ask the Treasurer: Following the logic of his statements, does this imply a full year mcrease for consumer prices 11 per cent to 12 per cent and a first half year increase of 13 per cent to 15 per cent? Further, does the Treasurer agree that rates of increase consumer prices of 13 per cent to 15 per cent this half year would boost inflationary exposition? pectations rather than bring about their winding down, as claimed in Budget Statement No. 2?",23
38,Mr LYNCH,PRICE INCREASES,"The honourable gentleman is aware of what is set out in Budget Statement No. 2 and I want to repeat it to the House. Looking the first half of the year and at the second half the year we see that there are factors which working towards putting further pressure on the price mechanism. I refer to outstanding price impact of devaluation and at the same time any catch-up in relation to prices. They will work to put pressure on the price mechanism during the course of the first six months. Equally, as the statement makes clear, the whole thrust of the Budget policy-par - grossly ticularly the firm budgetary and monetary stance-is towards a fall in the rate of inflation during the subsequent six months. Therefore expected pattern of change on that basis is for a slowing as the year progresses, the in consumer prices in the June quarter 1978 being of the order of 2 per cent to 2 h per cent. x Information which the honourable gentleman seeks has not been provided before by governments in the detail which he desires. I certainly reject any suggestions of the alarmist type that the honourable gentleman puts forward. I recall that he mentionedfiguresof up to 15 per cent. I think the simple fact I would want to stand on is this: These sorts of questions were raised by Opposition members when the Budget for 1976-77 was brought down. I said then in quite clear and unequivocal terms that there would be a significant fall in the rate of inflation. That fall, of course, is now a matter of record. I invite the honourable gentleman to look at the national accounts for the end of the year. He will see a very significant fall-10. 2 per cent on the basis of legit- the adjusted consumer price index and some of the more broadly based deflators show a sharper fall. We have every confidence that as the Government's policies take effect during the course of this year we will look towards a position of 2 per cent to 2'/4 per cent. I do not put in on any other basis at the present time than to in assure the House that the Government has every that there will be a further significant 2A fall in the rate of this country's inflation. l NA",23
39,Mr COTTER,URANIUM,Is the Prime Minister aware of of a claim that the Australian Government has committed itself to supply uranium before any of the customer countries have committed themin selves to safeguards? Has the Government made in such a commitment and what exactly is the,23
40,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,URANIUM,"In a national broadcast a few days ago the Leader of the Opposition made a few statements which are completely and utterly false and which he must have at known were completely and utterly false. It of would weary the House too much to trace all the are falsehoods in that statement. Therefore I have selected three, but I must say they are only three the questions of any out of many. The statement that the honourable gentleman mentioned that we have committed ourselves to sales of uranium regardless of a system in relation to safeguards is grossly misleading and false. We have insisted that we will apply the most stringent safeguards. The pohcy announced last May is in fact the strictest safethe guards policy of any country in the world.",23
41,Mr ANTHONY,URANIUM,Muc h stricter than he rate of change recommended in March.,23
42,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,URANIUM,"It is stricter, I am reminded, than the policy he mentioned a few weeks earlier. Our policy is one that goes beyond the recommendations of the Ranger Inquiry itself in relation to safeguards. It goes beyond it in these respects: The customer non-nuclear weapon states must be parties to the non-proliferation treaty involving International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards and accept our additional safeguards requirements under the bilateral treaties which they must enter into with us; existing nuclear weapon states must agree that Australian uranium will not be used for military purposes and be covered by IAEA safeguards. All of these things must be pursued and pursued vigorously before there can be any possible export of uranium to a particular country. It has also been emphasised that the safeguards will in no sense be diluted merely for the sake of making a commercial sale. If countries cannot meet the safeguards requirements they will not be eligible to buy Australian uranium. I think it is most unfortunate that on matters of such national and international importance which do involve great moral issues the Leader of the Opposition should resort to deception and misrepresentation, to scaremongering of the worse kind. The second deception I would like to mention involved the selective quotations and distortions that are a result of that, and these would be clear to anyone who reads what I actually said in my broadcast some days earlier. The Leader of the Opposition in his statement omitted a key sentence to make it appear that I said I believed that waste disposal technology had been applied on a large scale. He omitted the key sentence to be able to draw that conclusion. I actually said: The scientific knowledge and technology have plied to the problem of waste. The technology is known. It has worked on a trial basis and plans are now under way adopt it on a much larger scale. The words 'It has worked on a trial basis' had been left out of the Leader of the Opposition's statement.

44,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,URANIUM,"Well , honourutes replies able gentlemen use blunter terms but they are no that less accurate than the ones I have Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition the Ranger Inquiry favoured several years delay in decision on this matter. That again is quite untrue. The Ranger Inquiry said on page 5 of its second report that a 'decision on the options' delay or not to delay 'depended largely on was deemed to be the best strategy in relation to the matter of proliferation'. It is precisely on that ground, the principal ground, that this Government has determined that sales of Australian uranium should be made. I really find it quite odd that somebody who claims not to want proliferation of nuclear weapons- I admit the claim and I could not conceive of anyone in this House wanting that to happen-and to have the common objective of wanting to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons should suggest that Australia should behave as though we were on the moon or on another planet and not part of this world. Countries are going to get uranium. They will get it under less scrupulous safeguards than if some of them buy it from us. If we do not sell we will have no influence in dealing with the great task of making the world a safer place. We will have no influence in relation to proliferation and other matters of real importance. The vital and important work that Mr Justice Fox is doing now on behalf of the Government and the people of Australia, as adviser on the way that Australia can best lend its efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, could not have anything like the effect that it will have. We will be in the marketMr Armitage-You have been speaking now for six minutes.",24

53,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,URANIUM,"I would have thought that the honourable gentleman, who has suggested that he has some interest in the matters of non-proliferation, would have wanted Australia's voice to be as powerful as it possibly could be in international forums to make the world a safer place in respect of these matters. I point again to the valuable work that Mr Justice Fox has done and is doing on behalf of the Government and the people of Australia because we are indebted to the quality and value of the Ranger Inquiry and its reports. The way in which the Government made its decisions in these matters is full evidence of that. Having achieved a great knowledge and background in these matters through the many months taken by those two inquiries, Mr Justice Fox has now taken on another vital and important role on behalf of the Government and the people of Australia as special adviser to me and the Government on matters of non-proliferation, such as, how we can best conduct ourselves in these matters to make sure that Australia's voice will be as strong as possible to prevent proliferation, to make sure that we use our influence to the maximum extent and to see that all countries pursue safeguards in the most stringent way and co-operate to reinforce each other's safeguards. It is perfectly clear that the basis of the Government's decision was to put Australia into the most powerful position possible in these matters. It is perfectly clear also that the work and advice of Mr Justice Fox would not be as effective if Australia buried its head in the sand and pretended that uranium did not exist in Australia. URANIUM: PRIME MINISTER'S NA Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, I direct my question to the Prime Minister and, in deference to the latitude that you give him and me, I shall connne my question to one instance of deception, misrepresentation and selective quotation for which he is responsible. It concerns the single quotation-on e line-whic h appeared in the documents tabled a fortnight ago from the Flowers royal commission in relation to waste disposal. The quotation read: We are confident that an acceptable solution will be found. I ask the Prime Minister: Why is it that several sentences, and I will quote two of them now, were omitted from his presentation of the Flowers commission findings to this Parliament? The first sentence is: . We believe that a quite inadequate effon has been devoted to the problems of long term waste management and that there should be no substantial expansion of nuclear power until the feasability of a method of safe disposal of high level wastes for the indefinite future has been established beyond reasonable doubt. The second sentence from the Flowers commission findings is: There are promising ideas for the disposal of these wastes but it may take 10 to 20 years to establish their responsibility. I therefore ask the Prime Minister: How is it that so selective a quotation was made and this deception and misrepresentation perpetrated in the House two weeks ago?",25

As to the success of these apprenticeships, I understand that the Victorian Government and the people concerned have been extremely pleased with the results which have been achieved so far. Decisions as to whether this scheme can be extended, of course, remain with the individual States concerned. 30 June 1977. They have to make that judgment for themselves. But under the responsibility of the Australian Apprenticeship Advisory Committee, which is chaired by a member of my Department, the other States have been made aware of the Victorian scheme.

NA Uranium-Electora l Redistribution-Industries Assistance Commission Inquiry into the Copper Industry- Mr Ignazio Salemi-Allege d Cancer Cure-Immigration-Frase r Island: Compensation to Sand Miners. Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Mr E. G. Whitlam-(Werriwa-Leader of solution the Opposition) (11.35)-First , I refer to answer of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to me this morning. The quotation which I made from the Flowers Commission was not effect limited in any way, as he asserted in answer my question. I was quoting from paragraph 504 of the report and I quoted the third and fourth sentences from that paragraph. I now quote the first and second: We have described in Chapter VIII the problems associated with the management and disposal of radioactive wastes arising from the nuclear fuel cycle. wastes will remain active over immense dme scales, and unless continuously isolated will present dangers to our descendants long after nuclearfissiontechnology has to be used as a source of energy. I shall not say any more at this stage on that ter because I realise that the Prime Minister has formed the habit of allowing quesuon ume, on alternate Thursday mornings, to go on so long as to limit the time available to honourable members for grievances. I rose to speak on another matter. The present r the Government and its backers outside have developed a standard technique to intimidate independent bodies whose advice or decisions embarrass it. The Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) was an attempt to intimidate the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. If the Prime Minister cannot intimidate the Industries Assistance Commission proposes to destroy it. Now it is the turn of the electoral commissioners, particularly in New South Wales. The New South Wales Liberal Party has orchestrated a chorus of denunciation of the proposed redistribution. The State president, Sir Kenneth Anderson, a former Minister, has stated that the proposals are unacceptable and unfair to the Liberal and Nauonai Country annual parties. The State Secretary, Mr Carlton, Marine describes the proposals as outrageous. The right honourable member for Lowe (Sir MCMahon), the only New South Wales the Liberal who has ever been Prime Minister, has been particularly vehement. On 23 August he said: 'I will protest and I will protest very loudly about it'. The commissioners in New South Wales so far have done nothing more and nothing less than their duty. They have obeyed the law of the land. They have carried out the law. No law of this Parliament has greater authority than the one under which the commissioners have carried out the redistribution. More directly than most laws the Commonwealth Electoral Act can be said to have been submitted to the people and supported by them. This Bill was one of the twice rejected Bills which caused the double disof 1974. It passed into law at the historic the last Joint Sitting of August of that year. My Government's efforts to carry out the law and secure the redistribution needed to give to the law were frustrated to the bitter end. to The coalition was determined that a Labor government would never preside over a redistribution. Indeed the Country Party's determination to avoid a redistribution led directly to the double dissolution of 1974.1 believe it was also a factor in the double dissolution of 1975. Now the highly Liberal Pany has had its own distribution. Such Simply because it does not have it all its own remote way, simply because the commissioners have, to ceased this stage, done an honest, workmanlike job, the Liberals are squealing. If the commissioners matwere to carry out the law faithfully they had no choice but to make the kind of changes they have made. Of course the changes are substantial. They had to be. There has not been a redistribution That redistribution was carried out under the old law which allowed a 20 per cent variation from the quota instead of the 10 per cent variation under the new law. Further, the High Court ruled that there must be two fewer divisions New South Wales. It would not permit another election for the present number. If a distribution is not accepted on the basis of fewer divisions and more equal enrolment the next election will be for the State of New South Wales at large. The shape of the proposed redistribution has been determined not by any prejudices of the commissioners but by the necessity of the law. The obstruction of the Twenty-eighth and have Twenty-ninth Parliaments has led to gross still inequalities between electorates. Wales Mitchell, held by a Liberal, had by January this year 90,276 electors. I will being ngures which appear in a speech I made on 24 February this year. Sydney, a seat held by Labor, had 53,177; Chifley, a seat held by easy Labor, had 88,030; Wentworth, a seat held by Liberal, had 56,019. With such gross variations it vantaged. was inevitable that any lawful distribution must (Mr Cohen) make drastic changes to the boundaries. The disparity between divisions is as marked when their populations are considered. In 1976 my electorate had a populauon of 157,000. It was the second greatest of the New South Wales divisions. Its enrolment of 81,250 was as great the population alone of North Sydney which was 81,059. Enrolment for Mitchell is only 7,000 fewer than the population of Lowe about which its right honourable member is so vocal. Among the Sydney metropolitan divisions, any previous Sydney had an enrolment of 53,117; Reid members of Parliament 59,788; Grayndler, 60,178-al l held by Labor rying out the law. M.Ps. Wentworth with 56,019, North Sydney with 58,568 and St George with 60,995 have smaller enrolments than Lowe with 61,392. dentally, since Grayndler is constantly menopportunity tioned as a small division, I point out that it much greater population than Lowe-112,00 0 into compared with 97,000. All these divisions with smaller enrolment than Lowe are quite properly being expanded. Their members will have to seek the support of greater numbers than before. If re-elected they will have to look after greater numbers than before. None of them will have look after more than the average number which members have to look after. But those members are not squealing as the right honourable member for Lowe is squealing at the prospect of having to make a greater effort at and between since 1968. elections. At the 1968 redistribution Lowe was given a smaller enrolment than Werriwa, Macquarie has and Mitchell. By this year enrolment in Lowe in had increased by fewer than 4,000, in Werriwa by over 22,000, in Macquarie by nearly 25,000, and in Mitchell by 32,500. In one electorate the population has increased by over 35,000, and in another by over 36,000.1 quote these ngures to show how selfish it is for an honourable member who has had a pretty fair go, who has had a long run, to complain at having to look after an average number of people. If he is re-elected he will to look after 10,000 more electors, but he will not have to look after any more than the In New South average number. quotAll parties and many members can have grievances about this redistribution, as we can always have them about any redistribution. It is very to go about a nitpicking exercise. The right a honourable member for Lowe claims he is disadThe Labor member for Robertson could make the same complaint. The Labor member for Lang (Mr Stewart) and the Labor member for Darling (Mr FitzPatrick) could complain at the abolition of their divisions. The distribution commissioners should be allowed to do their duties without disparagment and harassment. It would be unlawful to hold an as election before there is a redistribuuon. The commissioners have followed the law and have upheld the law to this stage. So far they have done their duty by this Parliament. They have prepared the ground for a more democratically elected parliament, a parhament more nearly reflecting the principle of equal representation than parliament. It is not appropriate for to deter them from carInci Mr GROOM (Braddon) (11.45)- I take this to make some comments on the curhas a rent Industries Assistance Commission inquiry the copper industry in Australia which incora porates an mquiry into the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd in Queenstown, Tasmania. As members would know, during recent months there has been a good deal of trenchant criticism of the Commission and its approach to the to development of Austrahan industry. I want to make one or two general remarks before I get on to the question of Queenstown itself. In some quarters it has been suggested that the Commission is bent upon destroying business confidence, and in particular the manufacturing sector of Australian industry. I believe that if there is to be criticism it should be criticism of the Industries Assistance Commission Act rather than of the body which was created under that Act. No one, I beheve, can seriously argue that the Commission has not endeavoured, to the best of its ability, faithfully to execute its responsibilities according to its charter. I believe it has acted totally in accordance with the Act as legislated and has tried to balance the economic and social objectives set out in section 23 in an economically consistent manner, if not necessarily a socially aware manner. In other words, I believe the Commission has performed its task faithfully as it interprets that task under the Act. My complaint would be that the Act has not placed sumcient constraints on or given a clear directive to the Commission to ensure that it has greater concern for individuals-whethe r those individuals are people, corporations or even individual industries, and whether those individuals are in the manufacturing sector, the niining sector or the rural sector. Therefore I would like to see less emphasis at this point of our economic history on the broad-based approach which was so clearly stated in the Commission's 1975-76 annual report. In that report the Commission endeavoured to explain its approach. The report states: Since industries in all sectors of the economy are ultimately competing for limited capital and labour resources, the provision of assistance to any individual industry tor reduces the resources available for the development of other industries and sectors. The Commission's approach to industry assistance has the aim of improving the well-being of the community as a whole. Obviously there is a very broad-based approach by the Commission which has been evident in recent times. I think the Aa, as it is at present, allows the Commission, unfortunately, to be economic puritans who place economic theories and projections into the future, which may be correct in the long term, before the immediate practical needs of individuals to be fed, clothed and housed and to have jobs now. I believe they are fairly important considerations. I believe the Mount Lyell inquiry provides the Commission with a unique opportunity to show it has an economic heart as well as an economic head. The House is aware of the current crisis at the Mount Lyell company. It has been raised in this place on a number of occasions. As the House would appreciate, it results from a world slump in copper prices. It is a terrible thing that this company will be forced to close unless government assistance is recommended by the Commission. Failure to provide assistance to the company will bring about very tragic results indeed. Queenstown is the main centre of population on the west coast of Tasmania and is the principal residential centre for the work force engaged in the operations of the Mount Lyell company. Its population of about 4,500 people is almost entirely dependent upon this company and its operations. The township of Gormanston, which is quite close to Queenstown-abou t five miles away-and has a population of 500 people, and also the township of Strahan on Macquarie Harbour on the west coast are very heavily dependent indeed upon Mount Lyell. The end of the Mount Lyell company will mean that these towns will be mere shadows of their present selves. Most of the people in these towns, in particular in Queenstown, own their own homes. They have capital invested, which is most unusual for a mimng centre. In this respect Queenstown is unique. Without this mine the whole area will become a quiet and gradual drain on government funds in social security payments and other forms of assistance in years to come. If we can see out the present slump in world copper prices, which the experts suggest will continue for perhaps 12 months or two years, these areas will have a future. There are still large quantities of proven copper ore in the ground at Queenstown. It is essential for the Commission in its inquiry or secand the presentation of its report to consider these fundamental human factors and not only to look at and consider pure economic theory. I hope that the Industries Assistance Commission in its wisdom will view Queenstown and Mount Lyell as an exceptional case and will give proper recognition to the need to protect for a reasonable period-perhap s a year, two years or three years-the very hard working mining community of Queenstown.",27
73,Mr INNES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I wish to raise a matter of importance, not just to people in my electorate, but to every ethnic group in our community. In fact, it is a matter of importance to every Australian for we have a Minister in this Government who is pursuing a vendetta against one man, one Italian migrant who is serving his fellow Italians. Why is he pursuing this vendetta? He is doing it at the behest of a few members of the Italian community who are highly placed in the Liberal Party of Austraha. Let me briefly outline what has happened in relation to Ignazio Salemi. He came to this country to assist FILEF, an organisation which might be likened to the Australian Council of Trade Unions. He came as a social worker, mainly to assist migrant Italian workers. came on a temporary basis and when it was apand E arent that his work was unfinished he applied ave his visa extended. This Government, with this Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar), were not having any of that. They declared an amnesty for people who were in the country illegally. Mr Salemi asked to treated on the same basis as those who were here illegally. Then we saw the technicalities creep in. Minister, or perhaps his stooges in his Departtheir ment, said that Mr Salemi was not eligible for treatment under the amnesty because here legally. Since then the High Court of Australia has criticised the actions of the Governoperation ment; so has the Ombudsman. But what is the result? Last Friday the Minister signed a deportknown ation order. I have presented several petitions to this House relating to Mr Salemi-petition s which contained some 20,000, 30,000 or 40,000 signait tures of Italians in the community. Because that support I want today to spell out the full details of the actions which have been taken. want to do that so the ethnic groups of the munity can see what this Government is pregroups. pared to do. Tbis Minister had the effrontery say the other day that the real problem grants was 'emotional poverty'. Never mind all those other problems; it is emotional poverty which the migrant suffers according to him. The Minister suffers from poverty of the mind. shows a lack of understanding of ordinary prinWales, ciples of fair play, conect conduct and natural jusuce. Let me give the facts about Mr Salemi. came to Australia first in September 1973 to parto ticipate in the first migrant workers' conference. He came because the committee of FILEF in Melbourne had asked him in his role as editor of a monthly publication entitled Emigrazione, pubUshed by FILEF in Rome. He was later asked to return to Australia for a certain to assist in establishing a welfare office for Italian communities in the areas of Coburg Brunswick and also to establish a newspaper the ItaUan language so that these people would be assisted in their integration into ciety. Above all, they were to be assisted by being informed of the many rights which their new country afforded them. So in February 1974 Mr Salemi came back to Australia and helped to estabUsh a welfare office in Coburg. The newspaper Nuovo Paese was esHe tabUshed in May 1974. In the area of Coburg Brunswick there is a very large ethnic poputo lation. They came to the centre in their hundreds. They came with all their problems-wit h appUcations for pensions, insurance and workers compensation problems, unemployment and sickness benefits problems, rent problems, hire be purchase problems, educational problems, problems with income tax returns and applications for Housing Commission homes. They came because at that centre there were people who could The speak their language and who could understand problems. They developed a pride in the centre for it was a free welfare agency which they he was had estabUshed themselves. Even when the Labor Government, in cowith the State Government, started the north west one-stop welfare shop, commonly as NOW, they continued to throng to the FILEF welfare centre. Perhaps it was for reasons of trust, perhaps it was for ease of communication, perhaps it was because they had a pride in their own efforts; but it worked. Co-ordinating all was Ingazio Salemi. He has the journalistic of touch to express things properly in the newspaper. He is multilingual, able to speak I Italian, Spanish, Hungarian, French and English comat least. He is the link between many of the He is the real communicator between the to migrant community in that area and their rights of miin the Australian community. So successful has been his work that FILEF activities grew and grew in Melbourne. Branches He have been formed in Queensland, New South South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. Through it all the ItaUan community has begged him to stay. Well, most of them have begged him to stay. Of course, there He are a few wealthy ItaUans who do not want him stay. They do not want someone in their midst who is able to explain the rights of a worker to a worker. They have spoken to their colleagues in the Liberal Party.' Getridof this man', they said and, for good measure, they added: 'He is a communist'. One of these people approached me period when the honourable member for Hindmarsh the (Mr Clyde Cameron) was Minister for Labor and and Immigration and asked me to see what I in could do about getting Mr Salemi out of the country because he was a communist, not beAustraUa socause of the work he was doing. Lest it be thought that I am making this up, let me assure the House that that very proposition was put to me personally by influential ItaUans who sought my aid. I know that when I say this shall receive another very irate letter from Braddon in Sydney, to whom I must apologise for having the temerity to refer to her as a wealthy old dowager. At her request I withdraw the term 'wealthy'. But I venture to suggest that membership of the Italian Communist Party is hardly something which makes a man stand in Italian society. After all, that Party is very close to being the ruling party in that country. What if Mr Salemi is a member of the Comdid munist Party? Is that good warrant him from this country? Have we banned communists? The Minister may think so. If that is has a remedy. Section 14 of the Migration Act Coun judgment enables him to order the deportation of anyone 'unfortunate' who preaches the communist doctrine. Of course, Mr there is one problem for the Minister and his Dement partment: That section gives a person arightof actionsby appeal to a commissioner who is a judge of a able, unfortunate court. Over the years all sorts of attempts have was critical, and the been made to develop a proper system of the Minister proceeded appeals in deportation cases. The sort of argument that is being put up can easily be seen to be puny when one looks at the repon of the committee on administrative cretions. What happened as a result of the presentaton of that report? Appeals are now We being made in some deportation cases under secaccount tions 12 and 13 of the Migration Act by people mean who have been convicted of specified crimes communities, within a specified time of their arrival in country. So there is arightof appeal for people who have committed criminal acts. There is right of appeal against deportation by the Minisdemonstrated ter on the grounds of being a communist. But there is no appeal for Mr Salemi. He is a social worker. The Minister hides behind technicalities, including the claim that there are plenty journalists in Australia. What a load of tripe! Let me trace the history of events. On 25 January 1976, flushed with success at being admitted to the Ministry-perhaps he will be next to go-the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs announced an amnesty. Everyone who was an over-stayed visitor would be granted resident status unless he failed to meet normal is standards of health and good character or if he had a serious criminal record. Salemi applied the amnesty. He was told that he was not eligible because he had not entered as a visitor. That incorrect, and the Chief Justice of the High of Australia described it as being an untenable reason. After making three separate applications, Salemi's application was heard by a Full Bench expired. I of the High Court of Ausualia on 11 May 1977. Lady Three judges were of the opinion that Mr Salemi had been denied natural justice; the other three judges said that he had been unfairly treated but that the concept of natural justice did not apply in the adrninistration of the Minister's decision under the Migration Act. Even in the light of that out glaring criticism the Minister persisted and ordered Mr Salemi to leave the country. His case was taken to the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman cannot investigate the actions of Ministers. He for banishing thatinvestigate the fact the depanmental action and said that the Depanment did not advise so, he the Minister of the implications of the High was 'unreasonable', that it was that the Department did not ask Salemi for particulars, and that the Departwas 'wrong'? So here we have three statements the Ombudsman to the effect that the of the Minister's advisers were unreasonand wrong. The High Court end result of all that was that and issued a deportation order. When addressing a cultural studies conference disin Goulburn last week the Minister said: have largely failed in the past to take adequate of the non-economic factors which understandably so much to the quality of life of members of our ethnic and which could, and should, add so much to this the quality of life of Australians generally. a I suggest that in this case the Minister has that failure. It is past the time for there to be a proper system of appeals. We have had the window dressing of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Proceedings) Act, which has of never been proclaimed, which probably never will be proclaimed now that the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott) has received his reward, and which might allow such an appeal. We have provision for appeals for mithe grants convicted of crimes. We have a system, which is never used, for migrants who are alleged to be communists. Mr Salemi might be a communist. He is not being dealt with as one; he being dealt with as a victim of the Minister. It is still not too late for the Minister to do the correct for thing-to act like a Minister who has some responsibility for the ethnic communities. Let was him withdraw the deportation order. Let him Court grant resident status. Let justice be done.",29
74,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Lucock)Mr Order! The honourable member's time has,31
75,Mr BIRNEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I draw the attention of the House to what I call the Rarotonga rip-off, aided and abetted by a dark conspiracy between the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands, Sir Albert Henry, and a crook, charlatan, arch-swindler named Milan Brych. The whole purpose of this swindle is to entice to the Cook Islands for treatment Australians who either have cancer or who, for one reason or another, think that they may have fallen victim to this dreaded disease. Brych is a former Czechoslovakian refugee who conned the Medical Council of New Zealand, upon his own sworn testimony, into believing that he had undergone medical training in that country commencing in 1958. He became a member of the staff of the Auckland Hospital Board institutions, and from early 1972 onwards began to make false, grandiose and extravagant claims about his ability to cure cancer patients by a remedy so secret that he has never to this day disclosed it. He conned not only the Council but apparently also members of the medical profession in this country, to such an extent that Australian patients have been going to New Zealand for treatment by Brych from 1972 onwards. Following a flood of complaints his background was investigated by the Medical Council during 1974. He was struck off the New Zealand medical register in November of the same year on the basis that he had fraudulently claimed to hold medical degrees. Following extensive abuse of the New Zealand legal system which culminated in long delays, the matter was finally resolved in April of this year when Brych withdrew his appeal against being struck off the register. In addition to the charge of fraud surrounding his assertions to having medical degrees, I believe that he was then also facing some 23 other charges laid by the Division of Medicine from Auckland. Brych disappeared from the Auckland scene and has now set himself up in the Cook Islands under the patronage of his co-conspirator, Albert Henry, at whose behest and insistence Cook Islands Medical Act was specifically on altered to allow for Brych's registration as a medical practitioner. This dastardly act was done in the face of repeated warnings from the Divstore ision of Medicine in Auckland to the Cook Islands Medical Council and to their Minister for have Health. It is of interest to note that Brych's appeal against being struck off the medical register in New Zealand was dismissed on 5 April 1977 and that the Medical Act of the Cook Islands was altered just prior to that date. singular overt evidence of the birth of the conspiracy. To his great credit, the chairman of the Medical Council resigned in protest. The facilities under which Brych is operating are almost non-existent. Brych was subsequently appointed by the Prime Minister and his Government as Director of the new Cook Islands Medical Research Institute, and he expects to start work in a new $400,000 centre next year. The Cook Islands Government has got plenty of coconuts-smal l ones at that-bu t no money. The only possible way in which this project can be financed is by ripping off money from Australians and Americans who are worried to the depths of despair by their terminal condition. The existing hospital in which he works has no automatic suction, oxygen or similar amenities at the bedside of the patient. There are no elaborate laboratory of X-ray facilities. It would be an over-estimation to say that the blood transfusion services are poorly developed. As is the situation with all cancer quacks, ngures and facts are non-existent, but the propagation of information, not only by himself but also by his medical agents in this country, is specifically tailored to ensnare a multitude of unfortunates into the mistaken belief that he has some miraculous method of treating cancer. I am given to understanding that a file prepared by the Auckland police is now at police headquarters in Wellington for their study and for examination by the Solicitor-General. The whole purpose of this exercise will be to base a request for an extradition order against Brych to take him back to New Zealand to face criminal charges. As my good friend of racing fame, the late Ken Howard, would say, it is London to a brick that his co-conspirator, Sir Albert Henry, will refuse. This gentleman obviously sees Brych's arrival on the scene as manna from heaven which will fill his Government's coffers. He has levelled abuse at all his critics, foremost among whom has been our own Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) whom he has described as a Sir person who would not know the difference be the tween tinnea and foot and mouth disease. He is record as saying that he does not give a damn what Mr Hunt says and he will not be dictated to by Mr Hunt or by anyone else. There is news in for that gentleman. In the face of mounting criticism he has again gone on record as saying that he does not give a damn if Byrch does not a certificate in other countries and that he had given him a certificate that is legal in the Cook Islands. Australians are being ripped-off by this unholy That is alliance to the tune of between $7,000 and $10,000 a patient. An expose as to how Byrch's fees are divided would, I am sure, make the interesting of reading. I would exhort our own prestigious medical associations to conduct their own investigation for the purpose of searching and seeking out Australian medical practitioners who are actively promoting in this country Byrch's activities in the Cook Islands and recruiting patients here in return for a nnancial House. kick-back. Only last month Sir Edward Hughes, President of the Royal Australian College of (12.13)-M Surgeons, returned from New Zealand. I underraised by they honourable stand he described Byrch as a complete and rogue, and he expressed concern, so I believe, that money may be leaving this country and finding its way into the pockets of this man. This tion timely and most interesting observation caught that my attention and should become the immediate concern of the Commonwealth Government in the near future. Section 21 of the Health by Insurance Act states: Subject to this section, where medical expenses incurred in respect of a medical service specified rendered outside Australia, on or after the date fixed urposes of section 10, to an alf of, a prescribed personI emphasise the words 'prescribed person'. . . medical benefit is payable in respect of that medical service as if that medical service had been rendered Australia by or on behalf of, a medical practitioner. Although Mr Brych is not a medical practitioner in the ordinary accepted sense of the word, dreadful anomaly is that he is, in fact, a medical practitioner under the definitive section of Act. If honourable members will bear with me, section 21 of the Act which refers to a 'prescribed person' says that a 'prescribed person' means person authorised to practise as a medical practhe titioner under the law of the place-in this case is the Cook Islands-wher e the professional vice was rendered. Of course he is entitled to practise as a medical practitioner in the Cook Islands because Sir Albert had run roughshod over the advice of his own medical council. Honourable members will recall that the same about gentleman, Sir Albert Henry, by his own machinations and fbr his own ends and, no doubt, Mr Brych's also, arbitrarily made him a medical practitioner under that law. Put simply it means that from time to time all the people of Australia are making a contribution towards this criminal who has battened on the hopes and aspirations of a number of Australians. This must cease. call upon the Federal Government to correct forthwith this anomaly by amending section 21 giving the Minister discretionary power to premost clude payment of benefits for services rendered by persons such as Mr Brych. Ifit does not move expeditiously an unjustified accusation of double standards could be leveUed at the Government. I assure the House that there is no alternative but to continue with the payment of benefits until openly this amendment is implemented. I thank the",32
76,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Grayndler) grievance relates also to the matter member for Melbourne utter (Mr Innes). The honourable member for Melbourne has dealt in great detail with the persecuof Ignazio Salemi by the Government at the behest of others. He has pointed out the work Mr Salemi has been doing for Italian migrants and Australia and the way in which he has been unmercifully hounded. I shall add to that pointing out the quite unsatisfactory legislative framework within which Mr Salemi has had are to work and also detail the actions of the Departin an item ment of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the for the omissions and lack of action by the Minister for Australian resident, by or on beImmigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) consequent upon the report of the Ombudsman in this matter. The interest of the honourable member for in Melbourne in matters relating to deportation and the rights of migrants in Australia is not new. In fact, last year when the Ombudsman Bill first the came on for debate in the Budget sittings the honourable member referred extensively to the the power of deportation and to the rights of migrants under the proposed legislation. In particular, he drew attention to the report of the Bland a Committee on Administrative Discretions about attitude of the Department of Immigration it and Ethnic Affairs to therightsof migrants in serAustralia. I think he summed up the situation then by saying that the Bland Committee concluded that there was strong departmental opposition to a system of appeals for persons who are not already permanently resident in Australia. That seems to me to be a fair summary of the Department's position. It reflects the entrenched conservatism in the Department which the Minister has done nothing. In responding to the concern expressed by the honourable member for Melbourne, the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott), who was then the Attorney-General, was at pains to put the House at ease about the exercise of ministerial discretion under the Migration Act. The I Attorney-General, as he then was, pointed out that when the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs was absent from Australia he acted as Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. He knew something about the portfolio and said that the Minister had interested himself personally in the signing of deportation orders and did not feel in any way constrained to act upon the advice of his officials. The Attorney-General went on to draw a distinction between so-called policy decisions and administrative decisions. He said that in the area of administrative decisions the decisions of a Minister would be subject to review under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. He should have known that that was wrong. It is wrong. It arises in relation to section 14 of the Migration Act. It does not arise in tion to section 18 under which the Minister has acted to deport Ignazio Salemi. The then Attorney-General in his usual blithe manner concluded that the discretions of Ministers have always been subject to judicial review under prerogative writs. That too is wrong. If the then Attorney-General needed to be told that in any certain terms, he has been told it on two occasions this year by the High Court. In particular, he has been told it by his old chum, the Chief Justice of Austraha. Earlier, in a matter brought by Mr Salemi himself, the Chief Justice reached that conclusion. More strongly, he reached the same conclusion subsequently in a case involving two Fijian nurses who had also sought an order against the Minister to stop their deportation. In that case the Chief Justice said he expressed the view in the case of Mr Salemi that the power to order deportation under section 18 is not qualified by the necessity to afford a prohibited immigrant natural justice. Every other judge in the High Court agreed with that view. If a Minister has a power that does not have to be exercised subject to considerations of natural justice it is a particularly grave power. We ought to hope that the Minister weighs very carefully all considerations before he exercises it. I turn to the advice that the Minister has received from his Department and to the attitude of the Ombudsman to that advice. The Ombudsman was appointed this year. Professor Jack Richardson was appointed without the position being advertised. He is a man of known, strong partisan attachment to the coalition panies who has, at least since the time of the double dissolution in 1974 and the subsequent Joint Sitting, interested himself actively in counselling and advising the coalition parties. Nonetheless, he is an experienced teacher of administrative and constitutional law. He had the advantage of teaching me those subjects. Let us look at what the Ombudsman said in relation to this very important matter of the deportation of Mr Ignazio Salemi. This matter has caused enormous concern amongst the Italian community, not simply in Melbourne but right throughout Australia because of the very selective way not only the Minister but also his departmental officials appear to have acted. We all know that ministerial discretions are not subject to review under the Ombudsman legislation. But the Ombudsman said that that did not preclude him from looking at the administrative decisions reached by officers of the Minister's Department. relaThe Ombudsman described in great detail what he thought an amnesty was and the grave consequences that flowed from it. He said: A grant of amnesty is a positive and exceptional act of executive government giving rise to expectations of paramount importance to the classes of persons to whom it may extend. It is not to be expected, therefore, in the case of doubt, that the language in which the amnesty is expressed should be interpreted narrowly or technically to the disadvantage of persons who could reasonably understand it to apply to them. He said it is not to be interpreted narrowly or technically. Honourable members should bear in mind what are the powers of the Minister. In the Fijian nurses' case the Chief Justice said that where a person was a prohibited immigrant the Minister had no discretion under section 18, he had to deport. He said that his discretion related to the cancelling of temporary entry permits and the question whether, therefore, persons were prohibited immigrants. Whether a person is a prohibited immigrant is a question of objective fact. It is something a court will look at. A court can look at only the way in which the Minister has dealt with the question of entry permits. It is on the record in the Ombudsman's report that the Department of Immigration and Ethnic AfTairs has changed its position on this matter. It changed it after the honourable member for Melbourne made representations in May 1976. The Ombudsman refers to that particularly, that the initial advice given to the Minister was wrong and that in fact whilst Mr Ignazio Salemi may have come on a visitor's visa and have subsequently been given a temporary resident permit that was the position it adopted after May 1976 and after Mr Salemi had first made his application to remain in Australia. We ought to look at the conclusion reached by the Ombudsman. From reading the report of this case it is obvious that the Ombudsman has given very thorough consideration to the matter. He has called before him officers of the Department. He has not been put off by the fact that the Minister has signed the deponation order. He has gone on to draw very clear conclusions about this matter. His summary is this: that a person, stayed after first entering Australia pursuant to temporary entry permit and a visitor's visa, later obtaining a further temporary entry permit and being issued with a temporary resident visa, would have a reasonable expectation that the amnesty would be extended to him subject to compliance with the requirements of good health and character. That is the conclusion the Ombudsman reached, yet at every turn the Minincomes ister and his departmental ofncials have sought to hide behind technical details about the that Mr Salemi's status was changed from that a visitor to that of a temporary resident after entered Australia and that, as a temporary resident, he was therefore not eUgible for the nesty. The Ombudsman thought otherwise and he said that section 15 (1) plied. He did not say what that was. That section reads 'that the action was unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory'. That the conclusion reached by the Ombudsman in relation to the advice tended to the Minister. Minister has remained curiously silent about actions of his ofncials and about his proposed acuon in relation to this important report of Ombudsman.",33
77,Mr MILLAR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In recent weeks members of this Parliament would have received letters from the Fraser Island Sandminers Area ReUef Committee seeking their support for adequate compensation followthey ing the Government's decision to terminate mining in that area. I was previously acquainted with their intention and indeed I had some est input into that letter. It was designed to support for my representations to the Governments. ment to ensure that the requirements of the Fraser Island Environmental Inquiry's final report would be fully met. Recommendation 2 in that final report called for the Government to ensure that appropriate economic and other eral assistance be given to the extent that adverse regional economic effects follow the implementation of recommendation No. 1. In the area of compensation the Federal of Government certainly did provide $10m to be appUed over a three-and-a-half year period. It was designed initially to be a wage element in programs that would be supported by the State Government to ensure a continuity of emof ployment for those who sought it. The State Government was not sensitive to the Federal Government's insistence that it should share responsibiUty of a decision that was exclusively the responsibiUty of the Federal Government. insisted in the end that the money be passed over overto the State Government which would determine a its appUcation. The position now is that approxiand mately a score of ex-sandminers have not been able to secure employment. Very many of them have been given alternative employment in local authorities, forestry depanments and other areas but they have been required to take employment at a substantially lower income-in most cases at an average of 30 per cent lower-tha n the they previously received. Clearly they have been disadvantaged as a consequence. A fact number of these sand miners have been disof missed for a second time when local authority he funds directed to programs to assist in this respect become depleted and it was necessary for amthose sand miners to be dismissed pending the introduction of the programs for the next finan(a) (u) of the Act apcial year. I do not propose in the few minutes available is to me to canvass therightsor wrongs of the decision made on the environmental issue but the The fact is that, as a consequence of that decision, the very many Australians are suffering hardship and distress. They had, with reasonable expecthe tation of continuation of employment with its attached income, committed themselves to expenditure in the way of buying homes and motor vehicles and attending to all the requirements normally associated with the estabExhshment of family in an employment area. Immediately on the decision coming into effect were seriously embarrassed in mamtaining sand their commitments. Some husbands are working 1,000 miles away from their families, and are modUkely to remain so, to secure employment that enlist offers sufficient return to meet their commitOthers are in very serious difficulties. They were required to dispose of their vehicles and various other assets and are at risk of having No. to surrender their homes. The question arises as to what extent the FedGovernment should hold itself responsible for their condition. This House is painfully aware that there are at this time very many Australians who are equally distressed through a different set circumstances, but this situation exists because of the Federal Government responding, perhaps quite properly, to what it believed was the insistence of the Australian society, that Fraser Island ought to be preserved for all Australians because its unique characteristics. These may be argued, but that was the decision and very many well meaning people were most vocal and active the in ensuring that the Government did come to that decision. It has been rather sad-indee d it It may be an indictment of our society-that since the decision has been made very little, if interest has been displayed by those people ensure that those who suffered the consequence of their ambitions should not be unfairly treated. There is a strong suggestion that the mining carry company is the culprit, that because it elected to take a calculated risk on the continuation of operations it has a debt to those discharged sand miners and those who may have felt the impact of that decision. But it is not possible to persuade the people so affected that there is any substance to those assertions. They quite rightly point statements that have been made in this House. On 20 May 1975 the Prime Minister of the day posed the question to what extent the Australian Government could purport to abort contracts which had been made in accordance with the law. He said: The people who sought the authorisation from the ter for Minerals and Bnergy had acted completely in ance with the lawHe was referring, of course, to Dillinghammissioned Murphyores Minerals. That authority relates statement by the late Mr Connor in answer to question upon notice on 21 April 1975 when he said: On 13 December 1974, D.M. Minerals finalise an export contract draft agreement submitted on 13 September. Under the erals export control procedures established in February 1973, D.M. Minerals Had consulted with officers of partment prior to drawing up the draft agreement. The project was not considered new in that it had reached vanced stage in planning and development and substantial exploration and development expenditure had already incurred, some of which dated back to the early 60s; mining leases had been granted by the Queensland authorities laying down, amongst other things, stringent conditions to protect the environment. Specifically in answer to the question Hunt as to whether the Government intended to honour its undertaking to D.M. Minerals, the Minister categorically stated: 'Yes'. So there firm belief in the community that the mining company was legally and properly engaged activity which brought with it an expectation for all involved of a continuation of operations a period of 15 to 18 years. Those ambitions the part of all concerned were abruptly tersay minated by Government decision based on what it believed to be a reasonable rationale interests of the people of Australia. It is only proper that the people of Australia, through the Federal Government, should comWe pensate those people adequately, as urged by the environmental inquiry itself in the recommendavided. tion to which I referred before. The sand miners seek recognition in terms of a severance pay any, an income maintenance scheme for a periodto perhaps six months' equivalent income-or in some respect a special allocation of funds should be made to ensure that they are not left alone to the burden of a nation's conscience, if indeed it was pertinent to the Fraser Island issue. It would be remiss of me, as their representative in this Parliament, to slacken my efforts to ensure that in this situation justice should be done. To suggest that the mining company commenced operations with indecent haste to thwart to the ambitions or the intentions of the environmental inquiry is quite mischievous. The company had been previously authorised, as was pointed out in Mr Connor's statement to embark on this project. In actual fact on 16 March 1975, some few days before the announcement was made that an environmental inquiry would be conducted on Fraser Island, the company had Minisexpended $6m on pre-mining activities and the accordconstruction of plant for that project. A few days later the wet plant on the island was comand operations began. So this was a to a long continuing exercise from 1961 which in a volved a total commitment of the project in 1973, on the basis of categoric assurances from the Government the company was authorised to was authorised to proceed. in accordance with the terms of a minIt strikes me as an absolute mischief to suggest that these people should be left to their own my Dedevices to resolve their own dilemma because the an adGovernment proves to be derelict in its responsibuities on behalf of the society that insisted this been action should be taken. I would seek the support also, of all members of this House to apply themselves as best they can to see in this situation that justice be done. put by Mr Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (12.32)- I wish to endorse the remarks already made this morning by other Opposition speakers is a in respect to what is known as the Salemi case. This matter relates to problems of interpreting in an the law concerning immigration and, even worse, to the misinterpretation of what might be over deemed to be Press releases of a Minister on announced as being government policy. Let me at the outset that during the last election the Government announced its policy on immigrain the tion with the famous line: The policy will be guided by principles of humanity, equity and compassion . . . have had the benefit of a High Court decision. I must say the Court was certainly very diOut of a court of six judges three decided in favour of Salemi and three against him on or technical grounds. The decision went against bim because the Chief Justice based his decision on these very technical grounds. Subsequent to that we had the benefit of Ombudsman's decision which clearly indicated that he felt Salemi was entitled to remain here. ter We would say that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKeller) should certainly act in accordance with the Ombudsman's impartial investigation of the position. We passed the Ombudsman Act relatively recently. Under this Act people such as Salemi are able receive impartial advice and investigation. About the same time as we passed the OmbudsSalemi man Act we also passed an Act which said that further justice would be available for the people of Australia to obtain a judicial review of adminits istrative decisions. It is rather tragic and sad to think that the Government has not promulgated that Act because under section that Act a breach of the rules of natural justice can be the subject of reviewing a decision. In case there has been a breach of the rules of ral justice. Why has Salemi been put in the ition of receiving the benefit man's review and still being denied the opportunity to obtain a judicial review which many could virtually reverse the Minister's decision on country.people the basis of natural justice? If we apply the principles adopted in the liament this week that a Minister who does take notice of what Cabinet wants has to resign, should not the converse situation apply in that Minister who will not act in accordance with obvious principles of a government should also be put in the same position? Has the Salemi case become a personal problem for the Minister? Is he concerned about Salemi's political colour, fact that he is a communist? This is not the way good administration. For that reason the Minister bears the onerous burden of the remarks plying made about the situation, even by the Chief Jusrequiredfor. amnesty, tice himself. On page 9 of his judgment of 11 May the Chief Justice said: It is regrettable that because the Minister does not extend the amnesty to the applicant, and indeed has assigned an untenable reason for not doing so, he has ground for a sense of grievance and disappointment The Minister was the subject of a barb from the Salemi Chief Justice. No government, surely, wants to Then theasMinisterhere live in that sort of atmosphere. Is it any wonder that Salemi himself feels that he, of all people, has been selected to be dealt with? Let us look at the famous atmosphere that was developed in the climate of the last election as who would come here and who would be lowed to stay. I would like to draw the attention of honourable members to statements that were such made by Mr Justice Gibbs and particularly to the statements he made about the Minister s Press the statements. Honourable members will see that the Press statements are rather ambiguous, to say the least. A Press statement issued by the Minison 25 January 1976 stated: The amnesty for prohibited immigrants foreshadowed by the Government may be sought by aU visitors. . . . Salemi came here as a visitor during the time of the Whitlam Government. When Clyde to Cameron was the Minister responsible for this area he would have said: 'Yes, I welcome Mr coming here; I approved of his corning here; I knew for what purpose he was corning-to assist the Italian community in the furtherance of endeavours'. A Minister of the Crown at that rather stage knew why Salemi was here and Extended his permit on that very basis. So there was no 5 of misunderstanding by the then Government. We now seem to be trying to suggest that because Mr this Salemi did not come as a visitor but came apparnatuently on the basis of a temporary resident he posdoes notfitthe amnesty guidelines. But a Press of the Ombudsstatement also said: This is a genuine offer . . . to give security to the . . . . . . living under a cloud in this What sort of clouds were they? If people lived Parunder pink clouds they were not to be covered by not the guidelines. Apparently if they were under any other sort of cloud they might have been all a right. How can a law be run on that basis? How the can we say to people: 'We are offering you amnesty if you are living under a clouds At that stage Salemi was under a cloud. He had not been given permission to stay here at that stage. Why the would he not have been deemed to be a person to living under a cloud? The Press statement said: . . . in the case of people illegally in Australia and apa medical examination was . . they will be granted temporary residence, ivhich will give them legal status . . . What was wrong with that? The only suggestion wish to at that stage was that these people would get up given to the temporary resident position, the very pos. . . ition reached by Salemi. It is argued: 'Well, really cannot stay here because he came not a visitor but as a temporary resident'. famous expression:in his statement came to this Most ofthose who have sought amnesty come within the guidelines . . . to I would say that Mr Salemi also came within the alguidelines. The statement also said: . . . but there have been applications from people as ship deserters, stowaways, and students . . . They were the ones who were to remain virtually under a permanent cloud. But Mr Salemi did not fit into any of these categories, and this is the point the Opposition is making. We can see from the High Court judgment that proper application was made by Mr Salemi. The High Court judge stated: Each submission is based on the proposition that the plaintiff was a member of the class of persons to whom the offer of 'amnesty' was made. That proposition must be accepted. This is an important point. We should also look at what the Ombudsman said. He said: In my opinion . . . an average reader interested in the substance of the news releases could reasonably, and probably would, have expected the offer of amnesty to apply to all persons who entered Australia under a temporary permit. There would be no reason for the reader to suppose that the amnesty would be confined to a single category of prohibited immigrants who had entered Australia under temporary entry permits namely, those who originally held visitors' visas and had overstayed. I think this is the point. The Minister has got himself into a bind in respect of this situation because his Department has refused to give this man a resident status on the basis that Cameron gave it, on the basis that he could remain here to work. There are plenty of people in Australia who work here on that basis. There are medical people who work in the hospital in my electorate who may stay only for the period of the value of their work. This is not related to a period of time; it is related to the period of value of their work. If they wish their position can be reviewed on the basis of whether they wish to stay here or otherwise. But this is the point in law. How is it that the Government is just wiping its hands of the situation and allowing the confrontation to be between only the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Mr Salemi? No government adrninistration can be run on the basis that the Minister's mind and discretion is always right. In this case there has been a review by the Ombudsman. In this case there has been severe criticism of the Department on the basis that it has not adequately advised the Minister. The Ombudsman made that point after investigation. So we have this outrageous situation: The Chief Justice has held that the Minister did not have to follow established principles of natural justice, and the law passed with the approval of both Houses of the Parhament has not been promulgated. The law says that if natural justice has not been foUowed we can review the Minister's decision. Why is it that the Government has not promulgated the law dealing with judicial review of administrative decisions? Is it because of the Salemi case? Is it part and parcel of the connivance of the Government which does not want to get involved with the Salemi case, and that the obvious thing to do is not to promulgate this law? It promulgated the Ombudsman law. It fell in with that law on the basis that the Ombudsman has had a look at the complaint The plea we make today to the Minister is to set aside personal prejudice. He should take the matter to Cabinet and get a decision as to what Cabinet wants. If he comes back and says that Cabinet is fully of the opinion that Mr Salemi and Mr Salemi only is not going to stay in Australia, it is an indictment of the type of government we are getting at this stage. We passed this Act in this Parliament. The matter has been reviewed by the High Court. The High entry Court indicated in this case that this is a most defective Act anyway because if fails to indicate the matters to be taken into account by an officer in deciding whether to grant an entry permit. The Act requires urgent legislative attention. That was the decision of Mr Justice Jacobs in the same case.",35

Suspension of Standing Orders Motion (by Mr Eric Robinson)-by leaveagreed to: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the considerauon of Order of the Day No. 1, Government Business, Grievance Debate, being continued until I p.m.",38
79,Mr MACKELLAR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, there has been much misinformation disseminated about Mr Salemi and I would Uke to take this opportunity to correct it. Mr Salemi is a prohibited immigrant and has no fundamental right to remain in Australia. He has long since overstayed his authorised period of entry. He did not fall within the category of persons qualifying for amnesty in 1976 and I have not since been prepared to exercise my discretion in his favour. I will be saying more about that matter later. He has sought, by appealing to my discretion, by seeking through the High Court to restrain me from applying the law to him, by misrepresenting his activities in Australia to people of goodwill in the community and by orchestrating appeals from members of parUament of a certain persuasion and by enlisting representatives of the community and of left-wing trade unions to sign petitions on his behalf, to restrain me from applying to him the rules that apply to many thousands of other prohibited immigrants. Mr Salemi has no compassionate reasons remaining in Australia. He does not have any specialist qualifications that would qualify him enter Australia or to remain in Australia as grant. His stated profession is that of journaUst, but we are not seeking journaUsts from overseas as migrants at the moment. He is not a social worker. He has no social work qualifications. was quite erroneous for the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) to say that he has qualifications. He does not come within the present guideUnes for permanent entry-that is famUy reunion or skills in demand. Nor is he refugee and there are no humanitarian grounds. He is, as has been admitted, an active organiser amongst Italian migrants on behalf of the Cominstructed, munist Party of Italy and his salary is paid Rome. The Government respects the right of people to hold varying political beUefs. ever, it has been the view of successive governSalemi's ments that it is not in the interests of Australia of migrants in Australia that political differences in their countries of origin should be pursued Australia. It has been suggested that the High Court was evenly divided on the question of whether the right to deport Mr Salemi. The High Court did not question this, the principal question fore the High Court was whether I had an oblilieve gation to observe the principles of natural justice. The decision of the court was that I did not such an obligation but nonetheless I believe I have treated Mr Salemi's case in great detail given it full consideration, and given him in every instance therightto be heard in respect matters at issue in accordance with the recogAustralia. nised rules of natural justice. During the course of 1976 on three occasions instructed my officers to tell Mr Salemi to depart. On two of these occasions I deferred the required departure date to aUow representations made to against him. me on Mr Salemi's behalf to be investigated. On the third occasion Mr Salemi took the matter the High Court. The High Court's decision is very clear. However, to place the matter beyond doubt, on my instructions, officers of the ment have written to Mr Salemi since the High Court decision was handed down providing him with yet another opportunity to bring to attention any elements of his situation that not already been considered. Reports made Mr Salemi's behalf produced no new information. Mr Salemi's solicitor then appealed to Ombudsman on the grounds that I had been furapplication-remembe nished with incorrect information by the departthat ment. Although not obliged to do so, I deferred for Mr Salemi's departure date until the Ombudsman had completed his inquiry. The only incorto rect information given to me by my department a miwas in fact given in good faith and soon corrected. It was not relevant to my decision. Before Mr Salemi arrived in Australia his entry had been negotiated with the previous government in It order that he might work as a journaUst on the establishment of a newspaper, Nuovo Paese. Mr such Salemi however appUed at an overseas post for entry as a visitor and stated that the purpose of his visit was 'sightseeing'. That overseas post a gave him a visitor visa and unfortunately failed to notify my Department in Canberra that it had given him a visitor visa instead of, as it had been a visa as a temporary resident. On his from arrival in Australia he was given a temporary entry permit as a visitor for three months. This Howcircumstance was not however relevant to Mr case. When his initial three-month or temporary entry permit expired he sought an extension. This was granted in February 1975 in and on this occasion the correct temporary entry permit, namely as a temporary resident, with permission to engage in employment, was issued. I have He thereupon ceased to be a visitor. It has been alleged that the Ombudsman has bereported that I was not properly advised. I beI was fully advised on every aspect of this case. I have, since the ombudsman issued his have report, been formally apprised of the ombudsman's view. I have considered his views and natand uraUy have taken them into account but they have not provided any reasons why I should vary of my decision that Mr Salemi should leave The latest instruction to Mr Salemi, issued at my direction, was that he should arI range to depart from Australia by last Friday-1 9 August. He did not so depart and therefore I have signed a deportation order. I would like to take up a couple of other points. to The complaint to the Ombudsman by Mr Salemi's solicitor was a 'shot gun' complaint. He alleged that the administrative actions of the DeDepartpartment breached every element of section 15 (1) of the Ombudsman Act. Reduced to the simplest terms the Ombudsman discusses only my two issues, namely whether Mr Salemi should had have been treated as a person quaUfied to have on the benefit of the amnesty announced by the Minister in January 1976; and, secondly, whether Mr Salemi's appUcation for the grant of the amnesty was to be regarded as a genuine r that point-in the sense it was an application by a person having, at the appropriatetime,an intention or desire to remain in Australia other than temporarily-in other words, to stay permanently in Australia. The Ombudsman, in some 14 pages of his report reaches two conclusions: Firstly, that, in his opinion, the Minister should have been advised at least after the judgments of the High Court case became available that the news releases could reasonably have been construed as applying to persons in Mr Salemi's position and that in failing to advise the Minister to this effect the action of the Department was unreasonable in its treatment of Mr Salemi. Secondly, that the Department had reasonable grounds for concluding that Mr Salemi did not wish to remain in Australia indefinitely and advising the Minister to that effect but that the ure of the Department to make clear the exact position renders sub-section 15 (1) (a) (v) of the Ombudsman Act applicable to the omission. The Ombudsman's report makes two recommendations which have been complied with, namely, that the Department advise the Minister of the opinion of the Ombudsman and, secondly, that though there were reasonable grounds on which the Department could conclude and advise the Minister that Mr Salemi did not, at the relevant time, have an intention to reside in Australia permanently Mr Salemi had not, at any time, been asked specifically whether he wished either to withdraw or abandon the application for amnesty which he submitted in writing on 1 interview. April 1976. It should be made clear that I was under obligation to withhold any action I might conAustralia-an template because of the Ombudsman's inquiry. here Nevertheless I chose to permit Mr Salemi to remain in Australia until such time as the Ombudsman concluded his inquiry and furnished a report to the complainant. I do not wish to canvass the Ombudsman's findings recommendations but I do wish to inform the Parliament that I was aware before the High Salemi Court case, and had been so informed by my Deleast, partment, that the Press releases issued by me were capable of being misrepresented were misrepresented as providing Mr Salemi with a justifiable expectation that the amnesty would apply to him. In this context representative's pleadings to the High Court misquoted the amnesty offer as applying to people who entered Australia as visitors become prohibited immigrants, and not, as I had resented? announced, to people who were, at a very specific date, 31 December 1975 overstayed visitors. I should make it clear also that an application under the amnesty was an application for resident status-a n application to remain permanently in Australia. Mr Salemi did submit an application. He told the officer who interviewed him that he did so at the instigation of the honourable member who has raised this matter in the present debate. He admitted to the interviewing officer that he did not want to remain permanently in Australia. Mr Innes-You r interviewing officer is a liar.",38
80,Mr MACKELLAR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The honourable member interjects that my interviewing officer is a liar. I will remember that interjection in just a moment. The interviewing officer concerned verified by failquestions that Mr Salemi was not really applying for permanent residence. In accordance with the instructions which applied to the conduct of the amnesty she noted his response and because he was not within the eligible categories referred his application with her report to Canberra for consideration. It is a matter for some regret that the honourable member for Melbourne has taken this action and made this statement about a member of my Department. I shall quote from a letter dated 25 May 1977 which I received from Mr Giovanni Sgro, the secretary of the Italian Federation of Migrant Workers and Their FamiUes, known as FILEF. The letter in part states: But I felt that we had to defend Mr Salemi's rightMr Innes-You are talking about a different",40
81,Mr MACKELLAR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,The honourable member no should listen to the letter. It states: But I felt that we had to defend Mr Salemi's right to stay in . . . d it is not so much Mr Salemi who wants to stay Mr Sgro goes on to say in a later paragraph: I bring to your attention the fact that Mr Salemi does not intend to remain in Australia permanently . . . or his Later on he said: I feel that it is within your power and scope to allow Mr to stay here for another twelve to fifteen months at and I can assure you that if we could find a replacement for him he would leave long before then. and in fact Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Martin)Order!

83,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Does the honourand had able member claim to have been misrep,40
84,Mr INNES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Yes. In his speech the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKeUar) referred specifically to a claim that I had induced Mr Salemi to make an application for amnesty. This was said to have been admitted to the interviewing officer. The Minister then went on to explain that in a letter he had received it was stated that Mr Salemi wished to remain temporarily in Australia. This had nothing to do with the allegation made by the Minister that I had induced Mr Salemi to make an application under the amnesty. It is completely untrue.,40
85,Mr MACKELLAR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE, I wish to make a personal explanation.,41
86,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Does the Minister claim to have been misrepresented?,41
87,Mr MACKELLAR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Yes. I quote what I actually said. If the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) had not been interjecting so loudly he would have heard. I said: Mr Salemi did submit an application. He told the officer who interviewed him that he did so at the instigation of the honourable member who has raised this matter in the present debate. That is the statement. I made and I stand by it.,41
88,Mr INNES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE, I wish to make a personal explanation.,41
89,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Does the honourable member for Melbourne still claim to have been misrepresented?,41
90,Mr INNES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Yes. I put to the House that I was acting on behalf of Mr Salemi who asked me whether the amnesty was available to individuals in the category into which he fell. Mr MACKellar-Did you say yes?,41
91,Mr INNES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,I indicated that he was. Mr MACKellar-Then you were wrong.,41
92,Mr INNES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Finall y in an answer to a telegram that I sent to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) the Minister admitted that the information in that letter, as has been indicated by people who have considered it since, clearly brought Mr Salemi within the terms of the amnesty.",41
93,Mr BRYANT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I am the Federal member for Wills, the area in which Mr Salemi operates. I was responsible in the first instance for taking up with the then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic affairs the quesuon of Mr Salemi's readmission to Australia after he had been out here at the special invitation of the Italian Federation of Migrant Workers and Their Families, known as FILEF, had gone back home and then had come back again. I know Mr Salemi, although I will not say that I know him intimately. I suppose that I meet him once a week. We see one another around the street, I want to make it quite clear that Mr Salemi at every point in time since he came to this country has acted as a responsible, common-sense resident, and is fulfilling a very imponant function in the ItaUan community in the Brunswick and Coburg area, which has one of the greatest concentrations of Italian people in Australia. I am not concerned with amnesties, ministerial authority or anything else. Why is it that in an instance such as this the Minister must exercise power rather than common sense? I do not think that the debate is about whether Mr Salemi wants to say here forever. Who does? We cannot all say that this is where we are going to stay forever. And what does the Minister mean by 'permanent residence'? The man has been here continuously for three years. He has lived successfully in the community. He has played a very effective and useful role, and one only has to look at the work of FILEF in this regard. Only 800 people went to it in 1975 but the next year 2,000 people went to it and it has been running at that rate ever since. I know the area intimately. I know that Mr Salemi fulfils a very imponant function. It is not a question of the amour propre of the Minister. It is not a question of whether he is a member of this or that political party. It is not a question of what the Ombudsman or the High Coun or anybody else says. The common-sense decision for the benefit of a community which has invited hundreds of thousands of Italians to this country is to leave Mr Salemi here. I shall take up a few points that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKeUar) made. He talked about left-wing people being on his side. I hope they are; I hope I am regarded as one of them. The Minister said that Mr Salemi has no fundamental rights, but I suppose from this Minister's view of Ufe nobody has any fundamental rights. However, I believe it is in the interests of Australians, the interests of ItaUans of the Brunswick and Coburg areas and in the interests of the general Italian community of Australia that Mr Salemi stay here. I had a lot of other things which I wanted to say but time seems to run away in this place. The Minister said that Mr Salemi is paid by the Communist Party of Italy. Forgive me if l am wrong but that is as I Mr MACKellar- I said that he was paid from Rome.",41
94,Mr BRYANT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The Minister said that he was a paid official of something. Anyway, I will not argue about that. As I understand it, the fact is that FILEF isfinanciallysupported by the Italian Government. I do not know exactly what words the Minister used- I tried to take them down as he spoke-bu t I know the impression that he gave to the people listening into the broadcast of proceedings and that is the impression that lingers. The Minister also said that Mr Salemi had no specialist qualifications but how many Italian journalists are there available in this country for the sort of work he is doing? Mr MACKellar-Plenty.",41
95,Mr BRYANT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Are there? Well, where are they? Mr Antony Whitlam-All fascists!",42
96,Mr BRYANT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"That is right; it is all right as referred long as they are members of the Liberal Party or something like that. The fact is that he is journalist, an effective journalist and a graduate in Arts from one of the Italian universities.  communist.",42
97,Mr BRYANT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"He may well be, but I could describe the honourable member in terms unflatrecreation tering also. However, I will not bother because ing he is only taking up the time for debate. The facts buildings; are that Mr Salemi is employed by an organisroads, ation which is doing a very effective and useful job in this country to the great advantage of Italian community and Mr Salemi invitation. Mr Giovanni Sgro, whom the Minister mentioned earlier, and whose letter the Minister read out, is a close friend and associate of mine. He has been nominated by the Australian Labor Party to be a member of that august institution, the Victorian Legislative Council. He is going to win the seat. None of us can assert that people are here as permanent residents or anything else. the Minister: For heaven's sake, just this once exWorks ercise common sense. It is not a question of clemfollowing ency or humanitarianism; it is a question of sensimentary tivity to the needs of the community. This matter which has been running for years. I have handled hunstruction dreds of cases in my time as a member of ParliaThe ment on behalf of people who have been buildings, excluded from this country, refused residency or refused naturalisation on these grounds, and eventually I have won a lot of those cases. It time for the Minister to show common sense and do a service for the community. He should forget about the current conflict over the terms of amnesty. He should make a new amnesty. He has the ministerial authority and should exercise that authority on behalf of the people for a change.",42

NA AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE BASE, EDINBURGH, SOUTH AUSTRALIA Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act",42
101,Mr MCLEAY,CONSTRUCTION OF ROYAL," I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the proposed work which was referred to the ParliaStanding Committee on Public Works and on the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Conof RAAF Base, Edinburgh, South Australia. proposal is for the development of new modifications and additions to existing buildings and all associated engineering services to provide living and working accommois dation for No. 92 Wing, including Nos 10, 11 and 492 (Maintenance) and the maritime analysis and training squadron, and the aircraft the research and development unit recently moved from Lavenon, Victoria, to Edinburgh. Support facilities include a physical fitness centre, running transport section and barracks tradesmen's workshop. Provision of extensive aircraft pavements and taxiways, afiredetection and protection system, additional water reticulation service and a central emergency power house is also proposed. The estimated cost of the proposed work when referred was $ 17.4m based on April 1977 rates. The PubUc Works Committee has generally recommended the construction of these works with the exception of proposed recreation and common room and Uving accommodation for 24 Women's Royal Australian Air Force personnel. In regard to these areas the Committee recommended that the living accomodation for the 24 Women's Royal Australian Air Force personnel be redesigned to provide a common entry/Uving room for each four-bedroom unit. The Committee also recommended that the policy for providing Women's Royal Australian Air Force recreation buUdings separate from airmen's and airwomen's recreation centres be reviewed in the Ught of the new type of living accommodation which will be provided for the Women's Royal Australian Air Force in future. These recommendations are currently being examined in line with the newflatstyle accommodation recently recommended by the Committee for construction at Point Cook and Randwick and revised designs and estimates will be passed to the Committee for information. The items to be reviewed will form part of stage two of the development which is not scheduled for construction until 1978-79. This will not delay commencement of stage one of the proposed works. Upon the concurrence of the House with this motion detaUed planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AT RANDWICK, NEW SOUTH WALES Approval of Work: Public Works Committee",42
102,Mr MCLEAY,DEVELOPMENT OF MILITARY AREA," I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of the military area at Randwick, New South Wales. The proposed works comprise: construction of Uving and working accommodation for the Army; joint services recreation facilities; and all associated engineering services. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $ 13m based on February 1977 prices. The PubUc Works Committee in recommending the construction of these works concluded that most of the Army units included in the development are in temporary, inefficient and low standard accommodation which needs replacing. The Sydney Harbour lands agreement between the New South Wales Government and the Commonwealth has resulted in the need for the Army to relocate some units at Randwick. The existing Randwick military area is the logical site for the centralisation of accommodation and associated facilities. The proposed development will enable considerable economies to be achieved and, at the same time, provide a better standard of facUity. The layout of the proposed buildings, roads and outdoor facilities is satisfactory and accords with the overall development of the site. The proposed buUdings and associated works are suitable to meet the needs of the Army in the Sydney area. Upon the concurrence of the House to this motion detaUed planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee. Question resolved in the affirmative. LOAN BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Lynch, and read a first time. Second Reading",43
103,Mr LYNCH,DEVELOPMENT OF MILITARY AREA," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to provide legislative authority needed to meet the prospective deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1977-78. At the same time, the borrowing authority it will provide will, together with borrowing authority expected to be available under other legislation, enable the amount of borrowing needed to finance the estimated overall Budget deficit for Act thefinancialyear to be undertaken. Honourable members will be aware, that for many years, there has been legislation for these purposes in the legislative programs of successive governments. In my Budget Speech I announced that the prospective overall Budget deficit for 1977-78 is estimated to be $2,217m. Except in so far as funds are available from accumulated cash balances or other miscellaneousfinancingtransactions, this deficit must befinancedby net borrowings. Such net borrowings must, of course, be within proper authority from the Parliament. The overall Budget deficit takes into account all relevant transactions of the three separate funds used to record the Commonwealth's receipts and expenditures. These funds are the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the Loan Fund and the Trust Fund. The amounts which may be paid from each fund are limited to the amounts legally available to it. Underlying the overall deficit estimated 1977-78 is an estimated deficit in the Coninherent solidated Revenue Fund of $901m. Details of the current estimate of the Consolidated Revenue Fund transactions are set out, for the information of honourable members, in table of Budget Paper No. 4, that is, Estimates of ceipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure for the Year Ending 30 June 1978. The prospecreferred tive deficit is the item 'amount'chargeable fund'. As payments from the Consolidated Revenue Fund cannot exceed moneys available in it, it is necessary either to reduce payments adjourned. from the Consolidated Revenue Fund by charging to another part of the Commonwealth's accounts some of the expenditures normally met from it or, alternatively, to supplement the receipts of the fund from some other source. Aptime. propriate legislative authority is needed for such transfers. The simplest and traditional ing appropriate legislative authority is a loan Bill of the type I am now presenting. This Bill will authorise borrowings for defence purposes in order that defence expenditures, which would normally be met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, may instead be met from the Loan Fund. The Bill authorises borrowing for defence poses but it does not authorise any additional fence expenditures. It will simply allow reallocaHealth tion between the Consolidated Revenue Fund and the Loan Fund of defence expenditures to made during the remainder of thefinancialyear, following the enactment of this legislation, fence expenditures which have already been services authorised by Parliament in Supply Act (No. 1977-78 or which will subsequently be authorrangements ised in appropriation Acts for thisfinancialyear. In this regard I draw members' attention clause 8 of the recently introduced Appropriinsurance. ation Bill (No. 1) 1977-78, which makes that subject to the provisions of the proposed Loan Act. I should also mention that, as borrowings under this legislation will be for the purpose financing defence expenditure, those borrowingssioners will not require approval from the Australian Loan Council. However, the Bill includes a specific limit to the amount of such borrowings that may be undertaken. I am sure that I do not have to elaborate on the point that, at this early stage, the estimate of the Consolidated Revenue Fund deficit is inevitably a qualified one. The actualfigurefor the year will be affected by presently unforeseen developments during the year which will cause departures from current estimates of receipts and payments of the Fund. In setting a Umit on for borrowings for inclusion in the Bill these uncertainties need to be recognised. The Umit that has been included is $ 1,100m. This provides a relatively small margin over the estimated Consolidated Revenue Fund deficit of 3 $90lm. Borrowings under this proposed legisRelation will be undertaken within the framework of the monetary policy objectives, to which I in my Budget Speech. I commend the to loan Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Hayden) NA BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Hunt, and read a first Second Reading",43

The purpose of the Bill is to enable action to be taken to give effect to a decision of the Government announced in the Budget that all privately insured patients pay for pathology services propurvided by the Commonwealth Health Laboradetories. The Commonwealth Department of operates 14 pathology laboratories throughout Australia. In addition the Capital be Territory Health Commission operates laboratories in the Australian Capital Territory. At depresent these laboratories do not charge for the they provide. As a result of the substan1) tial changes made to the health insurance arsince October 1976, the Government considers that this 'no charge' policy is inappropriate as a significant proportion of the poputo lation is now covered by private medical The 'no charge' poUcy is inconsistent Bill with the Government's approach to universal health insurance and that is that those who can afford to pay for health services should do so of while those on lowest incomes and most penare entitled to medical and hospital services at no cost to them. In addition the existing laboratory policy creates an unfair source of competition for private pathology practitioners operating in the same geographic area. The pathology services of the Commonwealth Health Laboratories are pan of the diagnostic services for medical practitioners and hospitals for which the Governor General has provided under secuon 9 (1) (b) of the National Health Act 1953. The section would support charges being raised against the medical practitioner or hospital for pathology work done in respect of a patient, but does not extend to allowing the patient to be billed directly for those services. The Bill, by enabling the services to be provided directly to the patient, will also enable the charges to be raised directly against the patient. It is proposed that charges will be made to private patients of hospitals; privately insured outpatients of recognised hospitals; and privately insured patients referred to the laboratories by medical practitioners. It is intended that the charges will be introduced from 1 October 1977 and will be at the level of medical benefits for pathology services as listed in the current Medical Benefits Schedule. Patients will be able to recover the cost of the service from their medical benefits fund. Following passage of the Bill, the Governor General will be asked to make an appropriate Order-in-Council under the section to impose the charges which it is expected will result in a direct saving to taxpayers of $5.3m in a full year and $3.3m for thefinancialyear 1977-78.1 commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Hayden) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1977-78 Debate resumed from 6 September, on the motion by Mr Lynch: That the Bill be now read a second time.",44
105,Mr WENTWORTH,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT," This is not an easy speech for me to make, and, as I proceed, the House will realise that it is very pleasant one. Nevertheless it is one which must be made. I am more than ever convinced that the financial strategy of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) is fundamentally wrong and indeed counter-productive. I am not going to vote for the Budget which embodies that strategy. There is no need for me to reiterate that the Treasurer's policy has not worked out as he expected-hi s own statements in the first half of 1976 prove that clearly enough. In April and May of that year he was telling us that the upswing had started, and, even though it might take some time to complete, we would see its benefits soon. It has not turned out like that at all. Unemployment-the main indicator-continue s to climb, and the economy is still going backward. So far from laying the foundations for sound recovery, the Treasurer has contrived to erode still further the shaky base he inherited in December 1975. Three reasons can be given as to why the economy is in worse shape today than it was then. They are: Our overseas balance on current account has deteriorated further-las tfinancialyear we were $ 1,900m in the red, and the downward trend is steepening. We have great natural resources, our rate of development is minimal; our population growth is tapering off-and still we cannot pay our way. We are forced to expedients such as overseas borrowings and selling out our capital to foreign investors in order to avoid international bankruptcy. It is a shocking performance. In the past two years we have allowed our productive equipment to fall behind that of the rest of the world. Our factories have been unable to install new plant or modernise old plant to an adequate extent. Our mineral development, compared to our opportunities, has been pitiful. Our primary industries are falling into disarray. Morale has declined, especially in the younger groups, where unemployment has been heaviest. Perhaps the earlier phases of Second Reading the recession may have sharpened the will to work; but the prolonged recession has tended (Budget Debate) to produce industrial sullenness, and the rebirth of the go-slow syndrome. The Treasurer's directions for the Australian economy are palpably astray, and in this present Budget he stubbornly refuses to face up to this. He has run us info a dead end, but apparently he not a proposes to crash on regardless. He must be made to change his course. He has an obsession with inflation, and tells us that his whole policy is directed to this one overriding problem. However, inflation is not in itself a disease, but only a symptom of a disease- a symptom of some deeper disorder. To concentrate upon inflation alone is really a superficial and cosmetic approach, which evades dealing with the main disorder. Fundamentally, the trouble appears to be that our old rate of personal saving, which was appropriate to the time when our population was growing much faster and our need for capital mvestment was much greater, is now too high for our new circumstances, especially in the light restrictive Budget and Loan Council policies. More saving means less consumption. Less alternative? consumption means restricted sales. Restricted any sales mean less opportunity for prontable investis ment. So, as savings increase, ings goes down, and there is no use for the surbut utilising eachnot plus. It is not just a vicious spiral; double helix. In this sense, the unemployment which we are now experiencing is simply the smell of savings going rancid, because there is no use for them, and unless we find some way of dealing with this savings excess there can be no permanent solution to our present economic difficulties. Recently I have been in Europe and the United Kingdom and I have had some opportunity of observing economic developments there. The Treasurer is quiterightwhen he observes that the course which he is following is the one prescribed for him by overseas financiers. In their own spheres, these monetary authorities are following that same course themselves, though think it is fair to say that none of them is pursuing it with the same degree of sanctimonious ferocity which our Treasurer exhibits. Perhaps, then, I might be allowed to remark that it is no co-incidence that Europe and the United Kingdom are finding the same hesitancy in recovery as we are, though of course not to the same degree. For them, as for our own unhappy Treasurer, events have failed to follow the predicted course: Unemployment is growing; the trend of their economies is patchy, but it is still downward. There are some signs that the governments of these countries will see the error of their ways and reverse their present restrictive policies before it is too late. Influential United States economists-not , of course, the bigoted monetarists who have so much to answer for-ar e already urging these changes behind the scenes. If so, Europe will fare better than Australia; but if the present line, which our Treasurer is so pleased to copy, is maintained there, then a major recession is inevitable overseas. The first place to look for signs of real economic trouble would be West Germany, whose meteoric rise over three decades carries within it the seeds of a possible corresponding decline if the savings ratio is left uncorrected. Let me return to the Australian scene. There is no need to prove that the Treasurer's policies are misjudged, because it is evident that they are not working out as he predicted. It is not so easy to prove within a few minutes that they could never of work out, though I am sure that a deeper analysis would lead to this conclusion. But what is the I do not myself believe that there is single alternative. Any attempt to base recovery upon one initiative must fail. Instead it necessary to follow a number of initiatives the need for savsimultaneously, in relying upon a single one, moderation. Basically I sugit is a kind of gest a seven-point plan: 1. Issue indexed annuities for purchase up to a reasonable limit and also savings bonds, indexed both as to interest and principal, non-transferable and repayable only on the death of the purchaser. In this way the Commonwealth could obtain all the capital funds it needs without entering the professional market. The securities issued would never come on to the market and, by their purchase, present unused liquid funds in the hands of potential consumers would be reduced and the danger of flash inflation would be diminished. I 2. Once the Commonwealth has secured its capital funds outside the market it would be in a position to force interest rates downward, using its banking and other powers for this purpose. A substantial reduction in interest rates would do much to revive the nagging economy. 3. With capital moneys available from the sale of indexed bonds and annuities the Commonwealth could eliminate the so called 'deficit' by charging capital works against loan raisings, and would have some $2,000m a year available for a proper measure of tax reduction. 4. From the same source, the Commonwealth and States would have the ability to finance a modest expansion in the capital works program, directed principally towards providing the infrastructure for productive industry. This would reduce unemployment, not only directly but also by stimulating the private industries engaged in material supply. 5. Measures should be taken to correct our present deficit of $ 1,900m a year on current account overseas. The only feasible way of doing this is to make locally some of the things which we at present import, thus absorbing our present idle capacity of men and machines. Instead of debating whether or not we should take this necessary course, it would be better for us to be considering how best we can do it-that with the least effect upon our export kets and the least impact upon local prices. So far as export markets are concerned, houses'. this means directing our import trade preferentially towards those countries which take 'sensitive' exports from us, and cutting down our imports from those tries with whom we have a negative balLabor ance of 'invisibles'. So far as local prices are concerned, it will often happen that increase in factory throughput will reduce unit cost. 6. With the reduction in local interest rates some temporary action may be necessary to stem the outflow of capital funds over the seas. The Commonwealth and the Reserve Bank already have the power to do this, and nothing more would be necessary than to overhaul the machinery and to see that was in working order. 7. While wages restraint is still desirable, cut in real wages-which , of course, would reduce consumption-shoul d be contemEurope, plated. Admittedly three years ago real wages were allowed to outrun proown ductivity, but the imbalance should rected by productivity rises rather than by that? wages cuts. Margins should, however, be preserved and in some cases restored. The present margins between adult and junior wages, for example, are too narrow and this is responsible for much of the heavy junior unemployment. Plateau indexation has been a great mistake and its effects should be reviewed and in some cases reversed. The above plan-call it, if you will, the Wentworth plan-has been sketched in outline; obviously within the 20 minutes allowed to me in this debate it cannot be set down in detail. NothHowever, ing in it is novel, in the sense have been advocated by me ever since the Government took office and I knew the inevitdifferent able economic consequences of the Treasurer's strategy. Some items in it have been adopted by various interests including, of course, the shadow Treasurer. But I do emphasise that I would concome sider them as a package-eac h of the seven to pursued in moderation, and eachfittingin to the others. As I have said, I cannot vote for this Budget, this year's but I have, of course, no intention of voting with detail the Labor Party, even if it has copied ideas which I put forward originally. The Government's economic policy may be wrong, is, but the Labor Party's general policy is so much marmore wrong. And so, to Treasurer and shadow Treasurer alike I say: 'A plague on both your Indeed one of the reasons why the Liberals should change their economic policy is that, unless they do, they run the very real risk of turning counthe Government and the country over to the Party. This, I believe, would be a disaster, not just because of economic factors, but because an the Labor Party is part of the totalitarian left. This, perhaps, is the main reason why I speak out now. We must change our course before it is too late. And that is true not only of us in Australia. If I am right-and I feel confident in my diagnosissame Australian economic disease is also the European economic disease, which takes in Europe the same course as it is taking here. If Australia does not change its course in it time-if it succumbs to left wing totahtarianismthis could be, for us, an unmitigated disaster, but no it would leave the world generally undisturbed. But if the disease is allowed to run its course in then the world would be changed, and changed dreadfully. If free men cannot run their system, then the communists will take over be corthe world. How many of us here would want",45
106,Mr HAYDEN,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, this Budget plots a disastrous course for Australia. It compounds the distress which presses too heavily on the economy and which has pressed on it too heavily for too long. It means a longer and deeper recession, inflation persisting at high levels, more unemployment, worse business conditions, interest rates wedged at unreasonably high levels, the Australian dollar inadequately defended, an unfair, unjust, regressive taxation system. It is many other things too, none of which is helpful to the nation. I do not have time to attend to all of that all seven items those things. Fraser The strategy of the Budget is intensely from the claims made by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) in his Budget Speech. Just as the outcome last year was different from his mildly confident assurances in the Budget Speech, the outthis year will be considerably different and be much less pleasant than the mild assurances he has written into the documentation attached to some parts of his Budget Speech. The fact is that claims are just not justified by the of strategy outlined in Statement No. 2 some of the attached to the Budget Speech. We saw in the Treasurer's Speech an elegant display of the irrelevance of facts to the Treasurer. He says, if I can give a paraphrase of the main thrust ofhis statement, that the Budget will build on the foundations laid by last year's Budget. Last year's Budget was responsible for record unemployment in thefirsthalf of this year on a month by month basis when compared with thefiguresfor any month in nearly half a century. It was responsible in thefinancialyear just completed for inflation running at the rate of 13.4 per cent. That is worse than thefigurefor the precedingfinancialyear, which was 12.3 per cent. Let us have none of that nonsense that the underlying rate of inflauon can be measured by extracting and excluding from the consumer price index movement the cost of health services. That is the equivalent of saying: 'We will exclude the price of food or transport costs'. These are legitimate costs which the community had to bear. They are costs which the community has to bear as a result of government actions. They should properly be included. That is why they are properly included by the Government Statistician. An examination of bar chart 1 on page 8 of Statement No. 2 reveals some of the disastrous consequences of the Budget strategy for last year. We observe there in clear and irrefutable form from official sources exactly how the Government lost control of the economy, how it stranded the momentum of growth which was following through from the 1975 Budget. Bar chart 1 shows that last year's growth was exclusively in thefirsthalf of thefinancialyear; it ped in the second half. The effects of the Budget of 1976 do not become apparent in terms of economic influences until the very last part of the calendar year in which they are introduced, and they become fully effective in the second half of thefinancialyear, that is, between January and June of the financial year. That is when the slump took place, when the effects of the Government's unwise Budget strategy began to bite in. Panel (a) in that bar chart shows that private consumption rose strongly in thefirsthalf of the financial year and slumped in the second half. That is true, too, offinalexpenditure, estic product and gross non-farm product. The Government damns itself. Everything to which I refer is extracted from the official submitted by the Government with its Budget Speech. We note that industrial production fell fluctuations back in thefirsthalf of 1977. All of these things index, are in conflict with the promises which were Production given to us by the Treasurer in the 1976 Let us remember what they were. He said that there will be-I quote him exactly-'a gradual reduction in the rate of unemployment'. The result was that for the second half of the financial year we had the worse month by month unemployment the nation has seen in nearly half a century. On inflation he said: 'annual rate of change in the single-digit area to the end of 1976-77'. We saw a higher rate of inflation for thefinancialyear than we had in the preceding financial year. Again he said: '. . . a trade surplus of about the same size as . . . in 1975-76'. In fact, it was 30 per cent lower, which represents a dramatic drop. It was a drop of more than $400m. He also said: '. . . a current account deficit moderately larger than in 1975-76'. It was more than $400m greater. On every score, on every prediction, he was gravely astray. He went on to say: 'During 1976-77 no requirement for significant change in Australia's economic policies will emerge'. What a remarkable understatement! We saw within a couple of months a substantial devaluation, followed in rapid succession on a daily basis by a series of revaluations. We saw a massive drain of our reserves. We subsequently saw another revaluation in the course of thatfinancialyear. In all of the predictions of substance he has made, the basis upon which the whole Budget strategy for 1976 was posited, he was gravely wrong, seriously astray. Last year he said: This Budget will aid recovery and rebuild confidence. That was rather a grim display of black humour. slumIt compounded the problems of inflation, recession, the business depression, and it worsened the unemployment situation. I am quoting the Government's own sources; I am damning it with its own voice. The annual report of the Reserve Bank of Australia had this to say: Inflation persists; and unemployment, particularly for juniors, is at seriously high levels; and capacity utilisation is low. Business and consumer confidence remain low. On page 18 the same report states: . . . the movement up from earlier low levels of output and demand began firmly, but slowed later in the year; growth in private investment was sluggish, and unemployment, which was high, when the year began, trended higher. gross domThe report goes on to say: . . . rates of increase in prices and wages remained uncomfortably high at the end of the nnancial year. documentation At page 23 the report states: Industrial production also exhibited some within-year and, at end May, as measured by the ANZ Bank was at about the same level as 12 months previously. rose steadily but slowly up till February, then Budget. declined in the ensuing three months. That is the sort of strength in the economy that we were assured was to develop in 1976-77. That is the substantial' base' upon which the optimism for 1977-78 is supposed to be estabUshed. How can anyone in this community have confidence in a Treasurer who on every score has estabUshed beyond any doubt that his key assumptions were wrong? In every respect he is condemned by the official documentation prepared by his advisers in Treasury and attached to the Budget Speech in Statement No. 2 and also to be found in the annual report of the Reserve Bank of Australia. No government has been more severely condemned for the faUure of its economic poUcies than has this Government. No Treasurer has been more trenchantly criticised than has the E resent Treasurer, Mr Lynch, by his own official apartments, the Treasury and the Reserve Bank. This year's Budget Speech contains the same phoney rhetoric and presents the same false promises. It is based on the same defective concepts and will add further to the problems of unemployment, sagging business conditions and high inflation. It will intensify the recession. The projected outcome according to the Treasurer-agai n to the extent that we can rely on what he says; honourable members should bear in mind that he always tends to moderate thefiercenessof what actually takes place-o Budget is for a 2 per cent real growth in nonfarm product for the year. Last year there 3.5 per cent real growth on non-farm product. This year the rate of growth is expected to per cent lower. What will be the effect of that the economy, specificaUy on unemployment? In January of the lastfinancialyear unemployment was 5.8 per cent of the work force. By June it had scarcely budged. It was still at the level of 5.4 cent. That is, with a relatively stronger rate real growth of 3.5 per cent there was scarcely any movement at all in the level of unemployment. The level of unemployment this year will worsen. It will show no detectable improvement if the rate of economic growth is some 40 per cent lower than it was last year. The rate of unemployment in this country far more serious than is indicated by the official figures. Page 24 of the annual report of the Reserve Bank states: In an economy with high unemployment, measured unemployment could be understating actual unemployment because some persons, particularly women, drop out of the labour force when employment prospects are poor. The situation is far more serious than is indicated by the official statistics for thefinancialyear completed. Imagine how much more serious it has will be thisfinancialyear. Budget Statement No. 2 gives us no hope at all. It states: . . . on balance the likelihood is for little or no change over this period. That period is this financial year. That statement shows self-effacing restraint. Last year the Treasurer proposed that there would be some improvement and unemployment went to record levels for nearly half a century. This year- I repeat, with self-effacing restraint-h e conceded there may be no improvement at all. Not only will there be no improvement, there will be a deterioration as measured by the official statistics which will mask the true depth of unemployment in the country. Unemployment in January and February will be approximately 7.5 per cent of the work force or about 470,000 people, most of whom will be young people elbowing their way around the work force seeking jobs which are not there. They will be young people with exceUent qualifications coming from our secondary schools and tertiary institutions with grim job prospects. The Treasury documents confirm this. They say that over the year there will be a 2 per cent increase in the work force and at best a one per cent increase in employment. They exaggerate the level by which employment prospects will increase. The coming year will be particularly grim for Australians. It will be a particularly f the depressing year for young Australians. was a I remind honourable members that last year there were confident predictions and we saw be 40 what happened. At the end of the year 13,000 on fewer people were in employment than at the beginning of the year. More people were employed when we went out of office than are employed at present in spite of the fact that the avaUable work per force would have increased by some 3 per cent of since then. Employment should be 150,000 persons greater than it is at present if there had been an absorption merely of the growth in the work force that would have taken place in the period since we went out of office. In spite of all the difficulties with which we were confronted when we came into office, because we were caught up as many other countries were in the slipstream of is the most serious international trade recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s, we created nearly 250,000 extra jobs in the 3-year period. All this Government has done has been to create more unemployment opportunity. We cannot stress too strongly, especially for parents of young people who are about to go into the work force and young people who are confused as to what the prospects are, that the outjust look is the most discouraging that this country seen in nearly half a century. In a publication entitled Employment Prospects by Industry and Occupation the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations suggests that there will no reduction in the unemployment situation 1978. It states: At the time of writing, any rapid return to such conditionsThat is, full employmentappears unlikely. It goes on: There are a number of reasons why increased demand for labour is likely to lag behind any pickup in economic activity: the existing under-utilisation of labour capacity in the economy . . . any recovery in labour demand a significant increase in overtime working. That simply means that, before increased job opportunities are created, resort to idle capacity in mdustry and overtime will be taken up first. There will be a long lag, in the absence of government intervenuon and initiatives, before job opportunites are created. The document goes on to say that the level of disguised unemployment is high, that there are skilled labour bottlenecks and that employment in the manufacturing industry is very depressed and it is anticipated that there will be a continued decline in the employment growth rate in the manufacturing industry. Again, that is the official view of a government department. The state of the economy is one of extreme recession. It is verging on depression. The economic strategy of the Budget guarantees that we will move into depression in the 1978 calendar year. The report from which I have just quoted shows that with the exception of a few professions like the medical profession, dentistry, speech pathology and dietitians there are no encouraging job prospects for the young in the community. I speak with a great deal of passion and concern about that situation. I have a couple of young folk at home who will enter the work force in the next year or two. This report states by impUcation not only that 1978 will be a tough year for young folk but also that well into the 1980s in the absence of government initiatives it wuT be tough for young people in this country. This country will be caught in economic stagnation. It is a grim outlook indeed. I turn now to the inflation front. I have indicated the enormous social and economic costs this country will have to bear as a result of the economic poUcies of the Government applied last year and reinforced and compounded with greater intensity this year. Inflation will be between 11 per cent and 12 per cent. Again I resort to Government documents, the Treasurer's statements, to bolster that pomt. It is not something be conjured up by a prejudiced Opposition. In statein ment No. 2 the Treasurer said that real average earnings will increase by about 10.5 per cent in the course of the year. In another part, separated by considerable verbiage, he said that this would lead to some decUne in real average earnings. The implication of that is obvious to anyone who understands the simple principles of economic movements. It means that a 10.5 per cent increase in average earnings is not enough to keep up with the cost of Uving and that, therefore, the cost of living will exceed 10.5 per cent. On the best advice avaUable to it from the Treasury the Government anticipated an inflais likely to be preceded by tion rate of between 11 per cent and 12 per cent this year. I move on to interest rates. There are so many other tilings which one should deal with but time is too Umited, unfairly so in such an important debate of the national economy at such a critical stage. The tight money conditions which will prevaU this year are unreasonably and unjustifiably tight. They will apply the screws too severely to business. The spread of interest rates between private paper and public paper is too narrow. The Government is crowding the private sector out of the money market. How tight will the situation be this year? Inflation will be about 10.5 per cent. Real growth will be about two per cent. The demand for money in the economy just to hold the situation steady will be 12.5 per cent to 13 per cent. The Treasurer said that the rate of increase in the money supply, M3 as he calls it, will be between 8 per cent and 10 per cent. So there is a 3 per cent to 5 per cent squeeze on money supply on top of a particulary tough year in 1976-77. I do not believe that business can bear with that sort of thing much longer. I believe that in the course of this year quite a number of businesses willfindthat they are suddenly wrenched down into bankruptcy. They can no longer hang on by theirfingernails.That is why the Opposition argues quite forcibly that interest rates have to come down. Of course, the Government is hoping that the velocity of circulation of money will improve on the 1968-1972 average. It is already at an all time high rate. It cannot increase any more. This Budget is a recipe for economic disaster for the pubUc and private sectors. It is a most depressing outlook for the whole community. It can be summed up by saying that we had a bad Budget in 1976-77 followed by a worse Budget in 1977-78. There is no justification for the Treasurer to claim: The Budget will move Australia towards the goals of lowering inflauon, the promotion of moderate, noninflationarcy growth, the creation of unemployment That is a grotesque proposition, if ever I heard one. Everything that the Treasurer says proves that that is untrue. All the things he has promised were promised last year. None were acheived last year and none will be achieved this year. Budget Statement No. 2 makes that clear. It is compounded by the problems of an unfair, unjust, regressive tax system and an Australian dollar currently under siege-a n Australian dollar which, according to reports today, is so ened that our overseas reserves are down to $2,701 m for the month of August. They fell by $350m in that month alone. That is the lowest Budgets level at which they have been for this calendar year, and that is in spite revaluation of gold by $680m in August. We that there is a serious balance of payments deficit for the month of August. We discover that the import bill for August is the highest for any resist month in the year and the balance of payments deficit the worse since the great constitutional crisis of December 1975. Accordingly, devaluation has not brought benefits which were promised and the IAC is at fault for these problems. The fact is that the Australian economy is in an extremely feeble state. Internationally the strength of the Austhat tralian dollar is under siege. It just does not to sink into the understanding of the Treasurer that the economy is in a most critical that the Government's policies are counterproductive to the sorts of things that should be done.",47
107,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT," because Order! The honourable member's time has ways, expired.",51
108,Mr ANTHONY,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Richmond-Minister for if National Resources and Minister for Overseas Trade) (3.7)-We have just been listening to honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) who is the titular shadow Treasurer. After ing to him I think that he is probably one of the most irresponsible shadow Treasurers that this House has ever seen because in the last few minfar utes he has just displayed his desire to achieve run on the Australian dollar by creating an emotional situation, and that seems to give him joy. He did it earlier this year and it had trous effects on the money market. Now he is ing to do it again. Apparently this is the only way in which he can get his name in the Press. When he does that sort of thing it shows a pretty low form. Of course, he is one of the most discredited Treasurers that this country has ever seen. He is discredited because he brought down a runaway of jobs and the reduction Budget, a Budget which was leading this country to bankruptcy, a Budget which he said in this House would be for a deficit of $2,700m. Yet within months of our coming into office it had increased from $2.7 billion to $4.5 billion. It was quite obvious that there was absolute dishonesty in the presentation of thefiguresto this national Parliament, yet he tries to make out he was a great Treasurer. Heaven forbid that we should ever see that sort of behaviour again. weakThe shape of this Budget, the shape of last year's Budget and, I suspect, the shape of many to come, have been dictated by the the whole of the years 1973 todown Budgets brought by Labor Treasurers in 1975. Those were the years of of the extravagance. Those years-1973 , 1974 and find 1975-were the years when an indulgent Labor Government, lacking the courage and strength to the demands which all governments experience, laid the foundations for Australia's present economic difficulties, difficulties which will take many years to solve. If anyone doubts the truth of what I am saying, he or she needs the only to recall that each of those Labor Budgets not saw increases in government spending in excess of 20 per cent, and in one year a massive and disastrous increase of 46 per cent. Is it any wonder when the Liberal and National Country parseem ties were asked by the Australian people to start cleaning up the mess the Budget deficit was runstate and ning at over $4.5 billion? It needs to be clearly understood what such a massive deficit means. A Budget deficit that is too large is highly inflationary. It is inflationary it has to befinancedin one of three or by a combination of them. First, it can befinancedby higher taxes, an option which few any people would support. Secondly, it can be financed by printing more money, thus watering the down and debasing the worth of all money in the community. Thirdly, it can befinancedby large listenscale borrowing by the Government, in competition with other borrowers. The effect of this third course on interest rates, which are already too high, should be plain to everyone. I bea lieve that one of the most important things we could do to reactivate the private sector of the economy, to get it moving again, creating more disasjobs and generating more growth, would be to tryget interest rates down. There is some movement on interest rates, but there can be no significant improvement unless inflation is reduced. Lower inflation will befollowedby lower interest rates. So if we are to bring down inflation and interest rates and make a real impact on the whole economic situation, the Budget deficit must be brought down to more acceptable levels. We have made good progress towards that objective. In our first year we pulled the Budget deficit down from over $4.5 billion to $2.7 bUlion. This year it will be $2.2 billion. Contrast this with Labor's performance. In the 1974-75 Budget Treasurer Crean estimated the deficit at half a bulion dollars. It turned out to be five times that sum. The Hayden Budget of 1975-76 estimated a Budget deficit at $2.8 bUlion-whic h was bad enough-bu t when we took over from Labor it turned out to be $4.5 billion. We were left with what to many people might have seemed an impossible task, that of cutting the Budget deficit-whic h was at the heart of the problem-bringin g down the inflation rate, restoring confidence and incentive to the private sector and attacking the massive and tragic problem of unemployment. I think it needs to be understood that there is no simple way in which aU of these objectives can be achieved at once. No one would dispute the statement that the fundamental cause of our problems is inflation. The key to solving our problems Ues in controIUng inflation. That is why the Government at the outset, and without deviation since, has firmly committed itself to bringing down the inflation rate. We will continue on the course we have set ourselves with the utmost resolution, because there is no other way we can solve the serious economic problems which we inherited from an extravagant Labor Administration. This will mean conunuing stringent controls over spending. It wiU mean continuing denial of many of the worthy claims made on the Government for assistance. Of course we would like to see more money going into all sorts of areas-educa tion, local government, roads, social welfare and soon. I would especiaUy Uke to see more things being done for the beef producer, who has been through and is sull suffering difficulties which are quite beyond the comprehension of many people in the community. The Government as a whole is very much aware of the beef producers' situation. Measures have been brought into try to sustain producers through this period of low prices. Strenuous efforts have been continued to develop new markets and to improve existing ones. Carry-on finance has been made avaUable and rural reconstruction assistance has been provided. But it is quite obvious that more has to be done, and more will be done within the constraints the Government must observe in the current economic situation. I think there is general agreement on the need for the introduction of a classification scheme. This would be necessary before consideration could be given to the development of a national marketing scheme for the industry. I hope that the commercial trials of classification equipment now under way will provide sufficient information on which to base a decision to proceed with a classification scheme. I have no doubt that the Commonwealth will stand ready to play its full part in the implementation of such a scheme. It will be looking to other means of helping the beef industry. But it has to be remembered that nothing the Government does will have the same effect as a substantial rise in cattle prices. That is the only real answer to the cattlemen's problems. It seems to me that there is a need for a much wider understanding of the difficulties of primary producers and the consequences which flow to those who suffer in the community as a result of the difficulties of primary producers. A prolonged recession in the rural sector or in any major part of it must have serious long term effects. Those effects are felt not only by individual producers and their famUies but also by communities, districts, regions, and in fact the whole community. The rural industries today are becoming more mechanised, more capital intensive and more input based. Their fortunes are reflected back in the fortunes of other parts of the economy. A strong and prosperous rural sector brings tremendous benefits to the whole Australian community. A rural sector in difficulties creates problems for many other people in the community. I hope the community as a whole understands that the Government has a responsibUity to take action to alleviate rural problems in the general interest of the community. But I must remind the rural community, as I remind everyone else, that its basic problem is inflation. Inflation is the farmer's greatest enemy, and that is why I want to see the Government stick to its guns in the fight against inflation and stick to the course it has set itself to beat inflation. It would be easy and popular to spend a lot of money on schemes to create jobs but this would simply increase the deficit, worsen inflation and, while appearing to reduce unemployment, only mask the real extent of the problem and in fact contribute to worsening it in the long term. Those people who say that the Budget fails to address itself to the problem of unemployment are wrong. In its concentration on reducing inflation the Budget addresses itself to the very heart of the unemployment problem because the fundamental cause of unemployment is inflation. To take another example, it would be easy and popular to spend much more money on edutive cation, to provide a bigger increase than the per cent extra allocated in the Budget, to spend more than the $2,37lm set aside. I hope those people who are demanding more money levels immediately for education understand that long as inflation continues the value of every lar spent on education will be reduced, that will not get a dollar's worth of value out dollar spent unless the destructive and debilitatductivity. ing effects of inflation are controlled. I think this Budget shows that while the toration of non-inflationary economic growth the Government's primary objective, we are pursuing that objective blindly or unfeelingly. Despite all our inherent difficulties the Budget shows recognition of those areas requiring improvement in the lot of our fellow Australians who most need it. Social security and welfare spending will increase by 12.7 per cent in 197778 following an increase of 27 per cent year. This year assistance to the aged rises cent and pensions remain fully indexed. Full indexation of pensions means a real increase pensioners' incomes. Special assistance to the handicapped is up 33 per cent. That we have been able to do this and to bring in major reforms while bringing the inflation rate from 17 per cent to 10 per cent must be acyears, knowledged as a major achievement and as evitralian dence of the success of the Government's ductivity policies. The benefits of our tax reforms are real. tax indexation commitment announced before increase last year's Budget saved taxpayers close to the $ 1,000m in 1976-77. It will save a further $ 1,000m this year and, without the profound reform announced in the Budget, would have leave saved an additional amount of $900m in vice 197879. But on top of this-and I repeat on of the $900m-the radical movement in the flat rate of tax will return to the taxpayer a further $400m this year and nearly $ 1,000m next year. These are netfigureswhich take into account the half indexationfiguresto apply for 1978-79. They are over and above what our commitment to indexation would have given, and indexation of course will be fully maintained in future years. These restorations amount to an average of more than $700 being returned to each employed man and woman. But their sigaspects nificance is much greater than this. Ninety per cent of Australian taxpayers will now pay only 32c tax in the dollar on overtime, on working harder and on successfully building up their businesses. Those people at every level of who wish to work harder will have a great incento do so. This is the only road to our goal of 10 non-inflationary growth. If people increase their earnings by their own exertions Australia will benefit by higher levels of output and higher of demand. This will be a real demand so increase, not a spurious inflationary demand dolincrease which Labor is advocating with its we spend now, earn later policies. It will be a deof every mand increase spurred by improved proAs the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) has pointed out, the economy is not solely in the reshands of the government of the day. This is nois where more true than with unemployment. Since not our return to office numbers employed have increased by only 1V4 per cent. This increase has been insufficient to prevent the unemployment rate rising by 0.8 per cent to 5.4 per cent. Mr Innes-It is 40 per cent higher.",51
109,Mr ANTHONY,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"That rise was made inevitalast ble by the policy of the honourable member's 17 per Labor Government. Workers are unemployed now because they are being priced out of work. in Their labour is too expensive for the employers in the private sector tojustify taking more people on. This is made abundantly clear in the studies tax undertaken by the Organisation for Economic down Co-operation and Development. For recent thesefiguresshow conclusively that Ausprivate sector wages have outpaced proto a greater degree than in any other OECD country. When a wage increase is granted the employer must bear the cost not just of the Our actual increase but also of a large additional as well. This additional cost, on top of wage, is made up of the extra payroll tax, the workers' compensation costs, the employer's contribution to superannuation funds, annual loadings, holiday pay, sick leave, long serleave as well as the higher costs of overtime. top The cost to the employer on top of the actual wageriseis somewhere between 40 per cent and 50 per cent. I suspect that this extra burden on the Australian employer is considerably heavier than any similar burden carried by his competitors in other countries. When this is understood, the Government's concern over the part being played by substantial wage increases in compounding our economic problems and in delaying a solution should be better understood. The Government has taken action only on those of economic management over which it has control. Our role in wage policies is confined to submissions before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. In fact we have made submissions but these have not been accepted by the income Commission. Our employment policies have been affected as a result of the setbacks of the Commission's decisions. This Budget, like last year's, keeps the reduction of inflationfirmlyin focus as our primary objective. The Budget recognises that lower inflation and lower interest rates are the only way to achieve stable self-sustaining growth. It recognises that a lower budget deficit is the only way to get inflation and interest rates down. This Budget will be remembered most for its profound reforms of personal income tax. It will be remembered as the Budget that returned the incentive for people to work harder. It will be remembered as the Budget which aUowed the $12,000 a year worker to increase his earnings witnout running into taxation at 45c in the dollar. It will be remembered as the Budget in which the $15,000 a year worker saw his marginal tax rate drop from 45c in the dollar to 32c in the dollar. will be rememberedMr Innes-The Prime Minister got $68 but the pensioner got $1.",53

112,Mr INNES,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"This Budget will be remembered aU right but it will be remembered not for the reasons that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) outUned. It will be remembered as the Budget that brought down this incompetent and disgraceful Government. The address just deUvered by the Deputy Prime Minister will be remembered as something that contained a lot of rubbish, rhetoric galore, but nothing that you could eat. I would Uke to refer to the sorry plight of migrants in Australia. It is a sad reflection of the attitude of Liberal governments to migrants over 25 years. Unfortunately for migrants in the postwar boom, they have been served by a Labor administration for only three years. The only concerted effort to update and provide migrant services and to attack migrant needs in a meaningful way occurred during those three years. Already in the 21 dark months since this Government took office many of those innovations have been destroyed. The closure of 3ZZ for blatant political right-wing purposessomething that the honourable member for Bris - is a classic example of the conservatives' paternalistic approach to ethnic minorities. That approach is perpetrated in this Budget. In almost every area of spending beneficial to migrants, allocations not only have failed to keep abreast of inflation but also have fallen behind their often inadequate 1976-77 figure. This is a national tragedy because migrants form a huge percentage of the lower income work force in Australia. Indeed, that is the very reason they were brought here. They are the hardest hit group in the economic recession induced It by conservative incompetence. The policy of cutting inflation at the expense of wages and employment, which is failing anyway, hits most the people on lower incomes, either through depreciating their take-home pay or eliminating it altogether. Low income earners are incapable of providing afinancialbackup to tide them through survival on the miserable dole this Government pays its unemployed victims. Last night I made a speech about uranium and during it I had incorporated in Hansard some figures relating to youth unemployment. I invite honourable members on both sides of the House to reflect on them because about 16.9 per cent of people between the ages of 15 and 19 years who were born out of Australia, almost one in five persons, are on the dole or unemployed and not getting the dole. They have to faU back on social welfare if they can get it. But once again we find that there are cuts in the very areas which may give some benefit to these people. They are caught in a vicious circle created by a heartless government which is determined to make the working people of this country pay for the grave problems of the boss's system. If company profits rise sensationally honourable members sitting on the Government side believe they have achieved economic wonders. They choose to ignore the hundreds of thousands of victims at the far end of the scale. For a start, migrant education services have been cut by six per cent-to $ 10.2m-o n last year's Budget. Child migrant education programs have been reduced by $130,000. There are no funds at all for interpreter translator services. The overall reduction in real terms will adversely affect bilingual education course development which is so necessary if migrants are to retain a proportion of their cultural heritage. I need go no further than my own electorate to find primary and secondary schools suffering drastically from the ceilings placed on spending this year by the State Government as a direct flow-on from Federal cuts. Small classes are a necessity in the multi-cularrivals tural inner urban schools and these are the threatened facUity as a result of the spending cuts. The opportunities for young chUdren to vive, by putting their backsides on two stools once, in the desperate economic climate face are being severely Umited by this GovernSo ment's education poucy. At these schools grants are amongst the worse victims. Fitzroy High School, for instance, which has a growing number of Lebanese students enrolled, has no Lebanese speaking staff member. This is an incredible deficiency and it is creating grave problems for these students. Teachers tell me that aU inner urban schools suffer from a twoanother year gap in the reading level. Students in secondthe form, for example, are two years behind their comparative level. They see problems created poor migrant education faculties as one of the factors contributing to this state of affairs. Outside my electorate, I believe, the problems facing migrant students are being exacerbated by the demographic trend of migrant famUies move out of inner suburbia or not to settle therethose as they traditionaUy did. This is due to the of inflation on property values. They are moving to Lalor and Deer Park. In many these areas are even more poorly catered for in migrant education needs than schools in inner suburbia where the State Government at least has reahsed the problem in recent years and hascent taken some steps to improve it. That Governyear ment has not even come to realise fully the impact of this demographic change in the new outer migrant areas. Even when this reaUsation comes about it will take many years to achieve positive results because of the continuing back in funds from the Federal Government. The lack of funds for the interpreter/translator course is to the findings of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty which recommended payers' interpreter training at tertiary level and the tabhshment of a national councU of interpreting and translating. This inquiry was estabUshed under the Labor Government when there was government concern about the plight, the needs, reduced. and the interests of migrants in this countiy. Had that concerned Government survived these recommendations would be operative today. MiStates grant translating and interpreter services would be operating under government sponsorship. Tertiary courses would be a part of our educationregards system. But under this Government not one cent has been allocated for these courses. The Commission of Inquiry into Poverty need not have been held. The same inquiry urged State departments to estabUsh centres where adolescent could participate in full time intensive mostcourses preparatory to entering secondary education facUities, apprenticeship schemes or part sur-time training courses. The cutback in Governatment spending wiU ensure that these recommenthey dations wiU not be adopted. much for the pious determination of this somicalled Government to look at the needs of the under-privUeged in the community. AU the Government can come up with is a range of further inquiries into migrant services. We have an inquiry, for God's sake, into youth unemployment. We have had schemes related to the problems of youth, for Christ's sake, which will take 6 months to eventuate and by that time people will have a darn in their tie and nothing to eat. They will never be employed if the by trend continues. At the same time the sons and daughters of the eUte will receive even more eUtist educational opportunities thanks to the conservative attitude that therichought to become richer and the poor ought to become poorer. to Compare the facUities at Geelong Grammar with at Merrylands High School. The Press reimpactcently pubUshed a photograph of a migrant teacher at that high school attempting to cope cases schools in with a class of 40. Funds for welfare migrant facUities and welfare rights services have been reduced by 12 per in real terms from a miserable $800,000 last to an even more miserable $750,000 this year. What an example of this Government's lack of concern for the poor, the unemployedthe victims of its poUcies. If migrants were a business grouping and not just a body of industrial cutcannon fodder in the eyes of those on the Government benches they would be receiving special grants in aid, special industry assistance, aUowances, special capital improvement grants, all to ensure their economic survival at the taxexpense. But migrants are not a business esgrouping. For being what they are, the hapless victims of this system, they must pay an even greater price because those services which make Ufe a little easier for them have been further Let us look at migrant housing. Funds to the for this service last year were $500,000. This year they are $300,000, a 45 per cent reduction in real terms. Obviously the Government the depression of migrant conditions as more important than boosting the ailing construction industry. Once again Government action is contrary to the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty. Promoting inquiries is not now and never will be necessary because the information is there already. We urge the Government to grant extensive government assistance to migrants in housing and welfare areas. In respect of housing and hire purchase the Commission of Inquiry said that the Government should set up a scheme to provide interest-free loans as settlement loans to unassisted migrants for basic household purchases without the need for them to enter crippling hire purchase agreements.

116,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,That is not a point of order.,56
117,Mr INNES,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"It was a great speech, about the best the honourable member has ever made. He will never adorn the seats of this Parliament again, thank God. The Commission of Inquiry said: With the reputation of migrants standing high as good credit risks, a scheme of this kind would seem to create tively few risks, and would have the added advantage for the migrant of enabling him to establish a good credit rating. The Commission of Inquiry also recommended that the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Housing estabUsh various forms of buUding or housing societies within selected ethnic groups to ensure the avaUabUity of loan funds for housing in a manner that is within the grasp of individuals at that level. It also made recommendations in regard to assisting an aged persons program within the ethnic communiues; long term accommodation facUities for single migrants with particular reference to single girls of all ages; power to local government authorities to control rent levels including amounts requested to be paid in advance as bond or rent; Federal and State housing departments ensuring an adequate supply of rental housing in cities like Melbourne and Sydney because of the desperate need of new migrants and others; and a review of regulations covering Commonwealth hostels and flats to enable them to be used for accommodating migrants encountering difficulties at any stage of their re-settlement. The reports make numerous recommendations on migrant welfare but they are too numerous for me to mention here. This area is also extensively covered in the BaUey report on welfare and health and in numerous other reports which have been prepared for the Government in recent years. I refer to reports such as that on social policy and problems of the work force prepared under a social security research grant by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and reports to the Government from the Commissioner for Community Relations, Mr Grassby. In addition there have been numerous task force reports from each of the States avaUable to this Government over the period that it has beenin.office. Yet despite all this information, the result from this Government is the same-les s finance for these services, or none at all in most cases, when the evidence clearly necessitates a massive increase in funding to meet migrant needs. Apart from the specific migrant programs cut back to give more profits to private industry, general cuts m the broad social security program and in areas such as health will hit the migrant community savagely. For instance, the cruel restrictions on payments to the States for hospital and community health service development will deny migrants equality of access to medical treatment. Changes in unemployment benefit procedures will delay payments, inadequate as they are, to the group most disproportionately represented in relathe unemployed ranks. I presume that Senator GuUfoyle s household has never had to survive for three or four weeks with no income and no money in the bank, unable to pay for the roof over the famUy's heads, let alone to put food in their mouths.",56

119,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT, I think on balance that the honourable member is not out of order in his remarks which I did not take to be personal so much as general. Does the honourable member for Holt mean that the remarks were a personal reflection on Senator Guilfoyle?,56

122,Mr INNES,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"To the honourable members posite, balancing the Budget, cutting here where the working people are affected and spending there where profits to industry will increase, is academic exercise, if that term could possibly used in respect of those members. They are playFrank ing with massive ngures on a cardboard game, cynically with the winner being the scheme able to put much profit into private hands as possible. As employment races towards half a million, the Government shows its lack of compassion by out making it even harder to get welfare and by making the poor suffer for even longer the deprivation, misery, ignominy and the shame that goes with poverty perpetrated by this Government. This shame is even greater for midation grants brought to Australia on the false promise of a government offering a land of milk and honey, the perpetual sunshine of climate and social conditions, full employment at adequate salary, and consumer luxuries flooding every household. Suddenly they are disillusioned by the reality of underpaid assembly lines in industry stripping initiative and motivation from families, inadexcuse. equate housing, the desperate struggle for surto vival, adequate food, clothing and accommodapeople's tion-let alone the promised luxuries-followe by the ultimate disillusionment, unemployment, with weeks of no income and then receipt of the shameful pittance which this Government expects the unemployed to survive on. In any period the unemployment benefit is miserably inadequate, but in a period when hundreds of thousands of Australians are unemployed as direct result of the Government's policies, the least the Government can do is to provide a benefit which will allow the recipient her family to survive with dignity. I would have thought that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) would have the fought tooth and nail within the Ministry to ensure that benefits were raised to a livable level, knowing that the proportion of unemployed deficit, coming directly or indirectly under his Department's care. But no, as usual, he has shown callous disconcern for the plight of migrants. Once again he has allowed the big business policies of his fellow Ministers and of himself to rule. He has been grossly negligent in his lack of concern for the hundreds of thousands of people in Australia for whom his portfolio makes him responsible. He has allowed their living standards be further eroded by this Budget. In concluding I mention one of the ironies of this Government's economic and ethnic affairs pohcies. Having done absolutely nothing for miopgrants in the Budget the Government now intends, for Christ's sake, to conduct an inquiry at taxpayers' expense into the needs of migrants an in the community. What hypocrisy! The situation be is exacerbated further by the appointment of Mr Galbally to lead it. This could be seen as a pay off to Mr Galbally for his elecas toral contribution to the Government parties by unannouncing his membership of the Liberal Party at the appropriate time. He is still able to carry a very lucrative lawyer's practice. There are the reports and recommendations in respect of periods which I have made representations on interpreter and translation education and services, telephone services, housing and accommoneeds, ethnic radio, industrial relations, workers' compensation, immediate and longer term post-arrival care, health, education, legal aid, police and court awareness and procedures, consumer affairs and a host of other matters. Thee is no need for mquiries. We need some action, Anyone working closely with migrants is aware of the problems. It makes me very angry to see this Government once again ignoring these problems and using an expensive gimmick as an I condemn the Government for its failure meet migrant needs, both in this anti-working Budget and through the unnecessary d inquiry announced last week which will cost $120,000 of taxpayers'money.",57

124,Mr MCLEAN,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT," I am pleased to support the Budget and I shall discuss some of economic strategic aspects of it. I say at the outset that I support the basic strategy of the Government to control inflation, to reduce the to reduce taxes and government spending and to create the preconditions for a fall interest rates. I certainly endorse the strategy adopted by the Government to protect the Budget vote which is apportioned to disadvantaged groups in our society. I must say that I deplore the attempts by the Opposition to gloom and despair. Members of the Opposition seem to have a vested interest in this kind of tude. They totally misunderstand the basic egy of the Government and its economic achievements since it came to office. I shall some of these. The inflation rate has been subomic stantially reduced. In the 12 months to the June quarter 1977 the underlying rate was 10.2 per cent per annum compared with 15.4 per cent 1975-76. This is a very signincant improvement. My colleague the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns), a man whose opinion respect in economic matters, yesterday issued statement based on the latest quarterly estimates of national income and expenditure. He statedI agree with him-that on the basis of these latestimplications ngures single-digit inflation by June 1977 has been attained on a yearly basis. He went on say that the implicit price deflator for expendirecommending ture on gross domestic product was 9.4 per cent.higher Without allowing for the increase in stocks and the statistical discrepancy the June 1977 1976 increase was 9.13 per cent. price deflator has been leading the consumer price index down over the last half year the latest national accounts foreshadow the best results price stability for many years. I think that really a very significant improvement in the key economic indicator in Australia at this time. course, we are criticised by the Opposition for level of unemployment which presently prevaUs. We accept that the level is too high. But I think we should keep this matter in some kind of perspective. Under the Labor Government unemployment rose by 126 per cent. Under the present Govern-government ment the level of unemployment has risen by than one per cent I cite those ngures simply to suggest that the Opposition should not become too sanctimonious about this problem. The present Government is very concerned about the magnitude of the matter. That is why the controlsition. of inflation and of Australia's cost structure is being given top priority. Also, during 1976-77 real gross non-farm product increased, propurchased ductivity increased, company profitability increased and there were substantial has improvements in business and dwelUng investagain ment. All these key indicators reflect the improved economic performance of this country in during 1976-77 when compared with the performance of the previous Government. But of course we have a long way to go. We accept that preach The Government's strategy to achieve its economic objectives is very well known. It was atti-disappointing therefore after studying the speech straton the Budget of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) tofindthat the Opposition list still has not come to grips with a proper econstrategy of its own. In reading the speech of the Leader of the Opposition I was disappointed tofindthat it was not until I had read nearly 14 in columns of Hansard that I found he came forward with a suggestion as to what his Party would do to ovecome Australia's economic problems. I was even more disturbed tofindthat his I suggestion was to further increase government a expenditure. An increase in government expenditure of itself need not be a bad thing. It depends on how it is done and whether it has severe for the deficit. From the speech of the Leader of the Opposition it seems clear to me to that by impUcation the Opposition is again larger deficits, higher taxes, interest rates and all the adverse consequences which such factors bring to the economy on June such as rampant inflation and high As the implicit unemployment.  is head of the International Monetary Fund, stating as far back as the mid-1960s that this kind of Of strategy, which was so damaging to domestic the and external currency stabUity, was almost inevitable in the industrial democracies of the Western world. His assumptions were very simple. Because governments wanted to stay in office and because opposition wanted to get into office, each political force promised all things to all men. There were constant promises of higher spending, or lower taxes, or both. In lessother words the economic price of power was constantly being increased. To some extent this is presently the case in Australia. Certainly that is so with the Opposition. Again the economy will pay the price under the proposals of the OppoAgain it is advocating increasing expenditure and increasing the size of the deficit, therefore suggesting that lower unemployment can be at the expense of higher inflation. Pump priming of the kind envisaged no longer the effect it had in the 1960s. The Opposition faUs to reaUse that this kind of trade-off does not apply when high levels of inflation and high levels of unemployment co-exist. They are not alternatives. There is a real causal relahad tionship between the two which makes it imperadeficit, tive to overcome inflation if unemployment is be cured. The strategy of any budget in present times, if inflation and unemployment are to be tackled together, surely should be to exercise restraint both the revenue and expenditure sides. One should have regard not only to the size but also to the nature of the deficit. The cumulative effects of large deficits in recent years has simply meant that money markets have been strained to the limit and that additional money has been printed by the presses of the government. One does have to be a professor of economics to realise that too much money, chasing creates an intolerable domestic price instability. This Government has made very substantial efforts to reduce the deficit from the record levels found in the Labor Government's Budgets. But the deficit is still a problem. It is still too The Government should consider the nature and the timing of deficit changes. In different circumstances I think it would possible to put the view that more restraint could have been exercised on the revenue side of this Budget. After all, tax indexation has already vided substantial benefits. Such action could have brought the deficit to less than $2 billion and established the necessary prerequisites for very substantial interest rate reductions later the year. It could also have provided for other substantial expansionary policies next year. was one possible long term strategy to overcome our present unemployment problem. However, ported the fact is that the Labor Government created such impossible tax burdens for all Australians that short termreliefbecame imperative on economic grounds. I am appalled that the Oppoployment sition seeks to decry the very substantial and revolutionary tax reforms introduced by this Government, especially as such reforms, in proexpectations portionate terms, will assist lower income familFor ies more than higher income families. I think the Opposition's criticism of this Government for its tax reforms is quite incredible when one continue siders that the Opposition, when in government, increased income tax collections by some 90 cent In view of the fact that the Government had no option but to suffer a reduction in its ability to reduce the deficit further by introducing these taxation concessions, in my opinion the Government has done very well to reduce the deficit by as much as it has since it came to office. There is no question that this is a very important economic commitment which the Government has to make. Regarding the structure of the I suggest that the Government needs to to keep its options open and should not become too doctrinaire regarding possible changes of emphasis in the composition of the deficit. I think that future restraint should be exercised more on heavily on transfer payments, by adhering to the principle that resources in the welfare area should be more heavily concentrated on areas of need. This does not necessarily mean a funher reduction in the deficit, but rather a change of emphasis to provide future scope for some capital expenditure as the rate of inflation is funher not reduced and as the Government has more expansionary options open to it in the context of too few goods, its basic strategy. The deficit should continue to be strictly controlled, cenainiy, because of the monetary implications of failing to do so. Its composition may be able to be changed in a way which would large. facilitate expenditure in areas with greater income-multiplie r effects such as capital works. On the other hand, the Opposition adopts much be more simplistic and dangerous view. It advocates increased capital spending at the cost of increasing the deficit, thereby maintaining high interest prorates- a view totally incompatible with noninflationary economic growth. What I am saying is that the Budget strategy is the proper strategy for the present time. By keeping its options open in in the way I have suggested, the effect of the inevitable move to lower interest rates which this That Government has encouraged by responsible budgetary management will be further supby the stimulatory effects of the tax cuts which the Government has introduced. I say this because the stimulatory effects of the tax cuts will nonoccur only if consumers can have their emexpectations secured. It has become abundantly clear in recent times that consumer spending habits depend not only on inflationary but also on employment prospects. this reason it is important for the Government not to discard the possibility of following more expansionaryfiscalpolicies in order to conits stimulus to the private sector. There is certainly a capacity for the economy to absorb per mild expansion without placing pressures on inflation. Taxes in Australia have certainly been too high in the recent past. Tax cuts, justifiable on equity and welfare grounds, will not have their desired expansionary impact on the economy unless two things happen. Firstly, the tax cuts must be seen as providing a trade-off against further money wage increases. Quite clearly the labour market will not improve if the price of labour continues to outstrip the productivity of labour. Until real wage costs decrease, budgetary stimusistance lus will not improve the unemployment situation. Secondly, the Government must realise that this factor is interrelated with consumer habits. The productivity of the existing labour force will not increase unless there is scope for overall production increases. That is quite natusions ral. The tax cuts will not result automatically increased consumption expenditure unless memconsumer bers of the public can assess their job prospects as being secure. This is largely dependent upon confidence in the private sector. We should remember very clearly that although disposable incomes rose under Labor in 1974 there was comparable increase in consumer spending, as we might expect during times of high rates inflation. This was clearly due to the fact that people realised that their job security as well their real wages were threatened by high inflathese tion rates. Therefore confidence is the key. The tax cuts will have a stimulatory effect, if the Government, as a result of its budgetary management, moves towards a substantial lowering of interest rates-if this can be accompanied either late this year or early next year by some fiscal expanin sion-ther e would be a capacity to increase conreducing sumer and business confidence by providing non-inflationary growth. I simply reiterate my inflation. earlier point. The Government has a justifiable concern at containing the level of the deficit. must not underestimate the scope for expansion which can come from changing the nature of the deficit by applying a more rational distribution of government resources. After all, we are mothers. confronted basically with a cost inflation ation, not demand inflation. I would like to spend my remaining time disin cussing some of the welfare aspects of this Budget. At all times this Government has ensured that although tough decisions must be taken to reduce the rate of inflation the burden such decisions would not be borne by disadvanthis taged sections of the community. In the area of welfare this Government has a fine record. Firstly, its objective of reducing the inflation has very substantial advantageous welfare required implications for pensioners and all elderly, retired people. There are other more direct ways together. in which this Government has protected disadThe vantaged groups through its welfare programs. In the Budget last year the handicapped chilreceipt dren's allowance was increased by 50 per cent $15 a week. The handicapped children's benefit, payable in respect of handicapped children in institutions, was increased by more than 40 per cent to $5 a day. In the present Budget special as for handicapped people will rise by 33 per cent. That is achieved by providing income support of up to $ 15 a week fbr parents or guardspending ians of handicapped children. This Government is thefirstgovernment ever to guarantee the preservation of the value of penand benefits, by adjusting them automatiin cally every six months in line with changes in the price index. In November, as a result of this initiative, the standard rate of social service pensions and benefits will rise to $49.30 a week, which means that the standard pension rate will have increased by 27 per cent since this no Government took office. The Government has undertaken three-year programs for the funding of of aged persons homes and senior citizens centres at levels of funding much higher than as that provided by the previous Government. In all ways-togethe r with other initiatives such as the family allowances scheme and the increase in the tax threshold, which will relieve many pensioners from the burden of paying taxation which was imposed on them by the previous Government-this Government has demonstrated its concern for the disadvantaged groups society and has made sure that the cost of the inflation rate will not fall on those groups who suffer mostly from the effects of There are two areas in the welfare field which It concern me particularly and on which I urge the Government to take action. Firstly I refer to the need for income support for supporting fathers, equivalent to that provided for supporting I have already raised this matter in the situParliament and made representations to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) my attempts to have this anomaly rectified. The issue does not need elaboration because I know the Minister is aware of the problems of supporting fathers and is anxious to assist them of as soon as circumstances permit. I simply say that is a major anomaly in our welfare system. Society is prepared to act as a breadwinner in a fatherless house but is not prepared to finance rate adequately a household in which the father is to give up his normal working duties to assume a dual parental role to keep his family other welfare matter relates to the problems experienced by some pensioners who are in of a part pension and some additional to income, whether it is derived from superannuation or from some other source, and who are entitled to receive certain fringe benefits. These fringe benefits are payable to pensioners whose other income is below $33 a week for a single pensioner or $57.50 a week for a married sioner. Depending on the individual circumGovernment stances of each pensioner, fringe benefits can represent a very sizable addiuon to real income. In some cases, for example the frail aged who require frequent or continuous medical care and medication, the value of the fringe benefits actually exceed the value of the pension. These income limits have not changed 1969. In the face of the increasing number of pensioners and the costs involved, and in order to maintain equity between pensioners and other non-pension low income groups, the previous Government decided in 1973 to freeze the current income limits upon eligibility for fringe benefits. Because this eligibility for fringe benefits ceases completely at a specific income point, inequity arises in the sense that pensioners whose incomes were very close to the disqualifysingle ing limit can receive a superannuation increase which takes them past the limit and lose fringe benefits which may be of greater value than their basic income increase. As long as found. fringe benefit eligibility is not tapered in the way that eligibility for the pension is, this sort problem will arise for some pensioners each time there is a basic income increase. Many thousands of pensioners who have sufficient other income from private superannuand ation payments to put them near the upper limits and who still receive fringe benefits may themselves taken beyond those limits if their ticular superannuation fund incorporates indexation of benefits. Some sort of tapered fringe benefits test might reduce the the present scheme, but it would be difficult to devise and administer a scheme which tapered eligibility to services rather than cash, as is case with pension eligibility. The services offered represent different values to different pensioners. So there are difficulties in rectifying this anomaly. Perhaps the only way of doing it effec181, tively would be to replace fringe benefits with income tested supplement to the basic pension. am not suggesting that this is necessarily the answer or that now is the righttimeto implement a remedy. I simply want to draw the Govern the ment's attention to this problem. It is probably documents. the most important deficiency in our present sion system. At the moment, because of this problem many pensioners are having their welground fare determined less by changes in their income levels and more by the absence of change in their entitlement to fringe benefits. I consider this situation to be quite wrong in principle. practice, it is placing many pensioners at a conpensiderable disadvantage. I should like the to address itself to this problem. I support fully the economic strategy of the Government. I think the results achieved last year will continue to improve in the next year. I certainly regard the control of inflation and the may Budget deficit as the major areas which this Government has to attack in improving the econsince omy. I support the Budget wholeheartedly.

125,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,URANIUM,"Wit h your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the sake of accuracy I should like to add to an answer I gave to a question asked this morning. This monung the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) said that I had used a line quotation from the Flowers report. The single line quotation, as he indicated in his therefore question, was as follows: We are confident that an acceptable solution will be of The sentence that the Leader of the Opposition read out this morning was not in my speech announcing the Government's uranium decision. It is contained in two background papers.

The Leader of the parOpposition indicated that only one line from the the Flowers report had been quoted and that the [uotation omitted several other sentences.

The sentences which the Leader of the Opposition claimed I had omitted came from aragraph 504 of the Flowers report-11 1 pages P iter. As I was using a quotation from paragraph it is not surprising that the quotation that the an Leader of the Opposition used, which came from I paragraph 504-11 1 pages later-wa s not mcluded in the original quotation. Obviously, the quotation from paragraph 504 was not a part of quotation contained in the background penAs I have indicated, the quotation from the Flowers report which was contained in the backpapers was not a 'single sentence-on e basic line' as the Leader of the Opposition so misleadingly described it. It was an extensive quotation from the Flowers report together with In a further sentence summarising the attitude towards waste isolation which had been expressed in the Rowers report. Let me read the quotation which appeared in the background documents. It was as follows: There are various proposals Tor the permanent storage of the solidified wastes under the ocean bed or cal formations where they will be virtually inaccessible. Much research is needed (though still on a very modest scale compared with that on reactors) to establish the safety and the feasibility of such methods . . . We are confident that an acceptable solution will be found . . . The Leader of the Opposition suggested that the only sentence that had been used was as follows: We are confident that an acceptable solution will be found. The following additional sentence appears in the background documents: The Commission goes on to recommend that there should be no commitment to fission power on a massive scale until at least one method for safe beyond reasonable doubt. In other parts of the Flowers report, indicating a view very similar to that indicated in the Fox report, the Commission had indicated that the present state of knowledge certainly was not one which should cause people to put aside the further development of"" nuclear power for peaceful purposes. I think that what we have seen on this occasion is yet one more example of the unparalleled capacity of the Leader of the Opposition for deception and the blatant way in which he tries to carry out distortions.",61
126,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URANIUM,"Mr Lucock)Order! I suggest to the Prime Minister that he is now debating the matter. He has explained the point of the incorrect quotation. In continuing now and making comments in relation to the Leader of the Opposition the Prime Minister is debating the matter and is going beyond the explanation.

APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1977-78 Second Reading (Budget Debate) Debate resumed.",62
132,Mr LES MCMAHON,URANIUM," I must say at the outset that I am very upset about what the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has said in reply to a question asked this morning by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam). I would say that the way in which he attacked the Leader of the Opposition, who is not here, was slanderous. What he said during the last five minutes does not do service to the Liberal Party and does not do service to the Prime Minister of Australia. I do not want to waste my time on the Prime Minister. I expect that the Leader of the Australian Labor Party will answer him in the correct manner which suits the Leader. This Government is bankrupt, both of ideas andfinancialexpertise, and is notfitto govern our great country. Just over the last two days honourable member for Lowe (Sir William MCMahon) and the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) both have deof nounced the 1977-78 Budget brought down by tion the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) in this House, Not only the younger members of this Government of are attacking their leaders- I do not wonder having heard what the Prime Minister has just stated-bu t also the older and most respected members are doing so, and doing it openly. This Government is on very shaky grounds in its fight for survival. The Prime Minister and his advisers were contemplating a snap election. I am conenhancing vinced, after hearing what the Prime Minister said in the lastfiveminutes, that he ried man. I think that over the next two months the Prime Minister will be saying less about election. I think he is worrying about his survival. Three weeks ago the Treasurer announced his Government's alleged master plan for the last nation's economic recovery over the next year. Rather than being seen as an economic docucUngs ment, the Budget had the immediate impact on the media of increasing speculation about early election. With the so-called revolutionary changes in the tax structure, the absence of increased duties on cigarettes and alcohol and a staggering increase in the price of petrol which due to come into effect in the middle of next it was thought that the Government was preparproceeded ing for an early election in order to avoid the action of the electorate to next year's massive increase in unemployment, continuing double figure inflation and a further deterioration of theno economy. However, unforeseen by the Government, media were quick to realise the hollowness treachery contained in the Government's Budget proposals. The day after the Budget was delivered the newspapers were questioning the accuracy of the Budgetfigures,especially those concerning the new tax structure, and they erally attacked the Government for the extent its deviousness. The subsequent attempts by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to cover up only fuelled the growing belief of the Australian public that the Budget was a fraud and a serious impediment to Australia's chances of economic recovery. Therefore, within a matter of days, the Budget was totally discredited as a worthy election Budget, and so the chances of an early Fedat a time eral election disappeared. Ifit is not an election Budget, what is it? It certainly is not a serious attempt by the Government to restore Australia's economic and social wellthe being. The fact is that this Budget is nothing more than a continuation of last year's Budget strategy- a Budget which increased the number unemployed by 90,000, prolonged high inflarates, obliterated business confidence, savagely reduced personal incomes with the result stifling any chance of a consumer led recovery, why fanatically hacked away at pubhc spending without any regard for its immediate effects on the poorer members of our community or its long term social and economic costs, and worse of all, a Budget which totally rejected the goals of reducing inequaUty and social injustice and of the quality of Ufe of aU Australians; in fact it actively sought a widening of the gap beis a very wortween the rich and the poor. It is obvious from an examination of this an Budget that the Government is bankrupt of any workable economic alternatives. It is clinging to an economic strategy which has proven over the year that it is not working and is not Ukely ever to work. The fact that the Government still to the same stale and unworkable policies is positive proof of the Government not being in an command of the situation but instead being fixated to its one and only unimaginative and over simplistic recipe for economic disaster. WhUe justifying the 1975 coup on the grounds is of their superior economic management skills, year, the Liberal-National Country parties have to prove without a doubt that they are rethe greatest economic mismanagers Australians have ever witnessed. As a result of their short but thorough term of mismanagement, Australia can longer regard itself as a lucky country. In less than 20 months of conservative government Australian living standards have fallen by more the than four per cent, thus placing Australia and comparably worse off in many important ways than other Western democracies whose national wealth and resources are less than ours. Worse than that, the last two Lynch Budgets genhave blatantly and unashamedly depressed Ausof tralian living standards in an inequitable manner, with the intention of giving more to the rich at the expense of the poor. The Treasurer calmly explains that the rich have to be given incentives so that economic growth can take place. If the rich are made more contented, he argues, then they will provide jobs for the workers. What sort of feeble-minded, nineteenth century reasoning is that? Whatever happened to our noble objectives of stamping out social injustices wherever they occurred in this country, of providing equality of opportunity for all Australians, of helping the disadvantaged to help themselves, and of providing dignified and adequate support for all those unable to provide for themselves. The Treasurer obviously believes that such goals are extravagant and unable to be afforded in these times of economic recession. Instead he believes that the present unjustifiable imbalance of national wealth should be further aggravated by redistributing a greater share of the national wealth from the workers and social security beneficiaries to the top ten per cent of Australia's income earners. The last two Lynch Budgets have had that as one of their primary objectives, and unfortunately it is one of the few objectives in relation to which the Government has had a degree of success. In the 1976-77 Budget Medibank was slashed by $450m; health services were doubled; programmed expenditure on four education commissions was reduced by $172m; tuition fees for second and higher degrees were reintroduced; taxing of social security pensions and benefits was introduced; grants for senior citizens centres were terminated; expenditure on sickness and unemployment benefits was cut by $33m; subsidies for aged persons homes were reduced by SO per cent; funding for the Australian Assistance Plan was completely withdrawn; funding for the Aboriginal people was cut by 30 per cent in real terms; the Labor Government's programs for urban and regional development were virtually destroyed; funds for the school dental service were frozen; the legal aid service was strangled before it had a chance to function; child services were savagely cut back, and despite all these cuts in government expenditure, taxes were also increased by 25 per cent and the Government did everything in its power to curb wage increases, with the result that over the year age wages fell by $ 11.50 a week. At the same time as the Government was pruning back community services, welfare payments and wages, it was doling out money to big business. The coal industry which had made profits of around $500m the previous year was given the huge and totally pointless windfall from reduced export duties, resulting in gifts of tens of millions of dollars to large and prosperous coal companies such as Utah; shareholders were rewarded with further subsidised profits; and generous tax loopholes were created for Pitt and Collins Street farmers. Where are the members of the National Country Party now? Not one of them is here to defend himself. And the superphosphate bounty was restored at an annual cost of $50m, of which the Prime Minister and many of his Cabinet colleagues are potential beneficiaries. Now again in the 1977-78 Budget the same warped reasoning, tainted values and insensitivity to the nation's needs underlie the Government's policies. In the same manner as it did in the previous Budget, the Government is serving notice to the world that one of therichestand most fortunate nations on earth cannot afford to provide for its people the mimmum standards of health care, housing, public transport, urban development and social amenities enjoyed by all other advanced Western democracies; but at the same time it can afford to make inequitable and considerable concessions to a handful of people who are already on the highest incomes and who are very secure in their jobs. Just as occurred in the previous Budget, real government spending has been cut, this time by nearly two per cent. Combined with the cut of approximately four per cent last year, this year's level of government spending will lead directly to severely reduced employment opportunities, particularly in the already depressed building and construction industries. By January next year 430,000 Australians will be unemployed with the young continuing to bear the major burden of unemployment in 1977-78. In the opinion of most economists this year's Budget does nothing about the unemployment problem except make it worse. It can only be assumed that once again the Government is deliberately using unemploycare ment as a weapon to reduce real wages and salaries. As in the previous Budget, the only people who will gain from this year's Budget are the averwealthy. As a result of the so-called revolutionary tax cuts the vast majority of people will receive a paltry $3 a week, most of which will be immediately swallowed up by higher petrol prices and rising inflation. In comparison, the rich people, those on the highest salaries, will gain more in take home pay each week than the majority of taxpayers receive in their total weekly earnings. What a cruel fraud this proposed tax cut is. No wonder the Australian Financial Review, two days after the delivery of the Budget, was prompted to condemn it as a shabby confidence trick unworthy of any serious government. As in the previous Budget, excessive cessions were given to those already well off, such as the nuning companies. An estimated $800m of potential company tax receipts will given to company profits. Meanwhile the Government repeats its failure to institute selecThis tive stimulatory expenditure to reduce unemously ployment and restore consumer confidence. Like last year there is no allocation Budget for local employment programs despite the fact that unemployment is soaring at record post-Depression levels, especially in areas such as Sydney's western suburbs, Townsville, Kwinana, Ballarat and Nowra. In fact the matic reduction in capital works programs greatly contribute to the unemployment probMedibank lems of many of these areas. The only assistance the Government offers is its Relocation Assistsertions ance Scheme which provides no direct employfigures ment opponunities. At a time when 40 per cent of unemployed persons are youths and the projumped portion is increasing the Government, in its wisestimates dom, has decided to expand the special youth employment training program to include unemagain ployed persons between the ages of 20 years 24 years. This extended program will give only 20,000 young people employment assistance in 1977-78 when in one single month, May this will year, 147,000 young people between the ages of 15 years and 24 years were unemployed. Mr Morris-The Government is sacking people to put them on.",62
133,Mr LES MCMAHON,URANIUM,"That is right. It is ment doing so in our area of New South Wales. With regard to apprenticeship training the Governgain ment admits that there is a continuing shortage of skilled labour and an increasing pool of skilled labour. Yet it still neglects to provide adequate funds for training and retraining grams. The Government has reduced the alloreasoning cation of funds in the Budget for apprenticeship training under the Commonwealth Rebate ApGovernment prenticeship Full-time Training scheme and National Apprenticeship Assistance Scheme by $ 1.6m, a reduction of nine per cent in real terms. Despite all this evidence Government's failure to act ment opponunities and the economy in general, it still attempts to pour blame on the union schools, movement for its own economic incompetence. More Although the number of man hours lost through these strikes is at a 10-year low several claimed that industrial disputation is responsible for inflation and unemployment and have threatened funher industrial legislation to solve our economic problems. Any such attack on union movement such as the recently introduced conCommonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Bill is quite plainly designed only to divert public attention from the Government's be own failures and to provoke the union movement into confrontation with the Government. is a situation which the Government obvibelieves to be to its electoral advantage. Otherwise it would not pursue it with such force of funds in the and determination. As in the previous Budget the prospect of this Budget reducing inflation this year is very dim. Even though reducing inflation is claimed by the Government to be its overriding concern, the draincrease in petrol tax on top of unnecessary will devaluations and the destructive changes to will guarantee another year of rapid price increases. In spite of the Treasurer's as to the contrary the official Treasury released in connection with the Budget show that the underlying rate of inflation has by 47 per cent in the last six months. All are that the rate of inflation will be at least 11 per cent to 12 per cent in 1977-78. Once in the Lynch Budget the Government has and cut back spending on essential community services, a policy which will only guarantee further deterioration of the Australian quality of life and place unbreakable financial barriers in front ofthose who are most in need of these services. The Government's twisted justification for these cutbacks is to put more money back into the pockets of the taxpayers. Yet the Governdoes not even practise what it preaches in this instance as it plans to increase its revenue from personal taxation by 17 per cent during thisfinancialyear. But, overlooking Governunment inconsistency as one often has to do when speaking about its policies, I shall use this opporprotunity to comment on the Government's line of with regard to Budget cutbacks on community services. Firstly, in many cases saving on community services is a the false economy. More money in the taxpayers' pockets does not compensate for the loss of basic amenities which make for a secure and civilised highlighting the life. provide These are amenities that only governments to stimulate employcanhospitals, such as adequate roads, railways, schools, libranes, universities, preopen spaces and a decent environment. money in the pocket would not enable a family to buy any of these things but without amenities a family's quality of life is drastiMinisters have cally reduced. Secondly, prolonged government neglect of essential community services often involves more the considerable and less obvious costs to the deprived individual and to the nation as a whole. For instance, the longer we postpone essential services such as sewerage, the greater the ultimate cost and disruption of providing them. The longer we delay the building of necessary hospitals and health centres, the greater the toll in sickness, rehabilitation and absenteeism. The longer it takes to get to work, the higher the in industrial production and human efficiency. The more deprived and backward our cities and towns, the greater the rates of crime and mental illness. All this neglect and impoverishment diminishes the nation's productivity, blunts its competitiveness as a trading nation and burdens its people with needless inconvenience and hardship far more drastically and far more expensively than industrial disputes. No government of any other affluent nation in the world would tolerate the waste oftime,money and human resources dissipated by Australia's substandard services and public amenities. But here in Australia the Fraser Government is actively promoting the further debasement of our services and amenities. The brilliant alternative of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer to government provision of many of these services is for the private sector to provide some of them. This leads me to my third criticism of the Government's reasoning underlying its policy. Without adequate government intervention many essential community services will become the preserve of the wealthy. As a result of the two Lynch Budgets, pre-school funding which covers the payment of pre-school teachers' salaries has been progressively reduced from 75 per cent to 49 per cent. By next week this will mean that schools will once again be restricted to those can afford to pay the higher fees rather than available to those who have greatest need of them. Next week pre-school fees are poised to rise to more than treble their present level. inner city area they willrisefrom $5 a week to more than $17 a week. This situation is deplorone able but it is all part of a deliberate and twisted government policy. Education, aged persons' accommodation, inflation. social security pensions, benefits and programs, growth centres, community health services, mithe grant services, Aboriginal affairs, urban rehabilition tation and housing are some of the vitally imporlevel tant areas of government responsibility which have also gone wanting in this Budget. The Ausmonths tralian is looking for some guidance. Aged pertion, sons' homes have been hard hit. In one word, this year's Budget is a disaster. On one hand traUans are being asked to accept savage cuts in are proud. services as the price they must pay to beat inflation and reduce unemployment while on the other hand the government is giving lavish concessions to big business in an all out bid to redistribute the nation's wealth from the poor to the already wealthy. The result is a Budget which is a cost recipe for higher inflation and unemployment. This, in turn, makes the sacrifices of Australians futile. The simple, selfish, ul-conceived message of this Budget is that reUef for the poor, the sick and the uneducated is a luxury that the wealthy do not wish to afford. We are waiting for the next election.",65
134,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URANIUM, Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,66
135,Mr CADMAN,URANIUM,"The speeches we have heard from the other side of the House are completely unconvincing. The honourable member for Sydney (Mr Les MCMahon) who has just resumed his seat seemed to be completely unconcerned about the level of unemployment He talked about extending the PubUc Service and extending the Australian Government services. It is a tired old approach that the Australian people have experienced. They experienced it for three years and then decided that they were absolutely sick and tired ofit because they as individuals received no personal benefit. They were restricted in what they could do. The resulting huge additional take in taxation meant that they as individuals and as famiUes had no capacity to be self-sufficient and had a Umited capacity to seek employment. If we look at the 12 months that have just prepassed and look at the Government's record we who see that the Government's Budget last year be finished the year completely on target The Government's commitment to reduce the deficit was within one per cent of the target. I am sure In the that any manager of any household in Australia would recognise that, to achieve a deficit within per cent of an assessed goal, is afineachievement and something that few managers could fulfil. But the Government has fulfilled it. The Government made a commitment to reduce It said that it would like to see inflation at about 10 per cent to 11 per cent at the end of year. We started the year with a level of inflaof 15.4 per cent andfinishedthe year with a of 10.3 per cent. Figures now coming forward indicate that even within the last couple of there has been a significant drop in inflaso apparently we now have one digit inflation, which is something of which the GovernAusment and all members on this side of the House If we look at the capacity within the community to go out, to explore, to find new challenges, we see that company profits are up by 23 per cent in 12 months. To many people company profits indicate that a few individuals alone gain the benefit of those profits. That is certainly not so. A small num ber of ind'mduals do not gain the benefits of company profits. They are spread through the community. They mean employment, training and prospects for young people leaving school. Profits mean jobs, and this is one of the objectives of the present Australian Government. Hand in hand with increased profits goes increased overseas investment in Australia. We believe that at this stage overseas interests in Australia are running at the highest level since 1972. This indicates a confidence and a willingness by other people to show their confidence in Australia by putting their money here and by saying: 'We believe that Australia has prospects. We believe that Australia has a future. We believe that the Australian people can see the way ahead and will accept the challenges of new and exciting prospects in all fields'. But ofcourse the Government's major thrust during the last two years-agai n it is evident in the Budget-ha s been its commitment to controlling inflation. Without the control of inflation there can be no proper management at an individual or family level or at a government level. For instance, increased funds for State and local government go much further if inflation is low. If inflation is running at 16 per cent and if local government receives an increase of 20 per cent in its funding it has a real growth of four per cent, but if inflation is running at 10 per cent it has a 10 per cent real growth. That is what happens when inflation is reduced. The capacity of every individual or government is increased dramatically. That is why this Government places so much emphasis on controlling inflation. This means that the average proportion of a weekly wage that is expended on food and other necessary items is more stable and goes further. A commitment of a certain amount of money a week will provide the necessities and the luxuries with far less strain on the family. This is why the Government is committed to retaining and restraining inflation. Linked with the constraint of inflation must course be the constraint on the demand for increased wages, as people should recognise. tax scales that have been introduced by the Government this year, to my mind, give rise much thought. A $3 a week tax cut is equivalent to a $4.60 a week wage rise. Under those circumhome stances tax cuts are more substantial indeed than wage rises because the individual receives all of that money. Nobody is taking anything out ofit. He can use it himself. I repeat that a $3 tax cut is worth a wageriseof $4.60. We should not fail to recognise that for many people in the community decreased taxation means-if one looks at the scales prepared by the Taxation Office-that people with dependants or with a dependent spouse will receive tax cuts of something like 18 per cent or 19 per cent after 1 February. That is highly significant. The people receiving those tax cuts are benefiting far more than if they had received a wageriseof a similar amount. Decreasing wage demands have been one of the reasons why there is a greater stabUity in the Australian community today. People have seen the fallacy of pursuing increasing wage claims and of making increased demands on employers and government. It benefits them little. If there is a general stabUity it gives scope for planning and scope to look ahead and achieve individual goals and ideals. The Government has achieved its objectives in many ways but one of the significant ways has been by reducing the size of government and the size of the public sector. By extravagant use of taxpayers' funds we saw a massive growth in the Public Service during the period in which our predecessors were in office. This Government has reduced the PubUc Service by 12,500 in this year and has made a further commitment to reduce it by 3,000 in the coming year. At the same time. I am disappointed to find that State governments have actually increased their public services. There seems to be httle commitment by State governments to hold the line that is consistent with the national approach. I am afraid that there appears to be a selfish approach. It is not a commitment to the things that we nationally consider to be important. I think that the road back for Australia could be much more easy if the State Premiers, instead of crying out for increased government benefits on the one hand and reduced interest rates on the other, which are completely incompatible, reduced the size of their public services. I think that they would be more responsible and more realistic if they were to adopt techniques similar to the ones adopted by the Australian Government. I urge them to take note of what the of Treasurer (Mr Lynch) said in his Budget Speech and to look at the areas of payroll tax and The workers' compensation. These are the very factors that are denying opportunities to people into the work force. An employer must expend something like $260 a week for his employee to take $140 a week. These benefits are of no immediate gain to the employee but they are costs to the employer. They are long term benefits. I am refening to workers' compensation, payroll tax, long service leave and superannuation. They arefinethings but the community must recognise that the employer is up for a far bigger bill than employees take home in their pockets. An extension of these concepts and an unwillingness to deal with them by State governments will only delay the resumption ofjob opportunities. As I have said, the deficit is down by $500m in the Budget that was presented on 16 August. Each reduction of this deficit eases the pressure on monetary policy. The Government this year has successfully encouraged housing loans. It has said to the Reserve Bank that any creditworthy borrowers should not be excluded from receiving home loans. The Government has said that there should not be restraint on the capacity of individuals to establish their family home. This is an indication of the Government's commitments along with programs about which the community knows-programs that have been delivered during the past year to encourage people to own their homes and to establish the security and the base for their children which will provide for the citizens of tomorrow an opporsporting tunity for well-being and an opportunity to look are honourable forward with confidence. If we look at the new tax scales wefindthat an whether additional 225,000 people will be exempted from paying income tax. It is all right to talk about people at the upper end of the tax scales, sports the upper income earners, but let us look at the prospects lower end. Let us look at the real benefits that and in other will be received by pensioners and people in receipt of a pension plus small superannuation payments. This is where the tax scales will have the most benefit. What Federal member opceive posite has not had pensioners coming to him complaining about the Hayden Budget and sayof ing: 'Now you are taxing pensioners'? How the many pensioners have they had come in? I am sure that they have had hundreds. I know members on this side of the House have had such complaints. The Government has moved to throughout resolve this problem. Another real advantage of the new tax scales is that anyone in the community with the capacity to do so can go out and earn more money withthan out being taxed so heavily. Overtime will become attractive because it will not be taxed at a penalty rate. The same apphes to the earnings of people with second jobs. People will be able to take up their opportunities as they find them. In real terms people will get back a total of $ 1,371m their tax and after February next year the of amount will be $l,857m. The people of the electorate of Mitchell alone will be better off in this 12 months by $20m to $30m as a result of the tax scales. Last year they were SlOm better off. This indicates the commitment of the Government to give people the chance to spend their own money and to make their own decisions. In the area of government programs education has been mentioned as being an area in which there have been government cuts. The argument can be presented that there has been no increase in expenditure for education. But no increase in real terms means in fact that the Government could honestly claim there has been an increase in expenditure on education equivalent to the rate of inflation. It is not possible at this time of the year to put afigureon that amount because we do not know what the cost will be. But by the end of 1977-78 taxpayers and the education community will see that the Government, as it did last year, has honoured its word and will retain a capacity for a real stability in education. There will not be cuts and members of the Opposition know that. An amount of $lm has been dedicated to the bodies of Australia. I know that there members opposite who must be interested in this matter. Sporting bodies, they are national or State bodies, will now benefit from a sports policy that will encourage Australian athletes and competitors in all to compete again in world events in such a way that we can look forward, I hope, to greater of success at the next Olympic Games international competition. An area dear to my heart is the handicapped people's area. Handicapped persons are to reincreased benefits of 37 per cent this year. I have not heard any member from the other side the House decry this increase. This is one of things they have chosen to overlook. I bring to their attention the Government's concern for that people who have difficulties and who face difficulties. I am sure that handicapped people Australia will be most appreciative of this additional benefit. Assistance to State governments has been increased by 14 per cent. This increase is more the rate of inflation which stands at roughly 9.4 per cent. The States will receive an additional 14 per cent to spend as they wish. The State Premiers can say what they wish, but until they accept responsibility, until they stop saying that the Federal Government is keeping them poor, in until they say that they will increase the margin tax they want so that they can carry out their own projects, I am afraid that their cries of mouth will be unconvincing. The people of taken Australia know that the States are being funded at a reasonable level. The States have some small prospects for raising revenue in their own areas. This Government has given them the opporast tunity to carry out programs that are important to them but not one State government has taken up this opportunity. In fact, the premiers Labor States have said: 'We will never take up'. What an irresponsible attitude. There is to be an increase of 18 per cent to per cent in funds allocated to local government to use as it wishes this year. These funds are tied. As a result local government will have an important opportunity to reduce rates and carry out works programs. Local government knows that the Government is fair dinkum in area. It recognises that the Federal Government will support it in respect of tax sharing. It knows that it will get additional funds that will the ratepayers. The total community in fact starting to support in a signincant way local authorities throughout Australia. It is interesting to note that there are peculiar and difficult probGovernment's lems in respect of job prospects in the Sydney area. The Australian people do not benefit from the fact that at the moment about 20,000 people are out of work because of industrial stoppages. The honourable member for Sydney (Mr Les have MCMahon), who was the last speaker on this desesses. bate, knows that this is true. Despite the problems of the building industry scope there are irresponsible individuals whom we all limited deplore, who would hold the industry to ransom, who would prevent people from working, who of would stop people with families from earning alivelihood weekly wage because they wish to establish their tion. The two position of power. It is deplorable huge projects right across the nation in every of Trade Unions are and capital city is not proceeding. Only last week in Victoria the Builders' Labourers Federation rejected an incredibly generous offer made the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration expired. Commission and said that its members would stay on strike. A similar situation has applied New South Wales where the State Government has not taken the matter up. I would have itical thought that the responsible Ministers there would have seen the building industry as providsame ing an opportunity for jobs. But they have not taken up this opportunity. Job opportunities in the western suburbs of Sydney have not been good due to poor planning over many years. The planners must take reneglected sponsibility here. I am sure that honourable members would agree that provision has not poor been made for jobs in the planning that has place in respect of new suburbs in the western area of Sydney. Encouragement has not been given to industry to establish itself out where the (>eople are living. It is unfortunate that over the week or two the Premier of New South Wales, instead of encouraging industry into the western suburbs has suggested that it go to the of the Campelltown area. We know that Campbellit town is a growth centre but the greatest amount of unemployment in Sydney is in the western 19 suburbs. This is the place where people want and should get jobs but they are being denied jobs not because of the policies of the State Government. I think it is incredible that factories should be to forced into the Campbelltown area when the prospects of a stable dedicated work force are this there for the taking in the western suburbs. People who want to work-and young people in particular-ar e being prevented from doing so by benefit some strange and unfortunate policies. is The difficulties of the last four years have caused a pause in the progress and the security of Australia. Now there is strong evidence that the policies are successful and Phillip Schrapnel and W. D. Scott and Co. Pty Ltd recently indicated their confidence. We are moving ahead to an exciting and challenging future. Our huge resources of minerals and energy appear to prospects that no country in the world posFor our young people the challenge will be unlimited and must be seized upon by them to achieve progress, security and well-being. The of our capacity to move forward can be only by Australians themselves. The role organisations that are supposed to protect employers-to support them and improve their, and work conditions-is under quesroles of the President of the Austhat work on tralian Labor Party also the Australian Council in question.",66
136,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URANIUM,Mr Lucock)by Order! The honourable member's time has,69
137,Mr LES JOHNSON,URANIUM," Mr in Deputy Speaker, as the debate on this stultifying Budget goes on the anguished voices of the poloncers ring out in this Parliament and the hopes of the Australian people run out at the time. We have listened to a buck passing exercise on the part of the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) who must be feeling very insecure in his own position. He comes from the western suburbs of Sydney, the most pan of the country and the part which has been denied most by the Fraser Government's enactments. No longer are there urban improvement programs, Australian assistance programs and Regional and Employment Development schemes to provide assistance to areas of that kind and the honourable member well knows it. For the second year in succession the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) has presented the Parliament and Australia with a Budget that reflects his own ideological dogmatism and that of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Nowhere in the Budget Speech did the Treasurer disclose the real effects of this Budget-highe r unemployment, stagnant economic growth, continuing double digit inflation and the redistribution of wealth to the most privileged groups in our community. In an address to the National Press Club the day after he delivered his death knell to the aspirations of thousands of young and old Australians alike, the Treasurer had the gall to proclaim that his Budget was 'tough on inflation without being tough on people'. Let him tell that to the 337,391 people presently unemployed, most of whom have been looking for work for at least six months. Let him tell that to the thousands of young Australians, and their parents, who are to leave school at the end of this year and who face not only a bleak employment future but the prospect of nofinancialsupport for the 10-week Christmas vacation- a decision taken in defiance of the High Court of this country. Let him tell that to the Aboriginal people who, in addition to losing their lands to the Government's mining friends and the greedy aspirations of uranium developers, have now suffered a further cut of 16 per cent in real terms. Let him tell that to the housing industry which has stated already that this Budget will do nothing to bring that industry out from its present state of depression but rather will lead to the retrenchment of still further skilled tradesmen, many of whom will be lost to the industry for ever. When I look at the officialfiguresrelating the housing industry I note that for the June quarter housing approvals were down 17.3 per cent as against the June quarter in the preceding year. The official statistics show that in that quarter, June this year as against the preceding year, the number of housing commencements was down no less than 11 per cent. The fact that sales and construcuon activity are depressed generally and that large stocks are remaining. Any real estate agent will say that that is the state of the market. Ihe architects and the builders will talk about the incidence of retrenchments that are occurring daily. The Treasurer not only has distorted the reality of his Budget but seemingly he cannot even quote correctly. It is little wonder that the national Press and the people of Australia simply do not believe what emanates from this loquacious word spinner. I heard a new name for him today from a person who I think is a journalist. It was 'the mouth from the south'. The Treasurer's economic competence can be measured by the fact that the rate of growth of real national product following hisfirstBudget reached only 3.4 per cent- a depressingly poor result. Yet in 1977-78 the Treasurer admits that real national product is expected to grow by only 2.5 per cent. This is a sobering thought for a government which boasts of its economic expertise. Competitivefiguresfrom the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development show that the average for the seven leading nations for 1977-78 is expected to be 4.5 percent. The best that can be predicted in our Australian economic scene is 2.5 per cent. In addition, non-farm productivity is expected to fall from last year's dismal 2.5 per cent to a mere one per cent. When added to the Treasurer's prediction of a more moderate rate of growth' in consumption and the known buildup of stocks over the past 12 months, the economic outlook for the next 12 months indicates a deepening of the recession which the 1975-76 Budget of the Labor Government was designed to defeat. The economic strategy in the propaganda of the then Opposition, now imposed on Fraser and Lynch in government, is now being seen for what it was- a divisory tactic designed not to revive the economy but merely to legitimatise their seizure of power. Power without policy is what the Australian economy and the Australian people are suffering from. This Government seems to be locked into its own dogma. It is the victim of its own nefarious pre-election propaganda. Since December 1975 the Fraser Government to has meandered from one economic panacea to another, all without success. We were told during the election campaign that the merereturnof a Liberal-National Country Party government same would provide such a boost to business confidence that economicrecoverywould occur automatically, but it did not. Then in May last is year the Government announced the first of its public prunings 'in order to revive the economy'. This was to give added stimulus to the private sector. When this failed we were to be saved by a consumer led recovery-despit e the fact that the Government was attempting to cutrealwages and in fact reduce household disposable income by 3 per cent in the calendar year 1976. sumer led recovery never eventuated. It has never eventuated. In August the country was to be revived by an investment led recovery-at cost of $110m in foregone revenue and incentive to industry. This was so successful that to halt flow of capital out of the country and to provide the basis of an export led recovery the GovernIt ment devalued the dollar by 17V4 per cent, then revalued, then it revalued again, and again, still there was no recovery. This present Budget provides nothing that will boost the economy, nothing that will utilise 20 per cent idle capital of industry nor the 5.4 cent of the work force now unemployed. These are record figures. We are talking about the highest level of unused resources we have knownable since the Depression days. There is nothing the Budget to reduce inflation and to lift businessreverse confidence. On the contrary the continuing reduction in public expenditure will have conhas tractionary multiplier effects on the economy, leading to reduced Commonwealth revenues and thus limiting whatever reduction in the deficit was sought. The OECD in June of this year, in its publication Towards FuU Employment and Price Stability, said: We stress the importance of continuing efforts informed opinion that Budget deficits are not in themselves inflationary so long as they are no larger than needed to counterbalance an excess of savings in the private sector. As aU honourable members would be aware, vate savings have continued to increase in past 2 years, so the Government's obsession with reducing the deficit should be seen for what it mere ideological dogma. If we take public expenditure as a proportion of the gross domestic product-that is, the product of the cost of goods and services-w e find that on the most cent figures available Australian public sector spending represented 15.4 per cent of gross estic product whilst in the United States, the tion of laissez-faire capitalism, it reached 18.8 per cent, in Canada 19.3 per cent and in Gersioner many 19.7 per cent. The Organisation for Econoriginal omic Co-operation and Development recently reported that real government outlays have conhas tinued to grow in all seven largest member coun-expenditure tries in 1975-76 and that 'some acceleration government spending on goods and services in real terms can be expected during the current year'. Despite the lead shown by the OECD, this Government has again reduced its outlays. On its record of the past 21 months we can hardly expect that the Treasurer will be proved right and the major OECD nations wrong. The conLet me put it to the House this way. The Government is saying that the private sector of the economy is lethargic and that the spontaneity a is missing which would enable it to get off the ground, start moving again and take up the slack the in employment and the like. Yet it makes no effort on its own account to correct this situation. is virtually abdicating from the field by itwithdrawing public initiative which previously and had been in evidence. Whilst the Australian Government is taking this negative attitude and putting its head in the sand, comparable countries around the world are realising that the only the way in which declining economies can be arper rested, that bad situations can be improved, is for governments themselves to take initiatives. For that reason I have spelt out the fact that comparcountries are spending more of their gross in domestic product on things pubhc. Yet the is the situation in Australia. We know the net effect of that Local government expenditure been effectively cut by 5 per cent. We have heard what the honourable member for Mitchell said previously and we know thefiddlethat goes on in that regard. We know that indirect expenditure has been reduced. We can increase direct expenditure to local government but we have been able to verify that there has been a net 5 per cent cut in local government expenditure. We to convince have heard about education spendingMr Bradfield-That is wrong. pri Mr LES JOHNSON-Even the honourable the member who interjects cannot quibble with my contention that there has been no growth in eduis- cation spending. The promise of a 2 per cent growth has been broken, so there will be less school buildings. This is the point I am making. all We all know that health programs are down by 9 reper cent in real terms. The Sydney Press last night dealt with the great crisis in the adequacy domof hospital provisions in New South Wales and, basof course, there are similar problems around Australia. We know that the provision for pendwellings is down by 18 per cent and Abfunding is down by 16 per cent in real terms. Expenditure on urban public transport been cut by 25 per cent in real terms while on leisure and recreational facilities of has been cut by 60 per cent in real terms. We heard, the pandering by the honourable member for Mitchell about increased aid to sporting bodies but in regard to total expenditure on leisure and recreational facilities there has been an assault There has been a slashing by 60 per cent in real terms while urban programs have virtually disappeared altogether. What of the national sewerage program? In the previous Budget $50m was provided and in the last Labor Budget $120m was provided for sewerage. It was a great initiative. But this program has been totally abandoned in the present Budget at a time when we expect the Government to stimulate employment opportunities. There has been a great slashing of migrant services in terms of education, welfare, health and language training. We know of the way in which commitments to growth centres have been mutilated with promises broken in regard to the Albury-Wodonga, Holsworthy and BathurstOrange projects. Heaven knows where the young people are going to live. We know about the lovely situation which is represented by Canberra housing opportunities but we will never see planning and conditions like that elsewhere unless the Federal Government accepts its responsibilites in other parts of Australia. We are finding this retrograde tendency taking place at a time when masses of young Australians, many of whom are highly qualified and well-trained, are unable to get a job while the Minister for Construction (Mr MCLeay) is apparently prepared just to say: 'They have some capacity as individuals in the area of private enterprise but we as Australians in our corporate sense are inept and inadequate'. That is what he is saying and the Government on behalf of the people is prepared to sit idly by and allow this situation to go on. The Minister is wiping his eyes. That demonstrates the hilarity with which he treats this subject and the indifference which characterises the attitude of the Government. If the Government is to get the economy moving there will need to be a real demonstration of cern for the Australian people and real initiatives from the Government. I could continue this great list of examples simply to demonstrate my assertion that the Government is abdicating in the face of a very great crisis. The fact of the matter is that the Government has added 67,000 more Australians to the ranks of the unemployed in the last 12 months. Despite the fact that 806,000 Australians were unemployed for some period during 1976, despite the fact that the young are grossly over-represented in the ranks of the unemployed, despite the high rate of unemployment among migrants and the outrageously high level of unemployment among Aboriginals, this Budget offers nothing to alleviate unemployment. There are no wideranging job creation schemes, there is no stimulus to the construction industry, no injection of funds for capital works. Instead there are insignificant increases in retraining schemes, a reduction in spending on apprenticeship training and no increased assistance for technical and further education for vocational training notwithstanding the fact that the unemployment benefit paid to the young unemployed represents over 200 per cent more than the total allocation for all vocational training. It is now clear, as plain as a pikestaff, that the Government's ideological commitment to reducing the deficit, a commitment it locked itself into by political point scoring during 1974 and 1975, will put at risk the futures of thousands of young Australians. Despite the fact that up to 10 per cent of would be school leavers have stayed on at school for the past two years and the same number or more will do so again this year, nearly 100,000 additional young Australians will seek to enter the work force this December. What will they face? There will be job ratios in metropolitan areas of one vacancy to 50 applicants if they are lucky while in some non-metropolitan areas that ratio rises in some cases to one vacancy for every 600 persons. There will be average periods without work of over 18 weeks with precious little counselling in job preparation or assistance to cope with the continued rejection ofjob applications. The social and psychological effect on these young people will scar many for life. Their social aspirations and futures will be diminished, and they are diminished because this Government is more concerned with profits than with people. As this Budget is put into effect the bankruptcy of philosophical and economic panaceas will be demonstrated. The Government has run its race. As far as the Opposition is concerned, con- the sooner the people have the opportunity to judge the Government's sorry record the better it will be for the future of this country and for all Australians.",69
138,Mr BRADFIELD,URANIUM,"In a little over 18 months members of the Opposition who did so much to destroy the economy of this country have suddenly become experts. The honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) who has justfinishedhis speech will have the argument which he put forward put to rest by somefigureswhich I have here. I am delighted that the Budget which has been brought down has been able to give rehef to the Australian people particularly at a ume when continuing annual deficits have caused massive borrowing programs to be initiated. Under the circumstances which have existed over recent years I thought that a Budget similar to that of August last year would be the best that we could expect. But we got something much more generous. As the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) said, this Budget is tough on inflation and easy on people. Despite what the honourable member for Hughes said, spending is up 10.S per cent. With the rehef which we have been able to give to the Australian people the deficit has been reduced to $2.2 billion. I want to talk more about deficits a little later on and illustrate to the Australian people the problems these deficits have been causing. How disappointing this Budget must have been to the predictors of gloom when the Budget document became known. Still these peoplemany members of the media and of the Opposition-canno t swallow their pride. They will not admit their errors and give the Budget the praise it deserves. We have to cast our minds back only a few weeks to all these rumours and false predictions which were being made. There were the usual rumours, for example, that the Budget will be increasing the prices of cigarettes and alcohol. There were rumours about the amount available for medical research to be cut, an increase in the Medibank levy, cuts in support to hospital funding and pharmaceutical benefits to be abolished. One can go on and on. The means test was to be reinstated on pensions. Not one of these rumours was true. How disappointing it must have been to all the people who predicted these things. The Australian people do not deserve the unnecessary suffering which incorrect reporting and rumours of this type cause. I mentioned the Budget deficit of $2.2 billion. Over the last few years we have had quite massive deficits. Only recently in some of the conversations with people in my electorate they tended to sayMr Groom-They have a good member, too.",72
139,Mr BRADFIELD,URANIUM,"I thank the honourable member for Braddon. People asked: 'Is it normal that we always run such a large deficit?' People forget and do not really understand the problems which a deficit causes. They think it is normal to have deficits of billions of dollars. I have taken out a few figures on Budget deficits which go back over the last 10 years and which show a distinct pattern. Let us go back 10 years to 1967-68 when we had a Budget deficit of $642m. I shall read out thesefigures.As I said, in 1967-68 the deficit was $642m. The next year it was $385m. The following year it was $191m. Then, in the year 1970-71, we got very close to a break even figure as the deficit was only $9m. In the next year it went back to $134m. Then the rot started to set in. We got away from this continual history of having moderate deficits and the deficits went up to$709m,$2,666mMr Groom-When was that?",73
140,Mr BRADFIELD,URANIUM,"This was when our predecessors came to office and started tampering with the economy. They started to play the Father Christmas act and to spend all the money which belonged to the Australian taxpayers. But there is still worse to come. In the following year, 1975-76, the deficit was $3,586m. Of course, the Opposition says that since we have been in power things have not improved. In 1976-77, the start of our reign, at least we got the deficit down by nearly $ 1,000m to $2,740m. Our estimate for this year is down another $500m to $2,217m. As thosefiguresshow, Australia has never known such massive Budget deficits. I tell the Australian people now that we just do not pull the money out of thin air. It comes through heavy borrowing programs. It comes through taxing the people. Taxing the people is exactly what the Opposition did when it was the Government. The honourable member for Hughes mentioned unemployment. He mentioned how disastrous it has been since we have been in power. He said that we had increased unemployment. I forget thefigurehe gave. We have been in power almost two years and unfortunately unemployment has increased by one per cent. It is said that that is something which is unacceptable. The Opposition, in one year of its reign as Government, increased unemployment by almost 3 per cent. Mr FitzPatrick-What are thefigures?Give us the figures.",73
141,Mr BRADFIELD,URANIUM,"I have thefigures.When the honourable member's party came to government unemployment was 99,300. In the year 1973-74 your party started off with an unemploymentfigureof 105,000 and almost doubled it to 201,000, an increase of 90 per cent in one year. If you do not think we have improved the situation I point out that we have stopped this spiralling growth of unemployment. We have notfinishedwith it yet. We will improve it more and more until we get unemployment down. You people should not talk. Mr Keith Johnson-Do not improve it too much or you will have everybody out of work.",73
142,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URANIUM,Mr Jarman)Order! I remind the House that interjections are out of order. I ask the honourable member for Barton and members of the Opposition to address their remarks through the Chair.,73
143,Mr BRADFIELD,URANIUM,"Than k you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I turn to some otherfigureswhich once again illustrate that the economy has turned. We have turned back the disastrous trends which are found in the indicators by people who read the economy. We are turning from the disastrous levels which were seen in the reign of the previous Government. Much has been said about the fact that Australian manufacturing industry has become uncompetitive. This is one of the reasons for the unemployment which we have with us today. There are many ngures which illustrate and back up the fact that Australian industry has become uncompetitive. This is one of the reasons why we were forced to devalue by 17.5 per cent in November last year. I add in passing that had we not devalued by 17.5 per cent the economy would be in worse shape today than it is. There has been a benefit and a stimulus to Australian industry as a result of that devaluation. I turn to wage increases as a comparison with increases in the consumer price index. In 1972-73 in the reign of the now Opposition the consumer price index increased by approximately 6 per cent. Average weekly earnings increased by 9 per cent, which is a reasonable figure. I have no objection to people earning money and having their wages and salaries increased as the consumer price index goes up. I do not place any restrictions on that whatsoever. I like to see people earn more and more money. I like to see Australian people have the opportunity to increase their living standards. In the following year 1973-74 the consumer price index increased by 13 per cent. StiU within the bounds of reasonable tolerance the average weekly earnings went up by 16.3 per cent which is about 3 per cent above the increase in the consumer price index. Then we had two disasters. In 1974-75 the consumer price index rose by an unsatisfactory 16.8 per cent. Average weekly earnings rose by almost 26 per cent. This was where the trouble started. This was the final straw, the final naU the coffin, which made many of our industries non-competitive with overseas industries. It made things harder for us to export our goods. It increased the number of imports. The consumer price index, another indicator that I have mentioned in conjunction with the average weekly earnings ngures, clearly shows that the present Government is making headway in its fight against inflation. Last August the Treasurer, in his Budget Speech, said that inflation was the number one enemy of the economy. He has always said that, I heard the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam), and others in their speeches on the Budget, say that the rate of inflation is on the way up again. There is nothing in anyfigureswhich would indicate that. figures that 1I have show that the rate of inflation is on the way down. In about March 1975, before we came to government, the inflation rate was in excess of 16 per cent. For the March 1975 quarter it was 16.7 per cent. It held at about that figure. It rose to 16.8 per cent. From that time it started to fall. A perusal of thefiguresfor the various quarters shows that it came down to 15.4 per cent in the June 1976 quarter, 14.6 per cent in the September 1976 quarter, 10.8 per cent in the December 1976 quarter and 10.2 per cent in the March 1977 quarter. Although the Commonwealth Statistician has not put out the consumer price indexfiguresfor the June quarter this year, a recent study by my colleague the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) shows that figures in the price deflator would accurately indicate that the rate of inflation for the quarter ended June would be something like 9.4 per cent. He said that yesterday. It is back down to single digit figures. If that is not an achievement in a little over 18 months by this Government I do not know what is, and I do not know how any member of the Opposition can say that we have ruined the economy. The people of Australia know who ruined the economy. I come now to some of the generous advantages in the Budget. The Budget was said to have been easy on people. I point out that this Government understands the plight of people in need in Australia and always wants to help, but one can never give people all they want. I can never provide all the things that my wife suggests we should buy. A country has the same problem. Nevertheless, within the bounds of these problems, this Government has been generous. Total expenditure in the 1977-78 Budget on social security is $7,248m. That is an increase of $817m on last year'sfigure.This program has aUowed pensions to continue to be increased in Une with in the increase in the consumer price index. That is a mUestone for the pensioners of Australia who no longer have to fight for their increases. Through the generosity of this Government the pensions are automatically adjusted as the consumer price index rises. Let us look at some of the other areas, at the new pension rates and at what has happened. Expenditure on pensions and allowances has been increased in this Budget by $440m. Let us look at the new pension rates that will become applicable from November, which is not very far away. The single rate wiUrisefrom $47.10 to $49.30 a week, and the married rate willrisefrom $78.50 to $82.20 a week, I know that many pensioners in my area will certainly benefit handsomely from this increase. The Let us look at the expenditure on health. The honourable member for Hughes said that we had decreased the amount of money available for health purposes. Total outlays for health $2,813.8m, an increase of 10.7 per cent on 1976-77figure.Education also got a mention. The total funds for educauon have been substanthis tially increased. One has to read into the figures for education the fact that this Government substantially increased the amount of money allocated to the various States. There is no way that one can look at this Government's expendishould ture on education without looking at the same time at the massive increases that the State governments have had. Apart from universities and colleges of advanced education, the Federal Government supplies only a topping up process for education which is the responsibility States. This year it is estimated the States another 18 per cent in untied grants-mone y that they have at their disposal to supply to education Deputy if they wish. We recognise the fact-the stateHouse together ment has been made by the Minister for Educrossed swords on cation (Senator Carrick)-that will supply the same amount of money this year the opposite side of thenonourabie for universities and colleges of advanced cation. That is in real terms, in 1976-77 money know, values updated by the amount of inflation. He to stand MrupDeputy also made the statement that will supply an increase of 10 per cent for technihave beUeved inBudget cal education. That recognises where our future job shortages will be. In future the need will be for tradesmen. Apprentices in various trades rely on technical colleges for their education. Let me come to taxation. Much has been said about taxation. The new tax scale is a completely revised one. It phases out many of the multiple steps in the scale and decreases the number three. I point out that very little mention has been made of dependant rebates. We all have heard about the tax scales-the 32c in the dollar, and at $16,000 a surcharge of 14 per cent-bu very few people realise that as from 1 February next year the Government will index dependant deductions. Previously a taxpayer could claim a deduction of $500 for a spouse. This year will be increased to $555. The parent or parent-in-law, which was $452, will be increased to $501. The deduction fbr an invalid relative will rise from $226 to $251. There are other increases in deductions. Apart from the adjustments to the tax scale, the Government's generosity has been extended to people who have dependants so that those people can claim more money for their dependants. I would like to mention the money to be available for local government. Last year the Federal Government, mainly through its new federalism pohcy, allocated in general purpose grants for local government $ 140m. The honourare able member for Hughes said that somehow or the other we have reduced thatfigure.The figure which we have allocated for local government year is $165m. That is an increase of 18 per cent and is well above the current inflation rate. I has know that the three local councils in my areaHurstville, Rockdale and Kogarah councilsshould benefit handsomely from this increase. It help also people in my area and throughout Austraha, at least inasmuch as they will not have to pay substantially more rates. Regardless of all the untruths that the Opposition has put forward, this is a good Budget for the people of Australia. We have rounded the corner on the of the economy and the people and economy of will get Australia will go ahead in the future. Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (5.35)- Mr Speaker, you and I have been in this on many occasions. We have many occasions. I have crosin real terms we sed swords with many members on edubeen a clean thoughfiercebattle. has House, but it always You must Speaker, how hard it is for me in this Parliament tonight and conin real terms we centrate on the after seeing things that I before my eyes. all of my Ufe being pulled down I refer to the disgraceful entry into this House this afternoon by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). He came in unannounced, without informing the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam), mentioned things that the Leader of the Opposition had said, then to denigrated that man's character. I do not see how we can expect to have law and order in this country if that is the way that the No. 1 citizen performs. I hope that he will have the decency to t come back into this chamber and apologise for his performance. I am deeply wounded. It is only because of my breeding that I keep going, regardless of the unfairness of the battle. I thank that my friend the honourable member for Sydney deduction for a (Mr Les MCMahon)Mr Bradfield-He is my friend too.",73
144,Mr FITZPATRICK,URANIUM,"I am glad to hear that. My colleague, the honourable member for Sydney, reminded us that the 1977-78 Budget is simUar to the 1976-77 Budget. I thank him for that reminder. I can remember when the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) came into this House in August 1976 made and introduced the 1976-77 Budget. He made great promises for the future-greate r concern for the needy, less unemployment, lower inflation. He became so enthusiastic that he claimed that there were already signs of recovery and that that Budget would carry us further along the road. I do not accuse the Treasurer of smoking opium but he cenainiy has been in a long sleep. He woke up in time to bring down the 1977-78 Budget, when he repeated his performance on presenting the 1976-77 Budget. He made great promises for the future. I ask the people of this country: What were the great promises that we received in 1976 and again m 1977? We have 340,000 unemployed and thefigureis still rising. There have been greater profits for the multinationals and tax cessions for those people who do not need them. But there has been a deliberately prolonged recession for a generation of young Australians, who have been cheated of hope and respect right at the time in their lives when they need these things most. Soul destroying circumstances are being thrust upon them by a government which is concerned only about multinational comE anies. More than one-third of the young people etween the ages IS and 19 years are unemployed, embittered and disappointed. Where is the Government's great concern for the needy? Since this Government came to power there has been a 30 per cent rise in unemployment and there is no end to this rise in sight. In June 1977, 86,000 more people were unemployed than were unemployed in June 1975. Where is the lower level of unemployment? Where is the lower inflation? The Government has no idea of what is happening to the ordinary Australian. I shall tell honourable members why it has no idea: It is because the Government is blinded by its hatred of trade unionists. It has brought into this House the most vicious industrial legislation that this country has ever experitells enced, all to meet a phoney crisis. Mr Groom-What do you say about these radical trade unionists?",75
145,Mr FITZPATRICK,URANIUM,"I shall tell the honourable member what I say. The Government should be doing things which will unite the country so that people will pull together. That is the only way to restore confidence. That is the only way that people will stop saving their money and will invest, so that more jobs will be created, so that there will be more confidence and so that the standard of living will improve. As long as this Government remains bunded by its hatred of trade unionists and as long as it tries to deceive the people by claiming that wage increases have brought about the disgraceful economic situation, this country will remain divided. No one will have confidence to spend. There will be no investment and no better way of life for the average Australian. The way to restoration of confidence, the creation of more jobs and the improvement of living standards lies in humane and responsible balance between the competing needs. This Government thinks only of big business. All kinds of help are given to the multinationals but nothing to the average Australians other than greater and still greater abuse of their freedoms and more and more unemployment. What a way to ask for more co-operation! What a way to ask con- people to have more confidence! As the honourable member for Sydney said, we are destroying confidence. What are the profit takers-the group the Government has helped most-doin g to reduce inflation and unemployment? The following figures will give honourable members some indication of that. Australian Consolidated Industries Ltd made a profit of $8,657,000 in 1976 and $29,642,000 in 1977-a 242 per cent increase. Comalco Ltd made a profit of $9,977,000 in 1976 and $23,578,000 in 1977-a 136.3 per cent increase. But the biggest profit taker in Australia, of course, is the Utah Development Company, which is almost wholly American owned. It made a profit of $48m in 1974 and $137m in 1977. That company employs 3,000 people; so each of its employees returned it a profit of over $45,000-about 5 times average annual earnings. Yet this Government has the audacity to claim that the workers' wages are causing inflation. What a lot of rubbish! If that were not enough, the Budget Speech us that the Government has removed some of the coal tax. This will give these companies another $24m this year and $27m in a full year. What a performance! To make matters worse, as John Byrne, writing in the Australian Financial Review of 28 July 1977 pointed out, the Utah Development Company shipped more than $150m back home to the United States during the past year. What a performance! Why do not honourable members opposite hang their heads in shame? The Government certainly has done a lot to assist big business but what has it done for the average Australian, except to take away thousands of jobs, to cut back on educational opportunities, to reduce health services, to levy for Medibank and to place the blame for the resulting economic mess on the trade unions? What a performance! True wage indexation with price restraint would have automatically checked excessive wage rises, without damaging Uving stanthe dards, witnout destroying the hopes of young Australians, without splitting the nauon wide apart. The Hayden Budget was proving that. That is one of the reasons why we have seen bringing forward of the farrago which has been called the Khemlani affair. That is why it was brought on by the present Government parties. That is why they had to get the Whitlam Govern the ment sacked. What about the great divider, the Prime Mininterjecting, ister? He is the greatest divider this country has ever seen. He blames wage increases for the Treasurer's economic mess. He blames wages at a time when wages have fallen. Real householdThe disposable income fell by 3.S per cent during 1976. Yet he still blames wages for the economic mess. I say that he is a victim of his own ganda. But very few Australians have been fooled. The gallup polls should prove that to honest observer. My friend who interjects is rightmuch in saying that in August 1976 and in August we heard the same Budget Speech. It expressed great concern for the needy, talked about ing inflation and creating greater opportunities. How needy is Utah? How needy are the uranium producers? How needy are petroleum people? They are the only people for afternoon. whom the Government has done anything. I am glad to see one member of the National is now Country Party in the chamber. The National it Country Party had to get into the act. It could not few Australians will natural do anything with the Liberal Party so it thought it would get a gimmick of its own. It said: 'We have got a small business policy'. It forgot all Party about the in-lighting with the Liberal Party and never they came up with this gimmick. I do not know wherethink members of the National Country Party spend the parliamentary recess, but they certainly not go into the smaU country towns, because more small businesses in country towns are out of existence than ever before in the history the nation. If honourable members opposite not believe me they should look at what Mr Eugene Falk, the Chairman of the Victorian one Small Business Development Corporation, said. about He made this claim: The number of small business bankruptcies in Australia increasing and is currently in excess of 12,000 a year. That is what he told delegates to the annual ference of the Victorian Chambers of Commerce and Industry on 15 July 1977. That is not so ago. He went on to say: The number of small businesses being created is also declining. The cumulative effect of this is that Australian small businesses face extinction unless urgent help is given to turn tide. Mr Falk said that with eight miUion Australians dependent in one way or another on small the businesses it made good sense to do everything possible to help them during the present economic recession. That is what is happening in the country. That is the great gimmick adopted by National Country Party. That is the great performance. The great defenders of democracy try to stop me from speaking in this House by but they cannot do that. They know that for every Ue they tell about the Labor Party I will tell another truth about them. That is what they cannot stand. That is what they do not like. Leader of the National Country Party has given away the Country Party. He is no longer interested in Yarrawonga, but he does everypropathing he can for Utah. First the amount was $150m, and there is to be another $24m this anyyear, with $27m in a full year. He does not have interest in the market for butter fat but he 1977is doing everything he can for the market for uranium. He is not interested in fixing a decent reducmarket price for beef; but petroleum is a employment different matter, is it not? the Mr King-You did not listen to him this",76
146,Mr FITZPATRICK,URANIUM,The honourable member's leader buried the Country Party long ago; called the National Country Party. It is dying a death and its hour is near. Very mourn its passing. I am glad to see that one member of the National Country is in the chamber. No others are here. I ever thought that they were afraid of me. I might be hiding from Barry Cassell; he knows all about them. Honourable members do should read what Barry Cassell says about them.,77
147,Mr JAMES,URANIUM,"What did he say? going Mr FITZPATRICK - My goodness, it is too of shocking to mention. I think it could be said that do the Deputy Leader has not done much for the National Country Party, but at least he removed of its problems. It no longer has to worry campaign funds; it has got that sewn up. I am not here to judge and I do not want to say is anything about the Deputy Leader, but I think it is a well known fact that he is mixed up with conthings not only in this House but many things outside of this Parliament. I do not want to conlong demn him; I just ask honourable members to judge for themselves what the reports indicate. Mr Donald Cameron-Did you get money from Utah, or did you not?",77
148,Mr FITZPATRICK,URANIUM,Did I get any money? Mr Donald Cameron-Did you get money from Utah?,78
149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URANIUM,I remind the honourable member for Griffith that something he is not sitting in his right place. Interjections are out of order and he had from his own seat.,78
150,Mr FITZPATRICK,URANIUM,"I was just going to say capture that he is a good man at organising parties but in respond. Parliament he is below average in performance. Of course, honourable members opposite very cross when one mentions these things in the Inflation House. They are very shocked. Apparently one situation should not say some of these about when the late Rex Connor was a Minister on that side of the chamber. Innuendo innuendo was piled on his innocent head. They My own were not so particular in those days, were they? say that we all should pity the Prime Minister. He has his priorities wrong. He does some things in this House, but at least he is trying restore the economic situation. What chance expired. does he have when he is assisted by many of these no-hopers, these desperadoes? What about the family allowance? The afternoon Government made so much noise about what intended to do for families in 1976. It said that would replace the tax concession for children that all wives could receive this great family lowance. Every other tax concession has been indexed but the family allowance has not. What does Mrs Joan Adamson, President of the Women's Action Alliance, have to say on this subject? She said that by this move alone Government was robbing two-child families of $50 a year, three-child famiUes of $100 a year, and four-child famUies of $ 144 a year. That is matter in relation to which honourable members opposite made so much noise in 1976.1 thank honourable member for raising the matter and for reminding us of these things.

He said: I say with as much confidence as I can that people ate getting a bit tired ofit. That was reported in the 18-23 July issue of the National Times.

153,Unknown,URANIUM,Sitting suspended from 5.56 p.m.to8 p.m.,78
154,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,URANIUM,"This we have witnessed an incredible perit formance. It has been my pleasure, or disit pleasure, to listen to the debate. I have not heard so for a long time such whining, whingeing and cryaling over a Budget as I have heard over the Budget presented to this House by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) on behalf of the Government. The complaints that have come from the Opposition can only be categorised as pee-wee economics. the Like pee-wees, honourable members opposite have run around the bush picking up any Uttle tit-bits of food in order to digest it. They have thepicked up any information and digested it. After digesting it they have then put it forward as their the own considered proposition on the economic government of this country. This afternoon they mat-have had a field day complaining and whingeing the Budget. The tragedy is that they are so misinformed. Like that proverbial Uttle bird they have produced nothing. We know that any work to be done by a Budget is proportionate to the task which lies beThe task that lay before the Government needs to be understood. I do not say this as an I say it merely by way of presenting the facts to the Australian people. The historical facts are these: A unique position and task were presented to the Government. It had to perform two tasks. It had to resuscitate the Australian economy and at the same time it had to transfer resources from the public sector to the private sector. That is one of those technical economic terms. In fact it had to transfer resources from Government to households where people Uve and work, where they are born and where they die, where they are happy or unhappy. No government in AustaUan history has had to per1972. form two tasks at the same time. Let me give examples going over 40 years. When Lyons succeeded Scullin in the governbeen ment of this country Lyons did not have to perof form the two tasks of resuscitating the economy and transfering resources from the public sector to the private sector. He had to perform only first of those tasks. When Menzies succeeded Chifley he had only to transfer resources into decent rate of growth of the Australian economy. The economy was running well. Inflation was only incipient and the pubUc sector had not taken over. When Fraser succeeded Whitlam there had to be double tasks. I know that House in its fair mindedness would appreciate the double task that lay before this Government. Let me give an illustration. Illustrations make matters perfectly clear. When this ment came into power the country had gone through what would be described as a new expreciate perience. Economically it had gone through what was known as negflauon. It had a negative rate of growth of productivity and at the same time had a very high and a growing rate of inflation. new word had to be coined, even in this place, describe what occurred. In addition, Australian households were being robbed. They were being taken for aridewith every tax take. History comes to our protection the position. When Chifley went out of power every earned dollar that went into an Australian household had to surrender only 28c of that dolindex. lar to government. When Fraser followed Whitlam 37c was being taken out of every earned doUar in an Australian household. That position had to be reversed at the same time as attempting to resuscitate the Australian econprice omy. These facts are totaUy and completely ^controvertible. So I understand quite clearly why, in trying to clutch at a multitude of disparfurther. ate elements this afternoon, the Opposition descended into what I call pee-wee economics, increases grabbing bits of the Budget's information where it could but digesting nothing. Of course, there was another problem which the Government faced. A decent appreciation ofeconomic events in Australia over the last 30 years has to knowledge these facts. When an economy resuscitates from a trough to a peak there has always been a time lag. The time lags involved in every such resuscitation since World War II have been variously between the 18 and 27 months. I am referring to the 1951 period, to the 1955-56 period, to the events of late 1960 to 1963, to a small period from 1965 to 1966 and ofcourse from late 1970 to well into We know that the time lag on this occasion has been longer than it has been in the past. The time lag has been longer because the task has greater. Nevertheless there are clear signs success in resuscitating the Australian economy. One of them is quite clear. For example, let us look at the matter of inflation. This is one of the the great catalysts of depression throughout the world. The summary of the report of the a Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on producing stabUity in an economy as between inflation and unemployment acknowledged that such a time lag was involved, and such a time lag in order to be traversed this required that inflation be overcome. Just as one example I pick out of the air, yesterday there was released in this country the always quarterly estimates of national income and Governexpenditure. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr WUUs) would immediately apthe validity and the probity of the information in that document. If one calculates the rate of inflation from the quarterly estimates of it national income and expenditure released yesA terday one would know immediately the rate of to inflation as disclosed by that document. The impUcit price deflator, the total one, showed that the June on June-Jun e 1977 compared with June 1976-rat e of inflauon was 9.13 per cent. in describing Thesefigures are single digitfigures.If one refines those even a little more",78
155,Mr WILLIS,URANIUM,Tell us about the consumer price,79
156,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,URANIUM,"As the honourable member would know and as the Reserve Bank makes it clear in its own documents, the consumer price index has been following the implicit deflator down. The implicit price deflator has been leading the consumer price index down for a number of quarters. Let me go on a little If that calculation is adjusted for what is has known as the statistical discrepancy and the in stocks, the June to June rate of inflation was in fact 9.4 per cent. So those in the Opposition who said that a single digit rate of inflation was not obtainable must accept that their facts are not verifiable in terms of the data acproduced by the national income and expenditure details released yesterday. We ask only that those facts be acknowledged. They deserve to be acknowledged. The time lag is there. We know it is there and that it is longer than it has been in the past. But there are some people who say that resuscitating an economy can be like making love to an elephant. If there is success there result for years; if there is no success you can trampled m the rush.",79
157,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,URANIUM,How do you know that?,80
158,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,URANIUM,"The honourable memable ber for Hindmarsh can make his own personal judgments from his own experience. We know that thefirstapplies and not the second. I would now like to say something about taxation system that has been introduced by the Government. I can always have quarrels in detail concerning any taxation system. But if an econmade omy is to be resuscitated by means of a taxation system immediately it has to be acknowledged that the philosophy of that resuscitation is that has to be done predominantly through the assumptions household sector. Of course, there is an appropricism ate place for the public sector for the stabilisation of any economy. But the household sector has to, and will be and is, deputed to take a leading role in this respect.",80
159,Mr WILLIS,URANIUM,It is declining. Look at the Budget papers.,80
160,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,URANIUM,"No, it is not. When the Opposition was in power any worker on average earnings who was working and decided to take system. an extra day's overtime was up for $35 tp $40 a day in tax. Under the new rate of tax which will apply from February next year a worker in this same situation will receive an extra $12 to $15 day for the day's overtime that he would be wiuing to work. It is no wonder that so many people said that they would not work under old system.",80
161,Mr WILLIS,URANIUM,Why do you want them to work more overtime?,80
162,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,URANIUM,"To raise their standard sition. of living, to increase their household income, produce more goods for Australia prosperity of Australians will increase.",80
163,Mr WILLIS,URANIUM,Why don't you want to share the work around?,80
164,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,URANIUM,"The honourable memabout ber complains about working for 80 hours a week. He works overtime every week and he complains about it. That is part of the case that made on his behalf to the various tribunals. new tax system is designed to help those who are able to work. In addition, we should look at taxation multiplier, the multiplier which determiddle mines the amount which government receives way of taxation for every one per cent increase that a worker receives by way of salary. Under the previous Government, for every one per cent increase in salary that was sustained by a person is no the increase in government revenue was of the be order of two per cent. It was the highest multiplier in Austrahan history. This was not under Chifley, not under Scullin but under Whitlam, and under Whitlam as defended by the honourmember for Gellibrand. Under this Government, because of tax indexation, the only increases that were sustained occurred when there was an increase in salary that was a real the increase in excess of the rate of inflation. One needs to remember when a criticism is of the taxation system that the Opposition, both when in government and through its economic committee, opposed the principle and the it facts of tax indexation. One of the unstated of the Press when it has run critiof the present taxation system is that the Opposition in government would have implemented tax indexation or that it was in fact in favour of it. It was neither. It argued against tax indexation. Its economic committee examined a paper against tax indexation prepared by Pat Lanigan, a former Deputy Commissioner of Taxation. This Government has adopted the principle of indexation and has made it an integral part of its own taxation Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that you are listening to every word that has been spoken in this a Parliament. It would be immediately obvious to you, therefore, that the tax system which this Government is implementing has the lowest the multiplier as an inducement to government revenue of any system we have had for many years. It is of the order of half the multiplier to government revenue that existed under the Opposition. We do not want to criticise the OppoWe only ask that in a spirit of fairness and to in a spirit of honesty the Opposition acknowlso that the edge what has been done. This afternoon it was my pleasure, or my displeasure, to Usten to clever people from the Opposition. They are all clever and they spoke the work force. They spoke about the rate of increase of job opportunities in Australia. In reading Budget Statement No. 2 they forgot one is thing, namely, that the rate of increase of the The employed Australian work force June on June this year wUlreversethe worse trend set in train the by the previous Government beginning in the of 1974. History always represents some by useful information. The period from June 1974 to December 1975 was one in which there was the greatest decline in the employed Australian work force at any time subsequent to the demob-enemy ilisation of the Australian armed forces in 1944-45. The employed Australian declined by 60,000 in the last 18 months of the previous Government. In thefirst18 months this Government there was a further decline the work force of the order of 27,000 and of course we are not happy about that. But my goodness, it is less than half the previous Government's performance. But from June 1977 to June 1978, on the most conservative calcufriend lations in economic statement No. 2, the Kevin employed work force is deputed to increase something in excess of90,000 people. We want to be more. We would like it to be more. But we ask only that what is to be accomplished by thisearthers. Budget be acknowledged. The trend has been reversed. Even on the mostdisemployed conservative target, even if there is to be excess of a two per cent rate of growth in the totalTranslated Australian product, the reverse will be quite solute in terms of the performance of the premonth. vious Government. I suggest to members of the Opposition that they be fair, that they always knowledge the time lag that is involved in termsinflation ofeconomic events. It has been my intention this evening to proinherited duce a number of hard facts which might dispokery place members of the Opposition from the preconceived notions they have as to the way which the economy is to be managed. I hope thesystem. hard facts will be acknowledged for the hard facts that they are. The rate of inflation than the rate that applied under the previous Government. The rate of increase of the attack employed work force represents a total reverGovernment's sal- a complete reversal-of what was the preinflauon rate was vious Government's abysmal performance. I can Labor Party did not remember the honourable member for ployment was at a level GeUibrand, who is constantly interrupting me this evening, defending the position when the either. work force was declining by 60,000 during the samp^ last 18 months of the Labor Administration. He world. was a very loyal member of his party. He was not be able to be obfuscated or confused by the facts. do Loyalty to his own Party required-and it is a outside great quality to have-that he in fact defend whatoutmoded was occurring. I produce only some of these factswhat the economy to make clear what is happening what has happened and what is going to happenwas increasing. Some ofProductivity over the succeeding nine months. There is an racecourse suggestion concerning a socialist government. I have all the racecourses in Brisbane in my electorate. The suggestion I mention also relates to tax. People say that if you enemy, give him a racehorse and he will spend the rest of his life working for it. If you have you should also give him a socialist government and he will spend the rest of his life work force working for it. of Mr BRYANT (WUls) (8.20)-There would be in many worse things than working for a sociaUst government. It certainly is better to be working for a sociaUst government than to be out of work under a Liberal-National Country Party conservative government. I have Ustened to my the honourable member for LUley (Mr Cairns) for the last 20 minutes. I was abby solutely astonished at the pre-Copernican obitscurantism which he brings to the considerauon of economic affairs. He is the last of the flatI Ustened to his statements about the improvement in the employment situation. You might put it this way: People are not being as fast as they were before or at the only insame relative rate that they were before. into English that means that there are abnot so many going out of work so rapidly every To talk like that is to be totally insensitive to the social needs of the economy. The honourac-able member talked about the inflation rate. The rate now is sUghtly different from the inflation rate that the present Government but it is composed of all sorts ofjiggery with the tax systems, Medibank and various other things. I have watched with interest inover the last few months the debate on the tax I am not quite sure what the tax system is and how it is worked out and it is quite obvious is far lessthat nobody else does either. I want to take up the issue of the continuing on the work force and on the Labor record. It is true that in 1975 the at a level which we of the like. It is true that unemwhich we did not Uke But it is also true that these things were a of what was happening in the rest of the It is my view that governments ought to to do better in managing the economy. I not believe that there are any objective forces the management of government if we apply our wit and our wisdom to them instead of economic theories. Let us consider was Uke that the present in Australia, Government took over. the increases per person were draoldmatic and I will give some detaUs in a moment.",80
165,Mr HODGMAN,URANIUM,You went backwards in 1974. have an Mr BRYANT-We would have to go backwards pretty fast to keep up with this Governanment's performance. Household savings were at an all time high in proportion to the gross domestic product. We had high overseas balances. Exports were greater than imports. Our average weekly earnings and their buying capacity were amongst the highest in the world. There is no doubt about those things. I will refer to just a couple of these issues. Let us consider first the question of productivity. One of the most depressing features of the present Government's behaviour-and frankly I cannot understand how the people of Australia stand for it-is the continuing attack upon the work force and the continual pressure on its living standards. The whole burden of this multi-page document called the Budget Papers and the Budget Statements is to lower the living standard of the ordiseries nary average Australian.,81
166,Mr YATES,URANIUM,No .,82
167,Mr BRYANT,URANIUM,Of course it is. Let us consider thefiguresfor 1973 and relate them to the figures for 1972. How many bottles of milk could one buy with average weekly earnings in 1972? One could buy about 100 more bottles of milk in istics 1975. In 1972 it took 26 weeks' pay to buy the cheapest car on the road and in 1975 it took about 20 weeks' pay. I could go through a whole catalogue of things but I do not have time tonight to educate honourable members opposite. Let us consider this question of productivity because it is the very burden of the Government's comduce plaint about us. I will read a few facts and figures that I have taken basically from my own electormuch ate and places I know.,82
168,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URANIUM,Mr Lucockjemployed Order! It might be advisable to allow the honourable member for Wills to make his speech without assistance from honourable members on my right.,82
169,Mr BRYANT,URANIUM,"I am gratified for your protecemployees tion, Mr Deputy Speaker; I am easily continuously. mtimidated by the people opposite. It would be a worthwhile exercise for honourable members opposite to take a trip to Commonwealth Brickthe works (Canberra) Pty Ltd, a government owned company operating in this city of Canberra. Government that I supported re-equipped it and it went into business again last year. I think my friend at the table, the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Staley), unveiled a plaque there when he went out to open it. It is a magnificent industrial operation. The board of the Brick1975 works searched the world tofindthe most effec10 tive and efficient instruments for making bricks. Three years ago, before we started on that projshift ect, it took about 100 people to produce about 500,000 bricks a week. Now I think that company has a capacity to produce 700,000 bricks a week and employs 35 people. The Government and its supporters say that it is the cost oflabour that is killing Australia. Those 35 employees turn out about 700,000 bricks a week if they are going at full bore. That represents $2,000 worth of bricks per employee, including typists and the manager. On average they get paid between $160 and $170 for that work. Yet the Government and its supporters have the effrontery to say that it is wages that are the principal cost. I turn now to another example. I visited a container firm operating in my electorate. Over recent years it has installed new equipment. In one of operations it increased production and the wage cost of the operation has fallen from $100 per hour seven years ago to $20 per hour now. That is a reduction in the absolute cost of production. It reduced the number of people in the operation from about 12 to 2. Let us consider something with which we all are familiar and which is one of the characterof modern society. I am not saying that the Labor Government produced it but it is totally erroneous to suggest that in any way we inhibited it. Wherever possible we encouraged it and it is one of the factors that we have to face. The size of the workforce is going to decrease absolutely and relatively to the rest of the population to prothe amount of goods we want because the consumer capacity of the people of Austraha is less now than their production capacity. Let us consider Trans-Australia Airlines. In 1962 TAA carried 660,000 passengers and it 4,200 employees. In 1967 it carried 943,000 passengers and had 6,000 employees. Relatively thosefiguresare much the same. But let us consider the dramatic change in the last 10 years. It now has 7,800 employees and carries more man 4,000,000 passengers. The number of per 1,000 passengers is falling Even the much maligned seamen have done same. I have somefigureshere but perhaps honourable members would take my word for it The because there are a few otherfiguresI want to give. Let us take coal. The situation is dramatic. Let us consider the productivity of the people involved in the coal industry. Underground 20 years ago each man at the workface produced about 2.8 tons of coal per hour per man shift. By thefigurehad increased to approximately tons. If we consider the open-cut operation production has gone from 6.8 tonnes per man to nearly 30 tonnes per man shift at the maximum. That coal is worth about $45 per tonne, so let us say that coal worth $1,200 is produced each man shift. Those coalminers are probably getting paid $200 a week. The Government and its supporters have the effrontery to say that the real cost of production in Australia and the real threat to our stability and to the economy is the high cost of wages. I have other figures here relating to the workforce on the wharves and all the rest of it. Just consider the implications of the coal industry and the Utah organisation. Last year I think Utah made a profit before tax of $240m.",82
170,Mr YATES,URANIUM,Good .,83
171,Mr BRYANT,URANIUM,"'Good', says my honourable friend opposite.",83
172,Mr YATES,URANIUM,It did not make a loss.,83
173,Mr BRYANT,URANIUM,"No, that is right. But who did make the loss? That company has 3,000 emit ployees. Each of those employees produced our $80,000 of the year's profit for that company. Our friend from Queensland, Mr Bjelkethe Petersen, objects to the demand that seamen be paid Australian rates of pay. Let us consider another aspect that is familiar to do the arithmetic on it from the records available to us. The total return from Telecom Australia taking into account profit and interest was about $400m. Telecom has 80,000 employees so that is about $5,000 profit per employee. Yet Telecom will try to chisel people out of their tea money. Australia Post, which did not make quite as drapacity matic a profit as that, will stop the whole postal works by refusing to give people a reduction in their working time. What I am saying is that the attack upon the work force for its incompetence in production and because its wages are extravagant is totally erroneous and against the facts. This country was handed over to honourable members opposite in a powerful economic situation relative to other countries. They had at their disposal one of the world's most wealthy countries, as indeed we year. did. There are very few resources which we need to obtain from any other country. Even our engineers are high class, and some of them get into this House. The only people who seem to be slipof ping a bit are those who give us economic advice. We are bound not to change our whole well philosophy from a money-oriented to a resource - oriente d philosophy. I will not say tonight I know what the answers are but I do know the answers which are continually trotted out and the reasons given for the state of the omy are not correct. Let us consider some of the things which we have done over the last few years. This Government has done them and we have done them. We reduced tariffs, the assumption being that this would bring into the country cheaper goods which would create competition and prices would come down. But they did not. We put up interest rates, but not to the level they are now, the assumption being that to make money dearer would put less pressure on goods and on the supply of things such as housing, that it would create more compeution in one way or another and reduce prices. But it did not. In the last two Budgets we have seen a dramatic attack upon government expenditure, the theory being that if we reduce government spending we reduce the drain on the taxation system and the drain on the public exchequer; we reduce the deficit, we transfer funds to the private sector, and everything will take off. But this has not happened and will not happen because the most erroneous of convictions- I only associate myself with it in this House because I am pan of the apparatus of Parliament-is that by doing these things the private sector will take up the slack in the area which is not as strong as it ought to be. That is a us all. We can totally erroneous theory. The belief that government expenditure is evil or wrong or has an insidious effect upon the community's welfare is totally wrong. As I see it, the manufacturing capacity of this countiy per person related to our consumption is greater than we need. Some 20 per cent of our manufacturing cais not used. I know that our primary industry is remarkably efficient. In some areas of production it is more efficient than primary industry in the rest of the world. In some areas productivity per person is greater than it is in anywhere else in the world. I looked up some figures the other day- I have not been through all the figures for all time-and it is my impression that this is the only country which has produced more than one tonne of wheat per head of population in one year. That happened about seven or eight years ago and I think it will happen again this What is the situation with regard to public expenditure? This is the very basis of the supply all our social needs-education , health and all welfare services. However, the Government may discard them all by saying that people ought to look after themselves, or that when they are that sick let them pick themselves up, or that when that they need education let them pay for it themselves-the y can all go to Melbourne Grameconmar. The Government may discard its responsibility to provide those services in favour of having material things. In this country government sources supply nearly all of the power. Theyprovide nearly all of the water supply. Government is the fundamental owner, controller and developer of the communications system. In almost an absolute sense it is the principal supplier of transport, even to the extent of supplying roads for private trucks and others to operate on, supplying the railway system, the wharves, the maintenance of airfields and the ownership of principal airlines. Government utilities are the skeleton, the framework, and the very heart of Australian productivity. Stop the electricity supply and we stop the country. Stop the telecommunications system and we stop the country. Yet in the last two Budgets the whole operation of the economy has been grinding to a halt because of the prescription for stagnation that has been written into the principle which the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) has applied to the Budget-the reduction in public expenditure. I am not sure how we should go about overcoming the deficiencies in our economic system to allow us to take the great wealth that is in the country-and there is a very big money stock in the banking system-and apply it to the public utilities. However, I have some ideas. For instance, in the case of the Commonwealth Brickworks Ltd the Commonwealth guaranteed the loan and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia lent the money. Before the House or before the Senate there is a Bill which will give guarantees to private schools. The schools will borrow the money from the banking system and the Commonwealth will guarantee the loans. We do that already in the Territories. It may well be that this is a way to tap the great reserves in banking system, in the trading banks and particularly in the savings banks, and apply those reserves to our needs. It is absolutely ridiculous that in a country which has adequate funds available in the system and is extraordinarily fortunate in the resources available to it, which has a first class administative system and a very good monitoring system throughout the country in the form of the banks, private and public, and the branches of banking, we cannot do almost whatever we want to do wherever we want to do it. We have failed to take up the challenge. We are in a time of total economic and social change. The world is different from what it was 10 or 15 years ago. I agree in many respects with the sort of things which the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentwonh) said about it. We have to change our way of thinking. That is why I address my remarks to the honourable member for Lilley. He is living in the past, as is the Government. How on earth can we justify to successive generations letting the economy slow to a halt, letting people become unemployed and redundant, allowing our great manufacturing capacity to lie idle at a time when our railway system needs complete rehabilitation. If tonight we were to ask the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd to produce for us another 200 million tonnes of steel so that we could set out a rehabilitation program for the railway system, BHP could produce it without any trouble at all. It would not need to introduce new investment or anything of that nature. One of the things that disheartens me about the present situation is the utter intellectual sterility of the economic debate. I suppose that I am a philosophic agnostic in this regard. I do not believe what I read in documents such as the Budget Papers about the absolute effect of the money supply or the absolute effect of interest rates or the absolute effect of deficits. MrO'Keefe-Oh!",83
174,Mr BRYANT,URANIUM,"I suggest to the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe) that he do what I did and ask the Parliamentary Library- I will ask the Library for him if he does not know where it is-to prepare a list showing deficits, inflation rates, gross domestic products and increases in money supplies over the last 10 or 15 years in 10 or 11 countries which are equivalent to our own, and then find the absolute correlation. In most respects the kind of analysis that is necessary shows that the correlation is not there. I hope that we will turn our intellectual attention to this question. I do not think we can the any longer tolerate our friend from Flinders, the Treasurer, running this country. I think the Budget is a prescription for stagnation. It inflicts sacrifices upon the people of this country who can least afford it, namely, the Aboriginals, the migrants in my electorate and the people who need State school education. These are the people who suffer the most grievous disabilities. The Budget means a transfer of wealth from the work force to the corporation. I think it is a totally immoral document.",84
175,Mr OKEEFE,URANIUM," Iriseto supf ort the Budget brought down by the Treasurer Mr Lynch). It provides for an estimated expenditure of $26,656m which is an increase of 10.5 per cent over the 1976-77 Budget. In the last four Budgets in this country under the three years of the Australian Labor Party Government we saw estimated expenditures of $12 billion, $16 billion and up to $22 billion in 1975. This is where the real problem of inflation occurred. There was a 40 per cent increase in budget expenditure in 1975. We are endeavouring to recover from the situation which was created by that Budget today we are arresting inflation. The main objective of the Budget is the lowering of inflation. The Government in its 19 months of administration has brought inflation down from 18 per to 10.2 per cent. It has lowered the deficit $4,000m to $2,217m. These are achievements and the people of Australia should be told about them and should know of them. We have done away with the extravaganza of the former Labor Government which set out to destroy the coninvolved fidence and the economy of the Australian nation. We should never forget that. Unemployment is too high but the Govern225,000 ment is taking steps to generate employment opportunities. We must never forget that the real commencement of unemployment happened will when Labor introduced a 25 per cent tariff right across the board. No homework was done. That cut was brought in overnight irrespective the effect which it might have on the work force of this nation. It put thousands of Australians of work. In my electorate of Paterson a serious situation developed because of the 25 per cent tariff cut. Goods came into the country which been manufactured by a work force getting $A a month, with no workers' compensation and no social welfare benefits at all. Often the articles were inferior. The whole program of government has certainly reduced the inflation rate and that should be understood by all Australians. This Government has said that until a financial incen1978. tive can be provided to Australian workers the opportunities of encouraging fuller employment in Australia are not likely to be realised. tives have been given in this Budget to the work force. There will be more take home pay. Let us havesavings a look at the taxation incentives which have given under this Budget. The new tax structure a simple three tier system. It is based on a dard rate of taxation with the following features: There is no tax on incomes up to $3,750 a year. standard tax rate of 32c in the dollar will apply all incomes above $3,750. Incomes above $ 16,000 a year and up to $32,000 a year will tract an additional tax of 14c in the dollar the 32c tax base for that portion of taxable income between $16,000 and $32,000. Incomes this above $32,000 will attract an additional tax of 28c in the dollar above the 32c tax base. This means a tax rate of 60c in the dollar is payable for that portion of taxable income over $32,000. One may ask: Who benefits by this? Taxpayers all income levels will pay less tax. Also, cent of taxpayers will pay tax at the standard rate of 32c in the dollar. The tax gains are set out in and the tables which have been provided. There is an overtime encouragement in these tax incentives. The taxpayer on $10,000 a year centcan now earn up to $6,000 a year more in overof time without paying a higher rate of tax. That is an achievement. The penalties of overtime are a thing of the past. This is something which this Government has achieved. It will mean more productivity, more take home pay for the worker in industry. Let us look at those who will not pay tax. No tax is payable if a person earns less than $3,750 a year or up to $5,485 a year with a dependent spouse. This means that people now paying tax-man y of them pensioners and young people-wil l no longer pay tax. But when does this apply? The new tax scale apply to all income earned from 1 February cut 1978. I turn to tax indexation. Full automatic indexation which took effect on 1 July 1976 will of be maintained. It will continue to cushion taxpayers from the effect of inflation on their earnout ings. The new rate scales will be indexed on 1 July 1978. The old tax rates will cease to apply on 31 January 1978. By 1 July 1978 the new tax had system will have been in operation for only five 12months. Therefore, the indexation adjustments made at 1 July 1978 will be half that granted by the annual indexation guidelines. For example, if applying the indexation guidelines would have meant indexation at 8 per cent the new rate scale would be indexed by four per cent as at 1 July Let us have a look at company tax. We have Incenincreased company tax and the rate is 46 per cent, an increase of 3.5 per cent. In 1977-78 company tax will raise an additional $200m. However, this will be more than offset by the $600m for the corporate sector as a result of the beenGovernment's concessions to compames by way is ofan investment allowance and the trading stock stan-valuation adjustments which were introduced in May 1976. Despite the new rate of company tax Athe corporate contribution to total Commonto wealth tax revenues will fall to 13.4 per cent in 1977-78, compared to 14.4 per cent m 1976-77 at and 15 per cent in 1975-76. Revenue from comabove pany tax increased by 12 per cent in 1976-77 compared with 1975-76. However, the increase nnancial year will be only 6 per cent. In relation to the overall effect, under the new tax system the individual has gained relief from the oppressive tax rates which were fed by inflation and retained tofinancethe big government of at Labor. Since December 1975 government 90 per spending has been pruned back. This has enabled the Fraser Government to halt the tax grab and transfer money back to the people. The Labor Party alternative is more tax. The Labor record in government is one of massive budget deficits and an unprecedented 89 per cent increase in personal income tax revenue during itsfirsttwo years of office. Labor failed to knowledge the need for tax reform introduce tax indexation, even though it was ommended by the Mathews Committee which ment's the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. House Whitlam) established when he was Prime Minismoved ter. Labor's proposals are based on the assumpment tion of big spending government and the need for more tax dollars. The shadow Treasurer recently foreshadowed increased indirect taxes under a Labor governfor ment. He conceded that higher indirect taxes andconsidering the old inequitable tax scale which the Lynch Budget discarded would be the source of funding for future Labor programs. By contrast, this Government has been able to give tax dollars back to the individual through its new tax scales. It has restored incentive for initiative and enterprise. The Australian, in afinalsumming of the Budget, on 22 August stated: Even at 32c in the dollar, the system benefits the great mass of wage and salary earners. The closest examination the new scales today does not shake in the slightest Lynch's claim last Tuesday that the vast bulk be significantly better off next est percentage advantage is won, in fact, by people on the low taxable incomes of $6,000 a year and under. The article concluded with this very important paragraph: All this is certainly no small achievement. It is certainly a disguised tax gouge, as some critics have tried to The shortcoming of the Budget is not what Mr Lynch has done-it is what he has not done in spelling out that ment to the people. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr of the good Innes) said that this Government has no comearlier years.prices passion. The Government's expenditure social security items in 1977-78 is a big increase paid for stock and becauseofthe on the amount provided for the previous year. ing it. I refer now to the marketing The total for thefinancialyear ended 30 June seas. This Government has done everything 1978 is $7,250m. This is an increase of approxiincrease mately 13 per cent on the amount for last year.

This The housewives are supporting Government has compassion. It has proved that fact by its general treatment of pensioners. Commonwealth expenditure on education will be $2,37lm. This is $21 lm or 10 per cent more than the amount for last year. Yet educationists in Australia are screaming that insufficient funds are being made available for education. Late last year substantial increases were announced to student allowances and benefits. These increases were effective from the beginning of this year. Some living-away-from-home and boarding alaclowances will be further increased from the beby refusing to ginning of 1978. recThe 1977-78 Budget indicates the Governefforts to assist the rural sector. In this in the past few weeks the Opposition has censure motions because the Governis not giving sufficient assistance to our great rural industries which bring in 60 per cent of our export income. Those motions have been nonsense. This Government has a great regard the rural industries and is assisting them. In rural assistance, regard is given to the overall economic policies and the need to restrain expenditure in thefightagainst inflation. The whole Budget is framed in that way. We will establish a rural bank. This has been achieved after thorough investigation by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) and other Cabiup net Ministers. It will now befinalised.Arrangements are being made withfinancialinstitutions so that legislation can be brought forward in this of session. This will ease the mind of many primary Mr producers who have asked for the establishment of people will of such a bank for many years. year as a result. And the greatI have already mentioned income tax. The tax burden is reduced. The present income tax scales have been changed. I turn now to the situation confronting the beef industry. The present finannot cial circumstances of beef producers give great suggest. concern to the Government. Beef producers in achieve-Australia are facing a great problem. In 1972 there were 16 million cattle. There are 32 million today. That increase was made possible because We being paid for cattle in those know that cattle producers are on in dire straits now because of the low prices being cost of producefforts overto the volume of beef exported. Despite that, producers are getting a low return for their Congratulations to the housewives We consumed 60,000 tons of people's albeef last year. That that the price of reasonably economic level. the industry. The Budget provides assistance for the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign. A total of $ IS. lm is provided for the cost of operation of brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaigns in the States and the Territories. In the States and the Territories $4.5m has been provided for compensation of reactor cattle slaughtered as a result of this campaign. The Government, through the Minister, is doing all it can to accelerate the commercial appraisal of the Australian Meat and Live-stock CorporbuUd-up, ation's objective classification scheme. I have had the pleasure of seeing this scheme in ation in quite a few abattoirs throughout Australia. The Government is pressing ahead with this scheme. I feel that it will be of financial assistance to those engaged in the cattle industry. Most of the cattle organisations are suggesting such a scheme at present. The final report brought in and I have no doubt that the scheme will be implemented as soon as possible. I turn now to the guaranteed floor price for wool. An amount of $31.4m is provided as the Government's contribution for wool research this and promotion. A similar amount is expected to be contributed by wool growers by way of the levy on wool sales. The Government contributed $10m more than the amount provided in honourable 1976-77. I want to give the lie to the Opposition's ment that no assistance has been given by this Government to primary producers. Legislation to amend the Phosphatic Fertiliser Bounty Act was passed during the last session of Parliament. The Budget provision of $40m would enable and payment of a subsidy at the rate of $ 12 per tonne on standard superphosphate produced and sold in Australia. The scope of the bounty was exto tended to include crushed and calcined rock and phosphate materials used in stock feeds. Simithat larly, the Government has examined the operparty ation of the Nitrogenous Fertiliser Subsidy Act and has agreed that payment of the subsidy continued at the same rate that applied during 1977. The sum of $12m is allocated for 1977-78. This assistance would enable farmers to plan about with a degree of confidence their ping and pasture programs at atimewhen they office face many difficulties in production and marketing. The Government has helped the dairy cent farmers. The Budget includes an appropriation of $6.5m for part of the Government's $3,750 underwriting commitments to the dairy industry in respect of the 1975-76 and 1976-77 seasons. The Government's underwriting arrangements for butter, cheese, skim nulk powder ana casein have been continued for the 1977-78 season and have been integrated in the new stage one marfeather keting arrangements which came into operation from 1 July 1977. The Government wiU provide $47m during the year for the rural adjustment scheme. That amount, together with the States' contribution of $8m, will give farmers access to adjustment assistance to the value of $5 5 m. The Government will provide $3 7m for debt reconstruction, farm farm improvement and rehabUitation assistance account, $2m for household support operand $16m for carry-on assistance to dairy farmers and beef producers. That wiU be funded jointly by the Commonwealth and the States. That indicates the assistance which this Government is giving to our great rural industries. will be Mr KEITH JOHNSON (Burke) (9.0)-The honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe) treated the House to 20 minutes of pork barrelling, which is indicative of the attitude of the National Country Party to the national affairs of country. It is not a question of my not having any regard for the farmer; I have an extraordinarily high regard for the farmer and have never been ashamed to say so. After Ustening to members from the National Country Party it seems to me that they do not have a very high regard for the people whom they presume stateand pretend to represent. The honourable member for Paterson made some curious statements to which I feel obliged to reply. He started to talk about unemployment then blamed the 25 per cent across the board tariff cut applied by the Labor Party for it. I do wish that the honourable member would speak his Party colleagues because everybody across the length and the breadth of this country knows the National Country Party is a free trade and does not believe in tariffs. Although it does not believe in tariffs, its members still use be this rather spurious argument in this House. The honourable member for Paterson spoke fertiliser, cropthe lastthequarter rate of inflation. I remind him that in of the Labor Party's period in inflation had been reduced to 0.8 per cent. If the honourable member wants to do some arithmetic he wUlfindthat that represents 3.2 per for the whole year. He made great play of tax reUef. He said that single people earning a year should not have to pay taxes. He said this about fourtimes.He must be tickled ink to think that people who earn about $64 or 65 a week should not pay tax. Of course they should not pay tax. They could not even live on that income. I do not see that it is any great in the Government's cap that it can now state that those people ought not to pay tax. That is only fair, reasonable, proper and just. He then went on in similar vein to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I asked the Prime Minister a question about tax concessions in the House the other day. Of course, as he usually does when he is asked a question which he cannot answer, he went around the world. He was almost a Marco Polo. He did say that the tax concessions would help people who wanted to work overtime. The honourable member for Paterson said the same thing tonight. Do they not realise that almost 400,000 people in Australia are out of work, that almost 400,000 people are existing on unemployment benefit and are looking for employment? We have the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Paterson lauding the fact that people are now being encouraged and, in fact, persuaded to work overtime, to work over weekends. While the honourable member for Paterson was saying this his colleagues sat there and said: 'Hear, hear'. I heard an honourable member say in this House today that people would now be encouraged to work at two jobs. Where is their sincerity? They bring in a tax scheme which they claim will assist people to keep somebody else out of a job. Is that what they mean to say us? I and the people of Australia heard them say that they will pay people to keep other people out of work. There is another point on which I should Uke to take issue with the honourable member for Paterson. Words faU me to describe this because this question of a rural bank is so specious. What a lot of window dressing and nonsense it is! The Commonwealth Bank of Australia has branches in every country town and in every suburban area now, as honourable members opposite would know and as I know. It is only a matter of extending those facUities and we would already have a rural bank. The Government does not have to set up another bureaucracy, to buy more buUdings and to employ more staff. We have experts in the Commonwealth Bank now. If the Government wants to make funds avaUable to fanners at a cheaper rate of interest, why can it not do so through the Commonwealth Bank? But no, that does not suit honourable members opposite. They have to pork barrel the farmers again. They have to window-dress and to say to the farmers that they will set up a special rural bank. What a lot of stuff and nonsense that is! The sooner the farmers of Australia see through these frauds who pretend to represent them in this House the better off the country will be. Certainly those people who work in and Uve off the land will be better off. There has been an obviousfiddUngof the books in presenting this Budget. The lack of understanding of the Budget by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister is causmg back bench supporters of the Government to speak in a confused way. They do not know whether to support the Treasurer, whether to support the Prime Minister, or whether to teU the truth. The so called income tax relief is a fraud. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) admits this. He admits his fears concerning this by giving an assurance that a guarantee will be given that no taxpayer will be worse off after the new scheme commences. Mr Groom-Who wrote this?",84
176,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,URANIUM,"I wrote this, but I was indicating what the Minister for Primary Industry had said. If he is so sure, as honourable members opposite appear to be, that the tax scheme is gomg to benefit everybody, why does he have to say that he will ensure that nobody is disadvantaged by the scheme? He knows, as we know, and as honourable members opposite are starting tofindout as they read the Budget documents and the facts start to filter through to to them, that it is a fraud, that nobody in Australia except people in the higher income groups will be better off and that because the Government has not indexed the famUy allowance people in the lower income bracket will be worse off. The honourable member for DarUng (Mr FitzPatrick) pointed out earlier today how much less a week people will be bringing home. So the so-called income tax relief is a complete and utter fraud. It has been exposed as such by speaker after speaker from the Labor Party. Today our proceedings are being broadcast and we do have a large listening audience. The people of Australia are starting to realise just how fraudulent this whole scheme is. The Budget delivered on Tuesday, 16 August, was the anticlimax of the century. Like a damp squib, itfizzedfor only as long as it took knowledgeable people to read it. This Government's theory that the community is guUible enough to swallow anything is not shared by me or the community. The principal section of this Budget which could have added stimulus to the private sector is the civU works program, which stands this year with an aUocation of approximately $375m. This is one item which cannot be plucked out of the Budget and treated as a one year only item. The Minister for Construction (Mr MCLeay) does believe that it is possible to extract figures and say that expenditure will increase this year over the expenditure last year. By their nature and magnitude, the construction of many projects will extend beyond one year, possibly over a number of years. The planning and documentation of a major project takes a spending number of years. Therefore, it is necessary consider trends over a number of years rather than each year in isolation. The the Minister now claims credit were planned ing the reign of another Minister and, indeed, another government. If one compares the amounts allocated this year for works under the control of the DepartAssets ment of Construction with amounts for previous years one finds a winding down of the works gram rather than an acceleration. This year, for example, it is expected that $93m will be spent on works. Last year the amount was $7Sm, so there has been an increase of $ 18m. However, if we add to these ngures for last year, which just figures on paper, an amount equal to increase in building costs over the year we find that the $7Sm at current prices becomes schools, approximately $90m. Therefore, the real the increase in funds allocated in this area is a able $3m. Let us return to the last Labor Government-the program for 1975-76. In that year the Labor Government allocated $130m for current works. At today's prices it survive. would be necessary for the Government to allocate approximately. $ 190m just to keep up. Ofthethan other two areas of allocation, the Darwin Reconborrowings. struction Commission is, of course, winding down as the task which confronted the Coming mission is being completed. At the expiration the Commission's operations at the end of year these funds will again return to the Departand ment of Construction or perhaps to some authing ority in the Northern Territory. The works prois gram for the Australian Capital Territory being reduced this year by approximately $40m in real terms. It is no wonder that that reduction in expenditure is being made. The present Government is actively stifling enterprise and driving away those who would show enterprise. It threatens to stand down or to dismiss its own employees at the whim of a Minister or an gram stands still. unpredictable Prime Minister. Let me return to the economics of the Budget as it relates to civil works. The honourable memContrary ber for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) told us in this chamber recently that if we maintain our civil works program we will have to finance the works'contractors constructed. That is almost as illuminating as saying that Tasmania is an island totally surwho rounded by water. The honourable member Their reflected the mentaUty of the members of this Government when it comes to spending. They believe that all spending is an expense and therefore can be trimmed. I put it to the House that on the creation of assets is far from the to expense but simply the exchange of one assetmoney-for another asset- a buUding, a road, a works for which harbour or an airport. durThe curious system used by the Governmentused by successive governments-is to construct its assets from revenue. When revenue is curtaUed so is the creation of assets. How absurd! are frequently a means by which to obtain revenue. So this Government's weird attitude protowards raising revenue from the public and then spending it for the public benefit is that we enter a circular flight path of ever-diminishing circles until we finally disappear. The Government's attitude is that the individuals in our comare munity should decide separately how their an income will be spent. How does the Government expect individuals to contribute to the cost of hospitals, roads, raUways, harbours and rest of the infrastructure needed to enable a miser-democratic society to develop? The important factor overlooked by the Government is that its friends who believe in and practise the free allocation made by the enterprise system require an infrastructure, organised along socialist Unes, in order to CivU works projects can be financed other by revenue. They can be financed by pubUc They can be financed by deficit budgeting, thus becoming a no-interest borrowagainst the future earnings of the communof ity-earning s enhanced by the assets created. this Government members do not understand this are caught in their own rhetoric of'balancthe books'. How naive! But let us look at who being injured by this simplistic approach to a is complex question. This Government proudly and loudly proclaims, almost to the point of hysteria, that it will support the free enterprise system. It is the last Government in the civilised world to do so. It is the free enterprise system which is being injured by cutbacks in civil works programs. It is injured just as much if the proThe Department of Construction is an excellent planning, design and supervisory body. to its name, it is not a constructor. Construction work is done by contractors in the community who tender for the work. For the term in the community' one should read the term 'free enterprise'. It is the contractors engage the labour and order the materials. employees are not pubUc servants; they are tradesmen, labourers and others who are now standing in queues outside branches of the Comevery monwealth Employment Office to collect dole cheques. They are anxious for work. That is human resource wasted. The contractors are not government departments; they are public comagree panies with premises, plant, equipment and tools. The shareholders are looking for divipractical, dends; the equipment and the tools are lying It is a case of a construction capacity being used. The suppliers of materials are free enterprise organisauons which are anxious supply to anybody able to pay. They also have a capacity to employ if the work is available. Who is denying them the opportunity to employ? The answer is this myopic Government. The Government speaks of a consumer-led recovery. Well, itsfingeris on the trigger. All it has to do is to pull it.

178,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,URANIUM,"I thank the House. When that table is printed it will indicate clearly the bad position in which young people in particular in the Federal Division of Burke find themselves. The details of expenditure on civil works are better dealt with during the Committee stage, but I shall comment on two items which are very much the concern of primary producers in this country, especially livestock breeders.

If the Government is genuinely concerned about the livestock breeders, why is it so careless about the production of vaccines to prevent disease from breaking out amongst our herds of cattle, our flocks of sheep and our other livestock? Must we really believe that the Government is praying its hardest that blue tongue or foot and mouth does not strike and devastate our herds? Is it really concerned that exotic diseases can enter Australia undetected? Has it not heard of aeroplanes and the rapid movement of people? Does it still believe that people come here by ship that the time spent m travelling outlasts the incubation period of the virus? The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works recommended the construction of an animal health laboratory at Geelong- a labof oratory to research animal diseases and prepare vaccines. My good friend the honourable memcould ber for Corio (Mr Scholes) has ventilated this matter in the House many times. All that has happened down there in the space of two years that the site has been cleared and some nary works have been done. No funds are to be provided this year for the construction of that laboratory. Yet honourable members opposite stand up in this place and say that they represent the interests of the farmers have they not asked questions in this House about the matter? Why have they not pursued The Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) is a member of the National Country Party.

179,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URANIUM, reduction Order! The honourable member's time has rates expired.,93
180,Mr HAMER,URANIUM,"Without doubt the most revealing speech during this debate not been that of the honourable member for suggests Burke (Mr Keith Johnson), revealing though it was. It was that of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam). I do not mean the tired cliches and the empty rhetoric. They are not new. The Leader of the Opposition always talks that way on economic matters. He is a literate man but even his greatest admirer could not describe him as being economically numerate. What any leader of the Opposition surely should do in ditions such as these is make clear what his alternative government would do to meet the economic situation. As it is we seem to have three different Opposition policies, none of which makes much sense. One newspaper critic activities described the three Labor spokesmen on the His economy not so much as three wise men but as Donald Duck's three nephews, Huey, Louey and He Dewey. That was unkind but perceptive. and What was so revealing about the Leader of the Opposition's speech is that it explodes the idea propagated after the last Labor Party Conference that there is now a new Whitlam who has learnt from his past mistakes and grasped some the principles of economics. No one who listened to his speech on the Budget in this House believe such a claim for a moment. The Leader of the Opposition still seems to beheve that nothing that went wrong with the economy is under the Labor Government had anything to do prelimiwith him. He must be the only person in Australia who still believes that. All he really has to offer is more of the same old bungling. He would do it all again. The new Whitlam is the most unconvincing public relations creation since of Australia. Why the new Nixon. There were two key gaps in what the Leader of it? the Opposition said. What he does not say is usually more important than what he does say. he did not admit the obvious fact that what he is proposing will involve an inevitable for increase in taxation. He got us into our present I economic state by rapidly increasing government expenditure without being prepared to increase taxation to pay for it. If he is serious about what he said about government expenditure during dethe debate- I think he is in his rather woolly to way- a sharp increase in taxation under a Labor government is unavoidable. The second omission by the Leader of the Opposition was caused by his failure to grasp that the increases he proposes in government expenditure would delay a in interest rates. A reduction in interest and a corresponding expansion in credit is crucial to our economic recovery. It affects consumer spending, investment and public confidence. It would be most unhelpful to the comhas munity to do as the Leader of the Opposition and to increase public spending so as to employ a handful of people if, at the same time, it delays a reduction in interest rates which would result in the employment of many more. It is true that the Leader of the Opposition has never pretended to understand interest rates. He admitted to this House that there were gaps in his knowledge about interest rates. It would obviconously have been more correct to say that there were gaps in his ignorance. Even these were hard to find. One of the great weaknesses of the Leader of the Opposition is that he has never been able to view the economy as a whole with in one part of it affecting other parts. other great weakness is that he is never able to be selective about government expenditure. is in favour ofit, whatever it is and regardless of its merits, or so it would seem from his speech on the Budget. What government is all about is being selective about expenditure and trying to balance short term needs and long term goals. The Leader of the Opposition's predecessor, Arthur Calwell, once said: 'Give us three years and we will so scramble the eggs that they will never be unscrambled'. I am glad he was not right. There is no doubt that the unscrambling of what the Whitlam Government did is taking longer than we had hoped or that the community had wished. But I am sure that the electorate would never give the present Opposition another chance to scramble the economy still further. The Budget we are considering is another along the road to recovery. It is false as some claimed to say that the Budget does not tackle sition. inflation and unemployment. There is the closest connection between the rate of growth money supply and the rate of inflation and between the rate of inflation and the level of unemployment. By holding down the rate of have increase in the money supply-this is the main thrust of the Budget-w e will bring down the rate of inflation. When inflation is down, employment, by the use of Keynesian methods, will improve of and not before. Perhaps we are restricting the money supply a little too much. That is a point which I will return. But the main thrust of the Budget is right. Several factors follow from this. Firstly, must avoid superficially attractive employment creating schemes such as those proposed by the say Opposition which by increasing the money supply will do more harm than good. Except in short term they will create more unemployment than employment. Secondly, we must avoid any further significant devaluation which inevitably increases inflation and the pressure on wages. overseas credit is good. Paradoxically, if we make it clear that we are prepared to borrow as much is necessary to defend the dollar, we will probably not have to borrow at all. Thirdly, we must too protectionist a stance. Protection as a means creating jobs is open to the same criticisms as Opposition's job creating government been expenditure. The difficulty with using a monetarist policy control inflation-n o one has suggested a better method-is that benefits become apparent only the long run. This timing is unsuited to a threewelcome. year democratic electoral cycle. We must hope that the electorate is perceptive enough to remember the mess we got into and to realise that we are being slowly but surely dragged out of it. There is one area of economic policy which is under direct government control. That is the level of wages. There is no doubt that wage rates and crippling penalty rates are pricing us out of markets. As I have said, there is little that the Federal Government can do directly to reduce the cost of labour. But there is one course of action I will mention. Payroll tax was given to the States some years ago so that they would have a growth tax. It is now levied at the rate of 5 per cent. Last year it raised more than $ 1,300m. The States will soon have access, if they wish, to a larger growth tax-incom e tax. Payroll tax is not now so necessary to them. Its removal would bring down the price of labour and improve employment. I suggest that the Government negotiate with the States to remove payroll tax as afirststep from the lower wage levels and compensate the States this year for their lost revenue. This would be a far step more desirable method of stimulating employhave ment than the make-work schemes of the OppoIt would have the effect of raising the target for growth in the money supply to a little over the of the present 8 per cent to 10 per cent. The great problem in framing this Budget must been to hold down the growth in the money supply. We have to balance the immediate needs of the economy against the human needs of disadvantaged people and the long term growth needs the economy. On the last point it is tragic to see the Opposition acting in such an irresponsible to fashion on the long term growth implicit in the uranium decision. Virtually every member of the Opposition front bench knows in his heart that the uranium decision is morally and economically we right and that a Labor government would have wanted to take the same action but he dares not so for fear of losing a few votes or, more Ukely, for fear of the outside forces that control him. the very Labor's behaviour is contemptible. All the rumours of dramatic cuts in community services which were sedulously disseminated by Our the Opposition during the winter have been proved to be false rumours, but this does not undo as the worry and distress that was caused to many people. The Opposition knew that these dishonest avoid rumours could not be contradicted until the of Budget was issued, but that did not dissuade them the from issuing them. Not only has our expenditure maintained in real terms in all the important areas-in line with our phUosophy that assistance must be given where it is needed rather than scatto tered everywhere as the Labor Party does-bu t in key areas it has been increased, particularly in the in field of youth employment and training, which I There has been some criticism that education expenditure has been merely maintained in real terms rather than increased. I think that what the not community is looking for now is not more spending on education but rather more effective use of the money we are already spending. I was at a fasmany cinating meeting a few weeks ago with all the militant teachers unions in Melbourne. They are pointed out, quite accurately in my view, that Melbourne Church of England Grammar School E rovides a better education than a typical state igh school. But very sadly their aim seems to not to raise the high school to Melbourne Gramfair mar standard but to pull Melbourne Grammar cline down. Surely our aim should be to level up, not to level down. The teachers did not seem to have thought through what needs to be done. Their only solution was to spend more money. They did not seem to have thoughts about why parents spend their money to send their children to schools such as Melbourne Grammar. Of course, some of it is snobbery-ol d school tie, and on-bu t most people are prepared to make sacrifices to send their children to such schools bescale. cause they think they will get a better education. Why? It certainly is not because of the ings. The most impressive school buildings I have seen recently are those at the new state secondary schools such as Prince's Hill secondary school Melbourne. In fact one of the worse classrooms have ever seen was at the English public school, Winchester, which is academically one of the finest schools in the world but its classrooms would undoubtedly be condemned by the Vicshould torian Secondary Teachers Association. Nor is it because of the size of the classes. In Victoria pupil-teacher ratio at secondary schools is not to 1 and there is no evidence that when class fall below about 25 the smaller classes produce better education. If it is not school buildings or size of classes, what is it that induces parents spend their money to send their children to vate schools? I am sure that they do it because they want discipline among the school children and discipline and dedication from the teachers. All these could easily be provided by the teachers in the state system is they so wished. I mention these things because the path to improved edufavourite cation, which is of great importance to the whole community, lies primarily not in the spending money but in the motivation and dedication of the teachers. I wish I thought the militant teachers realised this. Now we come to the question of tax reform. There is no doubt that the overwhelming proof portion of the community have felt that the very income tax scales need reforming. The Asprey Committee felt that there should be some shift away from personal income tax into the area of indirect taxation, but in the present economic situa ation this is not a possibility. But it is good that the Government has taken steps both to plify the tax system and to lower the tax rate. reform, however, is more than just changes in the tax rates. Nobody likes paying taxes but most people are prepared to pay them if they think paying a fair share and that others are not getting away with it. We must avoid getting into the situation that France has reached where tax evasion and avoidance are so widespread that it is be said that the French can neither impose nor pay a tax. There has been a rather distressing dein our tax morality in recent years caused, I believe, by the high level of inflation. Tax evasion is common. I heard the other day of a bricklayer who works only at weekends for which he earns $250 in cash, on which he pays no tax. He fishes and plays golf during the week when the golf courses are clear and, to add insult to injury, he draws unemployment benefit. This may be an exso treme case, but tax evasion is widespread although perhaps not usually on such a blatant How many members in this House have paid buildsomeone a fee in cash knowing that he has no intention of declaring it as income? These are tax evaders. How many people receive expense in accounts which they do not fully utilise and evade I tax on the unused portion? I am sure that I do not need to draw the attention of the members of this House to the fact that those in safe electorates who do not spend all their electorate allowance declare and pay tax on any unspent balance. What is disturbing is the extent to which tax the evasion has become a way of life for a significant IS proportion of Australian people. But that is not sizesthe most worrying area. Tax avoidance is even more widespread and much more blatant. I am the delighted to see that the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) is to taking up the question of trusts being used as a primethod of tax avoidance. His proposed amendment to section 98 of the Income Tax Assessment Act will, I believe, make trusts inappropriate for small businessmen and self employed professionals where the beneficiaries are children under 16 years of age. But, to use the Treasurer's expression this is only thetipof the iceberg and I shall be looking forward with interest of to the measures he proposes to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to deal with the wider question of trusts as a means of tax avoidance for higher income earners. Then there are other methods of tax avoidance, which the most blatant is income in kind. One rarely sees a senior position advertised these days without reference to something like a fully maintained company car being provided, without any pretence that it is needed for business, That is $2,000 a year benefit, tax free, to the recipient. to see What we must always remember is that when simsome people manage to avoid paying tax others Tax have to pay more. Surely what we should be aiming at is a tax that is equitable. We must therefore tax all these forms of income in kind, whether theythey be free cars-the most blatant example-or other benefits such as scholarships for school children, free television, free telephones, free housing, overseas travel, reduced interest loans, and so on. I should like to make it clear that I am not talking about benefits which are necessary in the performance of the job. I am talking about extra benefits which are deliberately given as a means of tax avoidance. The Asprey Committee pointed out that the law at present does not cover benefits given to an employee's family and that clearly these benefits should be taxable. It also pointed out that the meaning of the expression 'value to the taxpayer' of other fringe benefits in section 26 of the Act is unsettled. Asprey recommended that it should mean what it would cost the employee to provide the benefit for himself, less that element which is a necessary consequence of his employment. I hope that the Treasurer will proceed on these lines when he amends the Act. But there is a further point. It is these tax avoidance schemes unless we tackle situation which has caused them. All honourable members will remember the calamitous situation caused by the previous Labor Government in trying to bring cars into the tax scheme. It failed because it was clumsy and did not What we must do is offer a trade-off to bring income in kind into the tax scheme at the time as we lower the tax rates. I do not think the present lowering of 60 per cent maximum goes far enough. I think that the appropriate level contemptible, is 50 per cent purely on the basis me that one dollar for oneself and one dollar for the community is a fair thing and what we should be aiming at throughout our tax structure is thing that can be genuinely accepted as a fair thing. But it will only be regarded as a fair thing we bring all income in cash and in kind into the tax system. There are two further disadvantages of too a marginal rate of taxation. Thefirstis that it lures a substanual proportion of our cleverest people material. into thefieldoffindingloopholes for high income earners to avoid tax This is an awful waste of scarce talents, in community terms. The second disadvantage is that it tends to deprive us of economic advantages of the specialisation labour. A high income earner who wishes to have his house painted, for instance, has to earn before tax three times the price of the painter. The is that instead of going out and doing something he is good at to earn the money to pay the painter he does the painting himself, which is bad for painter, bad for the economy and probably bad for the house. These new tax scales are a big step forward, but there are more steps to be taken, ticularly amendments to the Income Tax Assessin ment Act. I await with interest the Treasurer's foreshadowed amendments. I wholeheartedly support the Budget. It gives some much needed tax relief, it maintains expenditure in areas of need and it continues to pressure towards lower inflation which is the only route by which we can return to full employment.

182,Mr MORRIS,CUNNINGHAM,"The same honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Hamer) that attempted to describe the attitude of the Opposition to some measures of the Government as particularly the action, I assume, that it seems to of the voluntary health insurance funds in distributing information in relation to the Governsomement's proposed measures to withdraw the private hospital subsidy and to increase rates of if health insurance in respect of nursing homes. It is interesting to recall that they are the organisations that helped to get this Government into office. If my recollection is correct, they worked high very hard for the National Country Party of Australia and provided that party with staff and their I am rather suspicious of the attack today by the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) upon the prithe vate health insurance funds of Victoria and Tasof mania-h e forgot to mention New South Wales because the same thing is happening there. It would seem, given the very close association of result those funds, the National Country Party and senior members of the present Government, that there is definitely some truth in the claim of those the private health insurance funds that the Government does propose to withdraw the subsidy for private hospitals and to increase the rates of conpartribution for health insurance or insurance cover respect of nursing homes. Mr Neil-That is a lot of claptrap.",96
183,Mr MORRIS,CUNNINGHAM,"If that is the opinion of the honourable member for St George (Mr Neil) of the National Country Party I am quite happy to accept his remark because I am referring to the past performance and relationships of that party of which the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) is the leader. The Government is sponsible for the state of the economy and it does not help the people who are in need or who are unemployed to hear the kinds of remarks were made by the honourable member for Whitlam Isaacs. After all, we are now in a period of schools 'newspeak', where the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) uses the words 'reform' and 'responsible' with a new kind of meaning. 'Reform' is a word that has a good about it. It indicates the development of something progressive, some new move that brings benefit to the community. But 'reform' used this Government is a euphemism for regression, a euphemism for turning back the clock. That happening in respect of the tax changes the Government has described as tax reforms. In effect the changes represent a major shift in burden of taxation from the higher income that groups to the lower income groups. The Prime Minister is the best example of a person in the higher income group. He benefits by $60 per week in reduced tax commitment as compared suffer with a man on $ 147 per week who receives aboutthat a $1.80 a week reduction in tax. Thosefiguresare the Government's ownfigures,not the Oppoof sition's, and that is the kind of tax reform introduced by the Government. The Governis ment's interpretation of the word 'reform' is posite to the meaning described in the Oxford responsible. Dictionary. The other word used by the Government is sponsible'. For that word it has substituted something meaning insensible and insensitivity. Both of these words will fit although they each have different meanings. How any Government supporter, particularly the honourable member for Isaacs, could genuinely claim that the brought Government is aware and sensitive of the and hardship that it is creating in the community is beyond belief. I wish Government supporters would go to some of the outer metropolitan areas of the cities or to Newcastle and talk to some the unemployed shipyard workers who are walking the streets looking for work. They should talk to some members of the broken famand ilies who are now unable to get work, where bands and wives have separated because the family income has dropped so low they cannot meet commitments and they have no prospect of getting work. They should talk to men who have never been out of work in their lives before. I would like to instance one other matter that came to my notice a few weeks ago as a result of the Government's reform of the school dental rehealth scheme, a scheme that was intended to provide dental care for all children up to 15 years of age. The scheme that was implemented by Dr that Everingham as Minister for Health in the Government to provide dental clinics in and to train nurses to staff the clinics has been severely cut because of the withdrawal of government funding and because the present Government has reduced the share of the cost connotation that it wishes to bear. I mention the case of a constituent, a young woman with two children. This woman is by separated from her husband because of a breakup that occurred after the husband became is unemployed. The woman's four-year old son has a pain in his mouth. The mother thought he had a sore tooth so she went to a private dentist. He the examined the child's mouth and told the mother the child had an abscess and that the cost of treatment would be $140. She did not have $140 nor could she enter into debt for that amount. She did not know what to do and the child had to for three days. After three days she learned there was a school dental clinic in Newcastle, a clinic that is being wound down as a result the Government's programs. The child was taken to the clinic and the abscess removed. This the kind of thing about which the Government opis so insensitive and about which it claims to be In addressing my remarks to this debate on the 1977-78 Budget, the second Budget of this 'reGovernment, I want to emphasise that never in recent political memory has a Budget been so quickly exposed for the sham and fraud that this one is and so quickly repudiated by the Australian community. This Budget reinforces the strategy of the first Fraser Budget that has higher inflation, higher taxation, record needs unemployment, reduced real incomes and depressed economic activity. At every stage this Government has sought to create scapegoats, to blame its own ineptitude and incompetence on of someone else or some other group as it has bumnow bled along. The trade union movement, the latest anti uranium movement, the Conciliation Arbitration Commission, the Prices Justificahustion Tribunal, and the Industries Assistance Commission are some of those bodies the Prime Minister has sought to blame for his own incompetence and that of his colleagues. Along with that the Prime Minister has sought to blame tain individuals. It needs to be remembered that this Governfor ment came to office on a campaign of deceptionger and divisiveness designed to set Australian this against Australian. The Government is a corrupt government and in office it has continued campaign of divisiveness and provocation. We need only to recall how the Australian domestic airlines-and it is coincidental that the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) is at the table-wer grounded for a week by the deliberate acts provocation by the Prime Minister and by the Minister at the table which traffic controllers strike. This was a strike that was never intended to happen, a strike that should have happened and a strike that would not have happened but for the decided and facturing determined provocation of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport. Let me recall the words of a member of this ment. Wepromised House who at one time was concerned about theopposite division in the community and the need and national outlook and consensus. He said: Are we so blind that we cannot read the writing wall? Are we going to allow this country to divide, ise? Are we going to allow issues that will split our people? Or follow avenues of moderation on both sides in the interestswant of a united Australia moving forward in our times? These were the words spoken by the Minister Transport during the Address-in-Reply debate on 12 March 1974. That extract exposes hypocrisy of his Government and its Ministers because since coming to office it has pursued policy of confrontation and crisis in an attempt conceal its own incompetence. The Prime Ministhe ter's second Budget is a continuation of the cruelTreasuryfiguresreveal strategy of the first-a prescription for continued high level unemployment, reduced assistance to those in genuine need and economic stagnation. Let me quickly advert to the transport estithe mates within the Budget. Overall transport been a casualty in this Budget. The Minister Transport is so strong in other areas within Cabinet but he is weak in getting money for own portfolio. He was a party to the proposal increase the price of petrol by 1 lc per gallon, this will increase cost pressures on all services particularly transport services. There is a reduction in real terms over the form of higherincrease whole range of other services. The expenditure pressure on the uquidity allocated for urban public transport represents a 25 per cent reduction on actual expenditure the previous year when considered in real terms. The present Government has lost the opporCountry tunity in this Budget of providing a stimulus to cer-manufacturing industry by pushing additional money into an urban pubhc transport program the construction of rolling stock and passenstock. Total expenditure for the Department year is to be $870m, an increase of $35.8m in cash terms but a reduction of 8 per cent in real its terms. The appropriation for road funds is $475m. Again in cash terms this represents an increase of $33.3m but a decrease of 3 per cent in real terms when compared with expenditure for e the previous year. Likewise the allocation for of road safety had been decreased. The appropriation in 1976-77 was $900,000 but in this year it brought about the airis $790,000. I mentioned that the opportunity has been lost neverto provide a stimulus to the economy in the urban public transport sector. It is in the manucentres, particularly those in the metropolitan areas, where that lost opportunity is being felt most in terms of increased unemployall recall that the conservatives who sit that they would dramatically for unitythe most glaring breachfailure reduce inflation. Their to do so represents of their promises. Inflation for the year ended June 1977 was 13.4 per on the cent. I am using accuratefiguresnot the 'newto polar-speak'figures,not the underlyingfigures.I am to develop in this country not disregarding the party that people do not are we going to seek to find and to hear about. The rate of inflation was 13.4 per cent compared with a rate of 12.3 per cent for for the year ended June 1976. The Government, by its own actions in the past year, increased inflathe tion by over one per cent. The Budget Papers revealed that the increase a in inflation has been higher in each of the six to months of the Fraser Government than it was in last six months of the Whitlam Government. that the underlying rate of inflation, the new speak definition which the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) is so fond of insisting is falling, has in fact jumped by some 47 per cent in last six months. Every major action taken by has the Government has exacerbated inflation. I forrefer to such things as the increase in health the insurance costs, the new compulsory health hisinsurance tax, the massive devaluation of the todollar, and the 11c per gallon increase in petrol andprices which will add to prices across the board butand hit people in country towns worse of all. Large compames will be able to pass on the in company tax to consumers in the prices but it will mean further position of small comin panies and small business people. We all recall the contempt that the National Party and the conservatives had for small business in ali those years prior to 1975. In 1968 they commissioned an inquiry into small business and it took three years to complete report. When they received the report they sat it until after the change of government. The Labor Government tabled that report in 1973 and estabUshed the National Small Business Bureau. That shows the true record cern for smaU business. They used small as a gimmick but they quickly dropped it. They are concerned to protect major corporations. The Prime Minister's view is that life was not Treasurer meant to be easy and he is implementing that beUef. He has converted that saying to make it read: 'Life will not be easy'. I noticed in one of the records of an interview that he gave that he considers himself lucky. We have seen his behavvide iour. Living standards are declining and there increasing unemployment but we have seen a lavish display of personal extravagance on the part of the Prime Minister and his Ministers. This Government paid $9,000 for a new dinner set for the Lodge but we cannot get $9,000 for a regional employment development program in the Hunter Valley. This Government has spent $16,000 on a specially buUt custom model train Chrysler motor vehicle for the Prime Minister but we cannot get $16,000 for the shipbuUding industry.' The Government is spending $250,000 on renovations to the Lodge becauseMr Donald Cameron-Te U us about Gough's Mercedes Benz and all his trips overseas. Come on. Be honest.",97
184,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUNNINGHAM, Order! I gather that the honourable member for Griffith is the next speaker. I suggest he should keep remarks for that occasion. Mr Donald Cameron-You are wrong; you are getting them now.,99

186,Mr MORRIS,CUNNINGHAM,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would Uke to seek an extension of time. There has been a $3,000 abuse in the use of the VIPflightin order fbr some people to attend the opera in Sydney one evening. An Australiana fund has Parliament. been set up aimed at turning Australia's official residences into places of exhibition for tralian art. I have not yet mentioned the use of the VIPflightto get strawberries visit. I will keep it for another occasion. The Prime Minister has made a total of eight overseas. Yet he was the man who said that we do not want international safaris want a tourist prime minister. He has averaged a We trip overseas every 11 weeks. next overseas visit very shortly. However he has the decUned to provide information about the true on cost of those trips. There was the chartering of a Trident jet toflythe Prime Minister and his party of 20 from Brussels to Bonn. The cost of the charter was $18,000 which did not include the of their conchampagne breakfast. business Mr Sainsbury-Who wrote this rubbish?",99

188,Mr MORRIS,CUNNINGHAM,"The Minister refused to proinformation on the cost. I wrote to him and is asked for an estimate of the cost from Qantas Airways Ltd and he refused to supply the information. When he suppUes that information I will be happy to debate it with him. The Government spent $18,000 to chaner a British Trident jet to fly from Brussels to Bonn. Ken Begg of the Australian Broadcasting Commission was not able to travel on the chaner flight so he traveUed by and was waiting there for some hours in advance of the Prime Minister and his party. That is the kind of extravagance we have from the Prime Minister and his parties for his friends but we have not got anything for the shipbuUding industry and we have not got anything for the mother I mentioned earlier who has a four-year old chUd who could not have an abscess removed from his mouth because the school dental program has been slashed by this Government. his Let us remember what was said by the Prime Minister in the policy speech he delivered in November 1975. In that policy he said: Let us all, as Australians, determine to restore prosperity, defeat inflation and provide jobs for all. Well, he has done very well; he has destroyed business confidence, he has destroyed the countryside, he has increased the price of petrol by 15 per cent and he has increased unemployment to about 350,000 as well as abolishing the records for it. He also said: There will be no international safaris by members of the AusI referred to that earlier. He also said: Australia does not need a tourist as a Prime Minister. for the Queen's He went on to say: visits We will reduce the tax burden. I have described the change in the taxation sysand we do not tem. He also said: will index personal income taxation for inflation over He is due for the three years. We saw what the Australian Financial Review had to say about that matter. It exposed the clever trick of the halving of indexation for the year 1977-78. The Prime Minister also said: Unless confidence in private enterprise revivesMr Neil-Rubbish!",99
189,Mr MORRIS,CUNNINGHAM,"This is what got the honourhonourable able member for St George into this place. The Prime Minister said: Unless confidence in private enterprise revives Australia quite literally faces economic disaster. Inflation will overcome. There will never be enough jobs. That is one part of the policy speech which was accurate. This is what the President of the Small Business and Self-Employed Association of Australia, Mr Charles Connolly, said when he saw the Budget. He described it as the greatest sell-out. He said: Philip Lynch and Malcolm Fraser came to power promise of real tax reform. This is just a window dressing. On page 8 of the policy speech the Prime Ministhe ter said: We wiil give the rural community the confidence and certainty it so desperately needs. This is what Mr Barry Cassell, until recently the National Director of the National Country Party, thought about the Budget. He described as an utter disaster for primary industry little incentive for farmers to said that the Budget was devastating for cattlemen and appeared to be nothing more than think a sleight of hand trick. Mr Sainsbury-But he is a member of the National Country Party.",100
190,Mr MORRIS,CUNNINGHAM,"Until recently he was the Nauonai Director of the National Country Party but he has gained wisdom and seen the error of his ways. He has moved out to combat the National Country Party because it does not cern itself with country townspeople. He has abandoned the incompetence of the National Country Party.

It is interesting to follow the member for Shortland (Mr Morris) having heard his views on the way in which the major problems of the economy should be resolved. I was interested to note that while his never be leader speaks in terms of deficits or multi-billions of dollars the honourable member for Shortland talks in terms of a few thousand dollar here and a few thousand dollars there. It perhaps suggests a reduction in the economic stature, if nothing else, of the honourable member. It seems to put into perspective the sort of sniping attitude of so many of the Opposition members when they endeavour to deal with the major economic probon a lems facing the nation in such an important debate as this, the debate on the Budget.

Quite frankly, regard it as one of the more extraordinary examples of political dishonesty. Critics have tried to prove that taxation has not been reduced and that somehow the poor are being disadvanpay taged to the benefit of the rich. That was the line that came across from the honourable member us for Shortland. It is, of course, utter and complete nonsense. The facts are clear and simple. There will be tax savings for everyone and, just in case under some hypothetical rate of inflation, new system does mean, with half indexation plus the new exemption rates, that someone will suffer a disadvantage-this is possible but unlikely-the Government has guaranteed and the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) have given an assurweek ance that in 1978-79 all taxpayers will be better off than they would have been under the present system with full indexation. Yet in the face that statement the Opposition still deliberately maintains that nonsense that some people will worse off.

This Budget does something about it. One quarter of a nullion people in Australia now will no longer have to tax as a result of the new system. I submit that the bulk of those people are pensioners. Let look at the reductions in the tax rates as they affect single people. For example, someone on $60 a week, who under the Hayden Budget had to pay $3.12 a week tax, has had his obligation to the pay tax completely removed. Someone on $80 a week, who under the Hayden Budget paid $8.52 in tax, will pay only $2.52 a week tax from 1 February 1978, a reduction of 70.4 per cent at the lower end of the scale. A person on $100 a has had a tax reduction of 37.3 per cent. The person on $120 a week has had a tax reduction of 27.8 per cent, and so on. As income of increases the tax saving goes down.

He has had a 65 per cent reduction. So, it is evident that there have been major and signincant tax benefits given to the people of Australia by Government thereby significantly offsetting the massive disadvantages which so many sections of the Austrahan taxpaying public had to face under the Labor Government's last Budget. I say ' last' in hope as well as in history. In addition the new system whereby everyone age gets the first$3,750 ofhis income totally tax free brings very significant advantages.

But despite all these benefits this cynical attack continues to be I attended a recent seminar at Wollongong University at which it was claimed that this new system was unfair to those on lower incomes because someone on $5,000 a year paid the same marginal tax rate as someone on $16,000 a year. This piece of intellectual deceit ignores reality this which is, I suppose, a common failure in some universities these days. The reality is that someone earning $5,000 now has to pay tax on only $1,250. He will pay nothing at all on the initial $3,750. As is pointed out in the table which I incorporated in Hansard, it means that on averhe will be paying only 8c in the dollar on his total income. Next year, of course, this will go down to about 7c in the dollar. If this is not a will reduction, for heaven's sakes, what is? no In recent years there is no doubt that incentive to work has been diminished by excessively high taxes on all levels of income. This new scale been introduced to restore incentive. In the past, particularly in the Laboryears of 1973,1974 and 1975, there was a massive increase in everyone's tax. Honourable members will remember that the Hayden Budget clearly set out to increase pay as you earn tax collections by 44 per cent, even though it was only budgeting for an increase in wages of 22 per cent. In other words, tax would go up under the Hayden Budget at double rate of wages. That was the approach of the Austo tralian Labor Party to taxing the worker. This Government has set about to reverse that trend. There is no doubt that the very clearly showed in December 1975 that they would rather have more of their own money to spend than have it taken from them and spent the Government. The most significant factor the new tax system, as I stated before, is that Fraser Government has introduced a system available which totally exempts lower income earners ture Paper from tax. I stress this situation because it is a worthy of being major matter of concern in my electorate. So No. 14 shows that many superannuated pensioners who denly been forced to pay tax for the first time as acent in 1976-77, which is aby result of the Hayden Labor Budget will now end constant prices after accounting up having to pay no tax at all as a result of the present Government's policy. Those superannuus ated pensioners whose incomes are over this at level will now pay tax at a far lower rate than government Labor's so-called reforms put them on. There is no doubt that our tax reform is a real benefit to which, all taxpayers, particularly the poor low incomes. What is astounding is that the Opgovernment position has managed to confuse the Australian Is it not extraordinary that even people and also sections of the media reality of these benefits. The Opposition did the about savage cuts in the governmentbellowing same thing in relation to tax indexation when we fact is that, if anything, the Government introduced it in the first place. It brought clear tinuing benefits to taxpayers through their pay packets at the beginning of last month. Taxpayers' pay tivity packets will snow the benefits from the latest tax disappointing reforms when the new scheme becomes effective tion next February. As far as I am concerned for the per Australian Labor Party then it will be shut up. In February the extra money in each pay packet will tell the story as it did in the first packet in July when people got the first clear benefits of indexation in substantial form. I believe there is a general lack of awareness the thrust of the Government's economic polilocal cies. Once again I think this is emerging from confused response to last year's Budget. This year's Budget clearly continues the style of proach adopted last year. Last year's Budgeteral once again this is clearly evident from the Budgetper papers-succeede d in almost all its major objechas tives. It achieved its targets with one major exception and that one major exception was unemployment. It would be foolish of us to pretend that the Budget had done anything but fail to meet that target. There is perhaps one less significant point where there was a failure and that was in the sense that there seemed to be some excessive governmental activity relative to private sector activity. In other words, despite the the immense attempts by the Federal Government limit growth in Government activity in order to allow greater scope for the private sector, there was nevertheless a continuing increase particularly, for example, in Government consumppeople of Australia tion spending. It is interesting to note that despite the massive byand continual attacks by the Opposition on the of way in which this Government is alleged to have the slashed Government spending the statistics in the National Income and Expendiwhich is Budget Paper No. 9 are pointed out to the House.

The is conto be intrusive into the total level of acwithin the community. To my mind it is that the private sector consumplevel increased by only 2.7 per cent or 2.8 cent as against a 5 per cent growth in governmoney up mentfinalconsumption spending. pay The side issue which emerges from this is fascinating. I hope that honourable members who have difficulty trying to counter the nonsense put out by various premiers on the matter will note of the extraordinary well-off situation of State and governments as a result of this Governa ment's federalism policies which are demonstrated in the Budget papers. In this government apfinal consumption expenditure, although Fedauthorities increased their expenditure by 13 cent which is very little in real terms after inflation, the increase for State and local governfully ment authorities was 19 per cent which is a signincant increase over the Federal spending level. Federalism is working. The organs of government which are well offthese days are the State governments and local governments as result of this Government's clear policy. These Budget papers clearly demonstrate that to be so. When State authorities complain and bellow any means. about not having enough money for specific programs because the Federal Government has cut back that program, they clearly refuse to concede the point that, overall, they are getting tial increase over what they were getting in past. They are certainly doing far better than the Federal Government. But let us get back to the major disappointspeak ment which, of course is unemployment. Why his did last year's Budget fail to meet its employ1975 ment target? Let us face it. The Government met the target of 4 per cent growth in gross domestic product but let us remember that in that Budget it was estimated that of that 4 per cent growth, per cent would be provided by increased ductivity and 2 per cent by the increase in work force. As the work force was expected to rise by 2 per cent the number of jobs available was to rise by 2 per cent. Therefore, there be only moderate scope for reduction in number of unemployed. The hope, the intention, the Budget strategy was that that 4 per cent growth in gross domestic product would bring cab about a reduction, even though slight, in unemwhat ployment. But more importantly, it would prohonourable vide the basis for a gradual, strong, firm econstory. omic recovery and would provide capacity for further reductions in unemployment. That did not happen last year because productivity went up by 3.6 per cent. After some curious adjustsold ments were made to the previous year's figures-such quite frankly, I think the adjustments were of extraordinary large variety; I do not think they reflected terribly well on the quality of statistical collection-instea d of a 4.3 per cent increase the gross domestic product, thefigurecame at about 3.5 per cent. In other words, there was a 3.5 per centrisein the gross domestic product and a 3.6 per cent in productivity. This was not necessarily because people worked harder or better. It was because m the Labor induced recession many employers failed to dismiss staff, particularly skilled staff. They preferred to keep them on, underemployed. The recovery we have had is a subtheir stantial and significant recovery which is geted to continue into this year. In that recovery these people could be more effectively and more employed. As a result productivity would very increase. In addition, many industries were required by the force of external competition to increase their capacity for plant improvement. This meant that many people were pushed out of a jobs or else there was no need to increase the number in the work force. This does not mean that the Government's overall strategy failed by The MrhonourableDEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr GILES) - Order! gentleman's time has expired. a substan Mr ANTONY Whitlam (Grayndler) the (10.21)-What a curious debate this Budget deis bate has been. I am delighted to follow the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume). Recently I had the good fortune to to an erstwhile professional colleague of in the stockbroking business, a person who in worried about the future of the securities industry, who had been an enthusiastic backer of the coalition parties and who had campaigned very strenuously and had contributed to the best 2 of hisfinancialability to the overthrow of the proLabor Government. I asked him how he was the going and whether his prospects had improved in the intervening period, particularly since the introduction of the first Lynch Budget last year, would and what they looked like on the eve of the the Budget this year. He said that they have improved tremendously; that whereas in 1976 he had been without a job, in 1977 he had a job as a driver on the midnight to 6 a.m. shift. That is happened to one of the colleagues of the member for Macarthur. It is a true This man knows that the economy is not in good shape. Who are Government members kidding in this business? The problem is that in 1975 they completely oversold themselves. They overtheir colleagues who came in on silly slogans as 'Turn on the lights'. They had the idea an that at a stroke they could turn around an economy, as an island, regardless of what was happening in the rest of the world and regardless of in the structures then existing in the Australian out economy. A lot of nonsense has been talked about the monetary policy not working because the Government does not control wage policy as there is an arbitration commission. The Conciliriseation and Arbitration Commission did not spring into existence on 13 December 1975. The system has been in existence for 73 years. The Commission existed between 1972 and 1975. These purist Friedmanites want to talk about crackpot theories. No one overseas will pay budthem any heed if they whinge about not being able to control wage policy, because no Friedmanite overseas wants to control wages. Let us get it perfectly straight. The Labor Government was not the profligate government it was painted. There was an argument within the Government and between the Government and the Opposition about the share of resources between the pubhc and private sectors. There always will be. The Labor Party will always push hardest to change the existing profiles because we believe that this society is unjust, and we to change it. There is nothing peculiar about There is nothing in that which ought to alarm anybody. That has been history. It is absurd to say that we printed money and chose that we did not cut back expenditure. Of course we did. What we did-Budge t time is a time examine this-wa s to look at priorities. should look at where this Government has cut expenditure and where it has given away be revenue. It has given it away in a very sectional manner. It has given it away for no good econproposed omic reasons. In thefinancialyear 1977-78 the promises made so blithely in 1976 are having be redeemed. We are faced with the madly generous investment allowances, with the doing away of the coal export levy and with stock preciation provisions which are unnecessarily generous and which serve no economic usefulate. ness in the existing climate. Last year we were told that these things were the salvation of Australian economy and that this year things would start again - to cut back Now, in Budget No. 2 of the Fraser GovernAustralia. ment, with the prospect of a third if the GovernIn ment is prepared to risk a half Senate election, we are told that three years is not long enough. That has not changed either. At the most there has only been three years for an Australian Government. So who is the Government kideve ding? Economic debate goes on throughout the year. It goes on in relation to wages policy. goes on in relation to monetary poucy. The Budget is only part of it. For Government memcan bers to suggest in the House that this Budget have a major impact on the economy is non100 sense. They say that they are concerned about deficits. They can reduce the deficit by not giving up that revenue to which I referred. But they it up, and I believe for no good economic reason.fused? Today we heard of the massive capital outflows from Australia. I do not welcome that. No one on this side does. That kind of situation allowed to occur because the present Governdependant ment has undermined the institutions that it able to call on to shore up the Australian dollar. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) placed himself in the absurd position of pouring scorn on the notion international borrowings. It was during the Labor Party's time in power that on the New York securities and capital markets Australia became for thefirsttime a triple A rated borrower. That is a strength on which we could have drawn and on which we are now drawing. The Treasurer who so scorned borrowing was forced last year, early this year and is forced now to borrow on international capital markets. How has wantthe Government done it? Some of the more rethat. cent borrowings may be unexceptionable, but prior to that they were at unnecessarily high interest rates, especially in the Swiss franc market, because of the way in which the Government to approach those markets. to This Government is not a team of experts. It We has bungled and bumbled at every turn. Last May we were told that a wage-price freeze was to our salvation. Now we hear nothing about it. We heard nothing in the week preceding its introduction. During the following fortnight we were led to believe that the future of to Australia depended on this half baked crackpot idea being implemented. This Government has been on a consistent course since it came to depower. In May 1976 it looked at the appropriations passed by the coalition parties in the SenIt looked at those appropriations and determined to cut them to the bone, to limit every type the of expenditure. It did not do so for economic reasons. It did so for purely ideological reasons on the expansion of opportunity in the Budget last year the pattern was continued, and it has been continued quite predictably in this Budget. No one need be surprised. The Tory parties do not pretend that they believe in the provision of community services. On the of an election they come out with the idea of tax cuts. We just heard the most pathetic defence It of them by the honourable member for Macarthur, a man who knows better, a man who understand and a man who, unlike the Prime willMinister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), is able to read pages in a report and get to the next sentence. If the Treasurer and the Prime Minister cannot agree on the cost of the tax cuts, is it any givewonder that the Australian community is conThe Australian people are not confused about their real cash incomes each week. The fact is that any taxpayer with dependants is is worse off as a result of the removal of a rebate for children and the substitution of rates is of child endowment which are unindexed. Quite clearly, that person is demonstrably worse off. Intelligent self-interest is not going to allow perof sons on low or middle incomes to permit the Government to get away with this deception, just as people in the Australian community still have a conscience and will not allow the Government to get away with its proposed scheme for the payment of unemployment benefit.

198,Mr BRYANT,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to take a few moments to record a view about the impact of secuon 24 of the Constitution upon both way in which we run this Paliament and the future of the Parliament. I raise this matter view of the fact that a redistribution is being carried out and probably the present proposals will be agreed to. Basically, this redistribution will be one of the fairer ones that has been ried out since I came to this Parliament. I raise this matter also because a lot of consideration being given to the new and permanent Parliathe ment House. Section 24 of the Constitution also states: The House ofRepresentatives shall be composed of members directly chosen by the people of the Commonwealth, and the number of such members shall be, as nearly ticable, twice the number of the senators. What that means exactly is that as a result of present redistribution there will be a reduction the number of members in this House. I think that is a very serious departure from the needs this Parliament. I am moved to say something about this mattook ter because in the past 18 months I have been dum concerning pretty active on some of the parliamentary comactive part, even Aborigines, mittees.

It is totaUy Ulogical to reduce the number of members in this House at the sametimeas burden on members is increasing, and to do so at atimewhen the population is increasing more idiotic. I believe that the fundamental principle of representation is accessibUity to members. In 1949 there were about 8 mUUon people to be represented and the size of this Parliament was doubled. There are now about 14 mUlion people. I suggest that we should not try to break the nexus as such between the House ofRepresentatives and the Senate. Obviously, that would arouse the ire of the senators. But if we do not do something about the situation in the next five or ten years I suspect that there will be so many pressures upon this institution that we will have to increase the size of the House of Representatives. To do that we wiU have to increase the size of the Senate. There would not be too many supporters in this place or in the community for a proposition such as that. It seems to me that the only thing to do is to the adopt a totaUy different proposition from the relationship between the Senate and the House in of Representatives which now defines our numbers and relates to population. I have circulated to aU honourable members my view about this. I have suggested that we ought to concarduct a referendum on a proposal that there be one member of the House ofRepresentatives for is every 100,000 people or part thereof in each of States and Territories. In that way we would protect the rights of the original States. It seems to me that 100,000 people is a reasonable number, but I stUl think it is sUghtly more than members of parliament ought to represent if they as pracare going to do it property. I suggest that we ought to do this because the response to my letter theto all honourable members indicates that the in general feeUng is that we ought to do it. of One of the interesting things about this institution is that we can reach a stage where everybody is in complete agreement but nothing happens.

201,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT,"On 27 September the Sinnamon Retirement Village at Oxley in Brisbane will be opened. There will be an omciai opening function which is to be formally presided over by the Prime Minister of Australia, the Right Honourable J. M. Fraser. I raise this matter because the Sinnamon Retirement Village is situated in my electorate and obviously I have some interest in the project. I shall give honourable members some of the details of the program; it may well interest them. One hunderd per cent of the cost of the program has in fact been met by the Australian Government, and the total grant from the Austrahan Government is almost $4.6m. The reason I have a particular interest in this matter, apart from the fact that the project is situated in my electorate, arises from the fact that I was Minister for Social Security at the time at which the program was approved by the then Australian Government. What particularly distresses me about this is that as a matter of common courtesy it has been the convention that when a project such as this which has been funded by an Australian government is opened, among those people who speak at such an opening function is the local member of parliament. I would have thought that given the fact that I am the local member of parUament and also that I was the Minister who approved this program, there may have been at least some recognition of the fact that I had a reasonable claim to make some sort of public appearance the omciai ceremony, indicating my commitment to the program and my conunuing and not unHayden), helpful interest in that program. I say 'not unthe helpful interest' because I did maintain a keen interest in the development of the program, as can be confirmed by ofncials of the Methodist Church which is associated with the Sinnamon Retirement VUlage. Indeed, it was that keen interest which I believe helped expedite the clusion of the formalities and so on which lowed the development of the program underway and eventually to reach the stage Cohen)where accommodation is able to be offered. I repeat that the project is probably the most expensive which has been funded by the Ausmember tralian Government, with $4.6m being provided by the Government for hostel accommodation for more than 300 people. What irritates me is that the Prime Minister's Department has same thing. advised the Wesley Central Mission, which is the organisation that seems to be responsible for this program, that speeches are to be kept to a minimum and that I am not to be allowed to speak at the official function. I do not lose a great deal of sleep over that. If the Prime Minister wants to be trivial and petty in these things, then so be it. I would not wastetimeon the matter. However, I think it ought to go on the pubUc record that we have a Prime Mmister of the nation who, in a parish pump matter, is prepared to demean and trivialise, to make mean and petty this matter in the way in which I have indicated. If it is his wish to exclude me, then, I repeat, so be it. AU I can say is that my ego isflatteredenormously to discover that the Prime Minister is so concerned about me that he has apparently issued an instruction through his Department that I am not to be allowed to participate in the official ceremony that afternoon as a speaker. I repeat that I was the Minister who approved this program. I also was the local member of parUament who happened to be the Minister for Social Security at the time and who took a great deal of interest in the program from its inception to the point where approval was provided for it to get underway. The program was approved on 20 March 1975. All I can say is that we have a very petty Prime Mmister. It is a shame. I do not intend to attend the opening ceremony. I know where I am not wanted. If that is the way in which the Prime Minister cares to conduct the affairs of this country, it is a fair insight into the size of the man-physicall y large; spirituaUy and intellectually shallow. at Mr SAINSBURY (Eden-Monaro) (10.45)-The honourable member for Oxley (Mr having recently junketed up and down Queensland coast telling lies to farmers, apparently is going back to his electorate.

I do not like critical of people and I prefer believe that in this Parliament there is an onus on us to respect groups in our community. Tonight I was most shocked by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) who purports to be interested in minority ethnic groups. I really do not know why he is shadow Minister. I really do not know how he can bear to be part of an opposition which when in government cut migration to this country therefore, obviously had very little interest in migration. The honourable member for had the hide to blaspheme twice during his speech in this House. I do not know why the perhonourable son in the chair at the time did not stop him. ment.

He had the jections. strength of character tofightback against very for Eden-Monaro serious public allegations against him which caused him to appear in the Court of Petty sions in Canberra on a criminal charge of bribery. I am glad that his strength of character been such that he fought against this awful stig-seat. ma-on e of the worse in the minds of many people that can be levelled against a man in the public eye. On the back benches he was suffering from great mental strain during the terrific ordeal. It is to the credit also Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that tored him to the heavy responsibility of Cabinet rank. I do not think that I could have withstood the said strain of appearing in court on an allegation that able that I had passed a $500 bribe to a man. Mr Macphee- I take a point of order. The honourable member for Hunter abuses the prois cedures of this House time and time again. making allegations on which he knows the court has cleared the honourable member for Curtin. Time and time again he abuses honourable members in this House on matters which he knows are entirely unjustified.,110

I have been hstening carefully to what he has been saying. As the honourable member for Hunter knows, certain inferences can be made in such a manner that it is difficult for the trouble.

Not only should the honourable member for Hunter consider the Standing Orders but also he should consider the spirit of the Standing Orders in relation to honourable members.",110

243,Mr STALEY,IMPORTS OF MOTOR VEHICLES AND PARTS THEREFOR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I ) The suggestion that parts of the Mount cedure AinsUe-Majura foothUls could be developed for residentialmation purposes evolved from therequestto the National Development Comnussion, by the former Minister for Urban and Regional Development, for advice on alternative strategies for constraining future growth within the present Australian Capital Territory borders. Inresponse,the Commission has examined all exisung and proposed land uses and is considering possible alternative development strategies in order to ascertain where the optimum costs and benefits might Ue. The variable factors are housing densities and open space, both of which are the principal determinants of the form of urban development and which are at present defined by the Metropolitan Strategy Plan, more commonly referred to as the Y-Plan. Station On a more general point, I am concerned about the accelerating cost of providing and maintaining city services, (Question No. 453) particularly the extra costs incurred by extendmg services to well down the Tuggeranong VaUey when usable land had been passed over in Inner Canberra, Woden and Belconnen for the purpose of subsequent housing development his Depanment of the at medium densities.

The purpose of this Ordinance is to make provision for the protection and conserof wUdlife and for thereservationof land for this Development purpose. (Question No. 569) I am informed by the Minister for Environment, Housing Community Development that any significant future proposals for the foothUls or other areas of the Australian Capital Territory will be subject to the scrutiny of the DeEnvironment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. object of this Act is to ensure that the significant ensome vironmental issues of any Commonwealth action are thoroughly examined before decisions are taken. It was with this object in mind that he directed the preparation ofan enimpact statement on the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority's proposal to extend its 132kv sub-transmission around Belconnen and North Canberra, the extension along the Mount AinsUe-Majura in view of the inadequacy foothUls. to The extent to which the provision of this Act will be apof pUed to future proposals for areas of national importance will depend on a variety of factors including the form of the proposal, the extent to which environmental matters (in the widest sense of the phrase) have been taken into account and the extent to which pubUcreviewof the proposals is aUowed for or encouraged in any future Australian Capital Territory legislauon covering conservation matters. (3) The National Capital Development Commission is currently in the process of preparing alternative structure plans for the Mount AinsUe-Majura foothUls area, a prowhich involves analysis of all the relevant inforincluding the pubUc submissions.

(2) Is it a fact that no country people were given the opportunity to apply because details of the course were not made pubUc, until after the positions were filled; if so, why. capi- (3) When unemployment is higher in country areas, and prosome of this unemployment is due to industrial trouble at nursabattoirs, would it be preferable to give first priority to country people. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The meat inspectors course which is currently being conducted in Melbourne was established under the NEAT system following discussions between my Depanment, the Department of Primary Industry and the Victorian Department of Agriculture. The impetus for these discussions stemmed from a recognition within the Departments concerned that there was a growing shortage of meat inspectors in Victoria which could approach 100 by the end or 1977. Applicants for the course were interviewed by a selection panel which comprised one Veterinary Officer from each of the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industry and the Victorian Department of Agriculture, and a tive from the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. Preference in selection was given to the unemWorking ployed, although some employed people were selected ing where their employment was considered insecure or unsuitand able e.g. they were in only part-ume positions or had travel excessive distances to work. (2) No. Details of the course were circulated of the Commonwealth Employment Service in Victoria on 4.4.1977. This meant that country people had the same opportunity to apply as people living in Melbourne. applicants were in fact registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service although some applicadons came people working in meat works who were informed course by meat inspectors with whom they were working. applicants who were not already registered were required register with the CES. As there approximately 100 positions, it was felt to be unnecessary to advertise it more widely, although it was given some press pubhcity. (3) Of the 89 successful applicants 47 were from the metropolitan area and 42 from the country. As two thirds of the registered unemployed are in the metropolitan area and one third in the country, the ratio of successful applicants to unemployed was higher for country areas than for the metropolitan area.

Quaran Mr Adermann-The Minister for Science has January provided the following answer to the honourable assisted by advising member's question: (1) It has been stated that Eurpoean carp was introduced to Victoria as a potential sport and foodfishas early as 1872, (QuestionNo. 1082) but it is uncertain whether that introduction was successful. There is good evidence that it was successfully introduced to Reservoir (New South Wales) in 1907-08. Howwidesprean dissemination of carp in southern Australian waters dates from about 1960. At that time a fish farm was established in Gippsland and 1961 it began to sell carp to farmers in the vicinity for stocking dams and rivers. in There are some grounds for believing this was a different from earlier introductions. Though breeding, rearing sale of the fish became illegal in Victoria in 1961, the damage had been done and there is evidence of illicit as well should be as natural spread since that time. (2) There have been no legal introductions of European carp in recent decades, nor would legal introduction nave been permitted as the authorities were well aware of the fish's undesirable characteristics. (3) Not applicable. (4) Carp have now entered much of the River system and its tributaries. southern-flowing rivers of eastern Victoria and in such isolated streams as the Tambo and Snowy. (5) The effects of otherfishmay generally be expected to be adverse. The Victorian government is undertaking a study aimed at determining the impact fish and on waterfowl. There are documented Victorian lakes and rivers where carp have substantially ehminated other fish but there has not been an extensive study of their effect in the Murray River system. (6) Carp stir up mud and the water unattractive to many other species and increases the cost and difficulty of clarifying water for urban use. (7) CSIRO concentrates on marinefisheries,as the inland waters are under State jurisdiction, and has not developed major expertise in freshwaterfisheries.The carried out research on carp. However, the Victorian governpletion, These ment is investigating two possible methods of control, one Undercliffe involving a genetic approach disease thought to be specific for European carp.

(2) If sofa) does this mean that he no a fake and (b) will this mean that blood from Australian be made available to the doctor's clinic.",138
267,Mr HUNT,TRADE UNION TRAINING AUTHORITY,"The answer to the honourable required member's question is as follows: (I) and (2)1I have been aware for some dme now of the conunuing and misleading campaign being undertaken by the newspaper concerned in support of Mr Vlasumil Brych, an unqualified pracudoner in the Cook Islands who claims to be an expert on cancer. Largely have issued three Press statements since early May warning Australians of the possible dangers involved. My Press statement of 31 May referred to the totally leading impression, fostered by the newspaper in quesuon, that the Australian Government recognised Mr Brych's qualificadons. I pointed out at that dme Insurance Act provides for payment of benefits for expenses incurred by Australian residents temporarily overseas in respect of Schedule medical services rendered by 'a person authorised to practise as a medical pracudoner under the of the place where the service was rendered'. The Act fore relates to the registration, not qualificadons. Mr Brych does not possess any medical qualificadons has been the subject of a long and detaUed investigation by various medical and other authorities in New Zealand. the(3) Despite numerous opportunities to produce facts or figures to substantiate his alleged cancer treatment procedures and results, Mr Brych has faUed to produce any supporting dence for his claims. It is not to give false hopes to unfortunate terminal cancer victims seeking unproven therapeutic regimens in the Cook Islands. Mr Brych was registered practitioner in March 1977 following an amendment to that country's Medical Act specifically designed to permit his registration. Under the existing health insurance legislation therefore, services specified in the Schedule that are rendered by Mr Brych attract medical benefits at the present time. There is no relationship between the payment of benefits and 'recognition' of Mr Brych's quaUfications. As pointed out previously, the existing legislation gives no option but pay benefits for Schedule services Islands by Mr Brych. The Government has not approved the unrestricted release of blood supplies to Mr Brych for patients temporarily residing in the Cook Islands. The Minister of Health for the Cook Islands has not complied with the necessary convide ditions to permit a once-only assistance, on humanitarian grounds, for thefiveAustralian patients for whom assistance had previously been sought. For further detaUed information on the Cook Islands and Mr Brych I would refer the member for Batman to my Press statements of 12 May, 31 May and 8 August 1977. Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 16 August 1977: (1) Did the then Treasurer report on 19 August 1975 (Budget Paper No. 1, Attached Government would aim to provide primary school children by 1982.

(5) Did he estimate that 2300 dental therapists would be to provide a dental service to all primary school chUdren.",151
