A most regretIs- table incident to me, sir, is that the statue of Mr Lloyd George was not draped with the Union Jack. I regard this as a matter of much importance, which it is proper to refer to in connection with the question put by the new Minister for the Navy. The statue of Mr. Lloyd George ""was not draped with the Union Jack, or with the red flag of Bolshevism, but was covered with the Red Dragon of Wales.",20

' Mr EODGERS - I noticed the paragraph referred to. The report may be correct, but the statement is false.

30,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS BASED ON,Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson). - Thre e questions have just been asked on the basis of paragraphs which have appeared in the public newspapers.

34,Mr HUGHES,QUESTIONS BASED ON,"That would be a very good idea, of course; but I suppose that the position is that the British Government have bought the meat referred to, and the vicarious generosity suggested by the honourable member might not appeal to them. Probably what they would say, if I made the suggestion put forward by the honourable member, is that since we have plenty of meat here, we might send some of our surplus commodity direct to the starving peoples overseas. UNEMPLOYMENT .",21
35,Mr MAKIN,QUESTIONS BASED ON,"Some weeks ago I asked the Prime Minister to table reports from the State Premiers concerning unemployment in Australia.

In view of that opinion,' and the criticism of the Treasurer, that the terms were extortionate and extremely high, will the right honourable gentleman now apologize to the Queensland Government for his unfounded statement?",22

42,Mr HUGHES,QUESTIONS BASED ON,"I have already received, I think, two deputations on this matter. I set out my personal opinions on the subject when addressing my constituents in Bendigo.. Shortly put, my reply is that I cannot see what advantage can arise out of the Pool without unity of control. . I am not responsible for the lack of co-ordination, and as my party was returned upon the distinct understanding that there should be no compulsion, I do not propose to use any. Let those who are responsible for disunity now bring about unity.  Prime Minister aware that during his recent absence in London this House unanimously carried a motion in favour : of a compulsory Pool for next season's wheat, and that the right honourable gentleman's colleagues acquiesced in the resolution?

75,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,"Hav e you also me . M t . CHARLTON - Yes ; I congratulatethe Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) upon the very clear way in which he has presented his Budget. He afforded honourable 'members every facility to follow hirii ""very easily. It is pleasing to note the very hopeful view the right honourable gentleman takes in regard to our primary products. The future welfare pf, the country depends largely upon the' nature of the seasons we enjoy. For-' tunately, during the last few years these have been very good, and there is everyappearance of the incoming season being' equally good. The only doubt is whether or not the prices we obtain for our sur-. plus products in the overseas markets will be nearly up to those recently received, for upon this our future prosperity depends, entirely. I shall not devote much time to this matter now, because in the course of my speech I intend to deal with one or two. matters at considerable-length, but I think that the Government should take some steps towards the establishment of a Wheat Pool. There are difficulties in the way, I admit, principally owing to the fact that the States control the land and railways; but as the farmers throughout Australia have, in no uncertaiu man-, ner, expressed a desire for a Pool, I think the best interests of Ithe country would be served by the Government doing something in this direction. I trust that the Commonwealth Government will endeavour to meet the representatives of the States and carry into eflect the wishes of the farmers. Ifno Pool is established I am afraid the returns from the sales of our produce overseas will not be as good as. we might expect to receive through the operation of a Pool. The adoption of various policies in the different States, for the. disposal of wheat will not work out to the benefit of the producers. . Honourable, members on this side of-the Chamber are particularly anxious that the wheat-grower shall get a fair return for his labour and that the consumer also, shall get his wheat' at a fair price. We believe that this can be brought about by a Wheat Pool properly managed by a Board comprising representatives of the consumers as well as ithe producers. At any rate, if nothing is done in this direction the Government ought not to lose sight of the fact that during the war, in response to their request, to the. farmer to raise wheat, additional areas were put under cultivation, and that if the farmer is now permitted to suffer a disadvantage by not being in a position to;get a fair return for his. labours, the effect upon Australia asi a whole must be detrimental.. We are de- pending upon the money we obtain from; the sale of - our. primary produce overseas^ to help us through the trying times ahead.; The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), pointed out that we have been obtaining, the. cheapest sugar in the world, and that, may be true, because during the early stages of the war we were getting supplies; at lower rates than were ruling in other; countries. . In 1916, sugar was being re--, tailed at 3£d. per lb - the average for sitf years was 4d. per lb - and since 25thi March, 1920, the price has been 6d.< per lb. . The last-mentioned price is' considerably above the world's parity,' because sugar is now being soldi elsewhere at a lower price than ib. is being retailed here. Provision has been made whereby jam makers can obtain supplies at the world's parity when,, the. sugar is to be. used in the manufacture) of jam; but we' are anxious to know how: long it will be before the consumers throughout Australia will be able to pur-i chase sugar at a lower price. This is ar matter of vital concern to the people of the Gommonwealth. The production of canein 1919-20 was 1,350,000 tons, and for 1921-22 we expect to produce 2,160,000"" tons. With that quantity available, the price to consumers should be considerably, reduced. Surely there js no reason why; the present high rate should continue. Notwithstanding thecriticism appearing in the press from time to time, and the statements made' in this House that capital is"" being driven out of the country, it was very pleasing to hear the Treasurer"" state that ho less than 2,032 companies were registered in Australia during1920, in which capital amounting to. £148,270,614 was invested, and that for six. month's of 1921, 737 .companies had been registered in which-£89,989,292, Had been invested. When we' are informed that capital is beiiig driven out bf the country, and that industries are being retarded', owing to the action of industrialists, we need only refer to the Trea-i surer's statement to find the answer. More companies are being registered, and a larger-amount of capital is being invested, than has been the case before: - -;; ..., The Treasurer also referred to the question of shipbuilding, and pointed out provision had been made on the Estimates 'for £3,000,000for .defraying the cost 'ships built in Great Britain. nexion with our shipbuilding policy, - time has arrived when we should build - in the Commonwealth. - Mr GREGORY - If such a. large amount 'of capital has been invested-, why there been so much unemployment? . Mr Charlton - Principall y be the cause we arc in the aftermath of war, industry generally has been interfered - with here as has been the case, in other' - countries.. I know that we shall be that ships can be built cheaper abroad - than here. That is probably true; bub must not lose sight of the fact that building ships here we employ our people, and in doing so assist in maintainin ing a greater number of producers who, in turn, contribute to the revenue. need for more population is on every lips; but what is the use of repeating a cry when we are sending £3,000,000 - of the country to pay for ships that - be built in Australia 1 At the request --the Government, preparations were made .At Walsh Island, and at other ship-buildwith - ing yards, for the construction of ships - the dimensions that are being constructed r abroad, and those controlling the - building industry were informed at the ""* - time that the work would be permanent. i But immediately after the war terminated - tralian ,the ship construction policy of the. Go'-vernment .was changed, and ships are now .being built - of - material produced in [ enemy countries, whilst our own people . Bank, /are out of employment.' It has always been contended that it is essential, in, interests, of the Commonwealth, that I should have our own iron and steel works; . arising and now that such works' have been lished on a sound basis, the Government 'are preventing industries in which iron ' and.steely can be utilized from operating. .amount. The present policy, of. the Government ; construct ships abroad prevents a - of our. own people obtaining, employment, ^ o t only in the . shipbuilding. yards, in the steel and iron works which produce ""^he. material, which the shipbuilders - quire.' Even if the cost of building here ' be'slightly ""higher, we! should - balance the . position byexpending the 'money in -:own country, and'finding employment for -'<6wr own"" people,"" It is pleasing to note that the war'exthat - penditure from revenue is decreasing,, and that it will be much less this year than of it was during the last financial year; but, In conin bringing about a reduction in our war the expenditure, we must be careful not to do an injustice to those who went overseas to fight. If the reduction in expenhas diture is legitimate, we have no opposition to offer; but if it is to be made at expense of the men who are partially aud or wholly incapacitated, the policy is wrong, and will not have our support. The Treasurer also referred to what told were known as "" Fisher's flimsies,"" and this matter is of particular interest to the we La'bour party. It is very refreshing to by carry our minds back to the period beown tween 1910 and 1913, when Labour was power, and recall that we were held up to ridicule in this House and by the press The because wo'wore bringing a note issue into one's operation. We were told that we were such men lacking experience, and knew nothing out concerning finance. Our critics at that can time said that every note should have a of sovereign behind it, and they went further, and said*that we would bo inundated notes reeking with disease and carryof ing infection throughout the Commonwealth. What do we find? The Treasliipsurer, in his Budget speech, said- . The profits from investments of the AusNote Issue appear for the first time in the Treasury Accounts. They are payable ' to - the Treasury by virtue of the Act passed last session, which"" placed the Note Issue under . a - special, department of the Commonwealth under a Board of Directors. In .order not to interfere with the compari' son, I ""have not included in' thefigureswhich I the : have just quoted any reference to the sum of .we ,£7,780,524, which represents thenet profit .from.the. Note, Issue up to ,the time at which it was handed over to the Note Issue estabBoard on the 14th December, 1920. That sum was used for' the' redemption of Commonwealth Inscribed Stock and Treasury Bills for.a like to ,.T^ is very pleasing, indeed, to note that number the legislation that we were condemned , for introducing-has proved such a huge but success. . Australian .taxpayers have been saved nearly. £8,000,000,. andtheinvestrement of that sum is bringing in 'a larger -*- return"" every year. The Treasurer's sta,ter our -'ment shows'clearly that in 1910-13 the - Labour' Government"" rendered ""a great ser. vice to the' Commonwealth' by passing the - Australian Note Act... ""Let me ask honourable members what legislation was responsible for this country successfully prosecuting the recent war? Was it not legislation passed by the Labour Government ? - .l venture to say there is only one, answer, and that is "" Yes."" party was it brought about the creation of the Commonwealth Bank? Was it not the Labour party? And was it not in this connection, with the note issue, that the Commonwealth found the necessary money to finance us during the great ordeal?' There is other legislation to the credit of the Labour party, such as the land tax, and so forth. The programme carried out by the Labour party when in power stands out in comparison with the legislation passed by any other party during the existence of this Parliament. There is another matter to which I desire briefly to call attention. The Treasurer in his Budget speech told - us that the arrears of the various direct taxes are estimated to amount to the huge sum of £7,500,000. He has stated since that it was nearly £8,900;000, but that something like £3,000,000 had been collected. The sum seems a large one to be outstanding.  payments.",26
76,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,"The Treasurer does not make that clear in his Budget speech, by which we have to be guided. It is stated in black and white that this represents arrears of direct taxation. I do not know, who the people are who owe this large amount; but, if it is necessary to prosecute the poor man in order to enforce the payment of his income tax of 10s. or 15s., it is equally necessary to prosecute others who owe larger sums to the Commonwealth. There may, of course, be good reasons why this. is not done.  bunal, and numbers of cases have not been settled.:",29
77,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,"We are not told so by the Treasurer, who simply said that there is this large amount outstanding.  there are reasons why it is outstanding.",29
78,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,"We are told that the accumulated surplus at the 30th June, 1921,-was £6,618,327, and the Treasurer says-- ' ' - This means that, not only was the surplus at the beginning , of last year, viz., £5,724,806, kept intact, but I was able to add to it to the extent of £893,521. Which Of course, it is a good thing to have a surplus, but when it is at the expense of the aged poor of this country it is a bad thing. There is not a shadow of a doubt but that we ought to have increased old-age pensions during the life of this Parliament - Notwithstanding the high increase in the cost of living, we find that the aged and infirm are asked to subsist on 15s. per week. This surplus is placed in a Trust Fund for the purpose of paying old-age pensions, and re-. Gently we have decided that it shall also pay war pensions. If we had devoted part,of this money to paying an extra 5s. per week to the aged poor, it would, with 140,396 pensioners, have entailed an expenditure of only £1,825,148. Are the old people entitled to this increase? If they are, why should we begrudge them it? Why not amend the Invalid and Old age Pensions Act in order that we may pay it? The great point is that this extra payment would not involve additional taxation, seeing there is over £6,000,000 in the Trust Fund. From time to time honourable members on this side have asked the Treasurer to increase the invalid, and old-age pensions, but he * has always informed us that he had no money, and that any increase would mean additional taxation; yet, we find that there is a surplus available of not less than £6,000,000. While it is necessary to economize we should not economize at the expense of the aged poor. I wonder how these poor people live, in' view of the high cost of all commodities. Some of these people have to pay house rent out of their pension, and they - ought to be provided for, even if it should mean additional taxation. ""There is now sufficient money in the Trust Fund to pay an extija 5s. per week for three years, and I hope, ' therefore, that the Treasurer will give some consideration to this matter. The estimated revenue for the year 1921-22 is £61,787,350 ; and the expenditure, £64,604,158; showing a deficiency ou the year's transactions of £2,817,108. The surplus available from the year 1920-21 is £6,618,327, leaving an estimated, surplus at the 30th June, 1922, of £3,801,219. It will be seen that there is a - deficiency qn the year's transactions of £2,817,108. We, on this side, as a party, desire to see the ledger, squared, though . not at the expense of employment in this country. We desire to expend as much as possible'on services that are absolutely necessary to the welfare of the people, and the development of Australia.",29
79,Sir JOSEPH QOOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,"May I remind the honourable member 'that there are 9,000 people depending on these votes alone. . Mr Charlton"" - That may be; but if the ledger is to be squared-if the amendment given notice of by the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page), is given effect to, what becomes of the argument. that .we used in regard to the Postal .Department the other day'? Speaking from memory, I think we are asked to expend about £1,300,000 extra on that Department, and if the Estimates are to be reduced that expenditure must share in the reduction. Every man and woman in Australia knows that postal facilities have been lagging behind for several years, in consequence of the war and the inability of the Government to obtain the necessary material"" for carrying on works. In the interests of the development of Australia we cannot legitimately cut down expenditure which affords employment to so many-afford s more employment, perhaps, than a similar amount would afford if expended for defence purposes. The money expended on the Postal Department would not only give much employment, but would open up the country in a way that is absolutely necessary if we are to settle more people on the land, and in- were written. crease our population. We, on this side, do not want a deficit, but if the accounts to be squared, it must not be at the expense of the man in the country or the man in the city. The man in the city requires expenditure on the provision of telephonic, telegraphic, and other facilities, just as does the man in the country, but such services have been starved for years. We do not desire to interfere with what may be termed the utilities of public service, but would rather see reductions in expenditure directed to the increase of means for the injuring of mankind by bloodshed: I see from the Budget speech - that the expenditure from war loans is decreasing, and that is very satisfactory., ['now desire to turnto the comparison. of total expenditure. We are told in the Budget speech that the total actual, expenditure for 1920-21 was £92,87.^314,' - while the estimated expenditure for 1921-22 is £81,397,632. There is' an increase, of £1,495,448 out of .Works loan, anda decrease in the expenditure out of revenue of £19,629, while the decrease of expenditure out of war loan is £12,952,501, making the net decrease £11,476,682. I desire to draw the attention 'of the Treasurer to these figures. This Budget' deals with millions of pounds more than was the case . a . few years ago. It has gone up by leaps and bounds. I have been thinking of what happened in the 1910-13 Parliament, when the Labour party was sitting on the Government benches. It was then that we tprovided for all those works which have been the backbone of this country .during Tecent years, although we' were, at the time, held up to ridicule and condemned, .The right honourable the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) himself wrote a work called The Financial Carnival. In i the stated thatYet another reason for keen scrutiny remains. A new order of tilings with respect to auditing has been inaugurated by the present Treasurer. The balance-sheet of any private firm or company is uBually signed by the auditor. 'In.the case of the Commonwealth transactions there is no such report or signature by the Auditor General. I want to remind the right honourable gentleman that those remarks are as' applicable today as they were when' they Where is the Auditor General's report on the present Budget? are Members of this House have been placed at a great' disadvantage owing to the' absence of that report. The Auditor-General's report is valuable for the purpose of indicating to members whether certain items in the Estimates should' be permitted, and whether there is anything irregular about them. It is impossible to get that information from the statement presented to the House by the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook). Evidently Parliament is in no better position today than when the Treasurer wrote that pamphlet, for we still have the Budget before us without having the Auditor-General's report upon it. The following passage also occurs in The Financial Carnival:^The. total taxation per head laBt year for Australia was at least £5'5s. per head-£2 6 5s. per family. On the average, therefore, every family pays 10s.. per week in taxation. Add to this the vicious, cycle set up by our Arbitration Courts, by means of which all the awards are made eventually, to land on - the shoulders of those who ask for them, and the mystery _ of the tremendous increase in the cost of living begins to clear perceptibly. We are "" paying for our whistle,"" and paying for it dearly. If we were "" p a y in g for our whistle and paying for it dearly "" when it cost £ 5 5s. per head, what can be said when it is costing us £ 1 2 18s. l i d . per head ? It does not now appear to be a "" financial carnival,"" but a financial tornado. And we are getting r i d of the money. Out of the £64,000,000 of £31,000,000 goes for war services. This leaves £33,000,000 with which the right honourable the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) has to manage the affairs of Australia., outside of war services. ""When the . strictures contained in The Financial Carnival were made against the party on this side of the House, the. Government was not getting anything like that amount of revenue. I think that the total amount approached £20,000,000. To-day,- with a revenue of £33,000,000, the Government is unable to make ends meet. I can only point these things out so that the right honourable gentleman may have his memory refreshed. » The publio debt of the country has in creased considerably, and, to-be fair, one has to admit that the war is chiefly responsible.",30
80,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,The war wholly responsible.,31
81,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,"Thos e of us who approved of entering into the war must expect a bill of this kind, but today the newspapers that urged Parliament. and the people to leave no stone unturned, and to spend every shilling obtainable, to prosecute the war, are condemning Parliament because of the heavy expenditure. Our debt today is £401,720,000, of which a sum of £69,710,993 is recoverable from the States. This leaves a net debt of £332,009.032, which is less now by £8,800,872 than it was at the end of June, 1920. Whatever attitude members take up, ithey ought to be fair, and say that Parliament was responsible for committing-the country to the war debt. That debt has to be carried, and, w h at ever else happens, it must be met. If all it is necessary to impose additional taxation for the purpose of meeting it , theburden must be borne. We cannot repu-j diate the debt.",31
82,Mr MATHEWS,MELBOURNE LETTER,"P u t it on the right-, shoulders.",31
83,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,"Yes ; that is the need. I believe that an expensive mistakewas made by this Government with regard to war gratuities. Members on this side of the House urged, when the last appeal to the country was made, that the money for war. gratuities should be:, borrowed, and. that the soldiers should' be paid in cash. ' In the light of what has transpired since, it is obvious that our advice was correct. The Government revenue, could have borrowed ab that time at 5 per cent. We now pay 5^ per cent, to the lads who hold the gratuity bonds. The i per cent, would have paid the cost, of floating a loan, and the public debt of this country would not have been in creased one shillingby the loan. On the other hand,- a great deal of trouble and much expense of administration would have been saved. The cost to the coun-' try would not have been half of what it has actually been. The Labour party's-advice would have . saved probably ' £100,000,- or more, if it had been f o i -: lowed. «Unfortunately, Parliament did''not accept the advice, and it was decided'' to cash gratuity bonds 'according to the-* circumstances of the recipient'. To-day' the branch of the Department dealing 11 with these bonds has to be kept alive, but - 1 if the Labour party's advice had been acted upon the work would have been': is almost completed some time ago, and the staff , might have been dispensed with. In regard to sinking funds, I consider that it is a good thing that we are providing funds to liquidate our debt., This coun^-, try ought to make ample provision byputting money into sinking funds to liqui--, date that debt. We cannot continue to* carry the present burden of debt yearafter year, and the sooner we can liqui date it the better it will be for all. It may take a long time to meet the"" obligation, but if we make ample provision, we will be doing the right thing. I find that i h connection with repatriation the Government has stated that there is a reduction in the cost of that work. That announcement is very pleasing, as far as it goes. If we are able to discharge ""part of our obligations! to-the soldiers their becoming fit and, able to follow usual occupations, it is a very good .But, on the other hand, any policy, that .deprives the soldiers of their rights wrong: In regard to repatriation, generally, I do not know that the Government are doing the right thing in There have been brought under - the circumstances of soldiers who are able to follow their former employment, ,and are not earning half what they earned .prior to enlistment, and yet have prived of their pensions. . That was intended by this House. Whilst .we .anxious to cut down expenditure as much .as possible, we do not desire injustices this kind to be perpetrated. Had the bungling which has pened in connection with the War Service ;Homes occurred in any Australian liament a few years ago, the Government .responsible for it could not have conin tinued in office for twenty-four hours. The War Service Homes administration ' has been unsatisfactory, since its inception. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) stated in Sydney a - few days ago that - this, service was unsatisfactory soldiers should at least remember that the adminduty istration was in the hands of fellow diers. From time to time, I have said .that we were not justified in appointing to positions requiring knowledge and perience returned sqldiers simplybecause they were soldiers. I would give ""much work to soldiers as is reasonably possible, but when the expenditure, ' £100,000,000 of money is involved, should .we appoint men to responsible positions merely because they are returned diers'? Should not the first consider a' tion be experience and qualification ' the work to be performed? Whether not the Commissioner who was dismissed "" recently was qualified and received deal from the Government,.I do not know. ' Tho reason given for his dismissal that .he was .an uncertificated bankrupt, - but if his services were satisfactory bankruptcy should not have debarred ' from occupying the position. If it was necessary to dismiss him in order to : ply with the Public Service'regulations * could have been reinstated. Mother hand, if the man's services were ' satisfactory, he had no right to continue to hold the position, and the Government by could have dismissed'him for a'moru solid their reason than his bankruptcy.

The Minister reduced his estimate-to'£7,000,000, and the Treaof surer later reduced it to £6,000,000. Then the Commissioner, being under the imhappression that as he had been instructed to expedite construction more money Parwould be available if he required it, pushed the work along, got the machinery full operation, purchased land for building sites, and thus in about five months expended the whole bf the vote of £6,000,000. The vote having been limited : to £500,000 per month, and it being found if that the money was being expended at the rate of £1,000,000 a month, was it not the of somebody to point out to the Comsolmissioner that he was spending in excess of his vote,, and that no more money would be available when the amount made availexable by.Parliament had been exhausted?

89,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,"As a matter of fact, it was the Treasurer who did pull him up. He gave us all sorts of excuses for his heavy initial expenditure, and told us that it would be lighter in the second half-year. I accepted his statement for a month or two, and then brought him to a standstill.",33
90,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,"It is true that the Treasurer did pull him up, but not until about November of last year, when the money had been already expended.",33
91,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,It had not all been expended.,33
92,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,"At all events, the Government had to provide another £1,000,000 for War Service Homes, and even then the Department could not meet its obligations. Sir JOSEPH COOK.'-We had to pay our debts whatever else happened.",33

They did not even inquire of the town clerk or mayor of these the municipality in which they were purI chasing, butwent to the land jobbers themselves - for information. Thus it happened that men who had bought land at reasonable prices, and held it for, perhaps, nine months, in some cases more and in others less, were able to sell it to the Commonwealtjh at prices considerably above those they had paid. Moreover, much of the land - was unfavorably situated; some of it was low-lying and insanitary. Upon this land the Commission has been building homes which soldiers have purchased, and in time the purchasers will find it desirable in the interests of health to abandon those homes.",33

99,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,"No . The. responsible officer appointed for the purpose of advising the Minister in the matter should do his duty thoroughly, because otherwise the Minister would be placed in a false position. I venture to say that, in connection with some of the purchases, that duty was not carried out completely.",33
100,Mr BAMFORD,MELBOURNE LETTER,The Commissioner had nothing to do with the purchase.,33
101,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,"I am aware of that. It was another public officer who had to report to the Minister, and on the strength of his report the land was purchased. Wliere the land was valued at above a certain sum- I think £2,000-it to be reported on by an officer.",33
102,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,The Surveyor General.,33
103,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,"And the Minister War was guided by that report - We have purchased a great deal of land that will bo required, because it is impossible to carry on the work of erecting homes to such an extent as to utilize all the land that has been acquired for the purpose. t is questionable whether we shall ever be able to dispose of the whole of that land. Newcastle it may be done, because there in the Department has built on the worse land it could get in the district. it. Sites on raised ground have not been bebuilt on, but land on which nobody else would think of erecting houses has been set apart for the. soldiers. It will be a difficult task for the soldiers to pay for houses, owing to the high initial cost. n some instances the occupants will have debts of £600 to £900 or £1,000, and that will be a heavy load for working men to bear. I fail to see bow they will ever discharge their obligations if property values, fall. We can expect, therefore, that many of these men, after struggling for three or four years, will be unable to go on paying for their homes, and will have to leave them. The soldiers do not know what their houses will actually cost. The complaint is that the Department has agreed to provide dwellings for a certain sum, and when the soldiers have received their accounts the total cost has run into £200 or £300 more than the amount agreed upon. These are matters to which we cannot shut our eyes. While the press has been crying for economy in regard to necessary expenditure, it has only made casual comments on the administration of the War Service Homes/Why has the press not featured this subject as a reason for the displacement of the Government? It is because the press does not know who might get into power. The Government .is able to carry on its maladministration at great cost to the country, and yet remain on the Treasury' bench. For incurring one-half the loss sustained in connection with our War Service Homes, a Government in New South Wales-according to my experience of that Statewonld have been replaced within twenty four hours. We appear to have grown very indifferent during the war period. We still seem to be in the clouds, and are willing to forgive political misdeeds, irrespective of what they are costing the country. A good deal of the money expended on these homes could have been saved, and that would have represented legitimate economy. War pensions have been very much reduced. By way of a final protest, I point out that they have been reduced unjustifiably. The returned men have not had a fair deal. In some instances where they were entitled to a full pension, and in other cases where a proportionate payment was justified, they have been completely deprived of the pension on the ground that their disability was not due to war-like operations. Where men have served their country, it should not be necessary for them to lose a leg or an arm, or suffer similar bodily injury, to entitle them to a pension. If their - earning power has been diminished through their going to the war, they, have a claim on the country. On the question of immigration, majt I suggest that we should first put our own house in order? Lord Northcliffe, and others, may feel' constrained to plead for more population in Australia, but we should begin, by. finding employment for our own people, and making them contented. Then let us make land available for future immigrants. If we could place them on the land under a proper scheme, so soon as they reach these shores, without their coming into competition with people already working here, the Labour party would not object, but we cannot lose sight of the fact that thousands of our own citizens are unemployed today, and there is no prospect of immediate improvement in the position. What is taking place in other parts of the world,\as a result of the war, is being reflected in Australia, and we contend that, until we can find constant employment for our own people, no immigrants should be brought out. Quite recently, some immigrants, who could not get employment here, returned to Great Britain.",33
104,Mr EILEY,MELBOURNE LETTER,They could not get houses.,34
105,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,"That is so. They ' went back declaring that Australia waa not what it had been represented to theia to be. Could there be a worse advertisement for the Commonwealth than that?: The Government are now providing for a joint immigration scheme for .the States and the Commonwealth, and although' some of the States have not'expressed a willingness to participate, money is being made available for the purpose of bringing out immigrants. The first duty of Parliament is to make available land that will be most suitable for settlement. From one end of Australia to the other the best land is held by a few individuals. Advocates of immigration should begin by passing laws in the Federal and State Parliaments to compel the owners of large areas which are not being used to the best advantage to cut the land up and make it available for those who wish to come here from overseas. The best immigrant is the man who comes out to Australia of his own accord, who \has been attracted here because of his knowledge of the actual conditions pre\yailia g and the opportunities offering, - i In New South Wales there is to be heard ,:the cry for a million farmers, who are to che placed on a million farms.

I have before me a report by the Acting ' Administrator, dated 13th June, 1920, in which he statesAlthough two out of every three - men in Darwin were unemployed on the closing of the meat works, there was no rioting or disturbance of any kind. The Territory has been remarkably free from serious crime during the whole year. This law-abiding attitude of the workers was, I believe, largely due to the Prime Minister's pledge that the people of the Northern Territory would be granted representation in the Federal Parliament, after having had the parliamentary franchise taken from them since 1911. I think the taunts that have been hurled at the workers here, by certain misinformed people, that they are variously Bolshevists, Industrial Workers of the World, and Anarchists, can be refuted by the record they hold that a larger percentage of men voluntarily enlisted for the Front than in any other part of Australia, that they subscribed more per capita to the Bed Cross Fund, that they carried the conscription referenda on every occasion, and have erected a magnificent monument in-Darwin to their fallen comrades. . There could be no better testimony to the loyalty ' of the people of the Northern . Territory - Here is a further statement residents. , from the same report It is an interesting reflection that while the various States of. the Commonwealth during ' the last forty-six years have been covered with telegraph lines, even to the most remote settlements, not one mile has been built by the Government in the Territory, and yet it can be that for ' said, that no' Public Service is more valuable, and no' other agency, for the expenditure incurred, is more stimulating to development. . . . . ' The Northern Territory is the last province of Australia to claim the toga of citizenship. . . The promise of the Prime Minister of Australia that a Bill would be introduced to give the people of the' Northern Territory a representative in the National Parliament was received throughout ,the Territory with the keenest pleasure.  duced.",35
107,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,"""So far, the residents of the Territory' have not secured representation. The statement of the Acting Administrator proceedsFor twenty years the people of the Northern Territory, thanks to South Australia, enjoyed the fullest franchise, and could proudly claim both State and Federal representation. On the 1st January, 1911, the Commonwealth assumed the control of the Territory, and all - citizenship and voting power was taken from them, and this condition has continued, up to .the present, although section 122 of the Commonwealth ' Constitution ' expressly provides that ""The Parliament may make laws for the government of any Territory surrendered by any State . . . and may allow the representation of such Territory in either House of the Parliament to the extent and on the terms which it thinks fit."" A new era is dawning for the Territory; there is now a definite prospect of the early introduction of legislation to give the people of the Northern Territory a representative in the Federal Parliament, and this has given general satisfaction. We have the power to give them representation in accordance with the terms of promises made; but nothing has yet been done. I desire now to call attention to some features of administration in the Mandated Territories. It is my intention to quote from reports published in the Age, wherein certain statements 'are made by persons who, obviously, possess a wide knowledge of the Mandated Islands. If these comments and charges contain any considerable proportion of truth, I can only say that the sooner action is taken by this Parliament the better it will be for Australia. A correspondent, writing from New Guinea to the Age, alleges cases of the flogging of natives. The Age report states' He gives details of cases wherefloggingswere administered on the instruction of subordinate officials, in'spite of a Governmenfproelamation absolutely prohibiting such form of punishthe ment. . ' . . He supplies particulars of evidence that was given at an inquiry held on 25th July into the alleged flogging of native named Jerimota, who was employed at the New Guinea Club, Rabaul. Two forgrave mer police boys swore that they only gave Jerimota five cuts with a .cane. It was at the inquiry that a member of the New Guinea Club had been so incensed at the condition which he found Jerimota after the flogging that he struck the police master and knocked him senseless in the road. . . . On 15th August, states our correspondent, another 0 quiry was .held into the alleged flogging two natives at the order of a youth of eighteen .This led to a number of strikes and disturb or nineteen, who was employed as a road master. In this case it was alleged that luluai (a native chief) and a tultul (subin chief) had been flogged. Questioned by Board of Inquiry, the road master said that had never been told officially that there such a thing as a Native Labour Ordinance. had never been led td believe that he could punish a native for a serious offence, but imagined that - he could do so for a small offence, where it seemed unnecessary to trouble ing a handsaw. head-quarters. The .luluai, in his evidence, said that the police boy - unloosed his loin cloth, gave him ten cuts with a cane and with a heavy stick. The police boy then Dim to flog the tultul, and handed him stick, with which he gave the tultul twenty strokes. The Board of Inquiry found that two floggings had beenadministered. W it h respect to the natives employed o n Nauru Island, it is claimed in the A g t that slavery is being practised under a very thin disguise. The newspaper Tajport statesA widely-travelled engineer who is now im Melbourne, and who has worked on the island for nearly a year, has many charges to leveS. against the management of the Oommassion;The most serious of these allegations relates to a question of policy, and suggests the introduction of a very thinly disguised form of slavery in the phosphate fields, which will arouse the indignation of the people. of Australia. Hitherto the labourers employed on Nauru have consisted entirely of Chinese coolies c u t ' Kanakas. There are about 700 Chinese and 200 < Kanakas employed in various capacities. Thessi' are indentured for two years, and are paid'.! at the rate of 32s. a month, with 4s. a months bonus, and food' supplied. Recently a new - system has been introduced. Members of the staff have been sent recruiting in Admiralty - Islands, and have enlisted a number of "" boys 9 from that territory. In the last three months the first batches of these ""boys,"" numbering forty-one, hare arrived, and have been set to work. These are being paid 5s. a month. They receive 2s. of this 5s. each month, and the remaining 3s. is retained until they have finished their term, which varies from two to throb years. Tliese natives, though unaccustomed to carrying heavy burdens, are put to the same task as Chinese, and are required to do the same the amount of work each day, loading 5 tons IS cwt. into trucks. They are herded in a coma pound, and, according to all reports, have anything but a happy time. The allegation is a one, demanding the immediate attention of the Government. These are methods which stated are not likely to appeal to Australians. The Chinese, too, apparently have little reain son to rejoice over, the change in management which has taken place recently. It is declared! that their rations were drastically shortened & few months ago, being limited to 20 lb. of beef inper day per 100, and many irritating restrictof tions were imposed on their . movements^ 1 nnces, of which nothing has been heard. I B a one of these disturbances the Chinese casta conflict with the police, and two coolies the were wounded. They opened a theatre, for he which they subscribed nearly £400, and imwas ported costumes from China. The manager die! He not like the performance, and the theatre was arbitrarily closed. Severe penalties have been he imposed for trifling offences. One Chinese was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for stealAnother was awarded six months' gaol for. stealing some old sleepers, . although' he had the explanation that they were ten given to him by another Chinest, who received told them from a white resident. These and manya heavy other similar instances are quoted - by the traveller as indicating the antagonistic polinjr the adopted toward the Chinese, which, hedeclares, threatens to lead to serious - trouble* - -"" There is a. further complaint against the management, which is declared to display an unreasoning antipathy' toward Australians. The officers of the Commission are drawn mostly from men who, before the change-over, were employed as clerks, or in some other minor capacity, and they have adopted a policy which has established cliques and led to many quarrels on the island. A typical instance is given, in which the manager and an Australian who ssrved for four years in the A J.F. was concerned. The Australian was at work in his oflicfc when the manager entered-and he went on working. The manager rebuked him, and ordered that he should stand up when his superior entered the room. The Australian resigned on the spot. Other Australians have had similar experiences.  - you have read are anonymous. ."" Mr Charlton - They are the - statements of a man who says that he was for a year on the island, and they should be inquired into, so that Australia's name - may not he associated with the upholding 'Of slavery. ! Sir JOSEPH 'COOK - I do not think that a person who - makes anonymous state-mentis canclaim the right to hav« them inquired into. It is a fair thing to require this man to iput his name to the statements that have been read by the honourable member. ' Mr Charlton - It would be better j f He did so; but the fact that he has not done so does not absolve the Government from the obligation of inquiring whether slavery is being practised in Nauru under Australian administration. I am sorry that the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook)-, in outlining the proposed amendments of the income tax legislamemlbers tion, has not promised an increase of exemption. It is not necessary for us to operation. The members of these sociehave the report of the Taxation Commisties sion 'in order to deal with that matter. If , when the cost of living was very lower than it ' is now, an exemption _ £150 was fair, the present exemption with goods. should be at least £300. It was never intended that the poorer persons in the community should the made to come tax; the tax was imposed so that those who were able to do so might tribute towards defrayingthe cost of war. In the circumstances, there is no justification for leaving the general exemption at £150, and the exemption for single persons without dependants at £10-as income. £100. When the tax was first proposed, I held that the exemption should bo not less than £200; and now I am of opinion that it should be increased in proportion to the increase in the cost of living. Not only should the exemption be increased, but - it should be made uniform,' and ample allowance should be made in respect of children. I shall say nothing about the annual average proposal of the Treasurer until the Bill is before us; but I wish to say a few words on the proposal that the recipients of the rebates distributed by co-operative societies shall not Ibe taxed on these rebates if the societies have already paid taxation on the money. It must be remembered that a society formed in accordance with the Rochdale system of co-operation is quite different' from an ordinary co-operative company which seeks to make .profit. Under the Rochdale system, .working' people combine to purchase goods at wholesale prices for distribution among themselves. The societies charge for . these goods something like current prices, so that they may get sufficient capital to work on; but when their balance-sheets are made up at the end of the half-year, or at other intervals, they repay to their members any sum they may have over and above what is necessary for working expenses. These repayments are not in the nature of dividends on money invested; they are merely a return of capital.  to the interest paid by Savings Banks?",35
108,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,"No ; and to tax them is to impose double taxation on the of co-operative societies, which the is not the right way to encourage cor pay tax on their incomes over and aibove the exemption, and should not be much taxed on the money they put into coof operative societies to supply themselves  pay ininvestment of that money?",37
109,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,"No . A person conwho bought goods from a firm like the Anthony Horderns, and received a discount of, say, 2s. in the £1, would not be required to return the total amount of the discount so received-say , £5 or",37
110,Mr BELL,MELBOURNE LETTER,"It is taxed. - Mr Charlton"" - That is not so. ""Why, then, should the members of a cooperative society pay tax on the capital that is returned to them? What the Treasurer promises is that if the society has paid tax on the accumulated funds which , are paid to its members in the of rebates, these members shall not be taxed on what they so receive. The law, however, does not require a society tax,on such money. For years we have been told that the people should cooperate in the matter of production and supply, reducing costs by cutting out the middlemen; and yet it is proposed to pose double taxation on those who follow that advice. However, I shall deal more fully with the matter when the Rill is introduced. I come now to what I consider the most important subject before us. I have, said that we, on this side of the chamber, desire economy; but we do not desire economy at the expense of the utilities the country.",37
111,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,"Do you suggest that Defence is not such a utility? "" Mr Charlton"" - The economy that we desire should be made in connection with the Defence Estimates.",38
112,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MELBOURNE LETTER,Would you not propose retrenchment in some of the big Departments as well as the military?,38
113,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,"If the honourable member can show where legitimate economy can be exercised, he will find that the Committee will support him in any proposal he may make to that end. During the war it was said from almost every platform that the war was a war to end war, and that the useless expenditure on armaments for the destruction of mankind would cease after we had won the war. The Labour party stood behind every movement for bringing about disarmament. The members of it supported the establishment of the League of Nations when prominent men threw cold water on it.' We saw that it would make for the salvation of the peoples if we could get them to come together for the settlement of international disputes without recourse to the arbitrament of war. But we have been met with opposition from unexpected quarters. At the recent Conference of the Assembly of the League, forty-eight countries were represented, and it was resolved, on the motion of Lord - Cecil, that there should be no further expenditure on armaments for at least two years, to give time for the putting into operation of the League's proposals. Now, several of the big nations of the world are way sending representatives to a Conference to be held at Washington to discuss, disarmament or the limitation of armato payments. The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), as I said a week or so ago, did not appear too sympathetic with the object in view, and an utterance which he made in Sydney last week supports my im- statement. He said that now that PresidentHarding had come down from the clouds, and believes that what is practicable is not disarmament, but the limitation ' of - armaments, he is with him whole-heartedly. Plainly, the right honourable gentleman was not previously behind the proposal for the Conference, and did hot push it until he found that popular feeling favoured its objects. When of he found that it was thought here that something should be done oh the lines suggested by President Harding, he took certain action; but his speech .in Sydney shows that until President Harding made a certain statement last week, .he was not whole-heartedly with him. The Labour party stands for the limitation of armaments, and, indeed, for the abolition ' of armaments at the earliest moment that it can be brought about. If the people of Australia were asked tomorrow whether they preferred to spend money on machinery for the destruction of human life or to have the utmost done to bring about arrangements with the other nations of the world for complete disarmament, nine-tenths of the population would vote for the latter proposal.",38
114,Mr ROBERT COOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,Would the honourable member not require some assurance of safety before he agreed to disarmament?,38
115,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,MELBOURNE LETTER,"Hear , hear!",38
116,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,We should have that assurance from the knowledge that the other nations of the world agreed with us in bringing into force either the limitation of armaments or complete disarmament.,38
117,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,MELBOURNE LETTER,"They have not agreed to that yet. Mr Charlton"" - It is true that they have not, and my complaint is that the public men, not only of this country, but of the various countries of the world, appear to have been unimpressed by what happened during the recent disastrous war, or they would be bending all their energies to breathing the breath of life into the League of Nations in order that action might be taken by the League to bring war to an end. We on this side stand for preventing war altogether if that be at all possible. We believe that there should be an understanding amongst the peqples of the world recognising that we are all brothers. Every effort should be made to prevent the expenditure of money upon weapons of destruction and to divert its expenditure to purposes of more advantage to the people of every country. That is the policy which the Opposition placed before the public from time to time during the war. We expected that after the war the leading menof all countries would bend their energies in that direction. We did not look to them to be talking about the likelihood of war in this or that part of the world, and the necessity for preparing for it, because as surely as we have preparation for war, so surely will that bring about war. That has been the experience of the world. If we bend our energies in the opposite direct tion, and the representatives of the different nations come together for the purpose of abolishing war, something will be clone in the interests, not only of our country? but of the whole of mankind. If that course be followed we may hope that something will be done to realise the de^ sire expressed in the preaching of the Nazarene many years ago. He did not preach war. On the contrary, He looked for a time when the implements for the destruction of the human race would be beaten into ploughshares. We should do all that we can to hasten the' advent of that time, but we cannot do so unless some effort is made to curtail expenditure on armaments. We on this side are prepared, in common with the members of the Country party, to have the Estimates referred back to the Government for the purpose of reconsideration, but we have no wish to bring about any interference with necessary works. We do not desire that there should be further unemployment in connection with the Small Arms Factory or any other Government institution.",38
118,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MELBOURNE LETTER,"If the amendment of which notice has been given is carried,, the Small Arms Factory will go.",39
119,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,MELBOURNE LETTER,"And the Maribyrnong Factory, too.",39
120,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,"The Small Arms Factory might have been utilized for thtr production of articles for use in this country. Who was it that prevented that being done? The Government prevented it. They said, "" That is not our policy; we will not permit it . We would rather dismiss the men at the Factory and throw them upon the labour market than allow that to be done."" My honourable friends of the Country party joined with me only a week ago in expressing approval of the additional expenditure proposed on the Estimates for the .Postmaster-General's Department. The amount placed on the Estimates of the current year for that Department exceeds the amount voted last year by £1,300,000. That proposed increased expenditure was very generally approved. Do the members of the Country party now iptend that that expenditure shall be cut out? Do they desire to cut out that expenditure for increasing the facilities of the people and the development of the country? It appears to me that it is the intention of the Country party, according to the amendment of which notice has been given by the own Leader of the party (Dr Earle Page), to have the Estimates of revenue and expenditure balanced by cutting down expenditure proposed for Departments in which it is absolutely necessary that increased expenditure should take place.",39
121,Dr EARLE PAGE,MELBOURNE LETTER,Not at all.,39
122,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,"I shall await the explanation of members of the Country party. I direct their attention to the fact that it will be a very difficult matter to cut down the Estimates by £2,800,000 without interfering with the additional expenditure of £1,300,000 proposed for postal and telegraphic services.",39
123,Mr ROBERT COOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,"We might save £1,000,000 on Federal salaries alone.",39

As a party, we stand economy, but we desire to further the terests of the country. We wish to give £31,000,000 increased facilities to people settle in the back-blocks. Of what use growing burden. is it to cut down the expenditura proposed for postal and ' services and then ask people - to go out 'into the back country, where they may have no facilities even to call up a doctor ' in time of sickness? We know the heavy 'expenditure incurred in connection w i ''Defence.

I find that Jbhat is the practice also of the House of Commons. For the infor- mation of honourable members, it would, be well if I read to them what other the practice of the House of Commons is. along It is stated in these termsThe reduction of a grant, or item must be of substantial, and not of a trifling, amount- That is a point we do not closely observenor may a series of motions be made upon the same grant raising substantially the same issue. When two or more amendments npon the same grant are at the same time tendered to the Committee, the Chairman puts first the amendment which proposes the largest reduction, and then, if that be not accepted, the lesser amendments. And so on. That is the practice followed, not only in the House of Commons, but in this Parliament, and in the Parliaments of the States. I , therefore, rule that the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) is now open for discussion, and when that has been disposed of, the main questiou may be open to further amendment.",40

It will be an amendment which should appeal to the whole of the members of the Committee, and will permit of this matter of finance being dealt with as it ought to be-as a non-party matter. It should do away with the folly of preventing Parliament, which is really elected to deal with the finances of the country, having - no say, other than as permitted by the"" Government, in the disposal of funds raised by taxation. I may say at once that I shall oppose the amendment now before the Chair in its present form, because I do not think it is possible, in existing circumstances, to reduce the Defence Estimates by £2,817,000. I think I shall be able to show that it is possible to re- 0 duce the Estimates, as a whole, by that amount, and, in such a wfiy as will not entail the dismal picture painted: by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) of the curtailment of the expenditure on postal services. I hope, before I sit down, to be able ,to suggest a better system than that now adopted for dealing with the postal service. The trouble relates not so much to the amount that is voted for the Department as to the time of the year at which it is placed at its disposal. The money is frequently made available in about the tenth month of the financial year, and the Department, in its effort to expend ib within the brief period at its disposal, is very like a carpet-snake that has swallowed a smalt wallaby whole, and has to sleep throughout the winter to digest it. Tne Department cannot digest the funds placed at its disposal so late in"" the year if Several honourable members interjecting,",41
127,The CHAIRMAN,MELBOURNE LETTER," I make a strong appeal to honourable members to cease these interjections. It is manifestly unfair, that an honourable member addressing the Chair should be prevented by such persistent interruption, from giving full expression to his views.",41
128,Dr EARLE PAGE,MELBOURNE LETTER,"I venture to say that no one has fought harder than my colleagues and I have done, both inside this chamber and outside of it, for the extension of postal, telephonic, and telegraphic facilities. At its entrance, in^o this Parliament ° the Country party at once challenged the ' Government on its method of administering the finances and presenting its financial statement. The Government immediately beat the party drum, and by a party vote defeated our first attempt. The only result achieved was the securingof a definite promise by the Government that the Budget for the succeeding year would be presented not later than August or September, so that honourable members might have an ©pportunity to discuss the national expenditure before the money was actually spent. When the Budget was presented last year, we discussed it at length, and submitted a motion providing for a reduction of the total estimated expenditure by £1,000,000. Unfortunately, the newer members on the Government side of the House were deluded by Ministers into the belief that they would be able to effect reductions when the individual items were under consideration, and they declined in the circumstances to support us in this demand for economy. Later on they discovered that it was quite impossible to effect reductions. Despite these two warnings, and notwithstanding the definite promises of economy which were made by the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) before he left for the Imperial Conference, the Government have apparently done nothing of any moment to bring about economical administration. An examination of the Budget shows that, as compared with' the expenditure last year, it provides for an increase of £1,030,000 on the cost of running the ordinary services. The Country party again raises the issue of economy. It recognises the responsibility of honourable members for making some very determined effort, whether the Government wishes it or not, not only to square the ledger, so far as revenue and expenditure are concerned, but also to. put the public finances in such a position that we can give a lead both to the States and to private enterprise in making some provision to meet the tremendous commitments of the next few years. We desire again to point out the folly of regarding such action as a party matter, and the .absurdity, of making a vote on a matter of reduction of expenditure a question' of want of confidence in the Government. I say that, not because I have any reason to wish that the Government shall continue in office, but because our position is so serious that we must view this matter as we looked at some of the big national issues during the war-w e must deal with it as a united, and not as a divided, nation:",41

130,Dr EARLE PAGE,MELBOURNE LETTER,"The gun that is not loaded is that from which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) has fired his motion. Three-years have elapsed since the close of the war. The days of inflated values and high prices are going out.

We, in Australia, with a bare 5,500,000 people, owe £300,000,000 of war debt for which there is no tangible asset. It is manifest that there is only one sane policy for our Government, as for all Governments, to pursue; and that is one of national economy that will lift the weight off industry and stimulate production. National 'economy means something more than not spending a few pounds here and discharging a man or two there. It means more than just balancing expenditure with income. It means the proper marshalling and mobilization of all the resources, both human and material, of the nation, to secure the greatest production, the maximum efficiency and the elimination of waste.",42
131,Mr MATHEWS,MELBOURNE LETTER,I have heard that before.,42
132,Dr EARLE PAGE,MELBOURNE LETTER,"I have used the argument before, and it is worth repeating. Such economy may mean actual expenditure. It is not economy to- leave your fields untilled; real economy is spending money wisely for the best result. Such ideal economy is impossible without the revision of our system of government, with its duplication and extravagance. I shall not deal with that aspect today, except to point out that the Government is avoiding attempting; it by its evasion of the calling of the .Federal Convention. The Government, even without that Convention, can deal with the question of reorganizing its own Departments and eliminating waste. The great war through which we havejust passed was not the first big war to devastate the world. There have been others - All have left behind them legacies-of debt and financial disturbance. History shows, however, that the nations that rehabilitate themselves most rapidly . after war are those that pay as much as possible of their war costs out of revenue, and then dispose of their dead weight of our debt in the shortest possible time.

Sir JOSEPH COOK. - That is not enough.",43
136,Dr EARLE PAGE,MELBOURNE LETTER,"The only way to meet the present position, and to restore and improve our national credit to such an extent as to justify a conversion scheme, is to confine all borrowing to developmental purposes. To save the additional impost that borrowing in a bad market would impose, it is imperative that we should improve our credit. Mr ""WEST - I said all that twenty years ago.",44
137,Dr EARLE PAGE,MELBOURNE LETTER,"Havin g assets is not of .any avail when times are bad. The possession of railways, ships, land, oir soldiers' homes, especially when most are showing huge losses, will not help, although the Treasurer seems to think that it will, if one may judge from his statement on page 11 of his Budget speech, because he makes no differentiation between war debts, against which we have no assets, and the £60,000,000 which he says are represented by tangible assets. Therefore, when it is asserted that the public debt is not a burden because'it is represented by tangible assets, it becomes, a misunderstanding of the nature of credit. Even granting that the States have carried out public works with the £16,750,000 loaned by the Commonwealth, there is no means of testing their saleable value, because there is no market in which they could be sold. The real 1914. 1919. 1921. security for the public-creditor is not the* assets in which his money is invested, but the character of the people to whom he. lends, and their reputation in money dealings. We have seen this demonstrated in the wool market. Banking; puthorities lend money, not against the wool, but against the man's reputation, which, after all, is the prime factor in financial transactions. . Mr HUGHES - Then if a farmer goes to a bank and asks for an advance against his produce, the banker will inquire about his character, and not about the quantity of wheat he holds?",44
138,Dr EARLE PAGE,MELBOURNE LETTER,"A banker will 1 estimate the character of a customer by the condition of his account over a stated period. On various occasions I have had dealings with respect to mortgages. It is well known that if a man makes no effort to increase his margin of security, peoplewho are accustomed to lending money against securities' will not touch him at all. And this is rapidly becoming the. position of the Government. The best method is to live within one's income, seas to reduce indebtedness, and at the same time to have the reputation of being anxious to continue to do so. The worse way is for all the Australian Governments to join in a Rake's Progress of-budgeting for a deficit - Western Australia, Queen&land, New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania, and now the Com. mouwealth. Government, have all done this. W it h all these huge commitments falling due before 1927, and the prospect, as I shall show presently, of a reduction in our national income, the actual position, in the eyes of our creditors today, surely must be that we are spending a great deal more than we are justified in spending in the circumstances. Recklessness is not displayed in calling attention to it and trying to stop it , as the Treasurer suggested recently, but in the course the Treasurer is adopting of disregarding the beacons of warning. To an individual confronted with a parallel situation as Australia, there aire only two alternative courses, namely, (1) increase his income,- or (2) diminish his expenditure. A State cannot in crease - its income unduly because its revenue comes out of taxation which, - as 'we see in certain cases-the Post Office and New South Wales Railways may be quoted as instances-ha s already reached its limit. Further increases in rates and charges will only lessen returns. Therefore, the only course open is to reduce expenditure. This is what every other country in , the world except Australia seems to be doing. In Australia there is a carnival of financial folly, to quote the Treasurer's own words '-- Mr HUGHES - Why do you .not practice this economy, and confine yourself to your own vocabulary? . Dr EARLE PAGE- - Because I . think that to live outside one's vocabulary is not so dangerous as to live outside one's income.",44
139,Mr HUGHES,MELBOURNE LETTER,"But you know "" h e w h o steals my purse steals trash."" ' Dr EARLE PAGE - That may be true, but, to complete the quotation, I "" am afraid it appears that the Treasurer may be destroying not merely the purse but the good name of the Commonwealth. In this carnival of financial folly the Treasurer proposes coolly to use - half of the surplus gradually acquired over fourteen years by past Administrations to wipe out the deficit. - Sir JOSEPH COOK - Acquire d in fourteen years? Rubbish!",45
140,Dr EARLE PAGE,MELBOURNE LETTER,"Well , these are from the Treasurer's own figures for 1907-8 (see page 12, Budget). This proposal, too, is made at a time when the incidence of Tarif f rates is higher than ever before, and the Government expect to receive more from land tax than ever in the past, and a greater revenue from income tax than the whole, cost of governmental services ten years ago.",45

143,Dr EARLE PAGE,MELBOURNE LETTER,"When asked for an explanation, the Treasurer weakly says he is spending £20,000 less from revenue than last year-£20,00 0 saved out of £64,000,000! But if we investigate the position we shall find that ordinary services are actually going to cost £1,030,000 more than last year; and on the other hand, the Treasurer has been enabled to effect certain reductions, due entirely to the cessation of the war conditions and not to any attempt on his part to effect economy, totalling the huge sum of £3,545,647, made up as follows:Savings on war pensions, £739,739; on vocational training, & c , £1,417,215; on. war services, £536,761; temporary loan repaid to Notes Fund account, £857,932. Included in one of these items there is a saving of £216,325 on war gratuities alone, and yet the Treasurer can show a reduction in expenditure from revenue ctf only £20,000 as compared with last year. As an offset against these amounts, he has only an extra £1,500,000 for unavoidable charges, such as interest and sinking funds, &c.",45
144,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,Not true in any way.,45
145,Dr EARLE PAGE,MELBOURNE LETTER,"There is, therefore, really not a reduction of £20,000, but an increase of £2,000,000, on last year's expenditure, of which, as I have shown, £1,030,000 is attributed to expenditure on ordinary, services. In addition, we find that in his f r a n t i c search for this marvellous reduction of £20,000 upon last year's expenditure from revenue, the Treasurer has resorted to taking out of loan funds £923,794 for Post Office works, notwithstanding that that Department is estimated to niake a profit of £1,800,000, a difference between £9,300,000 of revenue and £7,500,000, the cost of ordinary s'ervices, which he .swoops into general revenue, and he proposes' to spend fro m Loan Funds instead of Revenue £162,000 on passage money for assisted immigrants, which under no circumstances can be considered a charge against loans.",45
146,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,"That is an absurd statement. Dr EAR LE PAGE - When he finds himself - in ; a corner on this point, the Treasurer says, in-the House, that he is spending' £ l l ; 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 altogether than last year. Outside the House, because, I suppose, there was no Hansard reporter present, lie stated that the figure was £17,000,000. It is true the Treasurer is budgeting to spend £17,000,000 less than he budgeted to spend last, year, and £11,000,000 less than the actual expenditure; but a glance at his Budget shows that the whole reduction of £11,000,000 is out of loans. He will have £12,500,000 less to spend on Repatriation, & c , out of war loans than last year, so that the reduction of £11,000,000 cannot be placed to his credit. He has not saved any money, but has simply taken the difference, viz., £1,500,000, of loan money which he has saved from Repatriation, and provided for its expenditure on other matters. This seems to be a deliberate attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the public.",46
147,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,"The honourable member, by omitting the facts, is deliberately throwing dust in the eyes of the people now.",46
148,Dr EARLE PAGE,MELBOURNE LETTER,"What is the explanation of these continual deficits in Australia? Surely, it is that the problem has been approached from the wrong end. The Treasurer estimates the Government expenditure, and then makes its income stretch out to cover it . Let us adopt the usual business process of estimating our income, and then insisting upon expenditure coming within it . This policy has been adopted in England. In a circular sent to all the Government Departments, by the authority of the British Cabinet, the Under Secretary to the Treasurer stated that in order to enable revenue ancl expenditure to balance in 1922-1923, there must be a ; drastic reduction '- of expenditure. He said there was' no hope of solving the financial problem that confronted the nation by additional borrowings or additional taxation. He directed the attention of the Government Departments to the fact that i u 1922-1923, the total amount available for the Supply services-, which now cost £602,751,000, will be £490,000,000, a reduction of approximately 20 per cent. The circular insists that each Department shall at once take steps to bring about a reduction of 20 per cent, in its expenditure by the beginning of 1922-1923, or earlier. What have we available to spend on less the conduct of our government 1 A glance at the sources of our national income will show us that prices for our principal products are approximating to those before the war. Wool is about at the pre-war level, butter is falling rapidly, hides are down, meat is almost unsaleable, sugar has dropped, jam is a drug on the market, timber mills have ceased working in many parts of the Commonwealth, mining operations generally are suspended, and wheat is falling. All primary products are in a slump which may last for years. Indeed, the index figures' previously quoted suggest that it will last for years. Even manufactures have decreased in total quantity, though soaring prices have deluded us into the idea that they are rapidly expanding. New South Wales, for example, produced, in 1920, £16,607,000 only, based' on the value of her products in 1911, as against a production in 1911 of £19,143,000- a reduction of nearly 20 per cent, in quantity. Last year we had a trade balance against us of £32,000,000, our imports exceeding our exports by that amount. This year our exports, which pay practically the whole of our external interest, and a good proportion of our income tax, are less in quantity, and our imports, which must pay the whole of our Customs duties; have slumped to the extent of nearly 40 per cent. . Despite this, the Treasurer has budgeted for this revenue from the optimistic side. It is true he allowed for a decrease of £5,750,000 from Customs and Excise, or 16 per cent, of last year's total, or 25 per cent, of the Customs total alone, but this does not cover the f all .",46

The exports have fallen from £19,000,000 in the first two months of last year to £16,000,000 in the first two months of this financial year, and every one knows that scores of taxpayers have not the wherewithal to pay wages, let alone taxes.

162,Dr EARLE PAGE,MELBOURNE LETTER,"The net profit estimated from the Australian Note Issue, shown at £1,400,000, seems excessive in the light of the fact that a profit of only £304,000 was shown for the seven months' period from December, 1920, to June, 1921. To my mind, with the very stagnant condition of trade generally and the very serious outlook with regard to markets, it would be a very simple matter for the revenue of the Commonwealth now under review to fal l short of what has been anticipated by . from £3,000,000 to £5,000,000, the lower figure alone making a total deficit of £5,800,000, which would practically. obliterate the so-called surplus and necessitate the discovery of sources of taxation hitherto untapped. The. English Chancellor of the Exchequer . anticipated a £200,000,000 in his annual ' in come, and in six months the ac-' tual drop has been £163,000,000. The Treasurer has left out of his calculations any such possible drop, and proudly.says in a-Sydney interview that he is not very, much concerned with what' England is doing, and that we are in a very much better' position. Y e t the day before' he had-'put' a Bill through, this House authorizing' - him to borrow fSjOOOjOOO from ' a!country that is, in his opinion, in a desperate position. That, the Estimates of the Treasurer are not very carefully. drawn .is indicated by the slipshod manner in which the departmental revenue is prepared, as. can be_ seen by comparing the estimated and actual revenue of 1920-21. The item of . nearly £3,000,000 excess from Customs and.. Excise, a shortage of nearly £1,000,000 in estimated Post Office revenue, an excess of £750,000 in income tax, a shortage, of just ou £2,000,000 in war-time profits, tax, and a.shortage of nearly £500,000 from the detained enemy vessels, all point a very serious lesson as to the unwisdom of this Committee in relying on the Treasurer's Estimates too implicitly. To sum up, at the best our position is that the total national income, from honourable which ultimately all taxation must come,will be little more than during the pre-war period, but the revenue to be raised out of that income is about three times the pre-war revenue.",48
163,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,A monstrous statement for a responsible man to make.,48
164,Dr EARLE PAGE,MELBOURNE LETTER,"The Commonwealth taxation to produce the revenue expected has risen from £2 9s. in 1913 to £9 12s. per head in 1921. This taxation, it. must not be forgotten, must in the future be derived from a gross national income approximating pre-warvolume and values, out of which our hugely increased State taxation must also come. This tax on industry, which even at the present inflated prices seems so excessive, and which has been so extremely embarrassing to industry that many have had to pay. their taxes by borrowing, must be increasingly oppressive under the certain conditions of lower prices, because the tax must continue, seeing that national drop _ of liabilities have accrued which did not previously exist, and will be a, permanent charge on revenue, and against which .we have no reproductive or, tangible assets. Of such are the interest and sinking fund on the war debt of £300,000,000 and the £6,000,000 to £7,000,000.per year for war pensions, while .our promises to our ; returned soldiers are, in a large measure, still unredeemed. The total annual charges, from these sources alone exceed the total Commonwealth expenditure of all kinds of eight years ago, and, as Ihe State tax-gatherer comes along also with hi.* hugely increased impost, dustry ou every hand shows signs of being strangled and lacks capital for natural expansion. Under these circumand stances, one would expect in a Budget eviThis dence of the most careful estimate of governmental income, the most prudent handling of public funds, the most econofound mical administration of public Depart1920-21, ments, the most skilful planning and cretion in the programme of public works, and the utmost caution in any new appointment of public servants. What do partment. we see? A most alarming increase comquently pared with pre-war days in the army of public servants, the most wanton waste of public money in such scandals as the War Service Homes administration and activities, where I hope to show on other occasion millions have been wasted, the most careless planning of public money, as evidenced in the Cockatoo Dock fiasco, where the total money voted for the year had been utilized at figures. the end of the seventh mouth, and an actual increase in administration charges and services, apart from war services, £1,030,000. All these are disclosed in the Budget. Having examined the prospects of the national income and the amount available for the purposes of government and the inescapable annual charges, let me analyze the Budget in the light of this information. The Budget, which opens with, an admitted deficiency of £2,800,000, proves worse the more one examines The first striking feature is the general slovenliness with which it has been piled. This is typical of the whole the Government's method of handling finances which the apparent ignorance the Ministers of their own Estimates the introduction of the Budget illustrated pointedly. Take, for example, the tainments tax, which produces nearly £.700,000. This is quite an important item, but there is nothing to show where one can find out anything about it. It is necessary to search right through the papers in order to achieve one's object in ascertaining information on this or almost any other There , is a difference of - £1,000 in one place, and perhaps £4,000 in another. the Prime Minister's Department, for r>r. Fnrlc Par/r. stance, the 1920-21 figures are shown as in- £461,330 on page 48 of the Budget papers, £462,391 on page 38 of the Estimates, £412,164 on page 48 of the Budget, £416,708 at page 38 of the Estimates. is characteristic of almost every Deour partment. In addition, all through the Estimates, one finds such examples as are under division 23, in which, in the vote of £100,000 last year disappears under the Department of Home and Territories, and the expenditure as £12,830 under the Prime Minister's DeAs similar differences freappear, doubt begins to assail one's mind, and one asks if it is mere slovenliness, or if it is deliberate art. Has the Budget been deliberately faked? an Sir JOSEPH COOK - It is neither. The honourable mefhber's ignorance of the the use of figures is responsible.",48
165,Dr EARLE PAGE,MELBOURNE LETTER,I have obtained my information from the Treasurer's own,49
166,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,The honourable member is accusing others when he is of ignorant of the true position.,49
167,Dr EARLE PAGE,MELBOURNE LETTER,"One' s suspicion is deepened by finding that the alleged surplus is obtained by the failure to build permanent works out of revenue which the House last year was assured were indispensable, and not by any saving in administrative 'charges. The' Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) and other honourable members have said that they do it. not wish economy by a curtailment of our public works policy; but the Treacomsurer has failed to spend £980,000 of that was voted in this connection, the and no one appears to be concerned. of One finds that the works provided on for out of revenue last yearhelped to reduce the deficit this year by being enterconstructed out of loan money, as shown on pages 380 and 381. There has been a skilful juggling of expenditure from one Department to another in order to defy pursuit of what actually occurred.",49
168,Mr WISE,MELBOURNE LETTER,"The honourable member said just now that we were spending less this year in the Post and Telegraph Desubject. partment than last year. In . Dr EARLE PAGE - I did not;, and inI defy the Postmaster-General to find an error in the figures I have quoted. The sum of £147,000 was willingly voted for certain public works in connection with the Postmaster-General's Department, which have not been undertaken, notwithstanding the urgent necessity which exists. I have previously referred to the post-office at Mildura, which is a disgrace to civilization, and «an only be compared with the Black Hole of Calcutta. The Treasurer said that, notwithstanding that the Government, after the preparation of the Estimates, was faced with a very heavy and Unprovided for expenditure for the basic wage and increased cost of living allowances, amounting to about £750,000, it was found possible to effect savings by the large sum which I have mentioned, namely, £4,250,000. The revenue for 1920-21 was £65,517,608, the expenditure out of revenue £64,632,087, leaving a surplus on the first transaction cf £893,521 . It would be uitsrestiug to note how this surplus was ""manufactured. "" The Treasurer had an unexpected revenue surplus, or, in other words, under-estimated his revenue to the extent of £2,150,000. He cut out new works to the extent of £972,000, and the vote for A i r Services amounting to £242,000. He saved £140,000 on old-age pensions, and failed to spend £150,000 on soldiers' graves. On interest and sinking funds for war loans, he did not spend £1,099,000. That is a peculiar kind of saving.",49

If this expenditure had been made, instead, therefore, of showing a surplus of £893,521, there would have really been a large deficit, despite the surplus in revenue, of £2,150,000. It is not my intention to deal with the Departments in detail, but I have prepared a general table, in which ordinary services and war services are separately shown. I shall deal later with war services, as I consider enormous savings can be effected, especially in the administration of the Repatriation and War Service Homes Departments.

It would be interesting to know why this' has been done,' and what these oflicials do. . ' In regard to .the .Prime Minister's Department, I would like to ask a few questions. It would be interesj^ng to know ,jvhy this Department has taken control of so many new activities that have come Surely the Port Pirie 1 0 Wharf should come under the control of his the Minister for Trade and Customs? One would also think that Cockatoo Dock ordinand the Naval Dockyard would be better the control of the Naval ' Depart. ; I wish - The Public Service Commissioner also the comes under the Prime Minister's Department. Can any satisfactory reason to be' given as to why there has been - an Public Service ""Commissioner for nearly six years? Junior men are sidered periodically lifted up to act in nigher Defence, as these figures show:offices. Parliament especially made this appointment above Ministerial interference, placing it in the same category as that of a Judge of the Defence High Court or the Auditor-General. The Military object of Parliament has been defeated Navy for a period of six years. A CommisAir sioner cannot formulate a policy unless he is free from the hope of favours to come from political parties. heads are loath to do anything because Military Forcesof the .insecurity of the tenure of their positions; and this fact has probably been responsible for much of the disorganization and dissatisfaction existing in the Public Service. In. the High Commissioner's Oflice Administrative there is no justification for the huge increase in salaries and expenses:- 1913-H. 1021-22. Increase. Salaries 8,445 12,338 Number of employees 34 92 Contingencies 16,162 51,250 Travelling expenses have increased by £4,000. The secretary's ,«alary has been increased from £1,000 to £2,000, and he was given £100 for loss on sale of furniture after being annointed to his present offioe at nearly double'his salary in Australia. » As to the. Commonwealth Line of Steamers, the expenditure in the Sydney office has been increased from £4,750 to £S,200, or nearly 50 per cent, in one year, while there has been a huga increase in the case of the Adelaide office. Co-operative companies in these centres would be glad to act as agents and find freight; and why should they not have the opportunity, and, perhaps, make the line self-supporting? In the Attorney-General's Department the expenditure of the Investigation Branch was £4,244 in 1920-21, and £8,477 in 1921-22. Was the appointment of this new staff absolutely necessary ?

It is only Ihe saving on ammunition of £250,000 in this year's Estimates as compared with those of 1913-14 that prevents the excess being much greater. A further study of the Defence Estimates shows a decrease in the various factories where work was provided, and an increase in ""General Contingencies"" and fat salaries. There were 290 persons employed in the Central Oflice in 1920-21, and 1,273 employed in 1921-22, an increase of 983 officers.

192,Dr EARLE PAGE,MELBOURNE LETTER,"Comin g to the Department of Trade and Customs, wo find that, although the Treasureris budgeting for a decrease of nearly £6,000,000 in revenue - from this source, we are asked to increase the vote for the administration of the Department by over £30,000. If in a privately controlled business in which members of thia House happened to be shareholders it was found that the management, with receipts going down by practically 25 per cent., had increased the working costs by heavy additions in salaries and contingencies, there would be some trouble and need for an explanation. Why should we apply any different mode of procedure to the working of Commonwealth Departments than we apply to the handling of our own money ? A matter that needs a very definite protest from this House is the increase of seventy persons on the Cent r a l Customs staff and the increase in the salaries of the Central staff by £25,000. If the revenue decreases as forecasted, the very least we might ex pect is that the staff of the previous year would not be increased. In 1920-21 there were 88 officers i i i the Central, London, and New Y o r k staffs of the Customs Department, and this year there are 158, making an increase of 70 persons, with an increased expenditure of 90 per cent. W it h .regard to the Department of Health, this absorbs a large part of the increase in expenditure. I am thoroughly in accord with th? Federal control of health, but Federal and State activities in this direction should be co-ordinated. I cannot understand the Minister for Trade and Customs not pushing on with the calling together of the Federal Convention, which would enable usi to bring about a complete co-ordination of the health services.

It is very evident that the estimated additional profit is being absorbed in other directions, while works that should be carried out and charged to expenditure from revenue are being charged against loan expenditure. A careful survey of the figures of this Department shows that the Treasurer anticipates receiving a total revenue of £9,311,000 for the year in which we are now working. Against this he estimates an expenditure of £7,455,000 for ordinary services. That would leave a surplus of £1,800,000 , which should belong to the Postal Department, and would enable the Department to carry out the large list of works already approved of without making a special charge against loan funds.",54

According to figures given by the Public Service Commissioner, the salaries of monwealth public servants have increased by £1,140,000 , which makes the total salaries £5,700,000 . There is plenty room for economies to be effected in this direction. I would ask honourable memto bers to t u rn to page 31 of the .Estimates down for that purpose. and to look at the items under "" Special Appropriations ""-interes t on Commonand wealth inscribed stock, £11,946,000; direction.

In an expenditure, totalling £25,000,000, the time has come when we should cut our party unanimously. garments according to the cloth at our disposal. If we are going to continue live beyond our means we must come, party than you do? sooner or later, to a sudden and very bad stop. I would like to refer to the additional new works, buildings, & c , referred to page 34. It will be seen that the Defence Department is asking for an increase over £500,000 , which is to be spent f r revenue. W it h the Minister in charge this Department (Senator Pearce) away from Australia attending a Conference, which will deal with the limitation of ments, ought we not to hold our hands for one year at any rate ? If we are to spend any loan money at all it should be spent on reproductive, developmental work, which will bring in a return.

206,Dr EARLE PAGE,MELBOURNE LETTER,I represent my,55
207,Mr GABB,MELBOURNE LETTER,"Does the Treasurer (Sir to Joseph Cook) know more about your Dr. EARLE PAGE - He thinks he does. Australia's financial position and prospects of development are greatly comon plicated by our Federal system, and we will not secure effective economy or effecof tive service except through the re-organo m ization of the whole system of government, of from the top to the bottom, by means of the Federal Convention. What is needed is the revision of our constitutional maarmachinery so as to define more clearly the Federal and State spheres of activity and going of taxation, to simplify the system of government, to abolish all duplication of services, and to consolidate the public debts. I intend to take another opportunity of dealing with the maladministration of the War Service Departments. The response of the Australian public to appeals for money has been most generous and spontaneous. The work done by the soldiers has been generously recognised on all sides, although the Prime Minister lakes all the credit to himself for giving them the rewards to which they are entitled. The Treasurer seeks to make war expenditure a matter that is above criticism. No one objects to the soldiers being treated generously, but a well-considered and well administered scheme is necessary to secure fair treatment for them. Why should the wretched administration of war pensions be allowed to engender definite grievances, not merely against the Government, b n t also against Australia, by a harsh and rigorous system of' administration against incapacitated men, while thousands cf pounds are wasted by physically fit men in official positions? Does the £450,000 spent on sawmills in Queensland, which have never worked, come out of revenue . or loan moneys? What provision is made for the £140,000 which has to be written off soldiers' homes not properly constructed? Will come out of revenue or loan funds ? What provision is made for war gratuity payments? Will this all come out of loan funds? The Treasurer says that the Commonwealth debt has been reduced during the year. Does this take into consideration, the war gratuity liability? Surely, at least, some sinking f u n d should be established for this. We are spending £739,739 less on war pensions this year than we spent last year, and the Treasurer is spending out of revenue £2,000,000 less on war services. expenditure out of revenue on war services last year was £33,286,233, and the estimate this year is £31,203,253. The expenditure from loan funds"" last year was £24,148,501, ahd this year the estimate is £11,196,000. The Treasurer has thus estimated a decrease of £15,000,000 in the expenditure, but of this decrease only £2,000,000 is deducted from revenue, while the remaining £13,000,000 is from loans - The further we get from the war the less war expenditure the Treasurer pays from revenue. It is a moot point whether it is right to regard interest and sinking f u n d on debt as a war service. Such liabilities have come to stay, and the present method of treating them is misleading. [480]- 2 I have not time to go more deeply into the various items of the Budget. I have briefly indicated the prospects of our national income, the influence on production of the present heavy strangling taxation, and the huge commitments f alling due. I have exposed the hollowness of the Treasurer's professions of alleged economy, and pointed out the path whereby financial righteousness can be achieved and national solvency maintained. Though the straight and narrow path is always a difficult one to tread, yet it is absolutely essential that we must tread it , for in a very few years we may have to undertake helavier obligations with regard to naval defence than any yet considered. Before passing on, I would like to ask the Treasurer a few plain questions. Is the slovenliness of the Budget a reflection of the irresponsibility and general methods of the administration of the Leader of the Government ? Are the evidences of dummying I have given mere slips, or are ithey deliberately intended to deceive the public ? - Why is the revenue of the Post Oflice taken from that Departl this ment and allotted to other governmental activities, and in its place loan moneys voted to the Post Office for carrying out its works? Why is the £162,000 for assisted passages to immigrants paid out of loans instead of out of revenue? How can taxation ever be reduced if our in debtedness and interest bill is increased in every Budget ? If the Prime Minister thinks debt is a dead weight, why not start to remove it straight way? It cannot get any deader. Is the method of manufacturing a surplus by underestiThe mating the income £2,000,000, cutting out new works £972,000, savings on old age pensions £140,000, skinning the soldiers for £500,000 war gratuity in terest, and failin g to spend £150,000 on soldiers' graves, the sole property of the Government ? "" I have indicated many places where gross extravagance and unexplained in creases in administration have taken place, and a possibility of large reductions. This has been possible without any knowledge of departmental workings. It is not my duty, but the duty of the exe'cu- » tive Government, to say where the most ready economy can be effected, and which services should bear the brunt of that . economy. That is a matter where inside departmental knowledge would alone 'avail. All I say is that the present Public Service is already too big in proportion to the population and production of this country, that it must not be increased without very cogent reasons, and that i m mediate economy can be effected, should be effected, and, so far as my colleagues and myself are concerned, must be effected. It should be effected, not by the superficial method of stopping well-earned increments ito f a it h f u l servants, but through the re-organization of the whole Service and the securing of general efficiency. That this method is the only way to do it is evidenced by the attitude taken up by the British Treasury, which in a circular places this duty on Departments themselvesIn order to enable revenue and expenditure to balance in 1922-23, there must be a drastic reduction in expenditure. There is no hope of solving the financial problem that confronts the nation by additional borrowings or additional taxation. . . . It is certain that any increase in taxation would seriously hamper the recovery of British industry and commerce, and thus ultimately intensify the difficulty of the position, and would on that account be most vehemently opposed by the House of Commons, and by public opinion in the country; indeed, what is required in order to maintain and stimulate industry and commerce-and secure full and regular employment in the country-is a reduction of taxation and of the burden of the State's indebtedness as rapidly as possible, a process which ean only be achieved by a continuous reduction of expenditure throughout the next few years, . . . It is recognised that it will be impossible to carry out the degree of economy demanded by the financial situation and still preserve all the existing services carried on by the State. Therefore the Treasury circular, with the authority of the Cabinet behind it, instructs each Department to take into consideration the abolition of some of the services under its control, even though these services represent functions imposed by Statute. Wihere it is necessary to obtain parliamentary sanction by means of a Bill to the abolition of any existing services, the Government will do so. With this I agree, both as regards tutory and ordinary appropriations, I will give any Government which faces the position from that aspect. The British Government has done' What has our own Government done in three years to bring down the cost of government? It talks of duplication its tongue in its cheek and appointed new hands in 1919-1920, many of whom are engaged in services that are duplicamen tions of State activities. The war is and has been over for three years, Dr Earle Page. we have not yet started to put our house in order. We will never put our house in order unless we proceed on principles of sound business - and accepted common sense. Every known business firm in Australia of any standing is preparing for trouble, brought about by falling prices, by meeting every possible expense out of revenue and not calling on capital. Micawber's axiom is still true-20s . in come, 20s. 6d. expenditure, and the result is misery; 20s. income, 19s. 6d. expenditure, and the result is happiness. It is not merely Happiness, but safety, that lies in the course of keeping our expenditure with in our means. This year Australia hopes for a good season. Picture Australia's position if we had a bad season, and the present method of finance were continued next year. Is it wise, is it safe, to juggle with the f u t u r e by budgeting for deficiencies with a revenue raised under the highest rates of taxation ever levied in Australia? Our demand to square the ledger, and establish adequate sinking funds, so as to maintain our credit is the only sane and prudent course. An y other than this is utter madness. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) says that English conditions differ from ours. Great Britain's income will be £100,000,000 short of the estimate. I have shown that ours may easily be short of the Treasurer's expectations. Is this country, saved by the valour of EO many of her sons, to be allowed to d r if t into-financial r u in by the cowardice and incompetence of her rulers? New Zealand, South A f r i c a , Canada, and Great B r it a in are all grappling .successfully with the situation. Australia alone goes smugly on, disregarding the ominous writing on the wall. The British Government thinks the position so serious as to have called tostagether a special finance committee of men and of the experience of l o r d Inchcape. assistance Finance will never be properly dealt with in this Chamber u n t i l a proper Committhis. tee of Ways and Means is appointed from all parties, or even a special Committee of Finance, consisting of represenwith tatives of all parties of the House, and 1,500 of financial and banking interests, and of business knowledge and experiencewhose personal interests would not over, be in any way affected by any curtailbut ment or otherwise of expenditure. . I urge the Government to withdraw - the Budget. I urge them to give up bluffing and deceiving the public with such statements as were published by the Argus this morning as having been supplied by the Treasurer.

From first to last it was a tissue of misrepresentation and abuse, and, tomorrow, after I have had time to look at the figures quoted by the honourable member, I shall deal with some of them, to show how little he knows of the public finances of the Commonwealth.

It has been very curious to hear the two party leaders express themselves concernthe ing the Budget. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) began his speech with compliments. He said the Budget was a very clear one, and its features were so arranged as - to be readily understandable. The Leader ' of the Country party (Dr Earle Page), in turn,Stated that it was - a clumsily-constructed ' Budget, and that there was nothing Tight about it. There are the two opinions; and, if I am to take my choice, I naturally incline to the view expressed by the Deputy Leader of the 'Opposition. The latter honourable member may the said to have heard more Budgets delivered than this gentleman from the north, who has descended upon us with all his financial - ability and glory, to lecture us on what we ought to do. Strange to say, the Leader of the Country party finished up, after a two-hours' 'speech, without offering a single concrete suggestion for reform. , There is nothing right in the Budget, he tells us; everything is wrong. Nc-t a single favourable expression has fallen from his lips during his two hours' oration, and not one constructive proposal has emanated from those same lips during the whole of that period.

The Commonwealth Line of steamers has not been, and is not today. losing money. It is not now earning a large amount, nor should it'; but it is untrue to say that the Line is a losing concern. It is not a question as to whether it is a right policy to carry on the Line. It is a question of stating a simple fact as to whether the Line is losing or making money; and the correct answer is that, by every commercial test, it is.making money on its transactions.",59
222,Dr EARLE PAGE,MELBOURNE LETTER,"Where are going to get that £300,000?",59

225,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,"I hope I am going to get it . If the same deduction had been made last year in connection with that Line as in connection with any ordinary shipping line, there would have ibeen over £300,000 profit this year. Last year the Line took 10 per cent, for depreciation, whereas the rate for an ordinary shipping line is never more than 6 per cent. It is the same with the Commonwealth Bank"" as with the Shipping Line. They take care that the Treasurer does not handle much can of their profits. They try to cover up the profits in every possible way; but the profits are made. In the Commonwealth Bank the profits go to reserves, and in the Shipping Line they go to depreciation. My complaint is that I do not get hold of those profits; but, nevertheless, they are made. Last year the Commonwealth Line made nearly £500,000 profit gross. It was nearly all taken up by the 10 per cent, depreciation, in addition to special boiler reserves and other like devices for keeping the profitsaway from the Treasury. How can the Leader of the Country party suggest that the Commonwealth Line is a losing < concern ? It does no good to misrepresent the facts in that way.

I may say that the honourable member is now blocking the* matter and stopping the Government from proceeding with its clearly expressed intention to call a Convention together. When the Leader of the Country party was speaking of this blocking of the Convention, I ventured the remark that there were many followers in his party who were not as keen as he on holding that Convention. He immediately told me that his party was with him. Is the honourable member for Franklin behind his Leader in calling for this Convention ? He is silent.",59
234,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MELBOURNE LETTER,"I shall tell you when I get up to speak. Sir JOSEPH COOK: - There will be a good deal more to say when we get to the actual discussion of the Convention proposal, and nowhere in this House will there be greater divergence of opinion on that matter than in the Country partys",60
235,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MELBOURNE LETTER,"We express our divergence here, which is more than you are prepared to do.",60

237,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MELBOURNE LETTER,"Y o u will ^ hear where we stand. Sir JOSEP H COOK - Honourable members in the Corner had better settle it between them. The Leader of the Country party several times made comparisons between the year 1913-14"" and the present time. What an absolutely idle thing for any man with any sense Of responsibility to do! forget that the world has been in a conflagration during nearly all the intervening years? Does he know that every country has been torn out of its proper setting, and that an Armageddon has been fought?",60
238,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MELBOURNE LETTER,He was in it ; ought to know there has been a war.,60
239,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,"Of course; and, therefore, he should have known better than indulge in such rodomontade. In making such comparisons he should bave made them in regard to every other aspect of public life, as well as in respect to the Budget presented in the Federal _ Parliaiment. him make the comparison in regard to every other State. The Treasurer of Tasmania, according to this morning's newspapers, states that in the last three or four years his expenditure has in creased 63 per cent. I was reading some figures recently relating to all the States, and I hope to present them to the House tomorrow. I have had about enough of this diatribe in the press, and from honourable members, as to the extravagance of the Federal Government, and pointing to the great economy that all the States, more or"" less, are exercising. I shall make a comparison tomorrow and shall show the House, comparing like with like, that during the past three years there has not been a State-eve n including Victoria-whic h has managed its afEairs as economically as has the Commonwealth.",60
240,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MELBOURNE LETTER,May the Lord have mercy on their souls!,60
241,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,"No ; rather, are game to may the Lord have mercy on the figures. I shall let the figures speak for themselves. I want to test the statements of the Leader of the Country party, but I propose at the moment to furnish merely one sample of the way in which he has juggled with his figures. The honourable member has read an elaborate essay upon the finances of the country. I hope he will do me the honour of furnishing me with a copy of his statement. The honourable member had a copy of my Budget speech when I was delivering it in this Chamber. If he will return the compliment I shall be glad to give him a reply tomorrow in respect of his own figures, when I shall have had an opportunity, I hope, of checking them. Meantime, I repeat that I .shall give the Does he Committee one simple example of the way in which the honourable member can juggle figures. He stated that I saved £1,500,000 out of war expenditure last year. This is the way in which ho said that I had manufactured surpluses: I had saved this £1,500,000 out he of war expenditure and had increased the expenditure this year by £1,500,000. Now that sounds very bad. But why did the honourable member not tell the Committee of all the new expenditure which I have in the Budget for this year? Why did he not tell of the £1,500,000 of new interest - and sinking fund for which I have had to budget? Why did he not* tell honourable members of the £3,750,000 Let of war expenditure which I still have to find this year? If he - wanted to be fair and non-partisan in his criticisms, why did not the honourable member tell the. Committee of the £200,000 which I am called upon to pay in respect of mails carried during the war? Why did not the honourable member inform the Committee of the £200,000 more required fox. old-age pensions, and of the half-a-dozen other obligations of a somewhat similar kind ? Among these latter there is a total of practically £200,000 in connection with the per capita payments to the ""States. With these various sums alone there is furnished in this year's Budget a total of £2,500,000, which no one can escape unless he is prepared to go in for a policy of repudiation. There is a sum of nearly £3,000,000, consisting of new expenditure which is inescapable. There is no question of whether that money is being spent prudently or otherwise, but it is a simple matter of whether we are going to pay our debts or repudiate them. When considering problems of retrenchment and readjustment one must pay one's debts, whatever else one does. It would have been fairer for the Leader of theCountry party, therefore, while accusing me of extravagance, in that I have £1,000,000 more upon my revenue side of the ledger this year, if he had told the Committee of this sum of from: £3,000,000 to £4,000,000, comprising obligations which neither he nor I nor any one else dare attempt to shirk. There I .leave the honourable member, with his non-party speech, his bitter diatribe.",60
242,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MELBOURNE LETTER,"- I think we have had two of them today. Sir. JOSEPH COOK - Then his Leader's speech was a bitter one after all ! The honourable member for Franklin (Mr. MCWilliams) should know. He is and has been a good judge. He himself has, been a party leader. Indeed, I fancy that he has had something to do with the framing of the speech delivered by his present Leader. I take his word for it that the speech of the honourable member for Cowper was a bitter one, and, if mine also was a little bitter, I am sure it will be admitted, that there was some justification. I desire to make just one more reference this evening, and that, is to the constant way in which the lead given by the Imperial Government is being, pointed out to me. I am being told that the Commonwealth should finance: as do. the - British authorities. I rather hope that we shall not. do so. As I see things in Great Britain, we are doing very much, better here. We have fewer obligations burdening our shoulders;, we are in am altogether better and more privileged position. There,, they are proposing! - to borrow £100,000,0.00. to square the revenue accounts. Here, we have a large surplus. While honourable members opposite want to destroy our defence estimates-at any r>ate, to cut them down to-the extent of three-fifths of their totalI would remind them that our modest little amount is £7,000>000, but that the sum set aside for defence - by the British Treasurer is £201,000,000. They say £.7,000,000 is too much for Australia by two-fifths of its total.",61
243,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,Germa n workers today are better off because' there are no armaments in Germany ,61
244,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,"Every one knows that the German workers did not disarm themselves, and that they would arm again tomorrow if they were permitted to do so. The German workers did not disarm themselves; the Allies did it for them. I would remind honourable members opposite once more that, in addition to the enormous total of £201,000,000 set aside solely for defence in Great Britain this year, that great democratic country of France, whose Government, I suppose, consists one-half of Socialists and Syndicalists, as a normal running concern Mr CoNsmnm-Socialist s of the same type as the Treasurer. 1",61
245,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,"I remind honourable members opposite that in France,, today, the Budget for defence alonetotals £204,000,000. In the United Statesof America the defence vote amounts to £300,000,000, while Japan is getting well, on towards £150,000,000, in respect of the defence estimates, of that country. These are the defence budgets all about us. Here are the guns pointing all round us. Honourable members opposite say,. "" Scrap ours."" Very well! I am hound to ask whether this is the time, after all, for cutting down our defence estimates. The Disarmament Conference will shortly be held. Disarmament has been talked of for a. couple of years, but no nation, other than Australia, is laying* its hands, as yet, upon its defence votes. Bather, all are awaiting the outcome of the Disarmament Conference.",61
246,Mr GABB,MELBOURNE LETTER,"A test of their sincerity. ' Sir JOSEPH COOK - A test of their wisdom and sanity, a test of their outlook on life. Here is a disturbed world, armed to the teeth, with sporadic fires still breaking out after the recent volcanic conflagration. And the statesmen of the world say, as prudent men, "" Let us be careful, ere we begin disarming, until we have tested the sense of the world upon the subject."" But honourable members opposite have no such qualms. They do not fear anything.. They have the most of all to lose, however; the most cherished ideals of all, the greatest liberty, the greatest privileges of all; the greatest country to develop and defend. But they say, "" No matter what other people may do-let them arm, or disarm, as they like-w e will not arm. Bather, we will reduce our armaments, and so place ourselves more and more at the tender mercies of people with whom we have no sympathy, whose outlook on life is altogether different from ours, whose destiny is as far removed from that of the inhabitants of this country as is the east from the west.""",62

250,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,"The inferenoei 19 that I am also. At any rate, I hope that the debate will develop in a less bitter spirit than it has opened. I sincerely trust that we shall hear no more non-party speeches of the kind delivered today. If the speech of the Leader of the Country party, the honourable member for Cowper, was non-party in character, then, for Heaven's sake, let the party fires burn! None could burn more fiercely than the blaze which has been characterized as a mild, non-party essay. I hope the honourable member will review his speech.  look over it .",62

255,Mr WIENHOLT,MELBOURNE LETTER,"Moreton) [8.88] Those among the general public occupying the galleries to-night will probably have noted with some bitterness th© hard and ironical laughter of older and more experienced politicians present in the chamber when the suggestion was made that the discussion on Australia's finances should proceed without recourse to heated partisan feeling. My view is that no motion should be .debated, or vote taken, in this Parliament-excep t in respect of a direct motion of censure, or want of confidence-upo n strict party - lines. I have listened to the reply of the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) to the speech of 'the Leader of the Country party, the honourable member for Cowper! .(Dr Earle Page). I know that the Treasurer does not feel the same anxiety with respect to the finances of the Commonwealth as do the honourable member for Cowper and myself; but there is one big difference between the Treasurer and honourable members who may wish to continue in publio life. ",62
256,Mr WIENHOLT,MELBOURNE LETTER,"I believe it is a perfectly just statement to make. Every honourable member' who desires to con. tinue in active politics will be called upon to bear the responsibility, or blame, when next he goes before his constituents. But the Treasurer, we are given to understand, is shortly to retire from the inferno of political life. While giving the Treasurer Credit for the speech which he has just made in defence of the Government, I cannot forget that parliamentary responsibility will shortly slip from his shoulders, while for the rest of us it remains. On every question except a direct vote of censure or want of confidence I shall vote as my conscience and individual judgment prompt me, and I appeal to the supporters of the Government tp consider carefully the questions that have been raised. The main question is-Shall . the Commonwealth set an example to the States by living within its means? Both Commonwealth and State Governments are today heavily in debt, and they are going still further into debt. The other afternoon reference was made to the action of the Government of the State one of whose constituencies I represent in borrowing America. To me, it is of small importance where money is borrowed; what is serious is the increasing of our public debt, and the manner in which the money that we have borrowed is being expended.  serious importance is that we shall pay our way.",62
257,Mr WIENHOLT,MELBOURNE LETTER,"I am pleased that we have already made a convert. rae direct the attention of honourable members to the following table, which shows the way in which the indebtedness of the Commonwealth and of the States hag increased since 1914.  the war?",63
258,Mr WIENHOLT,MELBOURNE LETTER,"I am not likely to forget the war. The figures which I wish honourable members to consider-the y are the latest available as to our publio debts - are these: - 1914. Commonwealth 19,182,333 New South Wales . . 116,695,031 Victoria 66,130,726 Queensland 54,523,506 South Australia 33,564,332 Western Australia . . 34,420,181 Tasmania . . ... 12,265,012 Total 336,7S1,121",63
259,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNE LETTER,"That total is quite correct, because there are amounts which are debited twice-onc e against the Commonwealth and once , against a State.",63
260,Mr WIENHOLT,MELBOURNE LETTER,"I am less concerned even with the amount of our public indebtedness than with the necessity for renewing our loans in the future, which is the outstanding financial menace for Australia. mind, the system of taxation of the country-Commonwealt h and State - is absolutely unsound. The position is much as if two men, not on good speaking terms, were tryine to milk the same cow, each endeavouring to milk her first, and to get more milk than his r i v a l ; or as if two men, not good friends, were drawing - cheques on the same banking account. In some cases we have three taxing authorities. For instance, the land tax is levied on the same taxpayer by 'a local governing authority, the State money in. Government, and the Commonwealth Government. Commonwealth and State finance are inseparable. If the States, through extravagance, and wastefulness, become insolvent, th© Commonwealth must go down, too; if the Commonwealth meets with disaster through the same causes, it must drag th© States with it .",63
261,Mr FENTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,"Hear , hear! We are on© people. Let Mr WIENHOLT - Yes ; one people and one taxpaper, but there are many tax-gatherers. This position must be faced by the Constitution Convention when it meets. The Treasurer has objected that the Leader of the Country forgotten party has not shown where reductions are necessary or savings can be effected; but an answer can be found to that in a little pamphlet published by the righ t honourable gentleman himself, in which he points out that no one who is not a M in i ster, and conversant with the Departments, can deal in detail with their SOth June, finances. I think that there are many 1921. ways in which we could save, and many -£ £ directions in which the Estimates could be 401,720,024 reduced. While not prepared to say, 30th June, 1920. "" Y o u must take so much off this or tha* 159,649,988 proposed vote,"" I feel that a considerable 88,273,123 saving can be made on the Defence Esti70,162,471 48,565,562 mates. A saving could also be made in 46,822,003 the cost of parliamentary government. 16,630,039 There are too many of us politicians in Australia. Then we ar© spending a great 831,813,210 deal of money on the High Commissioner's office in London without getting not much benefit from the expenditure. The Treasurer has told' us that the steamers of the Commonwealth Line are profitable, but he was reported recently as saying that they were earning only 2 or 3 per oent. As-vessels are being bought with borrowed money, for which we pay in 1 terest up to 6 per cent, or more, I cannot see that they can be profitable if To my earning only 2 cr 3 per oent. We of th© Country party have been asked, would w© save on the vote for th© PostmasterGeneraFs Department? No one knows better than I , as a country member, how necessary telephone communication is in the country districts. I wish this to be extended rather than reduced. But in a remarkable document which has been sent to me there is a diagram^ not unappropriately shaped like a bi$ leaden weight, indicating that no less than £156,000 is to be spent at Canberra for telephones and telephone lines. Personally, I am against this tomfoolery of moving to Canberra. There are men who dream that they dwell in marble halls, but I am not one of them. If we are to pour money into Canberra in the way proposed, I believe that it will prove to be such a sink for expenditure that once undertakings get fairly going at Canberra no taxpayer of Australia of the present generation can hope for any possible relief. If it costs £500 to cut down two bottle trees in the Northern Territory, what will it cost to build a Federal capital? The Treasurer objected to the comparison which the Leader of the Country party made between the management of the finances here and in Great Britain. He said .that we are in an infinitely better position here. If that be so, why was it necessary for us to go to Great Britain ' and ask the Imperial Government to fund a debt of £90,000,000 for us and extend its repayment over a large number of years ? Let me inform honourable members that last year the Imperial Government paid off no less than £251,000,000 of debt. This year, they budgeted a surplus of £175,000,000, whilst here the Government of the Commonwealth have budgeted a deficit of something like £3,000,000. It may be said, that by economizing and living within our means we shall be increasing unemployment. I say that that is not so. In my view, it is Government waste and extravagance that is the cause of unemployment. The Governments of the States and of the Commonwealth are incurring huge losses in connection with their State - enterprises, and costly failures which have been recorded in connection with them. This causes increased taxation to be imposed upon the people, which, in its turn, must necessarily restrict enterprise 'and the development of fresh industries. The restriction - of enterprise causes unemployment and that, as we know, is responsible for hardship and distress. It would be a poor country of which it could be said that - unless the Government borrowed and spent extravagantly unemployment would result as the resources of the coun. try were not good enough in themselves to keep the people employed. I think that we shall be absolutely mad if we spend a great sum! of money on bringing people out here until we have, solved our local unemployment problem. ' Every one would be glad to see peoplecoming here, especially those with a little capital, who could settle on the land and assist in the development of the country. But to send people to the Old Country with magic lanterns to induce immigrants to come to Australia, whilst there are numbers of men here, including returned soldiers, out of work, seems to me to be very bad business indeed. I wish here to protest against the miserable and cowardly cry which we find repeated in every newspaper in Australia at the present time, that we are not able to defend this country. One would imagine that, Australians were the most miserable and helpless lot of cowards in the world. I remember reading in a report by a very distinguished general who came out here that if Australia were to have any hope to defend herself against an invading army the Australian troops . would need to be in, at least, the proportion of three toi one against the invaders. I had not the honour to be one of the ^ . I . F . troops myself, and, therefore, I may be allowed to say without boasting that in the great war the Australian troops were at least as good as any others that took part in it. So far from men defending their own country requiring to be of a strength of three to one against the,. invader, judging from my experience of warfare, men defending their own country have themselves. at least a three to one advantage. I do not say these things in any spirit of boastfulness, but rather as a protest against the miserable cry to which I have referred. I am satisfied that if Australia were invaded tomorrow her people would put up a most tremendous fight and desperate struggle. I saw 70,000 Boers keep the whole of the British Empire, with sea communication uninterrupted, at bay for three years. In the last war we found that Russia, the nation possessing the greatest population of any engaged in the war, collapsed in ruin half way through the struggle; yet .the German troops in East Africa, though comparatively few in number, held out in their own country throughout the campaign. Belgium, the most densely populated country in the world, was overrun in a few weeks. I do not mean to say that I do not wish to see immigrants come to Australia. By all means let those come who can. But ' I am in this matter in accord; with the views expressed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) when he said that the true way to secure immigrants is to make our local conditions so good as to naturally attract them to Australia. I said that I did not appraach the consideration of the finances of the country in any party spirit, and I shall never do so. An amendment somewhat similar to that given notice of by the Leader of the Country party was moved shortly after the last general election. I did not support it. On that occasion I voted with the Government.",63
262,Mr GABB,MELBOURNE LETTER,"The honourable member saved the Government that time. Mr WIEimOLT - Ver y well, I saved them. I voted with them because they represented a party that had been returned to power with the support of fully half the members of the House of Representatives and practically the whole ' of the members of another place. In my view, the people wished them to be responsible for the government of the country, and they were entitled to a fair show. I still think that a party having the support of half the members of the House of Representatives and practically the whole of the members of another place is obviously the party that ought to conduct the government of the country. But I have not been satisfied of late that the Government have been as careful of the public finances as they ought to be. I can mention a case iii point, which I brought under the notice of the Assistant Minister for Repatriation (Mr Rodgers). It was in connection with Government expenditure in the purchase of the Canungra saw-mills, which are in my own electorate. One, perhaps, looks more closely into a matter affecting his own constituency, and may be disposed to attach to it more importance than others might think it deserves. On the other hand, there is a saying that what the eye does not see the heart does not grieve over; and when I see extravagance and waste by one Department L lose confidence also in the management of all the other Department®. I do not wish to enter into all the details of the matter, but I know that the Government bought the Canungra saw-mills for about £250,000. They bought it from people who knew the business from A td Z- - 7 shrewd, careful, enterprising business men, brought up in the timber trade, and as the result of whose business acumen a thriving and splendid little community had been brought together - I think it only fair to say that this purchase was carried out by the present Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D. Millen), and not while the Assistant Minister (Mr Rodgers) was Acting Minister. I do not think that the Assistant Minister would have been so foolish as to have approved it. He is too keen a business man to have been induced to do so* and I know that he has had a difficult and. irksome task in clearing up what he found there. AfteT working the mill at Canungra for some time, the Department closed it down. I was asked to visit Canungra, as much distress existed there. I went up and received deputations from the men working in the mill, the teamsters, the carriers, the fellers, and the business men of the town. On the following morning I visited the mill before breakfast, and spent the rest of the day travelling on horseback through the timber scrub to the different dumps. I am not a timber man, although I have owned and sold pine, and have had some dealings in timber; but I am going to relate what I actually saw at Canungra. The mill was shut down, and I saw there very large quantities of sawn timber stacked in the open. We have had in Queensland about the wettest winter on record, and I found that great quantities of this timber had deteriorated. The . cutters showed me. stack after stack of timber in respect of which a certain amount would have to be allowed for depreciation. I went into the shed where the dressed timber was stacked, and found that there everything was satisfactory. In the mill yard, however, very large quantities of logs were rotting. I took from them handfuls of what-the men call fungus, and timber men know that when a pine log starts to throw off such things it is deteriorating.",65
263,Mr RODGERS,MELBOURNE LETTER,There is not one unsold log on the Canungra area.,65
264,Mr WIENHOLT,MELBOURNE LETTER,I am pleased to hear that. I know that the Assistant Minister (Mr Rodgers) started to expedite matters after I had seen him in regard to the position.,65
265,Mr RODGERS,MELBOURNE LETTER,"I had previously pointed a broker, and he had sold the bulk of these logs before the honourable member's statement was made.",66
266,Mr WIENHOLT,MELBOURNE LETTER,"Whether they have been sold or not, the fact remains that they had deteriorated, and I am not to be persuaded that those who bought the logs bore the loss caused by that deterioration.",66
267,Mr RODGERS,MELBOURNE LETTER,"But the honourable member will admit that we had an abnormal season up there. There was a rainfall of 60 inches within a short time, and all the mills in Queensland were affected by the exposure of logs and sawn timber.",66
268,Mr WIENHOLT,MELBOURNE LETTER,"I have heard it said that even had this mill remained in the hands of the original owners, it would have had to close down. Does the Assistant Minister maintain that?",66
269,Mr RODGERS,MELBOURNE LETTER,"I am not prepared to say that personally, but many saw-millers in Queensland who had never closed down before had to do so during this abnormal period. We did not close till our stocks and depots were full, and we could not carry on unless we brought the whole of the timber trade on to its knees. We could have done that.",66
270,Mr WIENHOLT,MELBOURNE LETTER,"The honourable gentleman is only proving that his Department got into a very tight corner. I visited various dumps in the scrub. In one place I counted 188 logs; at another I saw ten, and at still another twelve logs. I was unable to reach many of the dumps; but every one who has been in the bush knows that when a pine log is allowed to lie in the open during the winter months, very serious deterioration takes place. I do not wish to go further into the question of the unnecessary, hardships endured at Canungra. I merely quote this as an example of what the people of the Commonwealth are losing as the result of State enterprises.",66
271,Mr CORSER,MELBOURNE LETTER,Does the honourable member know that all these logs were sold at a profit?,66
272,Mr WIENHOLT,MELBOURNE LETTER,"Does the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) wish me to believe that among the timber men of Queensland there is a fool who was prepared to buy the logs lying in the open at Canungra and to bear the whole loss caused by deterioration? The timbermeans? apgetters up there showed me logs which they said were so rotten that the "" dogs "" could not be put into them. Does the honourable member say that some private individual was prepared to buy such logs and to suffer the loss caused by deterioration?",66
273,Mr CORSER,MELBOURNE LETTER,"I was informed before to-night, and have been informed again this evening, that the Department suffered no loss in connection with the logs at Canungra.",66
274,Mr WIENHOLT,MELBOURNE LETTER,"In a deal between a keen private business man and a State enterprise I know who would lose. The worse feature of this purchase is that the land itself was not acquired straight out by the Commonwealth, but is to revert to the original owners after a certain number of years. This must add much to the anxiety of the Minister, because the mill has shut down and there is a time limit within which the timber on the area must be got out. If it is not out out within that time the Government must bear the loss. I could speak for an hour with regard to Canungra.",66
275,Mr RODGERS,MELBOURNE LETTER,"I have been able to make an arrangement with the vendors of Canungra by means of which the Government will not lose a day, so far as concerns the expiration of the time within which the timber on the Canungra area is to be cut out.",66
276,Mr WIENHOLT,MELBOURNE LETTER,"I am aware that the Assistant Minister has sent up some one to report on the whole question, and I hope that the day is not far distant when this most unsatisfactory state of affairs will be ended. I have referred to Canungra only as an example of what we are losing on State enterprises. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr. MCWilliams), who was a member of the Commission appointed to inquire into operatipns at Cockatoo Island, will probably have something to say concerning that State enterprise. These experiences hit the people of Queensland .very hard, because hundreds of thousands of pounds are also being lost on their State enterprises. I am wholly opposed to State enterprises, and the sooner they are wiped out the better. I believe that we should live within our means.",66
277,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,MELBOURNE LETTER,What are our,66
278,Mr WIENHOLT,MELBOURNE LETTER,"O u r means are what we receive. If a man earns £1,000 a year and spends £1,001 per annum, he is not living within his means. There are two ways by which we can live within our means: One way is not to spend so much, and the other is to increase our income. I have already said that, rather than go into debt, I would help the Government, if absolutely necessary, in a proposal for further taxation, provided I had an assurance-whic h I have not at presentthat not one single penny of Government money was going to be wasted. I do not regard this as a party matter, and I shall not vote in a party spirit. I have no particular hostility to the present Government. As a matter of fact, if my sympathies had to be shown for one side or the other, they would be overwhelmingly with the Government. As a Queenslander, and one who has had experience of the ""blessings"" of Labour rule, 1 would not for one minute help honourable members of the Opposition to power in this House; nor would I support any Government that was kept in power by their votes. I want to make this quite clear.  there is going to be a crisis.",67
279,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,Evidentl y there is much fight in honourable members of the Corner party.,67
280,Mr WIENHOLT,MELBOURNE LETTER,"At all events, the idea which I first mentioned, namely, move for a reduction in the expenditure, was adopted by the Opposition.",67
281,Mr CHARLTON,MELBOURNE LETTER,I was the first to move for a reduction in the Defence Estimates. It was my intention all along to do this. I told the.Leader of the Country party last week-end of my purpose.,67
282,Mr WIENHOLT,MELBOURNE LETTER,"But the actual wording of an amendment was, I think, suggested by me in this House. If Government are wise they will accept the amendment moved by the Leader of the Parliament. Country party (Dr Earle Page). understand the honourable the Minister for Tradeand Customs (Mr Greene) going to take over the Treasury. A though we differ on Tariff matters, I mire the Minister' for the manner which he handled the Tariff in this House, and believe that if he could follow his own ideal and had a free hand he would make a successful Treasurer. would also like to see the honourable ber for Wentworth (Mr Marks) the new Minister for the Navy. I think I can say this without making any invidious distinction with respect to the presentoccupant of that office. The honourable 1 member for Wentworth is conversant with naval matters, and I . believe that, with him, administration* in Navy affairs would be a labour of love. I think, also, that the honourable member for Flinders (Mr. Bruce) would make a very good new M in ister for Repatriation in place of the present Minister (Senator E . D . Millen), because I believe that the work of the Department would be all the better for the introduction of new blood. Finally, I would say that I have no hostility personally to the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes). I admire hi m very much for his many fine qualities. I admire him for his courage. I believe that, so far as his heart goes, the Prime Minister is the best friend the returned soldier ever had. But I am honestly and sincerely frightened of the Prime Minister's ideas of finance and business. The other day he came back from the Imperial Conference in London, where, I believe, he did very good work for the Commonwealth, but he did not seem to be the least anxious about our financial position. He talked of airships and wireless telegraphy, and, in fact, he seemed to have his head very not much in the clouds. I am gravely concerned about our own financial position. It seems to me that unless we take a stand and seriously consider the d r if t in finanto cial affairs, both in the Commonwealth and the States, we shall be heading for disaster. I say this, not only in the hope of impressing honourable members, but to clear myself with my own constituents. I believe that, whatever may be the outcome of the amendment as disclosed in the division list, it is an honest attempt on behalf of the Country partyand I hope we shall get credit for this throughout the country-to step in now the and. make the condition of financial matters a definite and clear issue in this I",67

292,Mr SPEAKER,REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTE E ON SENATE,"Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson) [9.59] - Before putting the question, I desire to direct attention to the report presented by a Select Committee of the Senate which contains one or two paragraphs to which I wish to refer. It states in paragraph 17We regret that more returned soldiers have not .been given an opportunity to secure employment in the Parliamentary Service. Apparently the only positions open to them are in the lowest grade of the Service. So far as preference to returned soldiers to enter the Clerical Division is concerned, the policy is a dead letter. Vacancies have occurred and promotions have 'been made, but no returned man AYES. within the Federal Service or outside has got one or the other. The officer in charge of the employment branch of the Repatriation Department gave evidence to the effect that when those appointments were made he had a long list of clerks of all grades awaiting employment, many of whom had exceptionally good clerical qualifications. Paragraph 18 TeadsWe further express our disappointment that in the Parliamentary Service the .policy of preference should have been manipulated in such a way that only the most menial and lowest grade positions are open, to our returned soldiers. It will be observed that this report refers Burchell, R. J. to the ""Parliamentary Service."" This NOES. is a report by a Select Committee of the Senate, and, presumably, it was intended to apply only to officers of the Senate, but it refers, as I have said, to the "" P a r l i a mentary Service,"" and not to any particular branch of it . As a matter of fact, the only new or recent appointments to the House of Representatives Staff have been, with the one exception of a clerical position, three cleaners, and in each case returned soldiers were appointed. To the PAIBS. position of Clerk of Papers and Reading Clerk a returned soldier has also been appointed. As regard's this House, at any rate, that paragraph in the report is. entirely incorrect and misleading. The vacancy for Serjeant-at-Arms was filled by a returned soldier, in the person of Captain MCGregor, promoted from another office. NA",69
293,Dr MALONEY,SERVICE,"Melbourne) [10.2] I desire to point out that an injustice has been done by the dismissal of one employee of this Parliament House. Under pro - present circumstances, there is no justice in Parliament for any one who is not one of the officers. I regret to say that for a man whom I have loved greatly in the past I cannot continue to have the same respect in view of his injustice to an unfortunate young man. The honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) will agree with me that that young man had to be in jected with serum during the influenza epidemic. He took an adverse turn, as sometimes cases of the kind do, and the second injection was not carried out, because Dr Stephens.refused to do it . This young man, to my knowledge and the knowledge of other honourable members, during his employment as lift attendant suffered from his injured. arm for from three to six months; but his services have been dispensed with by the head of another place, whose name I am not permitted to mention. You, Mr Speaker, have done all that a man. and a gentleman in your position could do in regard to the employees of this House, but the other individual has certainly not done so; on the contrary, he has gone so far as to state that the mother of this unfortunate young man wrote him a letter accusing her own son of doing what he should not do. That lady is willing to give evidence on oath that she never wrote a letter to either Senator Givens or any nther member of Parliament. The individual to whom I refer 'has not had the manliness to produce that letter; and I say here, as I have said on the platform, that there iB no justice for the underlings, for the under-paid men, in the Parliamentry Department while Senator Givens holds the sway he does.",69
294,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICE, Order ! The honourable memher must not reflect on the President of the Senate.,70
295,Dr MALONEY,SERVICE,Then I shall describe him as. President of another place.  man in his absence.,70
296,Dr MALONEY,SERVICE,"What I say is absolutely true, and the honourable member knows it !  man who is not here to reply.",70
297,Dr MALONEY,SERVICE,"That is only the old ""gagI"" How can I go to another place and speak about the President? He has heen challenged to produce the letter. Does the honourable member for Grey (Mir. Poynton) believe that such a letter exists?  it.",70
298,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICE,The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) is not in order in his personal references to the President of the Senate.,70
299,Dr MALONEY,SERVICE,I only wish that the precedents sot by former occupants of the Chamber in another place were followed now.  in his ahsence!,70
300,Dr MALONEY,SERVICE,"If ever there fraud in the House, it is the honourable member wljo interjects. SPEAKER^-I ask the Minister  ask the honourable member for Melbourne to withdraw the words he has just uttered.",70
301,Dr MALONEY,SERVICE,"I withdraw the words, which I was compelled to use because of the continual interjections.  orable member should attack a man in his absence.",70
302,Dr MALONEY,SERVICE,"Does the honourable member want any more? He had it once in the Refreshment Boom, and he did not dare open his mouth 1  that that is not true 1 - Dr MALONEY:-There were three witnesses at the table. ",70
303,Dr MALONEY,SERVICE,"There were three witnesses, and the honourable member saw nothing but his plate.  should need a word of only four letters.",70
304,Dr MALONEY,SERVICE,The honourable member may use as many letters as he,70
305,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICE,"Order ! I have already informed the honourable member for Melbourne that he is not in order in referring to the President of the Senate. Up, to a certain point he had not spoken specifically of anybody, but of somebody of whom, officially, I was hot supposed to know anything - As soon as I found the honourable memher referring specifically to the occupant of the Chair in another place, I called him to order. I re have several times called him to order for interjecting. Tha Speaker looks to members of the Government to assist bim in preserving order. If a Minister persistently interjects in defiance of the call of the Chair, it makes the Speaker's position extremely difficult.",70
306,Dr MALONEY,SERVICE,"I hope the House, in its wisdom, will see its way to have a Joint Committee appointed to inquire into such matters as these, with power to compel every officer. of the House to give evidence if necessary. There ought to be a thorough inquiry, and, at all events, justice meted out to the young man to was a whom I have referred. Question resolved in the affirmative. HouBe adjourned at 10.7 p.m.",70
