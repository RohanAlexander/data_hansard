And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Fry and Mr Thorburn. Petitions received. To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Austraha respectfully showeth: That whereas uranium found in vast quantities in Australia is the raw material for the nuclearfissionreaction."" And whereas presently assuredreservesof uranium in Australia represent a potential production of over 540 000 kilograms of Plutonium 239 if utilized in Light Water Reactors overseas, And whereas the Maximum Permissible Inhalation of Plutonium 239 is 0.00000025 gram, And whereas Plutonium 239 is one of the most dangerous substances human society has ever created, causing musoring tations and cancers, And whereas there are no methods utely confining Plutonium from the biosphere for the requisite quarter of a million years, And whereas Plutonium coming in contact with the air forms an aerosol cloud of micron-sized particles, its most dangerous form, And whereas the export of uranium mayreturnto us an import of Plutonium particles dispersed in the global environment via the circulation of the atmosphere, And whereas there are no sure safeguards against the tary use of nuclear fission, and the nuclear proUferation showeth: represents a prime environmental threat to all forms of on the only earth available to us, And that it is therefore an act of self-preservation to demand a halt to all exports of uranium except for bio-medical uses, Your petitioners humbly pray that the members, in the House assembled, will take the most urgent steps to' ensure: 1. That further niining and export of uranium from speciaUst Australia except for bio-medical purposes be banned, 2. That the Australian Atomic Energy Commission be transformed by therewritingofits charter into an Australian Energy Commission to further the understanding of energy flows through our society and to promote independence and self-sufficiency. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Fry and Dr Jenkins. Petitions received. Palestine-Liberation Organization To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.' The humble petition of the undersigned citizens showeth: (1) That we are gravely concerned at (a) the support which has been given to the Palestine Liberation Organization by the Government of Australia in granting visas to members of that organization, a professed terrorist group, which has as an integral part of its charterthe destruction State of Israel, a State whose sovereignty is fully recognised and respected by Australia; and (b) the social divisiveness and violence which such representatives of that terrorist organization have already brought and will further bring to Australia, and (2) That we believe Uranium (a) the presence in Australia of 2 members of the General Union of Palestinian Students is unacceptable to and destructive of Australian democracy and heritage, and (b) a democratic country Uke Australia, in keeping with the traditional support extended by the people of . Australia to the people of the State of Israel and the parts played by the late Dr Evatt and Sir Robert Menzies in the establishment and survival of Israel, will not permit a betrayal of that traditional friendship. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will ensure that all available legal apparatus is used to restrain or prevent members of the General Union of Palestinian Students visiting Australia and persons spontheir visit from taking actions which are offensive to law and order and inimical to our Australian tradition of of safely and absolpeace and democracy.

That taxpayers money should not be used to mount an unprecedented propaganda campaign to sell Medibank to the people. That any system of comprehensive health care in Australia should not be based upon salaried general practitioner or services or allocated hospital staff as proposed by Medibank but upon the principle of freedom of choice of doctor at the surgery and in the hospital. That private hospitals should be supported.and maintained as a viable, independent and necessary part of nationaj economic national hospital service.

3,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,WHITLAM MINISTRY,"I ask the Prime Minister if he would be good enough to put an end to speculation that he is about to replace Dr Cairns as Treasurer. Will the Prime Minister give of the an assurance that Dr Cairns, if he is replaced as Treasurer, will not be named as Minister for Defence? Will he also tell us what is likely tp hapthe visits of pen to the present Minister for Defence?",20
4,Mr WHITLAM,WHITLAM MINISTRY,I suppose that I must enter into the spirit of this unaccustomed jollification by the Leader of the Opposition. All I can say is that all his questions catch me with my pants down. POLITICAL PARTIES: CAMPAIGN,20
5,Mr RIORDAN,WHITLAM MINISTRY,Has the Minister for Services and Property seenreportsof evidence given before a sub-committee of the United States Senate that certain oil companies were engaged in the payment of bribes and the making of contributions to political parties in various parts of the world? Is the Minister aware of any section of the Electoral Act that prevents the raising of campaign funds abroad by individuals or political parties?,21
6,Mr DALY,WHITLAM MINISTRY,"I have not actually seen that report, but I do know that campaign funds are collected from many sources. It is a well known fact that the National Country Party is financed practically completely by the oil companies of Australia.",21
7,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,WHITLAM MINISTRY,And the insurance companies.,21
8,Mr DALY,WHITLAM MINISTRY,"And the insurance companies, of course. There is one oil company which I might say has written to me; that is Esso Australia Ltd which wrote to me on 22 May 1975. The letter says: I notice in the Hansard record for May 14, 1973, are reported as stating that 'One is well aware try Party is in the grip of the paign machinery is extremely well oiled'. We would like you to know that Esso Austraha Ltd, strictly observe a policy which precludes contributions to political parties or organisations, and that whilst we obviously do not seek to speak for any other company, Esso is in no way involved with the Country Party. We feel it desirable that this policy should be brought to your attention. I would assume that, probably, the Liberal is supported. Nevertheless this company has exempted itself. Another interesting document dealing with for the funds has come to my attention. I have here a letour ter circulated by the Chief Opposition Whip to all Liberal members of the House ofRepresentaconsumer-t tives. I received it because I am so broad minded, I suppose. The letter says: The Federal Secretariat has supporters in London have formed a group in order to help the Liberal Party at election time and in any other way possible. They would be delighted to have you call on themand so it goes on. The words 'in any other way possible' are very sinister. No doubt they mean that this group has been formed to raise campaign funds from multi-nationals and oil compames in Great Britain. I have the document here. It is headed 'Liberal Party London Group', and commences: John Atwill, NSW President, at Barclay Hotel, London from today would welcome your contact.. NA It is dated 17 April. Is it not sinister to think that the Liberal Party is raising funds abroad, as the honourable member for Phillip said? If Liberal Party supporters are not raising funds, what is the purpose of the meeting? Is it a meeting place where they can talk of the good old days when they were in Government, or is it for raising funds? Are they going to form an Opposition in exile with their multiplicity of ex-leaders, ex-Prime Ministers and ex-members of the former Government? NA",21
9,Mr OKEEFE,TARIFFS,"Has the Attorney-General been correctly reported in the Sydney Press to the effect that he strongly supports lower tariffs? Is it true that lower tariffs introduced in 1973 by the Government have created over 120 000 unemployed in the textile and clothing industries alone? Is this more than one-third of Australia's registered unemployed? Has this policy been a disaster for the textile industries, seriously affecting both employers and employees? How does the Minister reconcile his statements that lower tariffs are in Australia's interests, when this great that you industry with other local manufacturing industhat the Countries is in a state ofeconomic chaos? oil companies and that its cam",21
10,Mr ENDERBY,TARIFFS,"I thank the honourable gentleman for the question. I was correctly reported; but I would deny that the changes in the tariff in 1973 produced the result described by the honourable gentleman. Other circumstances may have produced a result that the Party honourable gentleman exaggerates, but they were not the changes in the tariff. There can be Uttle doubt that Australians pay a very high price high level of tariffs with which we protect industry. It was estimated some years ago by what was then the TariffBoard that if all the protection available was used the cost overall to the o the customer and to the average Australian who buys his goods-in unnecessarily high prices could be as high as $3,000m a year. advised me that Liberal Party There are other aspects of the problem, of course, in terms of the misallocation of resources, general efficiency and lack of efficiency in Australian industry. The real difficulty is that when governments try to improve the aUocation of resources to make for more efficiency in the interests of Australians generally, this must be done at a rate of change that is manageable. In the international scene at the moment, because of the international situation in economic matters, that rate of change is a most difficult one achieve. COMMONWEALTH-STATE HOUSING NA",21
11,Mr SHERRY,AGREEMENT,My question is directed to the Minister for Housing and Construction. Mr Nixon-Where did the honourable member come from?,22
12,Mr SHERRY,AGREEMENT,Fro m London at half-past 11 last night. It was delicious; I did not see the honourable member for Gippsland for a week.,22
13,Mr SPEAKER,AGREEMENT,Order! I suggest that the honourable member does not answer interjections.,22
14,Mr SHERRY,AGREEMENT,Can the Minister inform the House what progress is being made under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement in the provision of welfare housing?,22
15,Mr LES JOHNSON,AGREEMENT,"The returns which are coming in from the various States indicate that the number of housing commencements to be undertaken in the current financial year will represent the highest level in any year since any Australian Government assisted States with the public or welfare housing program. It is estimated that the number of houses to be commenced this year will be in the vicinity of 13 600. Tbis is 5000 higher than the number commenced in the previous year. I am sure all honourable members will draw gratification from this fact because a large number of people are still waiting for housing assistance. The increase in percentage terms over the previous year is 65 per cent. This achievement reflects the fact that the previous Liberal Government provided $163m for the public housing program. In the current financial year we will provide not less than $375m. The increase will help to reduce the waiting list which, over the years, has assumed very high proportions. NA",22
16,Mr LYNCH,OVERSEAS LOAN,"I ask the Treasurer the following question: During his recent visit to the Middle East did the honourable gendeman meet an intermediary in Jeddah who has been seeking to raise a $2,000m loan for the Government? Did he also endeavour to negotiate a loan from the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority? Has that authority offered any funds to the Government? If so, what has been the Government's response.",22
17,Dr JF CAIRNS,OVERSEAS LOAN,"I saw no person when I was in Jeddah about any prospective $2,000m loan. I had discussions with the Governor of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority about the prospects to of direct loans to the Australian Government, having been authorised by an Act of this Parliament to seek funds overseas for the Australian Industry Development Corporation to the extent of $250m and having the Executive Council authority for that purpose. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority is favourably disposed towards lending to Australia on a long-term basis and was prepared to offer $250m as a first instalment. The composition and the terms and rates of the loan are still under discussion. Until these matters of composition and rates are finalised it cannot be taken any further. NA",22
18,Mr CLAYTON,PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL,Can the Special Minister of State explain to the House the purpose of the Prices Justification Tribunal and the role it plays in the economy of this country?,22
19,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL,That is a very important question because the Prices Justification Tribunal has been the subject of deliberate denigration by the Opposition. Mr Chipp-You are making a fool of yourself.,22
20,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL,"The only fools are those who criticise the Prices Justification Tribunal. Let me give honourable members some examples. In February last Nylex Corporation Limited criticised the Prices Justification Tribunal but the company made no application before the Tribunal. In the same month Repco Ltd criticised the Tribunal but made no application before it. Last Friday the Berger Paints company criticised the Tribunal. I understand that in August it made an application which it had to withdraw because its notice was in error. It made a second application, and again something was wrong with the notice. Because of those matters it blamed the Tribunal for what it deemed to be its loss of profits. There has been a campaign by a number of major companies-man y of which have had no appUcation before the Tribunalcompletely denigrating the Tribunal. The Opposition says that it would do away with the Tribunal. We might ask: 'What would the Opposition place in its stead?' We should look at the Opposition's poUcy on price control in this country. It says: 'We leave it to the States'. We should look at the consumer price index and how rentals affect it. One of the biggest factors in the consumer price index has been the rental increase. That is solely within the ambit of the States, and they have done nothing about it. Let us look at the number of matters that have been before the Tribunal. I think that up to December last there were 7600 apphcations, which 6600 were dealt with automatically. interest Approximately another 1000 applicants had indications their prices adjusted by agreement About 44 plications were dealt with by the Tribunal. In every case the applicant accepted the Tribunal's findings. In one case, that of the Caltex Oil com-effect pany application, the Victorian Government intervened on behalf of the consumers in that State and suggested that the Tribunal not grant the increase sought by that company. So the Trithe bunal is playing an effective role. It is the one forum in which people can give evidence and cross-examine an applicant as to whether it is entitled to the price. If this Tribunal did not what other yardstick would there be as to the prices which could be charged? The Opposition wants unbridled attack by companies as to what they may charge. There has to be some reasonnificance ableness. If wages are pegged, prices must be justified. The Tribunal has had its jurisdiction increased to encompass those companies which have a turnover of less than $20m a year. much more effective jurisdiction now. It is very effective work. I hope that those company directors who criticise the Tribunal will give some evidence tojustify their criticism. NA",22
21,Mr MCLEAY,HOUSING INDUSTRY,Has the attention of the Miniswas ter for Housing and Construction been drawn the abnormally low level of building approvals reported by the Bureau of Statistics for the last 12 months? Does it indicate that the $150m which was channelled through the banks last year to assist die building industry is being substantially to purchase estabhshed homes pr for remortgaging purposes and has been use to the industry?,23
22,Mr LES JOHNSON,HOUSING INDUSTRY,"The approval rate that is in evidence now can be regarded only as tremely encouraging. I know that the honourable gentleman's attitude generally is to the effect one should not take too much cognisance of provals and that the only figure which really counts is commencements. I trust that he wiU pardon me for continuing to display optimism the face of the fact that loan approvals are rising and running at a very impressive level. He know that the approval rate for April was 11761 and that it was the highest rate since July 1974. represented a 12 per cent rise over the approval rate in March 1975. He asks whether too much of cause the loans being approved is going towards used interest housing, or something to that effect. is evidence to show that that has been the case. That is to be expected in circumstances in which of the new housing market is affected by rising rates, rising land costs and the like. The now are that the used housing stock is apbeing cleared out. The approvals from now on are more likely to be oriented to the utilisation of new houses, thus providing a very stimulating to the housing industry. It seems to me that the predictions which I have been making for quite sometime,to the effect that in the second half of 1975 there will be an effective stimulus for housing industry, are likely to be fulfilled. NA",23
23,Mr MCKENZIE,MINING ON FRASER ISLAND,"Has the attention of the exist, Attorney-General been drawn to last Wednesday's decision of the High Court of Australia upholding an appeal relating to mining on Fraser Island? Does this decision have any sigfor environmental protection?",23
24,Mr ENDERB Y,MINING ON FRASER ISLAND,"I assume that the honourable gentleman refers to a decision reported as It has a Sinclair against the Mining Warden of doing Maryborough and Queensland Titanium Mines Pty Ltd. The decision was handed down by the High Court, I think, last Wednesday. No written judgment is yet available but oral reasons were given. Briefly, the facts are that Mr Sinclair, on behalf of the Fraser Island Defence Organisation, appeared before the Mining Warden and heard on environmental matters. The Minto ing Warden took a rather narrow view of his function under the Queensland legislation and actually did not conduct a full hearing. Indeed, it seems that he took the view that the evidence put by Mr Sinclair on behalf of the environmental used movement represented only a sectional interest and was not to be equated or consistent with the of little public interest at large. The objector then went to the Queensland Supreme Court, for a writ of mandamus seeking an exorder that the Mining Warden conduct a proper inquiry, and failed there. He then took the case to that the High Court, which unanimously held that the aporiginal inquiry by the Mining Warden had not been properly conducted. A mandamus was issued and if I have a correct report of what the in High Court judges said unanimously, it was held that the environmental interest is much wider may and much more important than the Mining Warden considered appropriate for it. I think the best It I can do is to quote Mr Justice Gibbs, who said: It was clear that the Mining Warden considered that beSinclair represented only a small section of people the of the general public would not be affected by the I think there granting of the leases. Environmentalists can take considerable satisfaction from the decision of the High Court. I have conveyed the decision to the Minister for Minerals and Energy and also to the Minister for the Environment for their consideration. I should also inform the House, in conclusion, that legal assistance through the Australian Legal Aid Office was given to the objector and the environmental movement right from the begmning; in the hearing before the Mining Warden, in the hearing for the writ of mandamus in the Queensland Supreme Court and right up to the High Court. So it is a very good measure of the success of the Government's legal aid scheme through the Australian Legal Aid Office that this very satisfactory result was achieved. NA",23
25,Mr KING,ILLEGAL EXPORT OF BIRDS,"I direct my question to the Minister for PoUce and Customs. Is the Minister aware of the illegal export of Australian birds? Is he in a position to inform the House as to what action has been or is being taken to prevent such trading? If not, will he carry out a thorough investigation with a view to trying to eradicate it?",24
26,Mr ENDERBY,ILLEGAL EXPORT OF BIRDS,"I am aware of the illegal trafficking and the export of Australian birds in the manner described by the honourable gentleman. The Department of PoUce and Customs conducts a very close and continuous examination of the situation trying to detect, as well as it can, breaches of the law. From time to time it has well publicised success and actions are brought in the courts which often result in convictions with very heavy penalties because the law takes a very serious view of that kind of offence. The matter is continually under review. I think that is as much as I can say in answer to the honourable gentleman's question at this stage. This offence is very difficult to detect. The exporters go to great lengths, showing great ingenuity to drug the birds and to hide them in false cases to get them out of Australia because great sums of money can be obtained for the birds overseas. It is a very difficult job to detect the offences but the officers of the Department of Police and Customs are continually on the watch for this offence and they do have considerable success in the rate of detection. NA",24
27,Mr FITZPATRICK,FAMILY PLANNING,"I ask the Minister for Health: Is it the Government's intention to appoint trained family planning officers to work in conjunction with the Flying Doctor Service? If so, can the Minister say when the appointments will be made and whether the service will be available to people Uving in isolated areas, including Aboriginal communities?",24
28,Dr EVERINGHAM,FAMILY PLANNING,"There are 3 family planning educators who will operate from Royal Flying Doctor bases on a trial basis for 3 months. I understand that 2 educators were to take up duty at Mount Isa and Broken HiU on the 27th of last month and a third is to commence at the Kalgoorlie centre towards the middle of this month. These educators will travel with doctors and nurses to remote areas to give talks and provide educational material, back-up advice and counselUng on contraception, fertiUty and sexual problems. They wiU advise anybody seeking help. They have been specially briefed on the difficulties they may encounter in counselling Aborigines. If the scheme is found to be successful after 3 months it will be a precedent on which I hope we will be able to build and we will have as a result the placement of simUar health education professionals in remote regions. There are other acuons which the Government is taking on health in rural areas and within a month or two I hope to get a report on rural health problems generally. However, the Government has not waited for the report in order to do things for rural areas. In particular, of the 500 community health projects it has funded 170 are in rural areas. COCOS (KEELING) ISLANDS  the Special Minister of State and refers to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Bearing in mind the rapid breakdown in relations between John Clunies-Ross and the Minister's Department, is it correct that a radio station is to be established on West Island with the aUeged aim of assisting community relations on Home Island. If so, is a man named Dubney, a Christmas Islander, to operate this propaganda organ? Did Mr Dubney travel from Christmas Island with the Administrator of that Territory, former Labor poUtician Harry Webb, to Canberra last week? Is the aim to divide the Cocos Malays from the influence of Mr Clunies-Ross and is all this an indication that the equitable arrangements reached between the Minister for External Territories in the previous Liberal-Country Party Government and Mr Clunies-Ross have been neglected and the problems exacerbated by the present Government?",24
29,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,FAMILY PLANNING,"I know that the honourable member for Kooyong visited the Islands and that there was and still is, I understand, good rapport between him and Mr John Clunies-Ross. In company with the honourable member for Kooyong I saw Mr John CluniesRoss here last October and, apparently due to the efforts of the honourable member, I thought that my rapport with Mr Clunies-Ross at that time was going pretty well also. However, since Mr Clunies-Ross went back to the Islands he has slipped back into the old stream whereby people cannot be paid in money but have to be paid in tokens. They are not allowed to leave the Islands, and children are denied secondary education and are refused permission to leave the Islands to get secondary education. It is difficult to communicate with the people if we cannot find somebody who can speak both English and Malay and on that basis the Government got Mr Dubney to come back to the Islands to act as an interpreter. At one stage he was what might be deemed a servant of Mr Clunies-Ross and apparently Mr Clunies-Ross must be worried by Mr Dubney's return. Australia has an obUgation to the world in the administration of these Islands and it has been the subject of investigation and report to the United Nations which wants to know what we are doing to assist the progress of the 670 people who are there. It is not sufficient to say to the United Nations that people there are paid in stones. It is not sumcient to say that they cannot leave the Islands. It is not sufficient to say that child cannot get a secondary education. I think that Mr Clunies-Ross is an honourable man but he does not understand the normal commercial practices or the opportunities of Ufe that exist in Australia. The Government has tried to convey this to him by saying that we would Uke his cooperation, and I must say in fairness to him that he has offered it but it has always been delayed on the basis that the Imarat, or some equivalent there, wiU not aUow it to happen. . Mr Dubney would be able to indicate the advantages of children getting a better eduarisen. cation, the advantages of training the adults on the island and the advantages of the islanders the being paid in Australian money. We must bear mind that we pay a lot of money to that island and I do not know who banks it. Until recently the money was not going into the accounts of the islanders. I might say that the difficulty I have with Mr Clunies-Ross relates to the fact that I decided that the islanders ought to get own bank accounts. In recent months at least one-half of the money has been paid to the islanders' bank accounts. They at least own their own money, and I tlunk that is a welcome change.

32,Mr LAMB,AUSTRALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,"Is the Minister for Transport aware of the recent introduction of new rail timetables in Victoria? Is he aware of mounting dissatisfaction amongst commuters over constant a breakdowns in the new time-tables, especially on Unes serving Melbourne's outer eastern suburbs? Can he say what the Australian Government is doing under the urban transport upgrading program to help the Victorian railways over its troubles?",25
33,Mr CHARLES JONES,AUSTRALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,"I am aware of the change in time-tables in the Melbourne urban transport system. I am also aware of similar changes that have taken place in New South Wales. As a result of these changes, there has been great confusion and many problems have We reaUse this. The Australian Government realises that there is a great need to assist States. For the first time in the history of this in country an Australian government has been prepared to pour very substantial sums of money into aU the State urban transport systems with the idea of building them up. All told, we have a seem to commitment for works programs totalling $207m which have already been approved. The their Australian Government will be making a contribution of $ 138m. These programs started last year and we have made another allocation for the 1974-75financialyear. I hope that these programs will continue to be improved by the introduction of new carriages. As the honourable member is aware, we have been working on the development of a standard passenger train. We to get the best technology that is available to us from throughout the world and apply it to disasters. The Australian rolling stock. The same comment can be made about buses. We have the ludicrous situation in which hardly 2 States in Australia have identical buses. The manufacturers of buses have complained to me that it is costing a lot more money to manufacture buses because they have to meet the requirements of the different States. We have been working on this matter and we are starting to get results from what we are doing to assist the States. Unfortunately, the States have got into this mix with their time-tabling. Yesterday in New South Wales there was a substantial increase of some 20 per cent in urban passenger train fares. All this will do will be to drive people away from these services and put them back into their cars, which will then set up mand for expressways and freeways and result in the tearing down of houses and the pinching of parks and the like. The honourable member asked what has been done in Victoria. In that State already programs to the value of $60.98m have been approved, of which the Australian Government's contribution will be $40.66m. NA",25
34,Mr ANTHONY,GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE,"I ask the Prime Minister whether at his request the Treasurer recently wrote to all Ministers asking them to work out ways of reducing their spending programs by 5 per cent, 10 per cent and 15 per cent, if that proved necessary. Does this indicate that the Government has not committed itself to reducing the rate of increase in spending. Will he make such a firm commitment as a demonstration to the whole community that the Government is determined to give a strong lead in the fight against inflation?",26
35,Mr WHITLAM,GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE,I would be very happy to take into consideration any suggestions that the right honourable gentleman makes for savings in public expenditure. My observation of him over many years is that everything he says publicly these subjects involves an increased expenditure by the Federal Government. NA NA,26
36,Mr NICHOLLS,TRAINING SCHEME,Is the Minister for Labor ing and Immigration aware of a report that under administration of the national employment and training scheme 22 persons have been specially trained for unskilled positions? Will he inform the House whether this is a fact?,26
37,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,TRAINING SCHEME,"I did see an article by Clancy in the' National Times' saying that the Priorities Review Staff was surprised to find that 22 people had been chosen under the National Employment and Training scheme for training for unskilled occupations. I had this checked and I found that the figure was wrong and that the definition was not understood. There were 41 people chosen for training under the category of unskilled workers, which is a very broad banding category for a description of the labour market used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The figure was 41, not 22; and in the previous quarter is was 8 out of approximately 50 000 people who had been interviewed. The writer of the article did not seem to understand that the term 'unskilled worker' is a very broad banding demore finition and that it includes people such as asphalters, mine labourers, excavators, trench a de- workers, acid makers and arsenic sulphide makers. Although it is true to say that they are properly included within the category of so called unskilled workers because they are not tradesmen, nonetheless it would be very foolish to say that they require no training. If the writer of the article were given a job as an arsenic sulphide worker, as an acid maker or as a mine labourer and had not been given any training, he would not be writing any more articles. Mr Chipp-How long is the course of an asphalt maker?",26
38,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,TRAINING SCHEME,Not very long. I thank the honourable member for the interjection.,26
39,Mr SPEAKER,TRAINING SCHEME,Order! The Minister will not answer interjections.,26
40,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,TRAINING SCHEME,"Right, but I will answer something that came into my mind just a second ago. I should add that most of the courses for these dangerous kinds of work are only very short courses.",26
41,Mr WHITLAM,TRAINING SCHEME,As dangerous as that?,26
42,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,TRAINING SCHEME,"Yes. The job trainon ing sometimes lasts as little as three or four weeks. Nonetheless the workers need to be trained because of the danger factor. For example, asphalting is a very dangerous occupation that one must understand before one can do the job efficiendy. I do not mind Clancy writthese articles. It keeps my officers on their his toes. It keeps me on my toes. Although he is wrong this time, he may eventually get on the right course. If he does he will do a public service because he will unearth something that is wrong that should not be wrong. NA",26
43,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL,"I ask the Special Minister of State whether he is aware that the Prime Minister preceded the long list of distinguished companies that the Minister mentioned as criticising the Prices Justification Tribunal when the Prime Minister advised the House on 12 November last year in these terms: I am therefore writing to the Prices Justification to indicate the Government's view that, in the present economic circumstances, it should now give particular attention to the problems of sustaining and stimulating an adequate level of private investment and on capital which will induce the new investment required to maintain economic growth and employment. Is that not precisely the point of view that was being put by the companies concerned and were they not therefore preceded in that view by the for Mr Prime Minister? Should that not give some credibility to the points of view that he was seeking put earlier?",26
44,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL,"The honourable scheme? member for Isaacs asked about the effectiveness of the Tribunal. It is an effective Tribunal. Opposition has gone on record right from the outset-eve n in the times of the Leader of the Opposition's predecessor-as saying that proposed to getridofthe Tribunal. The query I put to the Leader of the Opposition is: What the alternative? The Prime Minister the Tribunal last November saying that it might look at the question of the incentive from profit and what might be termed the replacement of vertisements plant and stock. The Tribunal has done just that. But it is a bit wide of the mark for Repco Ltd the Nylex Corporation Ltd to make complaints back in February, which was, of course, prior to the Leader of the Opposition attaining his present office, and say that the Tribunal was fault when they themselves had made no applidoor cation. At the weekend Berger Paints Pty Ltd made a complaint about a delay. I understand that a proper look at the situation in that would show that the delay was the fault of the company itself. Furthermore, Berger has made no acknowledgement of the fact that it received further 8 cents increase in its prices last So company directors should not be blaming the Prices Justification Tribunal for lems. A lot of their problems are due to their own inefficiency. I understand that 42 public inquiries had been held by the Tribunal up to the end of 1974 and that to date not one company has gone against the Tribunal'sfindings.I think that that is a fair indication of the situation because, as the Leader c the Opposition knows, a company can reject r thefindingsif it wants to do so. Let me put record that the Tribunal has been able to deal effectively with all of those apphcations. Another 1000 appUcants have negotiated price increases and reached agreement without complaint. We must have a good look at why it is that so-called private enterprise is so worried about having its prices looked at. It is the justification of the situation that is important. We cannot afford to have Tribunal consumers being exploited all the time. That seems to be the Opposition's objection. The Opposition does not concern itself with the exploitation. But the country cannot be run with a polof maintaining rates of return icy that fixes wages but does not worry about prices. NA COHEN- I ask a question of the Minister Social Security. Did he note advertisements to over the weekend by the New South Wales Government that indicated that it was seeking a better hospital arrangement under the Medibank Is it likely that a variation of the arrangement negotiated with the Queensland, The South Australian and Tasmanian governments wiU be conceded at the sudden instigation of Mr Lewis? Have the proposals of New South Wales, it Victoria and Western Australia been of such complexity as to delay the negotiations with the is Australian Government longer than has been the did write to case with the other States?",27
45,Mr HAYDEN,MEDIBANK,"Yes, I have noticed such adin the newspaper. It is unlikely that there will be any significant variation of the arand rangements that have been negotiated with the States of Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania, least of all because Mr Lewis, the Premier of New South Wales, has suddenly decided that at he wants to stampede his way through the front of Medibank from 1 July. In a way he has a ton of cheek. He was a very late starter but he wants to be one of the earliestfinishers.I undercase stand that the cost of those advertisements exceeds $20,000. There has been $20,000 worth of camouflage to try to hide the fact that there a has been incompetence on the part of the New March. South Wales Government in the negotiations associated with the introduction of the hospital all of their probplan of Medibank. The facts are that the States of Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania have been in fairly extensive and continuous negotiations with the Australian Government on the hospital plan of Medibank for more than 12 months. In fact, the negotiations have been going on for nearly 2 years, but they have been quite intensive over the past 12 months. The other States-Ne w South on Wales, Victoria and Western Australia-prefer red to play poUtics, to snipe and try to collect cheap poltiical points. As a result they did not bother to enter into serious negotiations until 14 April, which was about 6 weeks ago, and decided then to do so only because of the change of leadership in the Opposition and the responsible statement of the Leader of the Opposition that Medibank would not be an issue on which he would seek to force an election. So the newspaper advertisement is misleading. The Australian Government does not intend to seek control of the States' hospitals. I would have thought that the Queensland Government would have been one of the States least attracted to any such suggestion. It is one State which is very close to signing the agreements. In fact, Dr Edwards and I have completed the final discussions on and consideration of the agreements. He is now taking the matter to his State Cabinet. The Premier of New South Wales refers to the increased utilisation which will arise if free beds are provided in public wards, presuming of course that people are going to rush in in horrendous numbers to have limbs removed and organs extracted. The fact is that people go into hospitals on medical reference, after careful assessment of their condition by medical practitioners. In the case of public wards, they are admitted only after a very careful and very strict assessment by the hospital medical practitioners. Rather than pointing to what are alleged to be increasing delays in obtaining public ward beds in the United Kingdom, Mr Lewis should be looking to the case in Queensland where, as a result of a State Labor Government's initiative more than 30 years ago, we have had continuously available to all who wish to use them free pubhc wards, free of means tests. The range of choice is much wider in that State than is available in New South Wales and the sorts of delays to which Mr Lewis refers do not occur. It may be by implication, of course, that Mr Lewis thinks he is less competent than Mr Bjelke-Petersen in administering public health services. Mr Lewis's advertisement also refers to discrimination against psychiatric patients. That, of course, is nonsense. From 1 July the only State in Australia which will be charging any psychiatric hospital patients will be New South Wales. Therefore, to the extent that there is discrimination, it rests solely with the New South Wales Government. I point out that the Australian Government, through its general financial support to New South Wales, already meets more than 50 per cent of the operating costs of psychiatric hospitals. That is a principle which was firmly enunciated by previous Federal Liberal Country Party governments in opposition to pressure from State governments demanding more money for psychiatric hospitals on some sort of formula basis. It is a principle to which I also adhere. If, for instance, we were to share with the States on a 50/50 basis the costs incurred by psychiatric hospitals, we would merely be releasing that amount of money which we presently could contribute to the operating costs of pubhc hospitals through generalfinanceallocations so that the States could use it in other areas. There would be no improvement in psychiatric hospitals conducted by the States and there would be no increased expenditure. The only thing with which I agree in Mr Lewis's advertisement is his firm proposition that people should not take out medical insurance after 1 July. That is a principle which I have enunciated. I am glad that he agrees with it. Perhaps the Opposition will now take it up in the interests of the public. All I can say is that the $20,000 expended on the weekend on these advertisements represents the most expensive facesaving exercise undertaken by the New South Wales Government. From comments I have heard from some of Mr Lewis's colleagues, I rather suspect that it is more than they think his face is worth. NA",27

I draw to the attention of the House an answer to a question given by the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) on 27 November 1974. He was referring to an Air Vice Marshal who was about 52 years of age. I have not been able to determine his age accurately. The Minister said, inter alia: . . . under the legislation as it now exists, an Air Vice Marshal with 34 years service would receive a pension of about $ 14,000 a year. But because there is automatic commutation, again was provided under the DFRB legislation, an Air Vice Marshal in this posiuon would be able to commute his pension, receive a lump sum payment of $56,000 and a reduced pension of $ 11,000 a year.",29

66,Mr SPEAKER,SUPPLY OF ENERGY RESOURCES TO,"I have received a letter from the Leader of the National Country Party of Australia (Mr Anthony) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The harmful effects of the policies pursued by the ment in relation to the supply of energy resources I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places)",30
67,Mr ANTHONY,SUPPLY OF ENERGY RESOURCES TO,"The Opposition wishes to raise as a matter of public importance its concern about the policies pursued-and the lack of pohcies-by this Government in relation to the supply of energy resources to Japan. No other country was so adversely affected by the Arab oil embargo as Japan. No other country is so completely dependent on outside sources for its energy needs as Japan. No other country has such industrial might which is vulnerable to foreign sources of energy. It was Japan's desire to achieve assured supplies of fuel and other vital resources which was the prime reason that drove Japan into the war in 1941. Today we see countries around the world on which Japan depends for its energy supplies all attempting, in one way or another, to squeeze and exploit Japan's dependence on outside energy supplies to their own advantage. While attempts by other countries to squeeze or exploit. Japan may not hold any immediate dangers to their economies and the short term export prospects of those countries, this is not the case where Austraha is concerned. The effects on Austraha which would result from any undermining of Japan's economic stabUity would be severe. Australia and Japan are mutually dependent in terms of trade: 9 per cent of Japan's total imports originate in Australia and 30 per cent of Australian exports go to Japan while 20 per cent of our imports come from Japan. While Australia, as a suppUer of raw materials and as a market for Japan's manufactured goods, obviously is important to Japan, Japan is of vital importance to Australia. As Dr T. B. MUlar commented at a symposium on Australian-Japanese relations held in Canberra in 1973: Japan is far more important to Australia than we are to it. On the other hand, a leading Japanese economist has stated: The proportion of raw materials and resources supplied to JAPAN her by Australia is so high that without it Japan's economy would not be viable. Both countries have more than just a common interest arising out of mutual trading relationships. The economies of Australia and Japan are so interrelated that any adverse movement in the Japanese economy wiU be reflected in Australia. It is in our interests, therefore, to Governensure that as a major supplier of materials and to Japan. resources to Japan we develop and maintain long term export arrangements with the Japanese. The poUcies pursued by this Government as regards the export of certain vital resources to Japan threaten to affect the continued stability of Japanese industry and the Japanese economy. The so-called resources diplomacy expounded by this Government, and in particular by the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor), will be counter-productive in its results as its effects on Japan's industrial strength and economic situation could well rebound on Australian exports. No doubt this was the reason for the Renouf outburst last year. The Minister for Minerals and Energy has pursued a poUcy aimed at obtaining higher returns for Australian exports to Japan. Whilst this policy has obvious short term advantages, when pursued to its ultimate extent it is not only commercially questionable but is also headed for ruinous economic circumstances. The Minister's success in increasing iron ore prices just a bit more than those negotiated in 1973 now threatens to develop into a policy of squeezing the Japanese for all they are worth. Australia has become a world pacesetter in coal pricing. If the Minister's latest proposals for coal pricing prevaU the price of coal will have increased by far more than the rise in the price of oil as a result of the embargo by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The Minister is playing a dangerous game because he is forcing the Japanese to look to alternative, cheaper sources of supply and is straining our relationships. It is also clear that the Minister is laying in replying to the Japanese in the current negotiations for a new export price for Australian coal. The Minister intends to exploit the earning capacity of the coal mining industry by imposing a tax on Australian coal exporters. It seems that the Minister intends to fix a price with the Japanese in line with the tax which he will impose on coal miners. This is yet another example of the Minister's arbitrary and heavy handed approach to the Japanese. It is the Japanese who will have to share the tax increase if it is associated with higher pricing arrangements. The second main policy of the Minister for. Minerals and Energy is to bring about full Australian ownership of Australia's natural resources. Indeed, he goes beyond this to a policy of full public ownership of energy resources. Such a policy, while superficially appealing, is not only naive in its assumptions but is also dangerous in its implications. Take the issue of uranium. Here Japan has a need which is vital to her future industrial and economic development. Plans are under way to construct 35 nuclear power plants in Japan by 1985. Japan is desperate to obtain long term supplies of uranium. The Government attempted to placate the former Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Tanaka, when he was here last November by coming up with a plan to develop the Ranger uranium deposit in the Northern Territory. However, it is obvious that no development has taken place at Ranger because of the intransigence of the Minister for Minerals and Energy. The Minister has conducted a campaign against the Ranger partners with the objective, I believe, of sending both companies into bankruptcy so that he can obtain control over the uranium resources at Ranger. A similar campaign has been waged against Queensland Mines Ltd. The Minister states that contracts between Australian companies and Japanese power companies for the supply of uranium will be met initially out of the Atomic Energy Commission's stockpile. This will cover all the contracts for 1977, but what about 1978 onwards? Does the Minister expect us to believe that mines can be opened and mills constructed in time to permit production to commence in 1978? The Minister knows that the companies must reach agreement with their Japanese purchasers within the next few months dn production and supply schedules. He knows that it is impossible for them to make anyfirmagreement with the Japanese and hence to meet their contracts. By cutting off this source of uranium to Japan the Minister for Minerals and Energy is threatening to bring considerable dehardship and dislocation to Japan's energy plans for the rest of this century. His latest grandiose talk of developing uranium enrichment alone must be seen by the Japanese as shunning them. The adverse effects on Japan's economy which such action would cause have serious implications for Australia. Japan is our largest customer. We have a vested interest in her continued development and prosperity. By his actions, the Minister for Minerals and Energy is striking at the heart of Japan's continued industrial prosperity and must drive Japan to other countries for her supphes. The policy of Australian ownership of energy resources also has meant that Japan's future requirements of natural gas have not been met from Australia. At present Australia exports one milhon tonnes a year of LPG from Bass Strait to Japan-a n earlier arrangement with which the Minister has just had to live. However, the interest which the Japanese have shown in the Cooper Basin and the north west shelf gas reserves has met complete rebuff from the Minister for Minerals and Energy. Again, by frustrating the development of these resources, the Minister has added significantly to the difficulties which Japan has experienced in filling its energy requirements. If the Minister had not been so belligerent 18 months ago in saying that we did not need any Japanese involvement m the north west we could well have had our natural gas and allied industries well under way by now. Now they shy away not knowing what our policies are and not wanting to be humiliated by any rejection or rebuff. The uncertainty and stress which have entered into Australian-Japanese trade relations since 1972 as a result of the policy of this Government have been reflected in the difficulties over the conclusion of the Nara Treaty. The main stumbling block to agreement is the Australian Government's insistence that all commercial arrangements entered into be subject to its approval. The Japanese fear this would commit them to a situation where they could be subjected to extortionary demands. It is obvious that their experience in the last 2 years at the hands of the Minister for Minerals and Energy is the basis of this fear. The Opposition is in favour of the development of closer and stronger relationships between Australia and Japan. Some may think that dangers are involved in Australia's becoming too dependent on Japanese markets for its exports. The Opposition does not believe that this is so. Indeed, apart from the obvious question-wher e else does such a highly developed and industrialised market exist for Australia to export her natural resources-ther e are many advantages to be gained by Australia as a result of a closer relationship with Japan. The Opposition believes that Australia would obtain large benefits from the extension of our present trading relationship to cover other areas such as investment, technology and know how. Apart from being a major market, Japan is also a major source of capital. It is also a very attractive area of investment for Australia. The future development of Australia's natural resources wiU depend on large amounts of over-' seas capital, and the Opposition beUeves trading relationship which exists between Australia and Japan should be developed further into an economic relationship which is broadly based. It should include not only trade but also capital and economic co-ordination. There is also a further reason for greater co-operation tween Australia and Japan. Japan is one of the main strengths of the Western economy. It stands as a bulwark against the advance of comwith munism not only in this area of the world, but also throughout the Western world. I believe that it is the aim of the communist powers to underto mine the economic strength of Japan, because the effects this would have on the whole of the Western world. By undermining the Japanese Pacific economy, the whole Western economy would be placed in jeopardy. I believe that this is the prime object of international sociaUsm. The poUcies and actions of this Government make one wonder whether Australia has become part of this movement to undermine Japan. G o v e r n m e n t has c o n s is t e n t l y unscrupulously used every opportunity to squeeze the Japanese, to hinder their access development projects in Australia and to impede their access to Australian uranium-the basic ingredient of their energy needs for the future. These actions must giveriseto doubts as to the fitness of this Government, especiaUy of certain Ministers, regarding Japan. Their actions proits vide every reason to believe that Australia has joined with international sociaUst and commucontracts nist powers in their poUcy to undermine Japan and the West. The confusion, uncertainty and procrastination by the Government in not being able to give the Japanese firm and positive poUtracts cies in relation to minerals and energy must immeasurable harm to our relations with Japan. will be. The Opposition has positive poUcies and will see that they are honoured, and the great trade bridge and the trust and confidence built by the 1957 Japan-Australia trade treaty will continue and will be strengthened. The Opposition acknowledges Japan's pressing energy needs and wiU do its best to support her.",30
68,Mr CONNOR,SUPPLY OF ENERGY RESOURCES TO," Mr Deputy Speaker, the remarks of the Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony) scarcely can be taken seriously. Mr Lynch-You are a joke. You ought to talk. Funny money!",32
69,Mr CONNOR,SUPPLY OF ENERGY RESOURCES TO,"It is a peculiar characteristic 3 of the Opposition in this House that its speakers can be heard in complete silence and without the interruption, but immediately a Government spokesman gets up Opposition members do not want to hear anything but want to hurl their inane interjections. In my contacts with the Japanese I have stressed one matter above all else, that is, the interdependence of Australia beand Japan. The remarks of the Leader of the Country Party have done a notable disservice to Australia and to Australia's trading relations Japan. If there is one thing that counts it is integrity, and Australia is a country- I stress this-that keeps its contracts and honours them the letter. It is a country which knows exactly of its relationship with Japan. Japan and Australia are the only 2 advanced countries in the western which have mutual trading interests in the Indian Ocean. We are the only 2 countries to which the people of South-East Asia can look for their future development and welfare without the oppression of therichnations of the world. It amazes me that a gentleman who is the This leader of a Party which sprang from BAWRAand the British Australian Wool Realisation Association Ltd-fro m price organisation, from the to organised marketing of primary products, should now come along with some dirge, with some jeremiad, suggesting that somehow Australia is screwing the Japanese. I have sought at all times . no more than to secure world parity prices. I have assured the Japanese that Australia values trading relations with them. I have assured them that, above all, Australia will honour its to the letter, that it will not take advantage of Japan's dependence on Australia-and Japan does depend on Australia. I have assured the Japanese also that we will see that our conare honoured by the individual producers do of energy, and so they ought to be and so they Above all, the Japanese respect people who are competent, people who are sophisticated, and for the first time in Australia's commercial history the Government of Austraha, because of its vetting of the export contracts, is fully informed. It is informed not only of export prices in respect of Australia's minerals and energy but is informed also in respect of world prices. I was in business for years before I came into Parliament and it has always been my belief that you do business with people not today and not tomorrow but over a period of years and that you never leave a customer dissatisfied but leave him so that you can go back and do business with him again. It is a disgrace, it is scurrilous, and it is contrary to the best interests of Australia that a speech such as the one delivered by the Leader of the National Country Party should have been made. The right honourable gentleman rubbishes the concept of full Australian ownership. Let me instance the case of the projected sale of Peabody interests in respect of Queensland coal. I suggested that in that case an Australian consortium or Australian group of companies might be able to negotiate to again buy back for Australia what-is Australia's birth right. In respect of the honourable member's suggestion that there was to be a huge tax on coal, I state that we are asking for a tax of 25c a ton.",32
70,Mr ANTHONY,SUPPLY OF ENERGY RESOURCES TO,That is the first time you have mentioned it.,33
71,Mr CONNOR,SUPPLY OF ENERGY RESOURCES TO,"No, but the right member would be silly enough to rush in and lead with his chin. We are asking for 25c a ton for the purpose of identifying and quantifying the coal resources of Australia and also for the purIndian pose of initial and substantial research in respect of coal hydrogenation. We are doing this so that we can honour arrangements which were commercial entered into with Mr Tanaka in his recent visit Australia. As soon as the session of Parliament from Europe. concludes, I will be going to Japan to pay the return visit to that country pursuant to the understanding that we have for a joint feasibUity in respect of uranium enrichment and coal into. hydrogenation. In respect of uranium enrichby ment, it wiU be a troika. Australia will supply raw materials. Japan can supply capital and will get the technology we need from our own research and from what is available in Europe. So much",33
72,Mr ANTHONY,SUPPLY OF ENERGY RESOURCES TO,That is news.,33
73,Mr CONNOR,SUPPLY OF ENERGY RESOURCES TO,"It is not news at all. I have said that in the House and said it .many times. has been stated pubUcly. Let me deal with the suggestion that the Japanese are being screwed in respect of coal. At the present time we are negotiating on a basis which provides that Japanese wiU be paying less for coal than they have been paying for purchases of coal from the east coast of the United States of America. If there is one thing that the Japanese need, it is reassurance. Australia supplies Japan with 45 per cent of its coal requirements. We supply approximately the same percentage of its iron ore requirements. In an uncertain and poUtically unstable world the Japanese know they can deal with one country that is poUtically and economicaUy stable. That is Australia. There are no political strings attached to contracts that we enter into with the Japanese. Let this be also clearly understood. The Nippon Steel Corporation is a monopsony. It is an efficient one. It buys for 15 or '16 steel nulls. Against that we exercise what I have correctly termed as a benign supervision over the contractual arrangements between the various coal and iron ore producers. With that monopsony the relationship has been a good one. The Japanese respect strength. They respect confidence and commercial capabUity. For that very reason they had a real contempt for the former Government in relation to which there was a poUcy of catch as catch can. For example, would the National Country Party suggest that we did the wrong thing in fixing a floor price for wool? Of course it would not. Yet members of the same Party come into this House and, in a puerile attempt to extract political advantage, advance an argument that somehow we are unhonourable kind to the Japanese. I know what the future holds. Two-thirds of the world's people Uve around the shores of the and the Pacific Oceans. It will be by partnership between Australia and Japan that we will emerge as the two strongest industrial and powers. Australia will be part of this to with the advent of additional people coming I may as well be very frank about the situation study in respect of uranium. A contract was entered It was drawn up at the Lodge. It was signed the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), the the Deputy Prime Mmister (Dr JF CAIRNS), the we former Attorney-General and myself. Representatives from Peko Wallsend Ltd and E. Z. Industries Ltd were present. The arrangement included the contribution of 21 h per cent of the l cost of the muung plant by these people. Now, they do not want to do it. They want an interest free loan. As should well be known, the 2 comIt pames have their problems. In fact, they want to screw the Government. In addition to that, it was clearly understood that the Government, because of the nature of uranium-afte r all, it is a the weapons source as much as being a source of energy-wante d to have some say in the sale of uranium. The compames wanted to sell the uranium as it was produced. That is contrary to the terms of the arrangement More than thatand here again the Leader of the National Country Party might take to task the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt)-ther e is to be an environmental impact study in respect of the Northern Territory. But in the meantime as I have already said, we have a stockpile of uranium inherited from the Menzies Administration which had produced it for weapons purposes. That, together with the initial output from the Mary Kathleen plant which is about to commence production after being reconditioned, will be available. Our contracts for the delivery of uranium to Japan are phased over a considerable period of years. I assure this House and Japan that we will be able to meet our commitments because if there are any delays we will loan part of that stockpile to the companies concerned so they can meet their contracts. In respect of steaming coal, we are also in close co-operation with Japan and we get their projections of their future requirements. Japan, if it continues to expand at its present pace, will be in a desperate position because of an increase in crude oil prices. It is utterly and completely wrong and a deliberate attempt to mislead the House to suggest that the increase in coking coal prices is proportionately greater than the increase in oil prices. It is not. It is utterly and the Leader of the National Country Party well knows it, although he tries to get away with it. We are in a position to meet more of Japan's requirements for coking coal. The United States of America which has been Japan's second major source of coal supply now finds that it needs more and more coal for its internal consumption. More than ever Japan has to rely on Australia for this source of energy. Japan has had a fair go from Australia. It will continue to get a fair go. But for the first time, Australia has a Government and an adrninistration which is capable of matching the Japanese, meeting them on their own ground and negotiating a commercial contract on proper terms. The Leader of the National Country Party made reference also to Uquefied petroleum gas. In fact we have increased the export of LPG to Japan from one million tons a year to 1.25 million tons a year. We are making a very valuable contribution to their requirements in this field. But a time will come-and it could come very soon-whe n we wiU need the LPG for ourselves. In the meantime I have assured the Japanese that they will have No. 1 priority in respect of their energy requirements. I am speaking here of priorities in terms of trading partners. Our second priority will be West Germany and the third, Italy. These countries are Australia's 3 best partners. They will have these supplies and they will get them. Australia is a sound and a reputable country and we are a sound and reputable Government. Labor honours its promises as does Australia. With regard to coal hydrogenation-and this is of the utmost importance to Japan-Australi a has certain coal types which can be well used and it will be a matter of very, very careful calculation as to the extent to which they can be used. Here again I deprecate the attempt by the Leader of the National Country Party to mislead the House. We need to know exactly what our high volatile coals are. Mr Hewson-And brown coal too.",33
74,Mr CONNOR,SUPPLY OF ENERGY RESOURCES TO,"And brown coal as well. But high volatile coal provides the most easy path to coal Uquefaction and hydrogenation. To get some idea of the magnitude of what will be required, a daUy production of 100 000 barrels of crude oU would require an annual commitment of 16 million tons of coal. About 105 million tons of coal would be required to satisfy Australia's present consumption of oU of a little over 620 000 barrels a day. In addition to that we wrong, produce 65 million tons for other purposes, which brings us to a total production of about 170 nuiUon tons a year. The Japanese have forecast that they wiU scale up to about 30 miUion tons of steaming coal for electricity generation in their own country by 1980. That will bring the total requirement to more than 200 nullion tons a year. It is for that reason alone and not to turn the screw on the Japanese that I am asking the Government to agree to the introduction of the excise. I repeat my initial comments: Remarks of this kind in a debate of this nature are disgraceful. It is utterly and completely disgraceful to raise this as a matter of pubUc importance. It reflects no credit on the National Country Party of Australia. It shows what a spurious, contemptible crowd they are when they speak in such scurrilous terms with such falacious arguments in an attempt to mislead the people of Australia. ..",34
75,Mr VINER,SUPPLY OF ENERGY RESOURCES TO,"Far from this issue which is raised as a matter of public importance being unimportant, it is a matter of supreme importance not only to Japan but also to the Parliament and the people of Australia. For the first time for many a day we have begun to hear the thoughts of the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor) on the future of trade relationships with Japan. It makes it abundantly clear that what the Opposition needs to do is to raise issues in this House as matters of pubhc importance so that the Japanese may find out what is the real attitude of the honourable gentleman and the Australian people may know what he is doing. We have had few statements from this Minister in the past, but many Dorothy Dix questions have been addressed to him. This is a technique which ought to be deplored because it denies to the Opposition an opportunity to debate the policies of the Government in mis vital field. We have learnt one thing from what the of honourable gendeman has said and that is that we have, at least, a prophet in our own time. quote his own words, he knows what the future holds. I recall that early in 1973 the honourable gentleman informed the House that there were things of which he was certain: Life, death, and that the value of the United States dollar would go down. Mr Connor-So it has. . Mr VINER-The value of the United States dollar went down, but it has certainly gone again. The Minister knows that well. The value price of the American dollar has not gone down and continued to go down. In the Press in recent times we have seen the announcement of the imminent retirement of the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard). I think the Prime Minister (Mr Whidam) might well follow this up by seeking the retirement of the Minister for Minerals and Energy. The Minister has certainly achieved that nothing during his ministry. I could think of much better task for him to perform. Perhaps he might be sent to Peru while Mr Barnard is sent to Copenhagen. I am sure that the present Minister for Minerals and Energy will be able to write some fish-meal contracts for Australia. done nothing but antagonise industry and, by doing so, has destroyed the foundation for get milk Austraha's future economic prosperity. He has Japan done nothing but antagonise Australia's great trading partners. His attitude has led to Minister's instability in international trade. That has been achieved by a naive concept of economic say: overlordship of Australian mineral resources. It is reflected in the Government's attitude towards time resource diplomacy. In real terms all that means dangerous in today's world is resource Government cannot do that with the finesse of member countries of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Nevertheless, the way in which the Government has pursued in its pohcies has had a deadly effect on our great trading partners and, in particular, on Japan. We have seen the effect of what the Government has done with its interference in the trade in iron ore and in coal, in denying to the Japanese the opportunity to import Australian natural gas and in its interference with the making of contracts for the sale of uranium. The Minister is very fond of declaiming to the people of Australia that he and the Labor Government will honour its contracts. What we want from the Government is not so much the honouring of contracts but contracts which can be honoured. This is what has not come from the Minister. When the Prime Minister and the Minister speak obtaining fair prices for Australian resources, what they really mean is that they will use the To export control powers of the Government to obtain the prices for our resources that the Government thinks ought to be obtained. That is 3 economic blackmaU. It takes no account of world patterns of trade, but seeks to apply a blanket rule to all international dealings. In the hands of the Minister this kind of economic blackmail is a blunt instrument which can only damage the sensibUities of our relationships with our great trading partners such as Japan. When the Minisup ter speaks of imposing an excise on the export of coal, as he is now doing, in essence that is no more than what the OPEC countries are doing in imposing a posted price for the export of crude oU, and that must have the effect of increasing the price of coal to Japan. In effect, it is a tax on the Japanese industrial consumers of our coal and we know that that is nothing more than international economic blackmail. I am glad to say that is not the policy of the Opposition and it a will not be our policy when we are in government. I should like to remind the House of something the Minister said about Japan in a debate in this House on 23 September 1970. He said then, as He has he has said recently: An old saying is that one never keeps a cow when one can by other means. Having tried aggression and failed, now tries the alternative of economic penetration. That means economic aggression, and that is this attitude on Japan-that it will indulge in economic aggression. The Minister went on to . . . the relationship between us which at the present is a mutually profitable one can be, in the long term, a one in which Japan could develop into a big brother and adopt the big brother complex and lean rather blackmail, and this heavily on us. He continued later: But in the long term, aggression is a distinct possibility and terms of physical aggression Japan is possibly the only enemy in sight. Mr Kelly-Who said that?",34
76,Mr VINER,SUPPLY OF ENERGY RESOURCES TO,"The Minister for Minerals and Energy. It must be alarrning to the people of Australia, as well as to the Government of Japan, to know that the Minister in charge of minerals in Australia upon which Japan is so dependent looks on Japan as an actual economic aggressor and a potential physical aggressor. So far as I can see in trying to understand this prophet in our time, that kind of attitude is derived either from pathological fear of Japan or from a distorted view of history. Neither attitude has any foundation in fact in any assessment of future relationships between Australia and Japan. So when we look at the actions of this Minister in relation to the pricing of iron ore exports, in the denial of vital energy sources such as natural gas and in inhibiting the export of uranium to Japan, we wonder whether in the pursuit of the attitude expressed by him in 1970 he is seeking to inhibit seriously Japan's abiUty to trade with the world. The Opposition's shadow minister for trade and resources has referred to the difficulties which uranium explorers have had in reaching agreement with the Government and in fulfilUng their uranium contracts with Japan. We wonder also what has happened to the statement ofjoint co-operation on mvestigating technology and uranium enrichment. We know that the establishment of nuclear power stations in Japan is vital to Japan's energy sources in the 1980s and beyond. We know that Japan is looking to Australia as a source of uranium. We know it would Uke to look to Australia as a source of enriched uranium, but we hear nothing from this Minister as to the progress of this exercise in cooperation between the 2 countries. Rather, the Minister now speaks proudly of Australia's achievement in uranium enrichment technology. It must make honourable members wonder, it must make the - industry wonder and it must make Japan wonder what wiU be the future of co-operation between the 2 countries in the investigation of enrichment technology. The Minister speaks also of co-operation tween Japan and Australia in coal hydrogendor ation. But then, in the next breath, he speaks Australia going it alone and achieving a great national potential. Where is the element operation he so often speaks about? He says one thing today, another thing tomorrow. This is pattern right throughout this Minister's ministry and throughout the relationships between Australia and Japan in this vital area of energy resources.",36
77,Mr KEATING,SUPPLY OF ENERGY RESOURCES TO," I think sending the 2 speeches we have just heard from members of the Opposition are very pathetic. On numerous occasions the Leader of the National Country Party of Australia (Mr Anthony) has come into this chamber and spoken about the Government's handUng of minerals and energy in Australia. But of course, as he has gone back to the people who sent him here-the Australian Mining Industry Council and the other minersthey have told him: 'Go quietly; Connor is doing a very well, thank you very much, and we do not need your assistance any more'. So, to make himself relevant, today he picks up a completely new tack- a tack which the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor) described as scurrilous, and I think that is the only way it could be of coal exports, described. The honourable member for Stirling (Mr Viner) talked about our antagonising our trading partners; he talked about international economic blackmaU. Now, getting price increases for Australian commodities is international economic blackmaU yet a year ago the Opposition criticised the Government for not getting price increases. Do we ever hear the members of the Opposition or the Leader of the National Country Party saying that Japan is paying too much for wool? No. The Leader of the National Country Party was out in front of Parliament House the other day acting to a group of Country Party supporters, trying to encourage the Government to stand by the 250c floor price for wool. Where is the logic in his argument? Why does he not say that the Government should not stand up for wool? He says that we are not to ask for increases in the price of iron ore, coal and other such commodities, yet we are to ask for increases in the price of wheat, wool, butter and beef. He says that our boards-the Australian Wheat Board and the wool board-shoul d go to our trading partners for higher prices. It is a completely lopsided and scurrilous approach. I do not know where the Leader of the Country Party thinks his interests are served; whether he thinks the Japanese Government will be beindebted to him or that the Japanese Ambassato Australia will write a nice letter back to of Tokyo about him. They think he is a fool; they always thought he was a fool. They thought the of coformer Government were fools because they could not extract decent prices from Japan for the our commodities. Everyone in the world knows that Nippon Steel buys on behalf of the Government of Japan. That company went to South America and came to Australia with one united voice, to buy. What were we doing? We were our coal and iron ore producers to Japan where they were competing, one against the other-Queenslan d producers of coal against New South Wales producers and the various consortiums in Western Australia competing against each other. This Minister for Minerals and Energy has given the Australian niining industry a chance to survive. Coal prices have increased by 250 per cent since we took office, but they are at the world parity. Could anyone argue seriously that if the price of oil is to up, substitute energy commodities will not move up to about the same price per British thermal unit, or whichever term is used to describe the energy content of any particular commodity. Of course not. Uranium prices will move up until they are somewhat equivalent to oil prices and the same applies to coal prices. But we have never said that we will deny these commodities to Japan. The whole thrust of our policy under this Government has been one of continuing co-operation with Japan and of guarantees of raw materials at the world parity price. Japan respects this. It knows we will not be conned or fooled any longer. For the Leader of the National Country Party to come into this House as a Leader of a Party and to say that this is international economic blackmail is like his saying to the iron ore producers and the coal ducers: ' I am arguing in Parliament these days for a reduction in the price of your exports'. Let him see how far he would get with that remark. Let him get up and say: ' I am putting it around these days that your are charging Japan and other countries too much'. I do not think that that would get very much of a reception. Let him say that to Sir Charles Court or to Hancock or to Carnegie from Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd or to the Utah coal mining company. Let him see what they would say when he says that about their prices. I know what they would say: They would say he is a clown, and he is. Honourable members opposite talked about stifling Japan's trading capacity. In the time have taken office, Japan's exports of steel have moved up from $5.5 billion to $ 11.5 billion. does Japan get that sort of growth unless it able to trade in the world? Japan is able in the world. There is no doubt that knocked around by the increases in oil prices. We do not deny that. But Japan will adjust to it. Its prices will move up. The Japanese will Uve with it. We are prepared to do what we can with regard to uranium. We have honoured the conwith tracts entered into by the former Government supply uranium to Japan at the time that Japanese want it. We are prepared to deplete our own stockpiles to do so. We have set up the Ranger projects to replenish our own stockpUes and to fulfil ongoing contracts. The honourable member for Stirling (Mr Viner) talked about uranium enrichment. There is an agreement between the Japanese and ourselves to look at feasibUity studies in coal hydrogenation, that is to get petroleum products from coal, and also uranium enrichment. But with move regard to uranium enrichment, it is true to say that the Japanese have been wary; they have held out. The point is that we have the technology now and we have found a lot of uranium ourselves. It is a gambUng position. We are prepared to gamble with them-to wait. But we have the technology; we have the raw material. Why should we not press a harder bargain? That is what it is all about. We are prepared to give them enriched fuel but that does not mean to say that we should be laid down and raped by them because they are our trading partners. We are prepared to give them fair treatment and they have received fair treatment from us. One of the things that have been done by the Minister for Minerals and Energy since he has been in office has been to put our relationship with Japan on a decent and equitable basis. pro- Japan understands that in the future Australia will trade with it and guarantee raw materials. But at-the same time Japan realises that it has to pay a fair world price. Why should the returns of the Australian people be depreciated in deference to a scurrilous sort of concept raised by the Leader of the National Country Party-that it is international blackmail? That is just a lot of rubbish, and he knows it. Let him get up and say to the coalminers and the iron ore miners in Western Australia that he is arguing for lower coal prices. A year ago he was in the pocket of ESSOBHP trying to get the crude oU price agreement raised at the expense of the Australian motorist from $2.09 a barrel to around $8 a barrel. That is now a lame duck issue. He is now taking another tack and saying that we are too tough on Japan, we and that we all ought to be saying: 'Oh, the Japanese cannot afford it. What a terrible thing How we are doing to them'. We are being fair with is them, and they know it. They know that the ride to trade that they had when honourable members Japan was opposite were in office is over. They get 45 per cent of their total coal supplies from Australia; they wiU probably get more in the future. We are now starting to supply them steaming coal. We are doing that as a supto plement to their supply of oU. Nevertheless, the Japan's problems with pollution and the environment are of prime consideration to us. If they were to supply all their energy needs with oil, they would literally need a string of oil tankers end on end from the Middle East to Japan. The environmental problems of sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere and of all the other pollutants which come from burning hydrocarbons is such that in a small area such as Japan, this will be an inhibiting factor. Therefore Japan is interested in moving into nuclear power and enriched fuel. We are prepared to give the Japanese any amount of fuel that they need, enriched if we can do so. The only thing is that we would like to do the enriching. Instead of sending just yellow cake at bargain basement prices we want to get the profit that comes from enrichment. We do not want the stuff to be sent to the United States or the Soviet Union or any place else where Japan may choose to have it enriched. A good offer is before Japan. It can come in with Australia on enrichment if it wishes. If it wants to wait until we develop the technology and secure the capital, as we have the raw material, it will wait too long. The Japanese should get off their tails and move into this undertaking. They should do something about it rather than hang out and wait until possibly we are suckered into some of the arguments raised by the Leader of the National Country Party. What really rocks me is what the Leader of the National Country Party thought was the advantage of the line that he took today in this Parliament. What possible advantage will result for the Japanese, the Australian people or the producers of these commodities from the argument that the prices are too high? Clearly the prices are not. They are at world parity and, in some cases, a Uttle bit less. There has been co-operation in terms of quantity. More is being exported to Japan. We are decent trading partners. We have taken a great deal of manufactured exports from the Japanese. With respect to motor vehicles, we almost aUowed our own motor car industry to be dislocated out of deference to imports from Japan to try to correct the trade imbalance that existed. The speech by the Leader of the National Country Party was a scurrilous attempt to make his poUcies relevant at a time when they have been discredited by the Minister for Minerals and Energy who has proved over and over again that he has the respect of the Japanese Government.",36
78,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPPLY OF ENERGY RESOURCES TO,Mr Berinson)Order! The discussion is concluded. NA (SIMULTANEOUS ELECTIONS) BILL 1975 [No. 2] Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 May on motion by Mr Enderby: That the Bill be now read a second time.,38
79,Mr GARLAND,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The House is debating again the Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill 1975 [No. 2]. The Bill seeks again to obtain the authorisation of Parliament to put to the people of Australia a referendum which would if carried result in elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate being held simultaneously. It is a proposal which was rejected by the Australian people at the elections in May of last year, only a litde more than one year ago. I believe that the person behind the Government's policy in this respect is the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam). He is the one rather than the rest of the Government who is pushing to see that this proposal is put again to the people. Nevertheless, it is Government poUcy that this legislation be introduced again, debated, and treated as a matter of high priority among the competing priorities of legislation in this House. I make some point of the competing priorities of legislation in this House. In practice there are only so many days that the House can meet and there are only so many BUls that can be dealt with. We are being told continually by the Government that there is a crush of legislation, that the House cannot deal with this, that, or the other, or that some proposal must be delayed because of the time restraint. Here we have a measure being forced through the House again. Time is being taken up on a proposal which has been recently decided against the Government's poUcy. The truth of the matter is-anyon e who has watched the Prime Minister closely will have observed this-that when he gets a bee in his bonnet he just goes straight ahead and rams his proposal through. Apparently he has bulldozed members of his Party into agreeing to put this Bill forward again, with other BUls, knowing that the legislation will be rejected in the Senate again on the ground that it was defeated by the people only a year ago. Yet the Prime Minister persists. I take the opportunity to point out that this is yet another indication of the aim of the Prime Minister to get his way, come what may, and in spite of what may be the clear indication of the vote of the Australian people and indeed of the sentiment of this Parliament. The Opposition will oppose this Bill. There is nothing new in it. This legislation was put before the House as recently as last February. It was defeated at that time in the Senate. It is one of 4 Bills that were put through the Parhament with the agreement of the Opposition to provide for referenda on 4 broad subjects. I will say more about that aspect in a moment. Those Bills were the subject of referenda put to the people at the double dissolution election of 18 May 1974. All of those referenda were defeated. The real significance of this Bill which has been brought forward today needs to be pointed out. It is that the Bill will now become one of a number of Bills- I think the present count is eleven-whic h could be used as grounds for a double dissolution if the Government were to recommend to the Governor General that a double dissolution be held. I do not think that the Government at the moment is game to do that. There is what has been called a storehouse of Bills. If there were a double dissolution and if the Labor Party had a majority of the combined membership of the Senate and House of Representatives, it could obtain at a Joint Sitting, as provided by the Constitution, a majority to have those Bills on which the double dissolution was granted put through and passed. That is what the Government did with 6 Bills in July last year as a result of the ble dissolution election which took place in May. So the significance of this Bill is that, when rejected by the Senate, it will join other Bills in this storehouse of Bills. This will be one of the Bills which the Government will seek to have passed. Having had it passed the Government, of course, will not be in any superior position to the position it held in April 1974 when the Bill was passed by the Senate. I think the Government has anticipated accurately that Opposition senators will not permit this Bill to be passed now because the matter has so recendy been decided by the people and they do not wish the proposition to be passed, with good reason which I shall come to in a moment. The fact is that this proposal suits the Government as the largest Party in the country at the moment, because the proposal will act against the interests of small parties and individual candidates if a Senate election coincides with the House of Representatives election. This would make it almost impossible for those individuals or small party candidates to have their voices heard in the crush and electoral conflict which go on at the time of a general election. The question which was put to the people and which they rejected was: 'Do you think that the elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives ought to be held on the same day?' That was the kernel of the question.",38
80,Mr DUTHIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They were, for donkey's years.",39
81,Mr GARLAND,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"As the honourable gentleman interjects, elections were held together for a long time but they were not automatically linked as is proposed in this Bill. Surely that distinction must be clear to the honourable member for Wilmot and to every other honourable member in the Parhament. The question I put a moment ago was the kernel of the matter. Unfortunately, as with the other referenda questions, this question was by no means clear when it appeared on the ballot papers presented to the people. It needs to be pointed out that the wording of all 4 questions put to the people contained more than 4 propositions. On analysis there were about double that number. The questions were very unclear and slanted in favour of the Government which was trying to get a majority of yes votes. The ballot paper was very complicated, but I am glad to say that the people of Australia saw through the Government's intentions and resoundingly voted them out. I wish to indicate what I mean by that statement because when one reads the comments made by the Prime Minister in support of this legislation in his speech in February of this year one will see the lengths to which he douwill go to misrepresent the position. Speaking of the referendum put in May 1974, he said: The proposal failed only narrowly to obtain an overall majority of the votes. Over 3V4 million voters endorsed the proposed law and slightly fewer than 3% voted no. The proposed law received a majority of yes votes in the most populous State New South Wales, and was only narrowly lost in Victoria and South Australia. The proposal is clearly one that has great appeal to the electorate. My Government is of the view that it is of such importance and merit that it should again be put to the people. Let us analyse that statement and the election results. The fact is that the Constitution requires a majority. It was not a close majority; it was quite a clear majority against the proposal. The Constitution provides also that it must be carried by a majority of States. The Prime Minister did not mention that fact. As a great lawyer, perhaps he overlooked the fact that the Constitution, makes that provision. How many States carried a majority for this proposition? One out of six. That is how close it was. I do not mind the Prime Minister being somewhat proud that he is a member from New South Wales-the most populous State, as he described it on this occasion and as he has described it on many occasions with some relish-bu t may I, as a representative of one of the other States, draw to his attention that when this Federation was formed a condition on which the other States came into it and on which it was founded was that they would have an equal say in the Senate. I have a great deal of regard for New South Wales and many of its people. I look upon it perhaps as a second home in some ways, but I am sure that the great majority of the people in New South Wales would agree with me that it is not only their more populous numbers which are to be considered in these matters which affect the whole country but the rninorities have some rights under our Constitution since it was based on the principle that smaller States and indeed other States would have a say. So when 5 States think one way and one State, albeit the most populous, thinks the other way, surely the decision is clear. Surely when a difference of 250 000 people is involved, even when one is counting heads, that is not a close result. The truth is that the Prime Minister wants . referendum and the other referenda carried to help his electoral prospects. That is what this matter is all about. We can see in this proposal and in the boundaries which have been presented to this House, the so-called reform that the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly) wants to achieve under the Electoral Act, a whole pattern of effort to improve greatly the chances of the Australian Labor Pary at elections. I put to the House and to the people of Australia that a system which has resulted in both sides of our poltiical spectrum being elected cannot be so very unfair. This system enabled Labor to win in 1972 and 1974, and the Liberal and Country parties to win prior to that. It must be pretty flexible and rather balanced to permit those changes. I believe that this Bill is part pattern to achieve advantage. When one speaks privately to many Labor Party members of this House, no secrecy is made of that objective. On the contrary, there seems to be a good deal of pride in the aim. This Bill and the proposition of making these elections simultaneous have, I suppose, ficially some attractiveness and some developed plausibility. But on more careful examination error. surely that argument is pretty hollow. The relationship between the House and the Senate is perhaps fairly sophisticated and not widely understood outside the Parliament. It is a relatime tionship of considerable independence. Of course the Senate is a chamber in which the number of representatives from each State is equal-eac h State has 10 Senators. The House a chamber at present of 127 members who are elected from the States in proportion to the population within those States. The Senate is controlled by the House and the House is not controlled by the Senate. AU BiUs must pass through both chambers before they can become law. As I said, in the 1890s some of the self governing States, when considering federation, were not prepared to come into the Federation unless their position was safeguarded. That is the view of many people in some of the States today. In my own State of Western Australia it is very much the general opinion. We should not think, as obviously the Prime Minister does, that all those views are outdated, that nobody minds all power being centralised in Canberra and decisions being made in accordance with his wishes. On the contrary there is a good deal of doubt about it. I find, wherever I go, an increasing recognition of the value of the Senate as a house of review, as a chamber which makes this some effort to analyse proposed legislation, which considers whether it would be a good law and which acts as a bit of a brake. Even when the Government of the day has had a majority in that chamber it has been notable that many amendments have been made to Bills before they became law. So it does in that sense act as a reconsideration mechanism and as a house of review. Under the constitution the Senate normally has an election for half of its members every three years. But the House of Representatives, which is the populous House, is constituted on the principle that its members represent certain numbers of people. It is a deep constitutional principle that governments stand or fall on their of a support or otherwise in this House and not by what goes on in the Senate. Of course there is a considerable difference in the activities of the 2 chambers which have a very different role to play within our Constitution. We borrowed this principle from the proceedings and Constitution of the House of Commons at Westminster. All the proceedings of this House are based on the prosupercedure and constitutionality of what was in England over centuries of trial and When a government loses confidence in this place it usually leads to an election. The only it would not lead to an election would be when the party of the majority was able to find another leader that it would stand behind so that there would be no need for it to go to the people is for an election to determine which pany or parties should have the majority and indeed which leader should get a vote of confidence. That vote not of confidence is a confidence to form a government and to carry on a government; it is not a vote of confidence in every item in the party form, as our present Prime Minister never fails to claim. Elections for this chamber can, and in fact do, take place at more frequent intervals than 3 years. We had a parliament which lasted from 2 December 1972-m y dates may not be entirely accurate but they will do for the sake of argument-until 18 May 1974. That was a short period. Under this proposal the term of the Senate, or half of its members, would be of the same duration. I am leaving out of the question consideration of the separate matters that arise with a double dissolution. That is a rather basic change to be suggesting. So, closer analysis of this proposition shows that we would be making a very big change to the Constitution of this country and I am not sure, even after the debate on this Bill, that all its ramifications have been fully thought out. We have to bear in mind too that the Prime Minister and the present Government Party have for many years put the view that the Senate ought to be abolished. It is or was Australian Labor Party poUcy- I think it still is-that the Senate should be aboUshed, that there is no need for it, and one quite often hears members of the Labor Party putting that argument in this place. That, of course, runs completely counter to the basis of our federation and to the structure that have briefly outUned in my remarks. However, does point up the beUef of the Government it knows far better than anybody else. The Prime Minister is on record as having said that he favours only a 2-party system-in other words, he would do away with any small party-and uni-cameral system, which means that he would do away with the Senate. He is clearly opposed to the activities of the States and wishes to them either aboUshed or left as empty sheUs. has talked about the anachronisms of boundaries set in the 1890s. There are some who believe that he would Uke to see himself as the first president of this country. Certainly at times he has things which indicate that he would like our monarchy dispensed with, though I notice that in recent times he is drawing away from that view. At times he has favoured afirstpast the post balloting system. At present he favours an optional preferential system which many people believe is much the same thing anyway. So we have an attack on many constitutional institutions in this country by the Prime Minister and his Government and this Bill is part of that attack. It is a course of conduct which seems aimed at enabling the Prime Minister to have very great power and at minimising very much platany opposition that might appear to his wishes. That seems to be based on the principle that he knows best, but one could validly argue that in view of some of his policies of recent times it is easy to see that he does not always know best. However, it is more fundamental than recent poUcies and administration. Surely the essence of democracy is divided power- a division of power around the country. Allowing no government or minister to have full and unfettered power is what democracy is all about. We in the Liberal and National Country Parties believe in the preservation of these institutions such as, to take one example, the relationship between the Senate and the House of Representatives. We believe that elections being held by the Senate at fixed intervals and by the House of Representatives at intervals determined in the first place by the Electoral Act, which sets a maximum of 3 years, and in the second place by events in this House-namely , untU the Government can no longer retain the confidence of the House-ar e basic principles which ought to be preserved. As the people already have voted against the proposition contained in this Bill, we see no reason why we should accept it now. We reject the Bill and will vote against it and the Senate wiU not pass it because the Opposition Parties there have sufficient numbers to see I that it is not passed. This is a proposition that it would do considerable violence to the place of that the Senate in the Constitution. There is certainly a growing need-no t a diminishing need-for the Senate in its present role as an examiner and a House of review. I a think Australia has had good service from the activities of the Senate in recent years and, to be fair, that has come about partly because of the have activity of Labor members in the Senate. The He Opposition's view is that we should oppose this Bill. The Government, if it wishes, can add the Bill to its storehouse of BUls awaiting a double dissolution. I suggest to the Government that it done may not be a complete joy to be gathering together more and more BUls to be put to the people at the next election. It may be a very attractive proposition to the Prime Minister to say: 'We have 15, 20, 30 or 40 BiUs in a storehouse and if you elect us we will make sure we get them all through'. But I put it to the Government that that proposition has a 2-edge blade. If the Government puts such a large number of BUls to the people there is bound to be a big section of the people who will say: 'We are not so sure we to be want that particular Bill passed'. The Government might find that at election time it gets more opposition than might at present be perceived. I conclude by saying that there is no general demand by the Australian people for making this change to the Constitution. I do not know in what circles the Prime Minister moves where he hears a demand for this change, but those circles are not very widespread. The history of referenda in Australia is that most people beheve that by and large the machinery has been working pretty well. I see no chance of this referendum being passed-if the proposal gets that far. The Opposition believes that the proposal is a waste of time and it will be rejecting it.",39
82,Mr MCKENZIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION," Mr Deputy Speaker, I think at the outset I should put the House straight about one very important point that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Garland) made on a number of occasions in his speech. A Constitution (Alternation) Bill cannot- I repeat cannot-be the subject of action taken under section 57 of the Constitution which, of course, refers to the proceedings for a double dissolution. If the Senate does not pass this Bill on 2 occasions, the consequence is that the Bill can then be put to the people. All that is required is for the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) to ask the Governor General to agree to have a referendum on the subject of the Constitution (Alteration) Bill put to the people. If the people agree to the change being made, that becomes an alteration to the Constitution. Because this point was made on a number of occasions by the honourable member for Curtin, I repeat that a Bill of this type cannot be the subject of a double dissolution. The procedure for the treatment of such a Bill is quite separate. The honourable member for Curtin seemed to be arguing in favour of having separate elections for the Senate and the House ofRepresentatives. I point out to him and to the House that the cost of holding separate elections for either the House of Representatives or the Senate is now rapidly approaching $2m. Considering the benefits and the disadvantages of holding separate elections, it seems to me that most people would favour having simultaneous elections. It is all right for the honourable member for Curtin to tell us that the question has been put to the people previously and that the people have made a decision on it. In my opinion, the argument that was put to the people previously by the Opposition was very misleading. Member after member of the Opposition stood in this House and said that the whole problem could be resolved if there was a double dissolution. I ask the Opposition to look at the debates which occurred early in November last year when this matter was last discussed. It will see what its spokesman said on that occasion. The then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Snedden, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) and other members of the Opposition said in this House that this problem could be resolved by the Government going to the people in a double dissolution. Of course, this has not occurred. The election for one-half of the Senate must occur between 1 July this year and 30 June next year. That must happen unless there is a double dissolution. It is easy to see that this is not in conjunction with the House ofRepresentatives election because this House is due to go to the people at any time around May 1977. I remind the members of the Opposition that next year is 1976. So separate elections, by the attitude that the members of the Opposition adopted on the last occasion a similar Bill came before this House, will inevitably cost the people of Australia $2m. This may not seem a great deal of money to members of this Parliament who are used to dealing in thousands of millions of dollars but $2m, I think anyone would agree, is worth saving in anybody's language. The advantages of having separate elections for which the Opposition now appears to be arguing just cannot be substantiated. The Joint Committee on Constitutional Review, which brought down its report in 1959 and which was composed of members of all parties, argued very strongly in favour of having simultaneous elections. I would like to quote very briefly from its report. The relevant part of the report can be seen in full at page 3332 and subsequent pages in Hansard dated 14 November 1973. The Committee said: There are, to the Committee's way of thinking, reasons why one-half the number of senators shouldretireat every general election of members of the House ofRepresentatives which are sufficiently cogent to justify a constitutional amendment. That was the decision of that Committee. The Committee later said: The Committee believes that the weight of public opinion is opposed to the holding of separate elections for the 2 Houses of the Federal Parliament. The Australian people already have to vote frequently because they are also called upon to elect members to the Parliaments of their States, in some States, for 2 Houses at different times. I speak to a lot of people who are very concerned about the number of elections which are held. When there are local government elections, byelections for local government quite frequently, elections for the State Houses and elections for the Federal Parliament, people seem to be going to the polls all the time. It is a senseless and very cosdy procedure to ask them to vote twice for the Federal Parliament. The Committee also said: Separate elections also tend to emphasise the component parts of the Parliament at the expense of the Parliament itself. That is something with which I agree very much indeed. Of course, minorities do have rights. The honourable member for Curtin said that the present procedure allowed minorities to exercise a function in this Parliament. Because the Senate is elected by proportional representation those minorities already have a chance to exercise their proper function in this Parliament. It is a great surprise to me to see the members of the Opposition arguing for a situation which I believe is tending to denigrate the whole cratic system. People both on the extreme right and on the extreme left in Australian poUtics would seem to be trying to drag down the demodesire cratic process and to make it as inefficient as possible for their own simUar but at the same time disparate purposes. They are workmg from different ends but they are working to the same cause. I think that ought to be of concern to every member of this Parliament regardless ofhis polof itical party allegiance. It is hard to understand why the Opposition does not want to let the sense people decide. It is hard to understand why previous occasions and again on this occasion has put up a smokescreen of arguments about aU sorts of things which have absolutely nothing do with the Bill. The Opposition has been talking about aboUtion of the Senate. That is completely irrelconcerned. evant to the present debate. Members of the Opposition are talking as they did in the previous debates. I remember the honourable member for Moreton talked about the idea of having a uniMinister cameral system, that is one House of Parliament. I agree with that, but that does not mean it has anything to do with this Bill. The Opposition is constantly putting up a smokescreen of argusay ments which have nothing whatever to do with this Bill. The honourable member for Curtin is then talked aboutfirstpast the post voting. How on earth can that have anything to do with what we are talking about, which is simultaneous tions for the Houses of this Parliament? I believe that the referendum faued to be carried because him. the people were fed that sort of argument. They were told that in any case there was no need vote for it because a double dissolution would solve the problem. That is quite incorrect. The Opposition has been misleading the people putting forward those arguments. I believe that the people ought to have another chance to what they think about this matter. could then get into a situation in which this Parliament would run much better than it is at the moment. The holding of simultaneous elections would not affect the Senate's power in any way. I ask honourable members opposite to have a look at the report of the Constitutional Review Committee. I believe that the arguments put in it are ones with which this Parliament and all the parties in it ought to agree. The honourable member for Curtin ought to brush up on his law when it comes to constitutional questions, because section 57 of the Constitution has nothing whatsoever to say about or to do with the matters that he brought before the House.",42
83,Mr MCMAHON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We have demoheard the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Garland), who led for the Opposition in this debate, say that this Bill is connected with the of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) and a few other people to ensure that whenever there is an election for the House of Representatives there will be simultaneously an election for part or the whole of the Senate. We have looked at this proposal on many occasions and the people this country have knocked it back at a referendum. I cannot understand the poltiical common of the Prime Minister in again bringing foron ward such a proposal; because without doubt he it will be disappointed a second time. The people just will not vote for constitutional changes that to will have the effect of reducing the power of the Senate which will be to the Senate's disadvantage and to the disadvantage of this country the insofar as its administration and law are As I looked at this proposal I had to ask myself, first of aU, what explanation has the Prime given when he has come to this House on 3 occasions and tried to persuade us and the people of the country to vote for this kind of constitutional change. It is with regret that I have to that he has told us the minimum possible. In fact, he seems to be under the impression that it best to leave us in the dark. In other words, he probably thinks that when ignorance is bliss 'tis folly to tell this House of the Parliament or the elecpeople anything. He hopes that in our lack of knowledge, in our ignorance, we might believe into Very few people will believe in the Prime Minister after his escapades relating to the cables that were sent to our embassies or officials in by North and South Vietnam, which were shown to be totaUy different in substance and tone from say the impression he tried to convey to the Perhaps we Australian people and to us. The next point that I want to make clear is this: I do not believe in giving increased power to any government that has already indicated beyond any shadow of a doubt that it cannot effectively manage or adrninster the government of this country. Most of the Government's actions from the time it came to power shortly after 2 December 1972 have had unfortunate repercussions upon the people of this country and are working against their interests. Anyone who looks at any of the Government's activitieswhether they be in the field of employment, the control of inflation, defence, the effective management of our economy, open government, our international relations or a dozen and one other bills or administrative actions-is forced to come to the conclusion that the Government does not know how to administer the country; that it does not know the kind oflaws that the people of this country want and need; and that it does not know of the aspiration of the people of this country and their desire to be left alone. For that reason, if for no other, I would not give the Government any more power. In fact, it would be my intention to restrict its power by kicking it out as soon as I possibly could. The Prime Minister himself has in truth implied that it is not necessary to have simulhas taneous elections because only on 3 occasions have there been separate elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives. He had to go back 20 years before we started a process in 1953 and 1954 in order to find another example of but simultaneous elections not having occurred. Those are the only occasions on which there have not been sychronous elections. I do not think time has now arisen when we ought to have ultaneous elections. I must say that Sir Robert Menzies, one of the great poUticians of our age or, for that matter, since the days of Federation, even with aU his wisdom, skill and powers of suasion did not try to bring for the Senate and the House after 1954. When we have the precedents of a man with the abUity, the inteUect and the poltiical persuasion that he had, why should Whitlam, who is stiU learning, still trying to ape the great man and stiU trying make an impression, try again and show how faulty his judgment is Ukely to be? As you well know, Mr Speaker, there is one other point I should make. It is not necessary to hold simultaneous elections. The Prime Minister has 3 options open to him at the moment. He must hold a Senate election before 30 June next year; it wiU have to be held well before that if the people elected are to be ready to take their place in the Senate on 1 July. If he chooses, can take out when he holds an election, the whole of the House and part of the same time, but he will not do that because he knows very well that he is Ukely to lose government, and I think he Ukes the joys of office, being duchessed, and being able to enjoy the fleshpots, if one happens to be an active Prime Minister and likes the entitlement of going overseas. I wish that I had been able to enjoy some of those pleasures. But I was never able to do so during the time that I was Prime Minister. He can dissolve the House alone. The other alternative he has avaUable to him, if he wants to take it, is to have a double dissolution. He has got aU the options open. He can achieve his objectives, if he wants to, simply and easUy. We must probe a little deeper mto his thinking and ask why he wants to go on in this way. I think thefirstreason is that he believes that if the people are confused at the time an election for the House is held, he is more likely to get his way than he would be if they were properly informed. He now knows that he is on a losing streak. He is betting badly, his horses are running badly, he is running very badly and so are the Labor members of Parliament. So, if he can, he got to create confusion, because the more the facts are known, the more the tide will swing against him, the fewer votes he will get, the quicker he wiU go out of office and the longer he will stay out. I should say that not Mr Whitlam his successor will stay out of office because he would not be able to hold tight after defeat. His phUosophy was introduced by his own the Press officer. It was referred to by Oakes and simSolomon in their book 'The Making of a Prime Minister', published shortly after the 1972 election and in which they coined the phUosophical approach that an all day sucker a day will keep perthe mug electors at bay. That is the Whitlam together the elections phUosophy. Another way is to distract attention from the vital issues with which we are faced today and it is another means by which he hopes he can susto tain himself in power for a greater length of time. What he is doing is introducing a constitutional trick. It is a trick to employ constitutional practices and procedures and an attempted alteration to the Constitution in order to persuade the people that he is a technical expert on the Constitution and is worthy of governing this country. I do not believe that he has shown the capability. date If he had shown himself to be capable he would have had the guts and the courage to pull on an he election of the House of Representatives and, at first chance, an election of the Senate before 1 Senate at the July next year. We will see whether this man is worthy of the reputation for political courage that he earned when he was in opposition but which he has never shown since he has been in government. We will see whether he does it. I know that he has the capacity for crashing through when he does not quite understand party or public opinion but I do not beheve that his common sense will permit him to continue these crash tactics any longer. I turn to the Constitution itself. I must confess that I am a devout admirer of those who drafted the Constitution-the fathers of our Constitution-and gave us a legal framework that has been a confirmed source of protection in times of trouble and need. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know, as I know and as every other nonourabie member knows, that we profess to live in a liberal democracy. The essential constituents, ingredients and characteristics of a liberal democracy are certainty, continuity, a sense of responsibility not in the singular interests of a pohtical party, not in the interests of the Parliament itself, but in the long term national interests of the Australian people. I do not think the Labor Government today represents the long term interests of the Australian people, and I deny that it is operating and acting administratively or legally in their long term interests. The relevant secuon of our Constitution that deals with the Senate is section 7. It states: The Senate shall be composed of senators for each State, directly chosen by the people Parliament otherwise provides, as one electorate. , It goes on to state in the fourth paragraph: The senators shall be chosen for a term of the names of the senators chosen fied by the Governor to the Governor General. What does the Prime Minister intend by trying to amend those 2 paragraphs of section 7 of the Constitution? Thefirstpart of that section says that the Senate is to be composed of senators for each State. That expresses a constitutional concept in the clearest of language and means that the Senate is a State's House and is intended to represent the States' views, Changing this section necessarily means that the Prime Minister wants to whittle away the power of the Senate to reflect the views of the States. In its place he wants a trend more and more towards centralisation, more and more towards an autocratic system of government, and more and more towards the destruction of a liberal democracy, which is the very heart and soul of the Australian political system today. The Prime Minister also wishes to turn away from what I regard as two of the essential features of democracy. The first one is the separation of the powers of the legislature, the Executive and the judiciary. Bit by bit it is the Executive of the Government, rather than the Parliament, that is attempting to dominate this country. Fortunately, on several occasions the Caucus of the Australian Labor Party has overruled the Prime Minister, giving him a good solid prod in the part where it hurts most and depriving him of the opportunity to display his vocal powers in Caucus. The most recent example was in regard to the wool stabilisation proposals.",43
84,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Mr Martin Order! I remind therighthonourable gentleman that this is a very fairly narrow Bill. He seems to be traversing a fair amount of ground going away from the Bill.,45
85,Mr MCMAHON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Sir, we have a slight difference of opinion about that, but I accept your ruling. Senators are at present chosen for a term of 6 years. What does the Prime Minister want to do? Why does he want to alter the Constitution so that senators must submit themselves for an election whenever there is a House of Representatives election? I know that superficially there are some attractions in such an approach. But on deep analysis and with a knowledge of parliamentary life in this country gained over a long period and with a knowledge of what my predecessors in the office of Prime Minister have said, I of the State, voting, until the have to say that we should not change that provision, because it can be contrary to be best interests of the people. These proposed changes six years, and would remove an essential safeguard. for each State shall be certiThere are two other points I want to deal with in relation to the question of parliamentary responsibility. Not only is the Senate a States' House, it is also a House of review. And according to those who wrote 'The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth', Quick and Garran, there is a necessity to ensure that the Parliament itself, whether in the House of Representatives or in the Senate, reflects the mature and long term views of the Australian people. Let us lookfirstof all at the Senate as a House of review. Nobody who thinks or cares about the Australian people can doubt that the Senate, particularly since 1972, has acted with the highest sense or responsibihty when dealing with the many measures that have come before it. The amendments it has made to so many draft laws have meant that the draft laws have come back here to the House ofRepresentatives as betthat ter law and better representing Australian national views than they did when they were up from this House.",45
86,Mr DUTHIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They have come back,46
87,Mr MCMAHON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Do be a good boy. You will government. not be here long. The Government parties have lost Lance Barnard and the honourable member Government for Wilmot (Mr Duthie) will be with him soon.,46
88,Mr DUTHIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I will be here longer than you.,46
89,Mr MCMAHON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Al lright,but please do not interject. I refer to such matters as the Racial Discrimiate's nation Bill, the attempts to gerrymander the torate in order to sustain an authoritarian system of democracy; and various Constitution Bills that were knocked back by the Senate and the people. I now want to refer to 'The Annotated Constiprevail tution of the Austrahan Commonwealth' by Quick and Garran in relation to mature judgchange ment of the people and the obligation to sustam the long term interests of the Australian wise electorate. At page 988 we find this statement: A Constitution is a charter of government; trust, containing covenants between the sovereign communityI emphasise those words because sovereignty truly resides with the people, or shouldand its individual units. Those covenants should lightly or inconsiderately altered. At the same ume tuuon which did not contain provision for its amendment with the development, growth, and expansion of the community which it is intended to govern, would be a most equate and imperfect deed of partnership. It would doomed to collapse ignominiously, and without hope reconstruction. The authors go on to say that those 2 ingredients must be combined and that the Constitution should be a hving organism changing as necesstheir ary to meet environmental changes. Above all there is a necessity to ensure that when consideris ing changes you must always ask yourself the basic question: Is the change in the interests the Australian people or not? 1I have no doubt that on a mature view this proposed change we are considering would be ner contrary to the interests of the Australian people. I ask one other question: Why did the fathers the Constitution provided that there should 6-year term for the members of the Senate? It was to ensure that the Prime Minister Government of the day could not intimidate or blackmail members of the Senate by threat of a double dissolution or by any other means when exercising their constitutional powers, to ensure the Senate is a States' House reflecting the views of the States and a House of review having sent all the qualities and power that a House of review needs to express the mature view and the long term attitude of the Australian people to constitutional change and the business of I finish on this note: I would not give the any more power and neither would the greatest politicians of our time extend power in the way envisaged in this Bill. I want to ensure that the Senate can act independently and in the best interests of the Australian people. For those reasons I will do what I can to sustain the Senprestige and power and to prevail upon the elecAustrahan people to support our action against this Bill. And to repeal an Act of Parliament should it be passed, when they have, the chance to vote on it at a referendum. I will do all I can to upon the people to continue to do what they have done so frequently, that is, not to the Constitution in a way that will react against their interests. The people are much too to do that. It is high time the Prime Minister understood that the people of this country have the wisdom and the will to knock back legislation it is a deed of they do not Uke.",46
90,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION," I would Uke to compliment the right honourable member for Lowe (Mr MCMahon) on his very excellent analysis of the consequences of this Bill not be being passed by this House today and to endorse a Constiwhat he said. The Government just cannot take the law into its own hands. It just cannot thumb inadits nose at the Australian electors and expect the be people of Australia to sit back passively. The of honourable members who are trying to interject obviously do not believe in democracy and that the people in the electorate who cast any sort of a vote count for much. No doubt the people in electorates are told by them when they go back into their arena that the Government really concerned about their point of view. Yet this Bill, probably more than any other piece of legisof lation that this Government has introduced, is in the category of having been submitted to the Australian electorate and, having been scrutinised by the Australian electorate in the manin which it felt the legislation deserved, and having been resoundly defeated. It is important of that the people of Australia recognise that what be a is happening is that the Government is just thumbing its nose at a decision given by them as or the recently as 18 May 1974. In only one State was the number of votes in favour of the proposed law greater than those against it. That was in New South Wales. There the vote in favour was less than the informal vote-abou t 30 000 votes as against 40 000 informal votes. In every other State there was a majority against this law being passed. The overall majority against it was about 400 000. Yet the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), showing the arbitrary manner in which he treats the decisions not only of the Parliament but also of the Australian electorate, now again introduces the Bill and says: 'It is identical with that introduced by me on 11 February 1975 and I shall not again put forward the reasons which led the Government to re-submit this legislation.' In other words, having had a signincant vote cast against him and having faUed in hisfirstattempt to persuade either this Parliament or the people of Australia that he wasrighton that occasion, he now decides that he will treat the people and the Parliament with complete contempt and re-submit the measure for another referendum. He says that he does not accept the argument which the Opposition advanced and which the Australian community accepted, that this legislation disturbs the balance of the relationship tween the 2 Houses of the Parliament. The Prime Minister says that it will in no way damage the independence of the Senate nor will it alter the Senate's present role. It is not for him to say. Four hundred thousand Australian electors more than those who supported the Bill said that his argument was wrong. Whatrighthas he now to come forward and say in a 2-page second reading speech: ' I am not prepared to go through the arguments again. I have given them once. Too bad for you. I am going to submit it again referendum.' What arrant hypocrisy! One needs to look at what the motivation of retainthe the Government might be and this is the matter that on which I principally want to noon. It seems to me that things are bad in the the other type Australian Labor Party. We have upon crisis over the last few weeks. First we saw not only was the House ofsupporters a very uncertain relationship between the Ministed ter for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor) and the Treasurer (Dr JF CAIRNS). Then it turned out that not only did the Treasurer not know anything about what the Mmister for Minerals and Energy was doing but also the Prime Minister did not know. When asked questions in this this House about the background to a certain bordefeated. rowing escapade by the Minister for Minerals and Energy the Prime Minister demonstrated that he knew absolutely nothing about it. That shows that the Prime Minister either was not interested or had insufficient concern about that type of borrowing.",46

93,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They are not my dictates. The Standing Orders are fairly clear that the debate must be concerned with the Bill before the House. The honourable member is slipping away from the Bill.,47
94,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I accept that. It is important that we look at this Bill because we need to see why the Government is introducing it. It is true that whUst the Government has demonstrated its lack of competence in borrowing moneys one week, a Bill for the accelerated introduction of another referendum might seem atfirstglimpse to have little in common with that. I am seeking to show that the Government is moving from crisis to crisis. This would seem to be a way by which it is trying to avoid the consequences of normal democratic elections and by having a Senate which is able to sit in judgment upon it. beThat is what this Bill is all about. It is about the maintenance of the parUamentary system. It is about therightsof the Senate to adjudicate on laws which it decides are unjust. I wanted to raise that matter and I want, very briefly, to talk about some other events. First we had the borrowing escapade, then we had the wool debacle and now we have the whole of the uncertainty of who's who in the leadership of the Labor Party. Today we are debating another referendum to Bill. The crises within the Government seem to be pushing it into a position where electoral change is the only basis on which it can hope to office. I am sure the fruits of office are such Government will seek, by whatever speak this afterment says: possible, means are to retain them. The Govern'We have a mandate on this, that and of legislation that we have seen crisis introduced'. Government forget that Representatives elecon 18 May but so also was the Senate. Obviously they have not only forgotten that the Senate was elected on that date but also they have forgotten that an identical referendum to that which we are now discussing in connection with Bill was also submitted to the Australian on 18 May 1974 and was resoundingly electorate I do not want to go over the detaUed arguments. However, I think it is necessary that I do say that under the Australian Constitution there is already an opportunity for the government of the day to have simultaneous elections. Not only is this a measure to reduce the power of the Senate, it is also a measure designed to ensure that the Austrahan Constitution will be arbitrarily changed so that there will not be available to the Government the option which is now available to it. The Government can have simultaneous elections. The Prime Minister can call the Senate and the House ofRepresentatives out at any time he wishes-and well the members of this chamber know it. In other words there is no point in introducing this Bill, unless there is some hidden reason. The Government can have simultaneous elections. The Government is in a position, thanks to the constitutional powers that are accorded it by sections 12, 13 and 32, to ensure that House of Representatives and Senate elections are held at an identical time. The Government does not seem to be interested in the present provisions of the Constitution. Why? Presumably because Government supporters are quite certain that if they submit their case to the Australian people in the normal course of events the Australian people will not be prepared to accept that case. That, of itself, is sufficient reason for this measure to be thrown out. The National Country Party of Australia is concerned that there should be an opportunity for the Australian community to vote, where necessary and where desirable, on referenda of national interest. It is not only totally opposed to such an accelerated resubmission of a proposal so recently rejected by the people but also it is opposed to this Bill because it obviously is intended to lessen the power of the Senate, the one chamber of this Parliament which at the moment is protecting the interests of the Australian community, if the decisions of recent weeks are to be taken as any indication. We are also opposed to this Bill because no doubt it is another one of the processes of trying to ensure that the Australian community gives its permanent support to the Labor cause. In other words, honourable members opposite try to get simultaneous elections to reduce the power of the Senate not because they reaUy see the matter as urgent and not because the Constitution is inadequate but because they are intentionaUy trying to give to the Labor Government a security of tenure which its actions should deny it and which I am quite confident the Australian people equaUy will deny it the next time it goes to the polls. The National Country Party of Australia regards this Bill as unnecessary and repugnant and as a Bill which would significantly reduce the power of the Senate in relation to the House ofRepresentatives. It is therefore totaUy opposed to its passage. Question put: That the Bill be now read a second time. The House divided. (Mr SPEAKER - Hon. G. G. D.

Loans (Australian Shipping Commission) Bill 1975. NA DEVELOPMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 1975 Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 May on motion by Mr Uren: That the Bill be now read a second time.",49
96,Mr WILSON,URBAN AND REGIONAL,"This legislation is straightforward, and the Opposition at this stage indicates its support for it. The Bill is desigHewson, H. A. Hodges, J.C. ned to do 2 things: Firstly, it proposes to include as an item of funding a category of flood mitigation. The Schedule to the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act 1974, which this Bill seeks to amend, authorises expenditure on 5 types of program. The first category is urban expansion and redevelopment, which may include sewerage and water supply. The second is area improvement, being urban and regional improvement and rehabilitation. The third is sewerage. The fourth is water supply. The fifth is restoration, preservation and improvement of landscapes and buildings of special significance. Macphee, 1. M. Nixon, P.J. This Bill proposes to add a sixth item, namely flood mitigation, and to provide in the current year a sum of $450,000 for that purpose. It is to be noted that in the future the amounts of expenditure to be allocated to each ofthose heads will Sinclair, I. MCC. Staley, A. A. be dealt with as a budgetary item rather than by means of afinancialassistance Bill. We are told by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) that the purpose of including the head of flood mitigation is to enable expenditure on flood mitigation works in Brisbane. It should be pointed out, though, that the amount of money involved on this occasion will enable only a relatively small amount of work to be carried out in mitigating the sort of circumstances that caused the disastrous floods that occurred in Brisbane early last year. The way in which the Minister presented his second reading speech created the impression that this contribution would do a great deal in respect of flood mitigation work in Brisbane. The Opposition points out that all it will do is make some very small beginnings. It will enable some work to be done on the Enoggera Creek Dam-to raise the height of the weir there by some 20 feet - and also will enable some further flood mitigation work to be carried out in that area. The Minister has indicated that further of money will be made available in future years. The great need in the Brisbane area, of course, will be for an examination to be made of the priority that should be given to the construction of the Wivenhoe Dam. One of the difficulties that will be faced in making that decision will be problem of allocating priorities. This dam will be needed for 2 purposes: Firsdy, to provide domfor estic water supply for the city of Brisbane secondly, to act as a means of mitigating the flood danger that Brisbane may face in the to flooding. future. When one builds a dam for flood mitigation purposes, of course, one builds it on the basis that it will be kept partially empty so that can cope with the sort of flood that Brisbane perienced last year. But this is always a problem because the responsibility of keeping a dam tially empty competes with the demands of those who want to see a more adequate domestic water supply for a city such as Brisbane. Therefore, at this stage I want to draw attention to the difficulthe ties in allocation of priority and urge that matter be carefully examined in relation to bane and other areas where it is necessary that flood mitigation work be carried out. It might be said that the most effective measure for flood mitigation is not to build areas where there is any real danger of flooding. Of course, one must recognise that in cities towns that have already been built in places where a danger exists of flooding, flood mitiThis gation work must be carried out. It is to be hoped that in the planning and designing of new cities and the expansion of our existing cities, proper account will be taken of therisksof flooding in certain areas. It is to be hoped that development will take other directions so that the resources that are today in some areas-takin g the longments term view-in effect necessarily being period misallocated can do more to provide better mentioned. urban areas for people than is now achieved by having to reduce the danger that established areas face as a consequence of some earlier mistaken decisions as to their location. A provision in the Bill will enable the Minister and the Department to allocate funds in respect of other cities. One might well ask: How much is now contemplated as being needed for flood mitigation purposes in the development of Albury-Wodonga? I would hope that the point I have just been making will be given some attention and that a careful examination will be made of the proposed development works to ensure that they are not in areas that have any serious risk of flooding. To build new urban areas on locations which could be subject to flooding is sums only to demand expenditure in the future to reduce thatrisk.Albury-Wodonga is not a place, as the Minister would well know, that is free from flooding. Only late last year the Hume Highway in Albury was cut. In the city of Wagga, not far away, substantial areas of its urban disthe tricts were seriouslyflooded.No doubt the provision in the Bill enabling the allocation of funds this purpose will now enable the Minister and and, the Department to look at other cities which have at present developed areas that are subject A further difficulty that arises in looking at the it question of the allocation of resources for flood exmitigation purposes is where to draw the line. When is a flood a natural disaster and when does parit involve something which should be regarded as normal expenditure by way of provision in the establishment of that urban area? I am sure that this will cause some difficulties in definition in future as the extent to which the flood mitithis gation work to be carried out under nnancial Brisprovisions of this legislation is examined. The other objective that this Bill seeks to achieve is to vary the terms under which moneys can be made available to the States by way of in loans. Under the present legislation loans for sewerage purposes can be on terms not in excess and of 40 years for repayment, and for other works on terms not in excess of 30 years for repayment. Bill seeks to remove that limitation and to enable loans to be made for such period as is negotiated from time to time.It is noted by the Opposition that the Act now requires the Minister to table any agreements he enters into. At the present time, the Parliament and the country know that the Minister cannot enter into agreewhereby the term of the loan is for a in excess of those periods which I have It is to be hoped that if the Minister plans to change the policy as to the terms ofloans he will do so in a way which will enable the Parliament to comment on and understand the implications of such a change in policy. It is true that the Minister can table the agreement but, of course, that is after the event. Comment can be made on future agreements but not concerning the agreement that is currently being tabled. We recognise, however, the need to change the law to provide the Minister with greater flexibility. The need arose in a special way. The House is well aware of the developments that are taking place in Albury-Wodonga. When the first Act of Parliament was passed in respect of funding development in the Albury-Wodonga area provision was contained in that legislation that also limited the period over which the capital funds could be repaid but when the Albury Wodonga agreement was entered into there was a provision in that agreement signed by the governments of Victoria and New South Wales and the Australian Government whereby in the event that the funds of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation were insufficient to enable it to repay the capital sums when they became due the amount then due could be tacked on at the end of the loan period. Legal doubts were expressed as to whether such a roll-over provision was in infringement of the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act which this Bill now seeks to amend, the suggestion being that the effect of the agreement entered into with the States enabled the loan to be repayable over a period of more than 40 years in respect of sewerage works and in other cases over a period of more than 30 years. So this Bill seeks to remove that limitation in respect of the future. The Bill also contains a special provision relating to the Albury-Wodonga assistance legislation for advances made in respect of the current financial year so as to exempt them specifically from doubts that may have arisen about the legislation as it reads at present, so those advances can be rolled over in the event of the receipts of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation being insufficient to meet liabilities as they arise. I note that the Minister not suggesting that the original Albury Wodonga Development (Financial Assistance) Act be amended. I understand that the reason for this is that the amounts of money involved are relatively so small that neither of the States, New South Wales and Victoria, is concerned about its ability to repay. I am also informed that in a number of the agreements entered into in respect of loans made out of the $258m that was made available under the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act 1974, where there is a provision for the tacking on ofan amount payable at the end of the loan period when payment cannot be made on the due date, there is a special provision which it is hoped will overcome the legal doubts that have arisen. As to the future, of course, the proposal in the Bill now before the House should remedy any defects and remove any doubts, thereby enabling the Minister to enter into an agreement of the sort entered into in respect of Albury-Wodonga. I shall conclude with regard to this point by emphasising again the request I made earher that, in the event of there being a substantial change in lending policies so far as the terms of loans are concerned, the Minister will make an announcement and indicate to the House and to the nation the nature of that change. It has become an accepted practice that a sewerage loan be of a 40-year term and that other loans be of a 30-year term, having in mind that many of the assets which are developed as a consequence of the loan moneys have a limited life. It would be of very grave significance if there were to be a major change in the terms under which loan moneys were made available because if, in respect of an asset that has a life of 25 to 30 years, the loan term were extended to, say, 60 years, future generations would be paying for an asset which had seen its useful life. I note from the expressions of the Minister that he is aware of the point that I am making and I look forward to healing his comments later in the debate and hope to receive from him an assurance that any major policy change in this regard will be drawn to the attention of the House. Although this Bill deals only with the 2 specific points which I have described, it is an amendment of a piece of legislation that approved the expenditure in the currentfinancialyear of $258m and I do want, in conclusion, to touch that very briefly on the implications of that. As the Minister would recall, last week I asked him a question arising out of the paper that he tabled with the Budget papers at the beginning of this is financial year. In that report the following statement appeared: The total outlay on the programs of the Urban and Regional Development Ministry is expected to increase by $266.7m, or 160 per cent, to $433.7m in 1974-75, following the increase of $87.7m in 1973-74. This rapid build-up in expenditure can be expected to ease in subsequent years as the new programs begun in 1973 become established. The best available estimates of the implications of present plans, not allowing for price changes, are that increases in 1975-76 and 1976-77 may be of the order of $206m (47 per cent) and $94m (15 per cent), respectively. I do not propose today to touch upon the great implications that such a real increase in the expenditure of one department would have when taken in the total Budget context. What I want to raise is the problem that confronts State governments, local governments and semi governmental authorities at the present time. That problem arises because of the fact that last year they too had this statement which I have just quoted drawn to their attention. Many of the programs undertaken by State governments, local governments and semi-governmental authorities with funds provided under this legislation are programs that take time to develop, and if there is to be a serious change in the resources available and those available to any particular program, it is important that those involved with the planning of those programs receive as early notification as possible. One is constantly amazed at the inefficiencies that develop because of the annual budgeting of programs that are necessarily for periods longer than 12 months and the bunching of expenditure that occurs immediately before the conclusion of the financial year because of the necessity to spend it before 30 June, and then the starvation in terms of available funds in the first few months of the oncomingfinancialyear. This distorts the allocation of resources and results in urban development costing more in real resources to achieve the same result than would be the case if the programs could be developed at a steadier pace and with a consistency over a period longer than 12 months.",49
97,Mr UREN,URBAN AND REGIONAL,They all have supply.,52
98,Mr WILSON,URBAN AND REGIONAL,"It is true, as the Minister Urban and Regional Development says, that they all have supply, but if there is to be a nificant change in the availabiUty of funds in forthcoming year, it is important change and the programs to be altered should be indicated as soon as possible, because the planning necessarily would have taken place upon the basis of the indications given last year. If as the Minister pointed out in his answer to question, he is faced with the problem of connumber vincing his Cabinet of the priority to be placed on the programs that he is advancing and if he unsuccessful in achieving the level of resource location that was pubUcly indicated in the Budland; get Papers last year, the sooner he can let authorities who are carrying out urban developgreen ment know of the change in the aUocation of resources, the more efficient wiU be the developpopulation ment of their programs. There will not be this sudden stop-start aspect of their programs which is expensive and mefficient in its operation. In conclusion, I should like to say that we in the Opposition recognise the great importance of improving the standard of our urban areas and ensuring that those new and developing urban areas are developed to a standard that is acceptable. We place great importance on local government, semi-government authorities and the States having the resources avaUable to them to enable them to achieve a standard of urban development that will meet the aspirations of the Australian people. But we want to make sure also that the funds that are made available preserve for local government and for State governments, not only the responsibility to administer, but the responsibUity to make decisions with respect to those matters that properly fall within the area and scope of their responsibuities. Insofar as this piece of legislation will give some greater flexibUity in making funds available to the States for urban development, we support this legislation and we support the inclusion of the provision of funds for flood mitigation purposes as well.",52
99,Mr LAMB,URBAN AND REGIONAL,"The Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Bill, as correctly pointed out, sets out to amend the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act 1974. It does so in 2 significant respects. Firstly, it sets out to adjust the terms of the loans under the financial agreements with the States. The House will recall that under sections 3,4 and 9 in the Schedule, the Act provided $258,398,000 in loans. This included $124,750,000 for urban expansion and redevelopment; $13,500,000 for area improvement, being urban and regional for improvement and rehabilitation; $110m for sewerage; $4,400,000 for water supply and a sigfurther $5,748,000 for restoration, preservation the and improvement of landscapes and buUdings of that that special significance. I particularly wish to refer to growth centres as that is the major aspect of the umbrella legisnow lation. Our program for growth centres aims to my encourage the rapid development of a small of regional growth centres as desirable alternatives to existing cities. This involves the is operation of a development corporation with the alfoUowing functions: To acquire and develop to provide service headworks; and to carry the out both strategic and detailed planning for field urban developments. Development corporations are also responsible for attracting and industry to the centres that they manage. The role of a development corporation involves much more construction work than land commissions. A development corporation should also generate demand by making the particular growth centre an attractive alternative to other urban areas. As the House knows, our major growth centre program is Albury-Wodonga. As correctly pointed out by the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) it will take time for the centres to develop and it will be difficult for the corporations to estimate accurately the rents, charges and other income that they wish to generate. It will be difficult for such corporations to set such rents and charges at a level which will give them income to service the loan from the Australian Government. The Australian Government, through the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren), built into the 1974 Act a form of loss guarantee which would cover this situation. But during the discussions on the terms and conditions of finance for our programs of development of the urban fringe and in growth centres, the States sought assurance from the Government that terms and conditions offinancecould be reviewed after an initial period. We agreed to this. The long term nature of those programs is such that flexibility will be required in the initial stages. To achieve thisflexibilityand to satisfy the States, we included in clause 5 (3) of the Bill a provision to review the operation of these agreements. But the States believe and, I understand, even received legal advice-o r that was the information given by the honourable member for Sturt-that the intent of section 5, subsection (3), of the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act was overruled by section 7 of that Act. Section 7 of the Act provides: (1) Subject to this Act, where iinancial assistance under this Act is provided to a State by way of loan, the State shall. (a) repay the loan in period, not exceeding(i) in the case of a loan in respect ture in accordance with a program relating to the matter specified in item 3 in the Schedule-4 0 years after the date on which the loan was made; or (ii) in any other case-30 years after the which the loan was made, I tliink a few comments about this provision are in order. Although we do not agree that these sections are inconsistent, or contradictory-the legal draftsmen certainly did not think so-w e have agreed to resolve the situation by replacing paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of section 7 of the Act with these words: (a) repay the loan in such manner, and within such period, as are specified ance with which thefinancialassistance is provided. That brings the provision into line with the new agreement under the umbrella Act. I think a few comments about the co-operative approach in which this amendment was agreed upon also are in order. It is a further example of the underlying co-operative effort between the Minister for Urban and Regional Development and his State counterparts in the various State governments. The original Act for thefirsttime set the seal on the concept and function of cooperative federalism in Australia. It allows the Australian and State governments to get together in co-operative measures to improve the quality of life in Australia. For far too long laissez faire or ad hoc attitudes have dominated the thinking of Australian governments in the area of urban and regional development. These defects have distorted the distribution of the good things of hfe which should be available to all of our people. The great merit of the Act, which this Bill seeks to amend, is that for the first time the resources of Australia were marshalled to provide national strategies and national programs. Indeed, it was thefirstattempt by an Australian government to recognise the national character of the problems of the cities. But, moreover, in particular it allowed the Australian Government to join State and local authorities in planning and implementing programs with a broad national perspective. In other areas, the States have been a little tardy in signing agreements with the Australian Government to set up the machinery to put these programs into operation. For instance, the Australian Government proposed that each State establish a land commission or some other body with powers to acquire and develop land. These bodies would operate within the existing adminsuch a manner, and within such istrative framework of the different States. Their activities would be mainly the acquisition and of expendirelease of large areas of land which would be ready to be put to urban use. The Victorian Government as late as May last year agreed to establish an urban land council. It was expected that $16m would be made available to Victoria date on thisfinancialyear. I understand that $3.5m of that amount would be used to purchase open space on the Mornington Peninsula in order to preserve an area which is of conservational and recreational significance to the whole of Melbourne. The balance of the funds would be sufficient to purchase some 850 hectares ofland for urban residential development in Melbourne in preferred growth areas. Exactly 12 months have passed since that iniin the agreement in accordtial agreement was reached between the Minister and the more progressive elements of the Victorian Government. I believe the delays have been caused by internal arguments in the Victorian Cabinet between the more conservative elements, which we see repeated in the Opposition here, and the more progressive elements which join the Minister and the Government in wishing to develop a quality of Ufe at a price in which the average earner can participate and which will enable him to purchase for himself. The latest announcement is that the Victorian Government has again agreed and is prepared to sign the agreement. I hope that comes about before the end of the financial year. It is a very thing to hear this news because it means that thousands of land seekers wishing to purchase their homes will be able to obtain land at a far cheaper cost to themselves and at a saving of thousands of doUars in each case. But final acceptance which, as I said earUer, is essential before the end of this month is symptomatic of the conservative States in many aspects. Co-operative federaUsm apparently depends on a one way flow of funds from the national Government to the State governments. Examples which are quick to come to mind are sewerage, land commissions, area improvement programs and so on. In this case it is not hard to understand why the State governments have readUy agreed, not only because of the persuasiveness and co-operative nature of the Mmister but also because of the flow of funds to the various State governments. Another example is Medibank. After a poltiical barrage and dispute lating several years and combined with several non-Government organisations-admittedl y parties to the scheme-the State governments have accepted Medibank. They have accepted the medical side because it is law and the hospital side because it means an increased flow of funds. If there is no money involved or if it means a loss of State generated revenue in favour of national benefit the spirit of cooperation disappears. I think this is nowhere more prominent than in the issue of conservation and preservation of the environment. A case in point is Fraser Island. Any mineral or environment poUcies in Australia are essentially based upon co-operation between a national government with powers over export licences and State governments which have the power to issue rnining Ucences. The State governments have as their sole prerogative and responsibUity land use in Australia. In the case of Fraser Island the mining leases or Ucences were issed by the Queensland Government. Of course upon this was built the expectation that DUlingham-Murphyores Minerals, the company involved, would be able to go ahead. The Australian Government and the Minister for Minerals and Energy, who is responsible for issuing the export Ucence, are forced to fulfil that expectation and obligation. I give this example because it shows that our environment policy is sound and consistent but it falls down if we cannot gain State co-operation. In aU their calls for a cut in government spending the conservative States and the Opposition avoid declaring where their cuts would be made. good Why does the Opposition not state that it would Uke to see a cut in government expenditure in the area of urban and regional development? I think the answer is fairly clear. First of all, the Opposition is frightened. It knows that if it is to win government, if it is to take over the benches from the current Government, it will need to secure votes in the outer suburbs of Sudney and Melbourne. So they are afraid to declare cuts in government expenditure which would increase the quaUty of Ufe. They are afraid to announce cuts of a direct flow of funds to their State counterparts-the conservative State governments. More kindly- I think the shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Stun falls into this category- I believe that some members of the Opposition recognise that the quaUty of life does not depend upon the income of the individual. He cannot buy his way out of bad planning, out of a smog-filled environment or out of a traffic jammed city. The quality of life depends more upon where one lives. The answer must be a community solution- a social or a national approach. Co-operative federaUsm, when successful, is carried out against a barrage of criticism that each government $1 increases the Budget deficit. Each claim for $1 is shadowed by a criticism of increased government expenditure. The States and the Opposition cannot have it both ways. They must acknowledge that State government expenditure must have the same impact as national government expenditure, whether their income is derived from their own sources or from the Australian Government under section 96 of the Constitution or whether the spending program is their own initiative or pan of a national program-par t of the Australian Government's nationally accepted responsibility. Co-operative federaUsm impUes an end to ad hoc or piecemeal derision-making and a start to national planning for the environment, for the cities, for the country and for our economy. One aspect of the national program forms the second feature of this Bill that seeks to amend the Act. The Australian Government poUcy statement 'A National Approach to Water Resources Management' which the Mmister for Environment (Dr Cass) tabled in Parliament in October sets out a broad framework and a series of objectives for a balanced approach to water resources management. One of the stated objectives is 'to encourage the zoning of flood prone land, with a view to its orderly management. Such zoning and management must of course be carried out in the context of the regional development framework and take full account of the overaU social, economic and environmental requirements of particular districts and the nation as a whole-'. This Bill wiU provide $450,000 for flood mitigation works on the Breakfast-Enogerra Creek in Brisbane which urgently requires attention before it can be incorporated in the national water resources program. The urgency is obvious. The 1974 flooding cost 11 Uves and probably was the most serious of the four or fivefloodingssince 1950. The honourable member for Sturt may decry the additional funds provided in this Bill, but action to lessen the tragedy offloodsmust be taken on aU fronts, of which flood mitigation is just one. In conclusion, I compliment the Minister for Urban and Regional Development and the Government on continuing their national responsibUity in the areas of urban and regional development and water conservation.",52
100,Mr DRURY,URBAN AND REGIONAL," I wish also to compliment the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) for introducing this Bill which provides $450,000 to be spent during the current year on flood mitigation works in the Ryan Federal electorate in Brisbane which I have the honour to represent. This proposal, as the Minister has pointed out, represents the first contribution from Canberra for flood mitigation in urban areas of the States. It will tainly be a boon to a large number of residents who for years have suffered considerably whenever very heavy rain has faUen. It is good to have the Minister's assurance, subject of course to Uamentary approval which I have no doubt will be readUy forthconung, that further funds will be made avaUable in future as the work proceeds and as the need arises. I regret that the joint move has been so long in coming to fruition. The loss of Uves and the serious damage to many homes in Brisbane during the devastating flood of January 1974 are still fresh in the minds of all who suffered. The proposal to make a substantial sum avaUable for flood mitigation is a very important in the right direction. I know it will be warmly welcomed, especiaUy in those areas that have been affected most. I should Uke also to compliment the Queensland Government and the Brisbane City Council on the joint arrangement which I understand has been made. It is the result of a good co-operative effort which deserves warm commendation. For years negotiations have been proceeding at all levels of government and repeated representations have been made by me and by State and municipal representatives. Some public meetings have been held, particularly in the Enoggera district. On such occasions as my parUamentary duties have aUowed I have attended these meetings, along with other pubUc representatives. I believe that our joint representations to the various authorities concerned have helped to reach the present stage. People Uving in the flood prone suburbs surrounding Enoggera Creek for years have lived in fear of the loss and damage that the next cyclone season or the next heavy storms would bring. Of course there are other areas besides Enoggera Creek that are also badly affected from time to time. It will be most reassuring to the long suffering citizens in these areas when the Parliament passes this legislation, as I am sure it will. The commencement, and more especially the completion, of these much needed flood mitigation works will be looked forward to keenly and will help to reheve many anxious minds in the areas. I have much pleasure in supporting this Bill.",55
101,Mr OKEEFE,URBAN AND REGIONAL,"As the previous speakers have said, this Bill provides for two main changes in the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act 1974. The first is the provision of an additional $450,000 to be spent on flood mitigation works in Brisbane in the 1974-75financialyear. In the second reading speech of the Minister for Urban cerand Regional Development (Mr Uren) it was indicated that further funds will be made available in future years as the work proceeds. Of course this has to be with parliamentary approval. This paris the first major Australian Government contribution to urban flood mitigation. Although this may be a small beginning we feel that it is extremely urgent that urban flood mitigation should receive considerable assistance because over the years urban flooding has caused considerable losses throughout the length and breadth of Australia. It has been said by some people that the additional allocation in the legislation will mean an increase in the already large Government Budget step deficit which may be considered undesirable in the current inflationary situation. But I would agree with other honourable members that this program is of such importance that this sum should not be regarded as too great cumstances. The indication given in the reading speech that more funds will be provided in future years means that the Queensland Government can commit itself to long term flood mitigation projects, but as the amount of future assistance is unspecified it may face problems drawing up a long term flood mitigation prorather gram. By providing assistance for flood mitithefinancialassistance. gation works the Government will be helping reduce losses from future floods and hence of the burden of public disaster rehef which it might otherwise have to bear. Over the years the Paterson electorate, which represent in this House, has seen some very astrousfloodingin the towns of Muswellbrook and Singleton and in the City of Maitland. I no doubt that this Bill will pave the way in the future for urbanfinanceforfloodmitigation these towns that I have mentioned and indeed many other towns right throughout the length and breadth of Austraha. So it is a measure which, in the main, we support. It is interesting to note that in the United completely States of America the Government different approach by subsidising flood insurance for people Uving in identified prone areas, tied to incentives to encourage use poUcies which would Umit buUding in floodprone areas or allow only elevated flood-proof construction. If communities which have been identified as flood-prone by the Government did not satisfy the buUding requirements, the individual residents would be ineligible to buy flood projects insurance at the subsidised rate, that is, US$0.25 per $100 or 0.25 per cent, with the Government paying about 90 per cent of the actual cost. Neither would they be eUgible for disaster relief should afloodoccur. A stronger incentive over the long run is that residents in flood-prone areas would be unable to obtain any federal or the federaUy-assisted loans for new construction mortgages on existing buUdings unless they had flood insurance. At present,floodinsurance cover in Australia is generaUy unavaUable or, where it is avaUable, only at very high cost from private insurers. However, the proposed Australian Government Insurance Corporation wiU be undertaking natural disaster insurance, possibly in the near future, and there is no doubt that we need natural disasmember ter insurance cover in this great country of ours.* The United States example shows that future government assistance for flood mitigation may be unnecessary if incentives are tied to governmentfloodinsurance to encourage more responsible use of flood plains. It is something that in the circould be looked at here. second * See personal explanation, page 3436. The second part of this Bill provides for a more flexible approach to the terms of loans made by the Government to the States, and for the terms to be defined in thefinancialagreein ments made with each State on each project than in the general legislation providing Of course, under the to Urban and Regional Development (Financial part Assistance) Act 1974 loans had to be repaid within a period of 30 years except in the case of loans for sewerage projects which were over 40 I years. The change provided for by the Bill will i dis- >ermit the Government to defer repayment of oans if the relevant projects faU to generate have sufficient income to meet the repayments when they fall due. I notice that in the Bill specific in reference is made to the Albury-Wodonga in regional development scheme in which the Australian Government is co-operating with the New South Wales and Victorian Governments. Many of us on both sides of this House are not in favour of this type of development has taken a local governmentsdampen because it could the enthusiasm of those their own areas. Be that as itanxious which are may, to develop the AlburyfloodWodonga complex is under way and everyone land would want to see it become a success. By aUowing changes in the terms ofloans to be made directly in thefinancialagreements with the States, the Government will be able to give consideration to the circumstances of in each State. This will refer not only to the Albury-Wodonga complex but also to any other projects of a simUar nature throughout Australia. I have no doubt that if this complex is successful there will be others, such as the scheme for the Orange-Bathurst area. However, the proposed changes would not be necessary if Government considered that the projects for or which it was providingfinancialassistance would be viable and able to earn sufficient income for the loans to be repaid within the time specified. The proposal to change the Act would imply that there are some doubts about the viability of projects in terms of generating money returns as opposed to providing social benefits.",55
102,Mr MORRIS,URBAN AND REGIONAL," I should like to join with the previous speaker, the honourable for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe), in some of his remarks aboutfloodmitigation work. In common with him, I have very strong recollections of the damage caused by the Hunter River in parts ofhis electorate and in other parts of the Hunter Valley. I can recall what used to be a regular sequence of property loss and damage caused by the Hunter River. I can recall in 1955 the severe hardship and damage that were caused by the Hunter River, particularly at Maitland. I can recall during those floods going to the area with teams of community workers to assist in repair work and in the recovery of homes and people's possessions. I think it is appropriate to say that the New South Wales Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission has done some very good work in controlling and directing the course of the Hunter River. It has carried out control measures which since 1955 no doubt have saved a lot of hardship and loss of property which otherwise would have occurred through severe flood damage. I welcome the remarks of the honourable member for Paterson in respect of the Australian Government Insurance Corporation. He seems to have comprehended one of the things that we were trying to get across to the Opposition in the debate on the legislation concerned with the Corporation, and that is that there is a need for national disaster insurance. There is a need to provide across-the-board protection for people who are Ukely to be the victims of floods and of other natural occurrences over which man has no control. I am pleased to have the opportunity to supsupplies, port this Bill which seeks to amend the Urban and Regional Development (Fmaneial Assistavoidable ance) Act 1974. There is no need to recapitulate the stories about loss and personal hardship occurred in the aftermath of the Brisbane floods in early 1974. Suffice it to say that much of the property damage-no t to mention the loss of human Uves-coul d have been avoided with irrigation. closer control over buUding and development approvals. The Minister for Environment (Dr Cass) has stated on other occasions that flood plains are for floods. This fact should be borne strongly in mind in all land use planning schemes. The funds to be provided to the Brisproject, bane City Council under this amendment to the Act will enable flood mitigation works to be carply, ried out on the Enoggera and Breakfast to prevent property damage and loss of life should there be in Brisbane another flood of the magnitude of the tragic flood of last year. to emphasise the pomt made by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Drury) earlier in the deapproached bate, namely, that the $450,000 to be provided under this amendment to the Act is being matched by the Queensland Government way of a non-repayable subsidy or grantremarkably whatever one cares to term it. So, 40 per cent the total cost, or $450,000, will be provided by the Australian Government, 40 per cent of the total cost will be provided by the Queensland Government, and the remaining 20 per cent of the total cost will be provided by the Brisbane City Council. Despite the claims of opponents of the Australian Government about the infringement of State rights by this Government, this legislation is a shining example of the co-operation and coordination between the 3 levels of government in our nation that can develop and that do exist. It is an example of the results that can be achieved when problems confronting the community are approached in a true spirit of co-operative federalism, which has been promoted so staunchly by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) who is presently sitting at the table. He has been outstandingly successful in promoting a spirit of co-operative federalism in relation to the responsibuities ofhis portfolio. When this Government came to office, one of its early decisions was to set about developing a national approach to water resources in lieu of the previous piecemeal system of providing financial assistance to the States for water resources management. This sum of $450,000 from the Australian Government should be seen as the first instalment of a future capital works program to improve the quantity of water to improve the quality of water supplies and to prevent property damage at times of unfloods. The Australian Government has asked aU States to submit a 10-year program that for water resources development. This will include not only urban projects concerning urban water supply and flood mitigation but also rural projects concerning flood mitigation and Those 10-year programs are coming in readUy and the Australian Government will be examining them and allocatingfinancialassistance on the basis of national priorities. In the interim urgent projects such as the one now before the House, the Breakfast Creek/Enoggera and the one which was approved some months ago in respect of the Adelaide water suphave been undertaken to try to alleviate the Creeks existing conditions. Reference is made in the principal Act to land I wish commissions. A level of harmony and cooperation can be achieved when problems are in the true spirit of trying to find a solution and when they are approached by all levels of government. Again the Department of by Urban and Regional Development has been successful in this area. Land comof missions have been established in 3 States and the stage has been reached that urban land councils are now operative in South Austraha, New South Wales and Western Austraha. I understand that agreements with Victoria and Tasmania are shortly to be signed. Under that program there will be a direct flow of finance from the Federal Government to State governments to assist in providing additional home sites based on the cost of acquiring and developing those sites rather than on whether there is a profit incentive to make home sites available. We hear constandy of the need for local government to receive assistance from the federal purse. Last week the Opposition mentioned that 5 per cent of federal income tax revenue should be directed to local government. I do not support the proposal of a flat percentage. At least it should be looked at a lot more closely before we set a flat percentage figure. But through the Department of Urban and Regional Development, through its recognition and co-operation with local government and the State governments, there is aheady a direct flow of funds from the Federal Treasury right down to the ground level of local government. I wish now to look at the establishment of the regional organisations. I mention the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe) and myself in respect of the Hunter Valley and I point out the success that has been achieved by the Hunter regional organisation which embraces 15 councils in the Hunter VaUey, covering geographicaUy almost the whole of the Hunter Valley. In that organisation there are 5 urban or semiurban councUs, with a clear majority of the population of the Hunter VaUey, and 10 rural councUs.",56
103,Mr UREN,URBAN AND REGIONAL,"Thei r progressive leadership should Armitage, J. L. be commended.",58
104,Mr MORRIS,URBAN AND REGIONAL,"Wit h progressive as the Minister points out. Almost complete harBowen, Lionel mony has been achieved by the members of the Bryant, Hunter regional organisation. As I pointed out, Cameron, ten of them are from rural areas and five are Child, G.J.L. from urban or semi-urban areas. The problems Clayton, of the region have been approached properly Cohen, B. and responsibly by the regional organisation on Collard, F.W. the basis of what is best for the region. Tbis in Connor, itself evidences a very large step forward for Crean, F. local government, because if the community is to Cross, receive the services it needs right down at local Davies, R. government level in terms of community facUiDawkins, J.S. ties, better roads, better drains and better kerbEnderby, ing and guttering-thing s as mundane as that the personnel of local government must be preFry, Fitzpatrick, J. pared to look beyond their own councU area. The Fulton, mechanism provided by the Department of Urban and Regional Development and the Australian Government, through the regional organisations, gives them the opportunity to do that. I would Uke to pay tribute to the Hunter regional organisation for its forward thinking and for the spirit of co-operation that exists between those 15 councUs. I put that forward to the House as an example of what can be achieved by people in local government and by the 3 levels of government in this nation when all concerned get together, face up to the problem and look at ways of solving the problem, not with a view to trying to obtam some cheap or quick political mUeage but rather in providing solutions that are best suited to meet the community need. I commend the Bill to the House.",58

109,Mr CHARLES JONES,AYES NOES," Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation. Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Railways (Tasmania) Bill, as they are related measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of both Bills to be discussed in this debate.",60
110,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES NOES," Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering both measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",60
111,Mr NIXON,AYES NOES,"The Bills we are debating are the Railways (South Australia) Bill and the RaUways (Tasmama) Bill. The purpose of the BUls is to give legislative effect to the takeover of the rural raUway services in South Australia and both the metropolitan and rural services in Tasmama along the lines set out in the papers tabled in the House several weeks ago entided 'Principles to Govern the Transfer of the non-metropoUtan South Australian RaUway system to the Australian Government' and 'Principles to Govern the Transfer of the Tasmanian Government RaUway System to the Australian Government'. The Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) pointed out in his second reading speech that there is a constitutional provision in relation to these measures, namely, section 51 of the Constitution, which gives the Australian Parliament power with respect to: The acquisition, with the consent of a State, of ways of the State on terms arranged between the Commonwealth and the State. The Minister made the point that this proposal was considered worthy enough by our founding fathers to be included in the Constitution. He then made this odd comment: The transfer of the State railways to the Australian Government has been portrayed by the Opposition as a centralist and socialist measure. I do not know who wrote his speech for him. The Bill certainly is a centraUst measure- I would not quibble with that description-bu t to describe the transfer of a raUway system from a State-owned instrumentality to a Federal-owned instrumen1975 tality as some form of socialist measure makes Second Reading the mind boggle a Uttle. The Minister went on to talk about the need for a government with a national outlook. We have heard this fine rhetoric from the Minister before. He said: . . . Australia has had to wait for a Government with a truly national approach to transpon problems before the vision of the framers of the Consutution could commence to be realised. The Minister not only aimed his attack at the previous Government but at previous Labor governments which also had not seen the need for this measure to proceed in this way, as will be demonstrated later. As for this being a Government with a truly national approach to transport, I do not believe for one moment that the taking over of the rural services of the South Australian raUways, or indeed the taking over of the Tasmanian raUway system, can be described in any way as a massive national approach when compared with the great raUway standardisation program that previous Liberal-Country Party governments undertook over previous years. The Minister pointed to what he beUeves are the major problems that have flowed from the decentralised control of raUway systems under present arrangements. He referred to such matters as the dupUcation of facUities and administrations. That is an extroadinary complaint when one looks at the provisions of this Bill which will maintain staff at the present levels. Indeed, they cannot be reduced. Operation costs obviously will not be reduced by staff reductions because there is provision for all staff to be taken care of under this Bill. The Minister then talked about the inefficient operating procedures at present in the State raUway systems. I think that raUway workers throughout New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland would love that attack on them. He also talked about the poor utilisation of avaUable any railresources but he did not give any example. He referred to the Umited standardisation of equipment and the lack of a uniform approach to railway poUcy. He totally ignored the fact that the raUways commissioners of the various States had been meeting and overcoming these problems. They have been doing so for a number of years and have been reducing the area of conflict between one raUway system and another. Some of the complaints the Minister raised do have a measure of currency but the fact is that there have been tremendous achievements as a result of the raUways commissioners meeting over the years. I doubt that the passage of these Bills will stop the commissioners from meeting and going properly about their affairs as they ought to The Minister then pointed to some of the techexpressionnical difficulties relating to trains and another as a reason for the Commonwealth taking over the State railway systems. One of the rationalise these services thatbyare examples he gave was that there are more different designs of car carrying waggons. I think tacking the poor raU services in those before that only 5 States are involved in carrying cars train, so it must be more than just coincidence way, that there are 9 designs for such waggons. I the Commonwealth suspect it is something to do with the cars themselves, their size, their length, height and breadth. I suspect that an over simplified apagreement proach, as the Minister pretends, cannot be itical taken. He then talked about the changing of train crews and the remarshalling of trains at State borders, saying that this wastes both time and resources. This argument has some appeal but I tliink a closer examination may demonstrate that the change of train crews coincides with the comface. pletion of their working hours for a period. As excuse for the transfer of these rail systems Minister used such a thing as the fact that hand brakes are located in different places on freight waggons used on different systems. Indeed, stooped to using the small problem of shunters steps on waggons from different systems varying in height, design and location on the waggons. Some of these may be important, some of them may even be costly, but they scarcely justify the expenditure by the Federal Government of excessive $200m for the takeover of the South Australian and Tasmanian railway systems. Many inquiries have been held into the rail erations of the various States. One of the most comprehensive and recent ones was the Bland Committee inquiry, the report of which was tabled in the Victorian Parliament last session. certainly pointed to much more major reasons than those which I have just read and which were advanced by the Minister for Transport as his reasons for taking over the State raUway tems. In the Bland Committee report there reference to the use being made of a number of raUway stations in country areas and of a incapable number of raUway lines in the areas and of the spirited-an need for some rationaUsation of some of these provided services. They are the major reasons put up by result the Bland Committee for a change in the raUway consequent system. The Minister has said that this Bill provides specifically that little change can flow out of the I takeover by the Commonwealth of the State raUsimplification ways because clause 9 specificaUy requires agreement of the State Minister to any proposed closure of Unes or reduction in services. To old expression- I do not know whether it is pardo. Uamentary but it is a well known Australian I think the Minister has been conned. Here is in one State ter takes overa situation the State where the Federal MinisraUway systems, advancing the argument that only so doing can he in poor shape. than 9 We have heard him make speeches States. atHe by advances the argument that there is only one and that isforcentraUsed control, and that has the answers. Clause 9 specifically requires a State Minister's to any such closure. Imagine the polsituation that will occur in South Australia when the Federal Mmister for Transport tries to close down a line or a raUway station that has not been used much. Of course his colleague in South Australia will refuse to agree to such closure and the Minister will be left with a lot of egg on his It seems to me that all the advantages in this an respect Ue with the State Minister. Again, the the Australian National RaUways may recommend a change of fare structure in Adelaide and there may be a great poltiical row. Clause 8 says that he where general fares,, freight rates and other charges at the commencement date have estabUshed a relative advantage to the users, that advantage shall not be diminished. I do not know how the Federal Minister for Transport expects to restructure either the fares or freight an rates in South Australia whUe that clause remains. As I said, it seems to me that the Minister at the table has been conned into accepting this proposal. It seems also that all the advantage opUes not with the Federal Minister or with the Australian National RaUways, which will find that its proposals will not be able to be proceeded with because the Minister has fallen It into the trap set up by these clauses. In his second reading speech the Minister spoke about the problems existing between the 2 sysStates and the practical differences between one was raU systems and another. He said: It is no wonder then that the railways were basically of coping with increased capital costs and the d mainly united and co-ordinated-competitio n by the road hauliers and freight forwarders. As a freight has been diverted to inadequate highways with economic and social costs to the community as a whole, in the form of higher road maintenance costs and the human misery and personal financial burden road accidents bring. can say only that that is a gross overof the facts. Indeed I find the the whole speech somewhat oversimplified. Certainly it wiU lead to high expectancy from both use an the users in Tasmania and the users in South Australia. I do not believe for one moment that the Minister will be able to satisfy that expectancy. I beheve that that extract from the speech makes the Minister look just a little foolish. He ought to know that within a State door to door operations by road hauliers are much more economic than the use of rail. Take the situation of a manufacturer making a product who can put the product on a truck and send it 100 miles across country to the point of delivery. The product would be handled only twice-at the loading stage and the unloading stage. Compare that with the requirement to use rail, if such a requirement were introduced. The product would have to be loaded on to a road haulier, then put on a train-whe n the train turns up, that is-and finaUy sent to its destination to be unloaded again on to a road haulier for deUvery to the consumer's door. Obviously that is an expensive and inefficient operation. Within the States a great deal of that circumstance prevaUs. Yet conversely in interstate haulage, raU has increased its volume of carriage of freight immensely. The Minister should know that road hauliers themselves demonstrate the capacity of raU to carry large volumes of freight on long haulage because they hire a great number of rail trains-complet e trains as I understand it-for example, on the Sydney to Melbourne run. RaU can and does compete under these circumstances more effectively, favourably and indeed economicaUy with road. Later in the second reading speech the Miniscontrol ter went into his usual expansive attitude to Government actions in respect of transport. He the Uving example of the old adage that success has a thousand fathers. He talks about how the Government is implementing the Tarcoola-AUce Springs raUway program, the Adelaide-Crystal Brook program and even the urban transport program. Not one of those programs was tiated by this Government; they were all initiatedperhaps by the previous Liberal-National Country Party Government. All poUcy decisions in respect of them were taken by the previous Government. Mr Charles Jones-That would be more. humourous if it were not so untrue.",60
112,Mr NIXON,AYES NOES,"It is a pity that the Minister cannot reaUy have a win on one of these This is the first Bill- I compUment the Minister-in which thefirstsingle initiative of a Labor Government in the transportfieldis seen that is sensible and that was not proposed and prepared to be implemented by the previous Government. Of course, it is more to the phUosophy of the Labor Government than it would be to a Liberal-National Country Party Government. This is a poUcy of centraUsm. If follows very closely the Unes that have been taken by the Minister and the whole of the Government. So one can expect this sort of initiative, this new centralist initiative, to be expanded by this Government. As I have said, it is about the only decent initiative-if one can call it decent; it is the only initiative, perhaps I had better phrase it that way-that I have seen taken in the transport field by this Government that was not taken by the previous Liberal-National Country Party Government. It is the later statement in the Minister's speech that Ifindthe most fascinating. He says: One may ask why the Government does not just provide the States with sumcient funds to bring their railways up to an acceptable standard; I must admit this solution has an elementary plausibility in that it would appease the States. But it would be a denial of our responsibihty to the railways and the people of Australia-that awesome responsibility that accompanies the spending of public money. We cannot, and will not, divorce the responsibility of raising funds from the spending of them. That is a fine piece of verbiage, I must say. Inherent in the last part of that statement-'w e cannot, and will not, divorce the responsibUity of raising funds from the spending of them'-is obviously a proposal that this Government will set out to control the expenditure of all tax funds that are raised by the central government. Every member of this House knows that all taxation revenue comes to the central government. Is it the wish of the Minister and his Government to the expenditure of all the funds that are raised? I suggest that such a proposition is untenis able. The Mmister says in his speech that major transport projects have been subject to vigorous cost benefit analysis by the Bureau of Transport Economics. Has this proposal been subjected to analysis by the Bureau of Transport Economics? The Minister did not say that it had been, and I inido not recall seeing tabled in the House I have not been reading my mail correctly; there is such a volume of it these days-a n analysis by the BTE of the proposal to take over the South Australian and Tasmanian railways systems. Yet the proposal is costing $200m or Did the BTE in fact make such an examination? programs. Mr Kelly-As k him again.",62
113,Mr NIXON,AYES NOES,"I think he is a bit deaf at times. He does not wish to hear. If I could divert from the BUls just for a moment, let me say that it is rather in line with the Minister's proposal that 40 per cent of imported oil should be carried in Australian bottoms, or in Australian ships. The fact that that will cost the Australian consumer a minimum of some $12m and probably $20m, and a growing amount year by year because of the feather-bedding of Australian crews on Australian ships, goes by the board and does not seem to matter. I ask the Minister again: Was this $200m South Australian and Tasmanian proposal subject to a BTE cost-benefit analysis? Was the oil proposal subjected to a cost-benefit analysis? Mr Charles Jones-You are making the speech.",62
114,Mr NIXON,AYES NOES,I am asking the questions too. I am not getting much of an answer. I do not think the Minister knows. He is so unprepared for the debate on these Bills that he does not know the answer; so he tries to bluff his way through.,63
115,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES NOES, Order! The Minister will have his chance to reply. Will the honourable member address his remarks through me?,63
116,Mr NIXON,AYES NOES,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker; I shall be delighted to do that, as long as the Minister is able to answer the questions. That is really the key to the whole issue. Then the Minister stated: The South Australian Government has decided to retain the SAR metropolitan railways, ordinate all urban passenger transport under one authority. How does the Minister rationalise the difference between his approaches to raising money and spending it on the metropoUtan raUways and on the rural raUways? He said that he has the awesome responsibUity of spending the money, but apparently that appUes only to the rural railway sector. The fact is, of course, that Mr Dunstan, the Premier of South Australia, stood the Minister up and told him to go to some other place and play marbles, that in fact he would not get the metropoUtan raUways to play with. It might be part of the Labor Party's poUcy that main-line raUways be taken over by the Federal Government, but it certainly is not part of its policy to take over the metropoUtan raUways. I think it is quite clear that the Premier of South Australia has told the Minister to take his marbles some place else. Then the Minister told us: However, the staff to man the metropolitan systemthat is in South Austrahawill be ANR employees who will work under the general direction of the State Transport Authority. The Minister went on with thesefinewords: This means that all SAR employees will be transferred the ANR. This arrangement offers advantages for both the Australian National Railways and the State Transport Authority as it prevents duplication of manpower resources, personnel and training facilities. That is quite contrary to what the Minister said in his speech about 4 paragraphs before that. Then he went on with thisfinebit of verbiage: It also enables the employees of the ANR to continue to enjoy the social advantages of living in a large city as well as leaving the present career patterns of many railway employees unchanged. Apparently that is the Minister's excuse for not being able to secure the takeover of the metropolitan raUway system-and afineexcuse it is, I must say. The main reason for acceptance by the South Australian and Tasmanian Governments seems to be afinancialone. In practical terms, the iinancial inducements are lump sums of $5m to Tasmania and SlOm to South Australia, as well as a takeover of debts incurred by the railways over past years. The Minister made it quite clear that in his view there had been an unwillingness or an incapacity on the part of the States to incur the necessary capital outlays for adequate raUway development. He said: In recent decades, the increasing need for new capital investment in railways and the inability or reluctance of State governments to meet this need has magnified the difficulties resulting from this diversity of interests and approaches. He goes on to state: because it sees a need to coIt is no wonder then that the railways were basically incapable of coping with increased capital costs and the spirited-and mainly united and co-ordinated-competitio n provided by theroadhauliers and freight forwarders. There are a number of factors causing this position. It is certainly not just the States' inabUity or reluctance to meet the need for capital investment. For a start, the States have not had sufficient money tofinanceraUways either from their own resources or from federal grants. There is a situation in all States in which the raUways simply have to continue with certain uneconomic services in order to provide for essential community needs. It is obvious that any State government will be most reluctant to close down a well established service if the result is that hardship will be caused to too many people. AU States are faced with heavy maintenance costs for both roUing stock and track. They are also faced with large capital outlays to provide new roUing stock. Transportation planning is stUl so new as a technique that the long term benefits which would come from comprehensive State-wide integrated plans have not yet had time to become effective. State raUways and road transport systems have developed in comparative isolation from one another. This has made it difficult or impossible to eUminate branch railway lines in many to instances even though the service could be done more efficiently by road. In other words, the State governments have had no option other than to continue to provide some services at the expense of the community as a whole. It seems that rather than look at what appears to be the simple solution for development-that is, to hand over the responsibility to the Australian Government-it would be better to get down to long range development planning at the Australian Government and State levels. One of the effects of these BUls may be that the Australian Government will introduce road and other services incidental to raU services. Certainly there are constitutional Umits as to how the Australian RaUways Commission could go with such services. However, the Umits are not clearly defined so that it is possible to see conflicts arising and the imposition of certain services upon the States at the expense of existing undertakings. I hope that the Minister wiU pay true regard to the spirit of the amendment I moved to the Australian National RaUways Bill in respect of the bus and other road services witlun the States which should not be put into the position of having to compete with the Commission. Alternatively, the Commission should not pre-empt private enterprise in setting up a service which is considered to be ancUlary or incidental. WhUst no one can be certain just how far the Australian Government will go in setting up services related to raUways, I hope that common sense wiU prevaU and that proper use will be made of the estabUshed and efficient private road hauliers. What reaUy happens as a result of these Federal-State government agreements is that instead of a highly desirable central coordination with each State continuing to have the ultimate pohcy direction of its raUway service in its own hands, the Australian Government takes over full ownership and control. A significant aspect of future State development and internal management will be given away. The effects of this wiU spUl over into other areas of State adrninistration and planning. Long range State regional planning proposals which depend in any way upon raUways will be influenced by federal control and the Australian Government. The Australian Government wiU be put into the position of being able to acquire land for the purposes related to raUway development. In other words, significant areas of State admniistration and control are being given up. The long-term effects and full extent of direct federal power which can be imposed as a result of the agreements is not easy to predict. It seems that the proper way in which the Australian Government can best provide assistance in the overall rail transportation scene is in the interstate field. Itwould seem natural and proper that main trunk routes be handed over to the Australian Railways Commission and be operated by it. Country services within the States are essentially a State government matter because the State governments know the problems. As fbr metropolitan services, of course there should be no thought of Austrahan Government ownership and control. Indeed, the Bill concerning South Australia does not envisage that particular point. I want to draw particular attention to the difference between the deal, if we could call it far such, that South Australia got and the deal that Tasmama got. I trust that my colleague the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott) will be given time to speak to these Bills and that he will not be gagged, as is the practice of the Government. The number of differences-extraordinar y differences concerning financial and other impUcations-betwee n the 2 agreements has been drawn to the attention of Tasmania by Mr Bingham, the Leader of the Opposition in that State. I think that all Tasmanians would be wise to read his constructive approach to this matter. For example, he has pointed out that South Australia gets a down payment of SlOm whilst Tasmania gets only $5m. He says that the Commonwealth is taking over a debt of $124m in South Australia but in Tasmama the debt is $63m. He says that the Commonwealth is also picking up other South Australian debts in connection with raUways dating back to 1949. Added to this the Commonwealth is making $26.4m available to South Australia. Mr Bingham deals with this subject in some detaU. I know that my colleague the honourable member for Wentworth will deal with this matter in some detaU. But there is certainly no parallel between the 2 agreements. The arrangement with Tasmania is obviously an ad hoc one. I would think that the best deal that the Minister has been able to arrive at is certainly unsatisfactory from Tasmania's point of view. I would think that Tasmamans are hostUe and very unhappy about the proposals put forward. The Opposition holds the view that because the BiUs are the result of agreements between the Federal and State sovereign governments they should not be opposed. The Opposition believes that the State parhaments themselves should decide whether or not they are prepared to allow the central government dominate this important area of State activity. M i WALLIS (Grey) (3.57)- I rise to support .the Bills. Whilst the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) would not claim that the unification of Austrahan railways is his original concept I think that at least we are reaching the stage where this concept has been given some teeth and we are now proceeding to overcome one of our biggest hurdles, namely, the disastrous decisions of the last century to operate railway systems with different rail gauges. This hurdle was recognised even by our founding fathers who drew up the Constitution. They saw that there would be a need at some time for the Commonwealth to move into the field of rail transportation. That is why provision is made in section 51 (xxxiii) of the Constitution for the Australian Parliament to have power with respect to: The acquisition, with the consent of a State, of ways of the State on terms arranged between the wealth and the State. The RaUways (South Australia) Bill and the RaUways (Tasmania) Bill propose to give effect BUls to what was envisaged by the founding fathers. towards A few years ago the provincial city of Pirie, which is in my electorate, had 3 different raUway gauges-gauge s of 3 feet 6 inches, 4 814 inches and 5 feet 3 inches- a situation which clearly Ulustrated the difficulties. Since that the standardisation of the Broken HU1 to Port Pirie Une has done away with the need for the feet 6 inches gauge. The standardisation of line from Crystal Brook to Adelaide will, course, reduce the gauges to one. Port Pirie was unique in that it had 3 raUway gauges within the one raUway yard. Australia certainly has paid a price for of foresight by the colonial governments of the last century. The lack of a standardised raU gauge is probably one of the greatest hurdles that this country has had to overcome. The that we have different raU result of the insularity of the various colonial governments which looked on themselves as separate entities. They did not co-operate with one another and as a result this abominable disadvantage has been placed on us. Many thinking people certainly have done theh best over the last few years to try to come these problems. I know that the standardisAustralia ation of the Broken HiU to Port Pirie Une was carof ried out during the time of the previous Governas ment. The introduction of new roUing stock ideas such as bogie exchange has aUowed inter-system working where different gauges existed. But all the problems have not been overcome despite the fact that there has been some progress over the last few years and I think some greater cooperation between the various raUway authorities. We still have many difficulties to overcome. The Minister mentioned some of these difficulties in his second reading speech. Perhaps I could mention a few. They include the break of gauge itself, different types of rolling stock, different types of locos, different designs in the various systems, different signalling systems, and different forms of control in each of the States. An inhibiting factor in the past has been the jealousy between the States. These problems have all added to the Australian transport difficulties and have certainly retarded the development of this country. We would hope that with these 2 BUls we are starting to take a big step forward. One of the disadvantages with a country such as any railours is its smaU population and its large area, Commonand we cannot afford to go along with these problems much longer. The fact that the Minister has introduced these is a step in the right direction and a step the achievement of that goal. I am sure Port that honourable members on both sides of the House would like to see a standardised system feet throughout Australia. I would hope that we would aU agree that there should not be probtime lems at the State borders. Of course, for quite some time this Government has recognised the 3 problems that exist. I think these problems have the been recognised in the Labor Party's platform. of Since coming to power the Government has taken some quite positive steps to ensure that its long term aims are put into effect, at least in part. We have taken a number of initiatives since we became the Government. The previous speaker, the lack the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon), said that the initiatives for the standardisation of the Adelaide to Crystal Brook line and the new Tarcoola to AUce Springs line were inifact tiatives taken when the previous Government gauges has been the was in office.",63
117,Mr CALDER,AYES NOES,That is correct.,65
118,Mr WALLIS,AYES NOES,"The previous Government certamly did discuss these matters, but when the Labor Party came to power there was nothing on the statute book in relation to these raUway lines. overThere was no agreement with the State of South about the provision of these 2 systems trans-raU transport. It was not until such time the present Government came to power that the Mmister was able to successfully negotiate with the South Australian Government. The result is that both the projects are now in the course of being started. Those who had the opportunity a few weeks ago to go to Tarcoola saw the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) turn the first sod for the line from Tarcoola to AUce Springs. That was tangible evidence of the progressive moves of this Government. Prior to our coming to power there was difficulty between South Australia and the Commonwealth about these particular Unes. I know that the previous Minister for Transport and the South Australian authorities had discussed the difficulties for quite sometime.There were some problems in South Australia. The South Australian Premier wanted to ensure that at least the line which brought coal from Leigh Creek Coalfield would not be affected by any Commonwealth takeover because it was the Ufeblood of South Australia. These problems had not been resolved between the previous Government and the South Australian Government when the Labor Party came into office. It is a fact that once the Labor Party Government came to power it was able to negotiate successfuUy with the South Australian Government, with the result that these 2 proposals were able to proceed. As all honourable members are aware a start has been made on the Tarcoola to AUce Springs Une and the other line wiU commence shortly. On this question of the Australian Government taking over the State raUway systems, a few years ago both Sir Robert Asian and Sir Henry Bolte offered to hand over their State systems. Prior to the 1972 election the Prime Minister indicated that the Labor Party, if returned to office, would take up the offer to take over the 2 State systems, but when the Labor Party was elected to office and the offer to take over the systems was made to the States we found that we did not get any response from the Liberal States. The South Australian Government the Tasmanian Government and the Western Australian Government responded. Of course, a State by-election was held in South Australia. The Liberal-Country Party coaUtion came to power in that State and withdrew the offers that had been made prior to that time.Arrangements were more or less tossed aside and the Western Australian Government threw in with the other Liberal governments by not agreeing to a takeover of its raUway system. My own opinion is that if any State stood to gain by a Commonwealth takeover of its raUway system it would be Western Australia, but the people in power in that State allow their poUtics to colour everything they do including the decisions they take and because there was a Labor Government in Canberra at thattimethey withdrew all their offers. We will probably have to wait until a Labor government is returned to office in Western Australia before this matter can be taken up again. As to the proposed amalgamation of the South Australian raUway system with the Australian National Railways, the South Australian Minister for Transport and the Federal Minister for Transport have held a number of conferences on this subject and I have had the opportunity of taking part in some of them myself. I know that they successfully thrashed this proposal out and agreement was reached. I am sure that after the discussions with the Australian Minister for Transport the South Australian Minister went away quite satisfied with what was achieved. Under the agreement the ANR will take over all the non-metropolitan railway systems of South Australia. This created some problems for the South Australian employers but both the State and the Australian governments were able to approach the major unions involved, the matter was thrashed out and agreement was reached not only on the question of the conditions of employment and whether employees under the State.systems be disadvantaged but also who would be the employer. It was determined that all employees of the South Australian railway system would become employees of the ANR. An assurance was given that in any amalgamation the employees would not be disadvantaged in respect of wage rates, long service leave, seniority rights in some cases and superannuation. Under the agreement although employees of the South Australian system wiU become employees of ANR they will work under the control of the South Australian Transport Authority mainly because of the necessity for that body to have control in co-ordinating other forms of transport in the metropoUtan area of Adelaide. Under this arrangement the State authority will be able to co-ordinate road transport with rail transport. I think this is reasonable, although the employees wiU be under the direction of the Australian National Railways Commission. There will be union representation on the Commission. Therefore the interests of the employees will be taken into account in any decisions of the Commission. The very fact that a union official is to be appointed to the Commission means that the interests of union members will be looked after. There are probably stUl some problems to be thrashed out. It will take some time to sort them out. These problems probably lie at the union level. Sometimes they lie at the management level but I think that if there are any problems everybody concerned will sit down in a spirit of co-operation and thrash them out to everyone's satisfaction. The closure of country railway lines is a matter of particular interest to me because I know that employees of the South Australian Railways, particularly those in that part called the Lincoln Division, have some concern about their future position mainly because of the competition between rail and road transport. The line never was really first class. Quite some money has been spent on it in recent years but the employees are still concerned about their position. But I am very glad to say that the Minister has stated that, as the line is there, it will continue in operation. Minister said in his second reading speech that before there is any closure of any lines the South Australian Minister for Transport will have a say, more or less, in any decision that is made. I certainly hope that this does take place because there are some Unes in South Australia that, if there were an assessment of them, I doubt whether it would be decided that they were viable Unes to keep in operation. I should Uke to refer now to how this Bill dovetaUs in with general Government poUcy. Our policy is that we should adopt a national transport system in a poUcy in which each major form of transport fulfills the task for which it is best suited. This is only logical. There are plenty of areas where goods can be carried much better by road transport than by raU. Also, in bulk carriage, there are many items, such as coal, iron ore and simUar types of things, which logically can be best carried by raU. I do not think that road transport can in any way compete with the raUways in the bulk cartage of cargo. But there are other areas, of course, where road transport can compete successfuUy with the raUways. I think it is our policyMrFisher-Where?",65
119,Mr WALLIS,AYES NOES,"Where the characteristics of a particular form of motor transport are used to theij best advantage. There are just a few matters on which I should Uke to conclude. The honourable member for Gippsland mentioned that there are 9 different types of motor car carrying wagons on the Australian raUway systems and that those wagons might be for 9 different types of vehicles. From my knowledge of raUways I thirtk that this would be incorrect. Most of the car carrying vehicles on the Australian raUway systems are basicaUy similar in design, but different. I think the width between the wheels of a motor car governs the design of car carrying vehicles. I think they are all standard in that respect and that a Holden, a Ford, a Valiant or any other vehicle can be put on them. But the fact is that they are aU different in design and they are all different in such a way that sometimes they cannot be used on other systems; the) have different braking systems and so forth. So I do not tiiink the comments of the honourable member for Gippsland on that were quite valid. The honourable member made reference also to the urban transport system in Australia. I understand from the Minister for Transport that previously, when the honourable member for Gippsland was the Minister for Transport, the States did approach the Commonwealth The Government to get the Bureau of Transport Economics to carry out studies on urban transport and how it could be improved. Despite these approaches to the Liberal-Country Party Government these matters were resisted. It was left until the Labor Government came to power before any positive moves were made in this field. I think we have seen the result of this delay, just as we have seen the problems that have arisen with the raUways in Australia over the last few years. There are insufficient raUway vehicles to carry the stock that is offered and, as a result, the raUways lost many millions of dollars last year. One of the actions of the present Government was to decide to provide 1300 new raUway wagons to be loaned to the States, with the provision that, if more were required, further consideration would be given. I think that the best thing that has ever happened to the raUway systems of Australia was the election of the Labor Government in 1972. I hope that such projects as the Tarcoola-Alice Springs raUway and the Adelaide-Crystal Brook standardisation, will link up every capital city throughout Australia. Also, 1300 new wagons will be provided for interstate use on the establishment of the Australian National Railways Commission. All these matters augur well for the transport industry and are a credit to the Minister who introduced them.",67
120,Mr ELLICOTT,AYES NOES," I rise in this debate as the Opposition spokesman for Tasmania in the House of Representatives. I rise to support the Opposition's attitude to the RaUways (Tasmania) Bill which is, because it is a Bill to implement an agreement between 2 sovereign governments-the Commonwealth Government and the Government of Tasmania-that the Bill should not be opposed. It is, of course, an historic debate because it represents the Australian Parliament's first intrusion into the running of State raUways. Therefore it may be an occasion which the Australian Parliament could well live to regret when it comes to consider the growing deficits that appear in raUway operations over the years. However, let us be optimistic and hope that in the corning years the deficits will grow into surpluses. Let us hope that there will be an efficient railway system in this country. Of course the Bill in relation to the railways Tasmania can only come into operation if an of the Parliament of Tasmania approves it. The current position in Tasmania is that the Upper House will not pass the Bill because it takes view that Tasmama has not got as good a deal this matter as South Australia has and therefore it has sent the Tasmanian Government off to the Australian Government to see if it can get some better assurances. Perhaps for that reason it would have been better had this debate not proceeded. However, no harm can really be done to Tasmama by proceeding with the measure beagain, cause, as I say, it is a Bill operation on the approval of the Tasmanian Parliament-a n approval that has not yet been given. However, what should be of grave concern to this Parliament and to anybody interested in Tasmania's rights are the reasons that have parently caused the Upper House to request Government of Tasmama to obtain further asare surances from the Australian Government in relation to the Agreement. This concern of the Tasmanian Upper House arises out parison between the 2 railways agreements, namely, the Tasmanian agreement and the South Australian agreement. Both are the subject of this debate, and I do not wish to repeat at railways. length what the honourable member for the Gippsland (Mr Nixon) has said already both Bill, provides: with clarity and vigour in relation to the matter. But I wish to refer to the differences as it may be of assistance to honourable members and also to the listening public to consider shortly what the main points of difference are between the 2 equal Agreements. I think we need to emphasise those the matters which indicate that Tasmania really is which not being adequately protected by the existing standards Agreement. The main points of difference are: remainder First of all, Tasmama is transferring all its railways of States ways, whereas South Austraha is transferring only its non-metropohtan railways. In the Australian Principles of Agreement, there is following provision: The Australian and State Governments agree that a separate metropolitan rapid transit system in South Australia is a desirable long-term objective and initiated to establish the technical a complete or partial separation between the systems. No such provision is contained in the Tasmanian Principles of Agreement. No such undertaking has been given by the Commonwealth Government to enter into any inquiry or to give any consideration to the introduction of a rapid transit system into Tasmania's 2 large cities-Hobar t of with a population of over 140 000, and LauncesAct ton with a population of over 70 000. Tasmanians may well think that surely Tasmania is entitled to a similar guarantee. Again clause 8 of the the South Austrahan Agreement as set out in the in Schedule to the Bill requires the Commission to maintain in general, fares, freight rates and other charges at levels comparable with those applying in other States and requires that advantages already given in relation to fares, freight rates and other charges are to be maintained. Obviously, this is a most beneficial provision. But, it is not included in the Tasmanian agreethat is dependent for its ment. Tasmania, under its agreement, is to continue to subsidise any concessional rates. Why is there this discrimination? Is it perhaps indicative of the fact that there is a relatively strong Government in South Australia and a weak one, perhaps an apabysmally weak one, in Tasmania? Why should the Tasmanians be disadvantaged in this way? Why not honourable members representing Tasmanian seats in this House pressing for some change of this agreement in order to put Tasof a commania in a better position? Another matter of difference relates to the differences in the standards of operation of the Clause 7 of the Agreement, as set out in Schedule to the Railways (South Australia) The non-metropolitan railwaysThose are the ones taken over by the Australian Government: . . . shall be operated, on and after the commencement date, in accordance with standards in all respects at least to those obtaining at the date of the agreement, and Commission will pursue a program of improvements, it considers to be economically desirable to ensure of service and facilities at least equivalent, in general, to those at any time current in respect to the of the Australian National Railways and the railother than South Australia. South In other words, the South Australian nonthe metropohtan railways to be taken over by the Commonwealth will not be run any less efficiently than the railways in any other States. Clause 9 of the Agreement relating to South that studies will be Australia says: and economic feasibility of (1) The Australian Minister will obtain the prior agreement of the State Minister to(a) Any proposal for the closure of a railway line of the non-metropolitan railways; or (b) The reduction in the level of effectively demanded services on the non-metropolitan railways, and failing agreement on any of these matters the dispute shall be determined by arbitration. I turn now to the Railways (Tasmania) Bill, in the Schedule to which is set out the Agreement relating to Tasmama. What do we find in clause 6? This clause provides: When so requested by the State, the Australian Minister or his delegate will consult with the State on matters regarding the operation of the existing and new railways within the State which the State considers to be of concern to Again, why is Tasmama not entitled to the maintenance of standards at the level existing elsewhere in Australia? Why is it disadvantaged? We might well ask: Is it again the result of a strong Government in South Australia or a relatively weak one in Tasmania? Is it because representation in the Government from Tasmama is not pressing sufficiently for Tasmania'srightsin relation to this very signincant acquisition of Tasmania's property? Let us look now at clause 5 of the Principles of Agreement relating to South Australia. The clause provides: The Australian Government will agree to construct operate a rail connection to the container terminal Harbour and to improve and where necessary replace the main line to Murray Bridge in order to ensure a high dard service to the growth centre at Monarto, subject evaluation by the Bureau of Transport Economics these to be economically desirable. One can search the Tasmanian Agreement or Principles of Agreement, but there is no such provision for Tasmania. There is no agreement to give to Tasmania therightto have particular lines constructed, even though there must situations in Tasmama simUar to those covered in South Australia. Other provisions Ulustrate this discrimination. For instance, clause 11(8) of the South Ausat traUan Agreement provides: The Commission will transfer to land within the State which suant to this Agreement and purposes. I turn to clause 10 (5) of the Agreement relating to Tasmama. What do wefind?The sub-clause states: Australia or the Australian Commission will give to the State the right of first refusal in respect of any land to be vested in the Australian Commission pursuant to this agreement and no longer required for the purposes of Australia, the Australian Commission, or any other Authority or Instrumentality of Australia, on such terms and conditions as shall be agreed between the patties, and having regard to the basis on which the relevant Commission. In one case the Australian Government has agreed to transfer free of charge to the South Australian Government land which it does not require. Tasmania has no such guarantee. It may get it free of charge, but it may not. All Tasmania has by way ofrightis arightoffirstrefusal. So again we find a distinct disadvantage to Tasmania in this agreement. There are other provisions. For instance, the South Australian Government has therightto appoint to the Australian National RaUways Commission a part time representative for 2 consecutive terms of 5 the State. years. Under the Tasmanian agreement the Tasmanian Government can appoint a representative for only one term of 5 years. Why is there a difference? Why is South Australia to have greater representation than Tasmania? In relation to the Australian Shipping Commission the Tasmanian Government is given the right to appoint a representative to that Commission for one 5-year term. In view of the fact that the Railways Commission is such an important body one wonders why Tasmama is Umited to a single 5-year term. It is in this situation that wefinddifferences between the 2 agreements on a very vital matter. and I am only pointing out ways in which Tasmania at Outer seems to be disadvantaged when compared with stanSouth Australia in relation to the agreement. Of to course there are other differences in relation to showing amounts which the honourable member for Gippsland has mentioned. Tasmania gets $5m the whereas South Australia gets $10m by way of grants. In relation to South Australia, debts totalling $ 124m are taken over whereas the debt in relation to Tasmama is $63m. This difference be may be explained by other reasons. It may be that calculations were done on a different financial basis. I must say in fairness that what superficially may be open to criticism may turn out to be not so great a disadvantage to Tasmama as it first seems. However, there are unexplained differences infinancialmatters on the face of the the State free of charge agreement. is vested in the Comnussion puris no longer required for railway As to the other differences, these are matters which it appears the Tasmanian Upper House requested the Tasmanian Government to take up with the Australian Government. I have pointed them out. I trust that the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) who is at the table will give consideration to these matters. Perhaps in his speech in reply he will indicate his wUlingness to give some assurance to Tasmania that it will not be disadvantaged when compared with South Australia in relation to these matters and that land was vested in the Australian Tasmania will be on an equal footing with South Australia. Another matter which has caused concern is the fear on the part of many people in Tasmania that the intention of the Government is to intrude into road transport. The Minister stated in his second reading speech on the Railways (South Austrahan) Bill: . . . in the debate on the Australian accepted an amendment proposed by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) relaung to the ancillary services that the Commission can engage in. The definition of 'services' contained in clause 1 of the Agreement has been drawn with the honourable member's amendment in mind for it defines 'services' as 'services including passenger freight road services that are or are operated in association with the non-metropolitan railways'. The Minister in his speech which relates to both Tasmania and South Australia was referring to a specific provision for South Austraha. of the Railways (Tasmania) Bill provides: On and after the declared date, the Australian mission may(b) construct and extend railways in Tasmania in ance with the Agreement and administer, maintain and operate railways so constructed or extended services (including passenger and freight vices) incidental or supplementary to, or associated with, those railways. Those words have a very wide meaning. They would enable the authority, the Austrahan sition. National Railways Commission, to undertake road transport in Tasmama in such a way that was not merely incidental, in the sense that some goods were being transported and had to be taken to a close destination because most of their journey had been by rail; it could encompass activities which would involve the Austrahan Railways Commission engaging in road very transport to a considerable degree. Having mind the Minister's second reading speech, one assumes that that is not the intention of this legisState. lation. It would be of grave concern to those are engaged in road transport in Tasmama if their businesses were to be the subject of petition from the Commission. I do not beheve that the Tasmanian Labor members of this afternoon House would support the Australian Railways Commission engaging in competition with road hauliers in Tasmania and putting many people out of business. One looks to the Minister, in Ught of his second reading speech, to assure this House that it is not the intention of his Governgauge. ment that the Commission undertake large road haulage activities of a business character in Tasmania. I conclude by repeating the Opposition's attione tude to this Bill. We regard it step by the Austrahan Parliament to enter into the field of the acquisition of State railways. At the same time, because it is an agreement between the governments of Tasmania and Austraha, we see no proper basis on which the Bill ought to be opposed. It should be passed. On the other hand, we can have only mild optimism National Railways Bill I whether the venture will be successful. Many people hi Tasmania think it is a retrograde measure which will put the raUways into the hands of people who are distant from their concern. Let us hope that the Australian Railways and Commission, when it takes over the raUways of incidental or supplementary to, Tasmania, will show that concern which is just as close as it has been in the past and as it would be with a concerned raUways commission operated by a State. However, that is stUl to be seen. Clause 10 Mr DUTHIE (WUmot) (4.32)-The Opposition takes a very strange attitude to this Bill, Comstranger than most of its attitudes which are straight out opposition to legislation which we put to this Parliament. I think there is a fair accordamount of poUtics intermingled with its attitude or motivating its attitude to this Bill. After all, and Tasmania will get approximately $80m over the road sernext 10 years under this agreement. No Opposition would want to go to Tasmania at election time and say that it opposed the Bill in this Parliament. That would be disastrous for the OppoSo apart from the beginning and the ending, we get a highly critical and analytical it speech, by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Elhcott). I would expect it from him. He said: 'We will support the Bill. We see no real reason to oppose it', yet he spent 20 minutes telling us how crook it is. I cannot really understand the Opposition's attitude. He talked about the important contribution to the debate in the in Tasmanian House of Assembly last week by Mr Bingham, the Leader of the Opposition in that Mr Bingham criticised the relative assistwho ance to South Australia and to Tasmania. But he forgot to tell the Tasmanians-and the honourcomable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) who is an ex-Minister for Shipping and Transport this forgot to tell us-that there is a vast difference between the raUway systems of South Australia and Tasmania. There is the width of the tracks, for a start. Tasmania has a narrow the gauge raUway of 3 feet 6 inches; South Australia has the standard gauge and the 5 feet 3 inches Think of the extra cost of track laying and the capital investment in track laying alone. Then there is the size of the rolling stock travelling on those 2 systems, one a narrow line and a broader Une. Then there is the work force. as an historic first workersAustraUa South has very many more raUway than Tasmania has. So it is incredible to suggest that Tasmania is not getting a fah deal under this Bill. The comparison with South Australia is completely and utterly irrelevant. The Tasmanian Government has approved of the measure. It has been passed by the House Assembly and is now anchored in the Legislative Council which, as the honourable member for Wentworth rightly remarked a moment ago, is as asking for an undertaking before it will pass Do honourable members know the undertaking for which it is asking? It is this: That there written into the agreement the power for the manian Government to take back the raUways the State at some distant date. That must be the most laughable amendment ever suggested by an upper House. What State would want ways back after handing them over lock, stock, barrel and debts to an Australian government? All those in a State who wanted the raUways back in those circumstances would need to mentaUy examined, from the Premier down. tainer That request by the Legislative Council is utterly ridiculous. Surely it is only a delaying tactic. Let me come back to the actual losses, etc., that Tasmama has been suffering. I shall quote official figures. In 1973-74 the raUway losses growth rate in Tasmania was 27 per cent; but financial assistance grant increased in that year by only 10 per cent. So, each year Tasmania's railways have been going backwards financiaUy. Over the 3financialyears to 1973-74 the losses on our raUways reached 67 per cent; the nnancial assistance granted in that time reached 35 per cent. So, each year Tasmania has been getting further behind in its financial status in respect its raUways. In other words, the losses were increasing at a more rapid rate than was the financial assistance that Tasmania was receiving. So Tasmania was reaching an imoasse. How the could it continue to finance these losses on raUways? The Commonwealth offer, in my opinion, has come at a most opportune moment for Tasmania. Any Tasmanian who really opposes this scheme surely must have a strange philosophy. The Commonwealth proposes to take over everything-the rolling stock, the hands. buUdings, the land, the equipment, the superannuation schemes, the protection for in the Tasmanian RaUways, the debts which are considerable and the losses which have been enormous. What State in its right mind would refuse such an offer? I am only hoping that in next week or two the Legislative Council will be them. convinced to support the Tasmanian Bill so that the agreement can become law in Tasmania and wiU be able to begin to operate from 1 July. It has been suggested that we are going to nationaUse State transport and take over the road transport services that feed the railways, and others as well. As far as I know there is no truth in this suggestion. I would be against the of Commonwealth takuig over aU road services. I believe the private operator has a part to play in the internal transport system in my State as much in any other State. I have no desire to see all it. road transport taken over by the Australian Government or State governments. What this be reaUy means is that we will co-ordinate State and TasFederal road matters and where the Tasmanian in Government operates road services at the moment to feed our raUways, these services will be co-ordinated with the Australian National Line its raUin a road-sea transport system. The Tasmanian Government RaUways was the pioneer in Austraha of the container system when it forwarded farm produce and other be goods from our Tasmanian factories by conto the ports and across to the mainland on ferries and then by raU to Sydney. I must congratulate Mr Collins who was the brain behind this move a few years ago. He revolutionised the Tasmanian raUway system, connecting it with the mainland raUway system by the use of ferries. It brought about the cheaper transport of the goods to Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, a more regular transport service to those centres and a far more business like transport system. Honourable members opposite cry about sociaUsm and centraUsm but the raUways have always been a socialist enterprise except for a smaU raUway on the west coast of Tasmania of owned by the Emu Bay RaUway Co. Ltd of Burnie. For over a century all railways have been government owned. I know that a few privately owned raUways started in Australia way back in middle of the last century but they did not its last very long and later the State governments took them over. So today, apart from the Emu Bay RaUway, the Tasmanian raUway system is a sociaUst raUway system and the governments of aU States, no matter what size or political colour, have agreed to the raUways being in government Mr King- I thought you said you were not the workers going to socialise raUways.",67
121,Mr DUTHIE,AYES NOES,They are socialised now. Mr King-Whic h way do you want it? I the thought you said you were not going to socialise,71
122,Mr DUTHIE,AYES NOES,They are socialised now and the Liberal governments of the States through the years have agreed to it and have poured money into the systems. They tried to meet the losses but they could not. Mr King-So long as we know where you stand. You are going to nationalise them.,71
123,Mr DUTHIE,AYES NOES,"We are going to do nothing the sort. They are a State socialised enterprise. Liberals in Tasmama for many years have conBay demned the railways' indebtedness, the burden of interest payments they are forced to make, unsafe tracks and out-of-date rolling stock. humbug it is now to fight against a transfer to Australian Government. There is criticism that raUways are. railway workers in Tasmama will be worse off under this proposed scheme. A study of the Bill's superannuation clauses completely torpedoes this assumption. Railways workers in Tasmama, in conjunction with the Australian Railways Unions have consulted with the Minister Transport (Mr Charles Jones) on this issue and they are completely satisfied on which the Australian Government takes over the railways will not jeopardise their position at all. In total and over the long term it will probably improve the conditions of railway workers have throughout Tasmania. The State will be millions of doUars better off each year as a result of this transfer. The losses which I mentioned before will be absorbed by the Austrahan Government so the State will not have those to worry about. could possibly be $3m a year better off in total with the Australian Government taking over the raUways-perhap s it would be more than thatand the State will also be better off because a tool annexe is to be built in the next 10 years on outside the raUway area of LauncestonThere will be new rolUng stock and an upgrading of tracks which in some areas are in a bad way. debt burden will be Ufted from the Tasmanian Government. A nominee from the Tasmanian more transport system will be appointed as a 5-year term commissioner to the Australian National long term. RaUways Commission. He will have his say in aU decision making, as will the nominees from the other States who are appointed to the Comsition mission. A nominee from Tasmania will be Railways appointed as a part-time member of the Auscisms traUan National Line. This is being done because of the Austrahan Government's determination about to co-ordinate raU and sea transport more effecthe tively for our State. I put forward the fond hope that at some in the future-it might not be in my time-som portion of the Tasmanian raUway system will electrified. Our hydro-electric system provides us with the cheapest electric power in Australia. know that initially the hydro-electric rail system is expensive, but in the long term it is cheaper and safer to run than diesel engines. All States have to import diesel fuel to run their diesel engines, but we generate our own hydro-electric of power in Tasmania. Why could not the Hobart suburban raU system or the Launceston to Bell section of the raUways be electrified in the future? Tasmania is coming out of this deal probably better than South Australia, because the What South Australian raUways are in a much better the condition in every respect than the Tasmanian Mr Charles Jones-Your s are a bomb.",72
124,Mr DUTHIE,AYES NOES,"When one considers the losses to which I have referred, the Tasmanian railways could be described as the Minister for Transport for has just described them. Mr Charles Jones-It will cost about $80m to that the conditions upgrade them.",72
125,Mr DUTHIE,AYES NOES,Yes . Earlier in my speech I mentioned that in 10 years it will cost $80m to upgrade the Tasmanian raUways. The 27 or 28 miles of the new Bell Bay section of the railways been buUt during the last 5 years. The Liberal Government in Tasmania set the ball rolling for this section and estimated the cost at $4m. The section cost $30m before it was opened. Tasmama had to meet that cost. That extra cost is It included in the takeover bid by the Australian Government. So Tasmania is very fortunate that the costs of that section of the Bell Bay line will not run on into the future. I believe that what is proposed in the Bill will in the long term increase land Tasmania's capacity to earn money through the raUways. I believe that upgrading the railways the by providing better tracks and better rolling The stock will contribute towards confidence in the State. People will use our railways more and and this will increase the total income from our raUways and so help to pay off the debt in the,72
126,Mr KELLY,AYES NOES,"The Oppohas made it clear that it will not oppose the (South Austraha) Bill, but some critiought to be made about it. The first criticism I make is that it is the wrong way to go it. I think that there should have been from South Australian Parliament an expression of opmion that it wants this agreement. I am not certam whether or not the South Australian Partime Uament will oppose the agreement; I do not e know. However, I will be surprised if the South be Australian Parliament does not oppose some parts of the agreement. Of course, the first part is I that the metropolitan section of the raUways will be separate from the other section. This will be dog's breakfast of the worse kind and an adminerate istrative monstrosity. I presume that there will be workers employed by the Commonwealth controlling trains that owned by the South Australian railways. I sume that these trains will be running on tracks owned by the Commonwealth or the South Auswith tralian railways-n o one has said-and mainAustraUan tained by the Commonwealth or the South Auslook tralian railways-no one has that the Commonwealth or the South Australian railways knows that yet. It is clear that, if the 2 sections are to be separate, the proper decision should have been to do it across the whole State. If it is not done it will put hobbles on the new chine and will make it awfully difficult to be operated efficiently. Honourable members down. should just imagine the problems that will be volved in the Australian Government being sponsible for paying the employees and yet operating trains owned by the other arm of government. If this must be done at all it seems great pity that it should not be done across whole field. The Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) must feel that this will handicap the new system in a way which I dunk will be a great pity. Mr Charles Jones-You speak for yourself.",72
127,Mr KELLY,AYES NOES,"I am speaking for myself. I was hoping that the Minister would follow my logic. The second reason why I expect the South Ausit tralian Parliament to alter at least some parts the Agreement concerns the question of road transport. Sub-clause 13 (2) of the Agreement states'. Nothing in this clause shall operate to restrict the tion of new freight or passenger road services . . . That means that there is nothing to stop anybody operating a road service. Sub-clause 13(5) states: Australia . . . shall not be liable to pay any taxes or other charges in respect of the application approval . . . in connecuon with the operation of the road services referred to in this clause. That means categorically that the Commonwealth could just put in a road service which theOne does not have to pay taxes-ton-mileag e taxes or an any other kind of tax-and can put the existing ementary road services out of business. The Minister has But not said that he will do that, but there is clear and provision in the Agreement for that to be done. I would be surprised if the South Australian Parliament did not have a very clear look at this matter, because it has made it clear that the State a Government insurance organisation, ifit is to opin competition, must operate in fair competition with private insurance companies, must pay taxes and must be on equal terms. If the Mmister does what he is allowed to do under this are Agreement, he would not need to close down a preUne but he could leave a line open and run a parallel road service in quite unfair competition the private hauliers. I hope that the South Parliament would have a long cold at this Agreement because it does not look said. I do not think good to me. That brings me to the question of closing down Unes. I listened with some attention to my friend the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wallis). I mado not adopt the same attitude as he does. I think that if a une is a bad one it ought to be closed If it is uneconomic it ought to be closed indown. It is one of the great handicaps of a raUreway system that it must carry the uneconomic lines which in many cases are kept open mainly because of local pressures including local union a pressure. I do not shelter from the fact that if a the Une is a bad economic project it ought to be closed down. I was a bit surprised to see the quaUfication that has been put into the Agreement which states that it can be done only if the State agrees. But when one comes to think of it, that does not really mean much because a line does not have to be actuaUy closed down. A train could be run every 3 weeks and the line would stiU be regarded as being kept open. A train could run on only the day before Christmas and would stUl be regarded as being kept open. The of point is that the Commonwealth would be able effectively to close down any line and put in a road service that would compete on unequal terms with private industry hauUers. I think that introducthat is a warning that ought to be sounded. I presume that the South Australian Parliament will have a good hard look at that aspect also. One matter ought to be mentioned. I do not intend to spend much time on it. I refer to the elofees, quent plea made by the Minister for Transport in or his second reading speech. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) quoted it. I think I ought to do the same. The Minister said: may ask why the Government does not just provide States with sumcient funds to bring their railways up to acceptable standard. I must admit this solution has an elplausibility, in that it would appease the States. it would be a denial of our responsibility to the railways the people of Australia-that awesome responsibility that accompanies the spending of public money. We cannot, and will not, divorce the responsibility for raising funds from the spending of them . . . I suspect that the Minister wiped a tear from his eyes at that stage. That is why he is saying: ' I am going to do this. I am going to have a say. I am going to pay over the money that the Treasurer is knocking up in the bowels of Parliament House with his prmting press. I am going to give that to the States and then I am going to run them'. He did not say but he knows that he is going to do the exact opposite with the metropolitan section. He is just going to pay the States the money and they are going to run it. There is a complete difference in the points of view. The Minister must have been so sorry to see that the States would not hand over the metropolitan sector also because he is going to have to pay the money to the State railway systems to run the metropolitan lines. The Minister has made the claim that he is going to put his mouth where his money is-to reverse the usual phrase-whe n it comes to the country lines, but when it comes to the metropolitan hnes he is just going to pay over the money and let the States run the lines if not take the decisions. Mr Johnson, I want to make it clear",73

It is mainly the South Austrahan Parliament's responsibihty to do so. The railways in South Austraha are the South Austrahan Parliament's railways as they are operated now. It knows the railways in much more detail. The South Australian Parliament knows the various problems associated with running the railways. It knows its needs and it knows its costs.

132,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,AYES NOES,"Hindmarshinsen the following sub-clauses: Minister for Labor and Immigration) (5.3)- I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The amendments are consequential upon the amendments moved by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street) in this House during the Committee stage. The effect of the amendments which were in fact moved by Senator Bishop on behalf of the Government is to give complementary effect to those amendments which were moved by the honourable member for Corangamite, who is now at the table. One of those amendments provides that the 3 additional members of the Austrahan Council-that is, the person nominated by the Prime Minister, the person nominated by the Leader of the Opposition and the person nominated by the Minister for Education-shal l hold office for 3 years. That amendment became necessary because we had to specify the period for which they should hold office. There was a typographical error in clause 18, and that has been corrected. The same kind of error has been picked up in clause 19. A consequential alteration has been made clause 27 by the addition of 3 new sub-clauses. The first one makes it clear that the member the Austrahan Council appointed by the Prime Minister or by the Leader of the Opposition may resign his office in writing but that he remains member of the Council until the resignation has actually been accepted. The same would apply in the case of the person nominated by the Minister for Education. Any member of the council, other than the Secretary, a director or a member nated under proposed new sub-sections (2), could resign his office by writing under his hand delivered to the Minister, but again such resignation would not operate until it had been accepted by the Minister. The rest of the amendments are purely consequential, except one machinery amendment to insert a new clause 5 IA, which provides that the Council may, either generally or otherwise as provided by resolution of the Council, delegate to a member of the Council or to an officer of the Authority any of its powers under the Act, other than the power of delegation. The new clause has been made necessary by the insertion of the first sub-clause to which I have referred. I take this opportunity to thank the honouramendment able member for Corangamite, table, for the co-operation which he has given to me in this matter. He has shown considerable reasonableness. The amendments which he moved in this place were good amendments. The sideration Government accepted them. Uncharacteristically, the Senate accepted the Bill without any amendments other than the ones that were merely complementary to the earlier ones about which I have talked. I place on record my appreciation of the co-operation and assistance which the honourable gentleman gave me in this matter. It indicates that trade union training and the establishment of a college for trade union training are now no longer party political matters. I think that is good.",75
133,Mr SINCLAIR,AYES NOES,Perhaps we ought to name the college after the honourable member for Corangamite instead of the Minister.,76

135,Mr STREET,AYES NOES,"As the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) has said, most of the amendments are consequential on those which the Opposition moved in the House of Representatives and which were accepted by the Government and the Senate. Most of the amendments referred to to required alterations to the Bill consequent on members of Parliament becoming members of of the Council, with the one exception mentioned by the Minister-that of the power of delegation held by the Council. This is perfectly acceptable a to the Opposition, and it is in context with amendment No. 9 referring to the powers of delegation.

Honourable members will recall that the Opposition supported strongly cils' attitude and in the Senate the original provisions were taken out. The matter came this House and the original provision was back in by the Government by use of its numbers in this place. But when the Bill returned to the Senate the Government indicated that it would be prepared to move an amendment which amendment. would recognise therightof the Aboriginal and Islander councils to say who would go on to their reserves, either by way of visit or by way of That residence. The Opposition regards this as an acceptance of the principle of self determination which we a Reserve by reason that a peris not in regard as of great importance.

141,Dr PATTERSON,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT,"Dawson-Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory) (5.16)- I move: That the amendment be agreed to. The reason for the amendment is quite clear. The agreed to. Bill before the Committee is a Bill to establish a Pig Meat Promotion Trust Account and for purposes connected therewith. Under the definitions clause, 'Promotion Account', means the Pig adopted. Meat Promotion Trust Account. Honourable members will notice in paragraph (a) of subclause 6 (1) the words 'with the approval of the lVfinister, for the purpose of promotion' and in sub-clause (3) the words 'The Minister shall not exercise his power to approve the expenditure of moneys from the Research Account for the purraise poses referred to in paragraph 1(a)'-the paralegislation graph to which I have justreferred-'except in accordance with recommendations of the Comthe mittee'. It is clear that the word 'Research' should be 'Promotion'. That is quite consistent. do not know just how the word got there, but that does not matter. One can see from the finitions clause, clause 3, and from sub-clause 6(1), which deals with promotion, that in subweek. clause (3) the word 'Research' should be 'Proamalgamation motion', because under the existing legislation the levy is forresearchand not promotion and this Bill is establishing funds to provide for motion.

142,Mr WILSON,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT," I would like to one matter at the third reading stage. This relates to grants in respect of colleges of advanced education. We read in the Press at weekend of a proposed amalgamation of the Universities Commission and the Commission I on Colleges of Advanced Education. As yet that matter has not been placed before this House. It dewas known that the Parliament was sitting last week; it was known that it would be sitting this Yet an announcement as significant as the of the two commissions was made outside the House. I would be interested to know from the Minister for Education (Mr Beazley) prowhether in due course opportunity will be given to discuss this significant move. The implications for universities of a move such as this are very large indeed. The Minister will remember that on 15 April in the debate on the Bill to establish the Commission on Technical and Further Education I drew to the attention of the House a statement that he had issued in respect of the establishment to look into some special prob1974 [No.2] lems with regard to what was in his statement described as post-secondary education in northern Tasmania. The Minister was at some pains to that that committee was established merely to examine the problem that has arisen in northern Tasmania. When I drew to the attention of the House the significance of the implications of the establishment of a committee that comprised the Chairman of the Universities Commission, the Chairman of the Commission on Advanced Education and the chairman of the interim committee deahng with technical education, the Minister endeavoured to dismiss the importance of the committee. By way of interjection, the Minister said that the committee has been set up at the request of the Tasmanian Government, and that is true. But I pointed out: It may have been at the request of the Tasmanian Government, but it is significant that and that it is to include the Chairman of the Universities Commission, Professor Karmel; the Chairman of the Commission on Advanced Education, Mr T. B. Swanson; and the Chairman of the Committee on Technical and Further Education, Associate Professor E. Richardson. The Minister then interjected and said: It is not a committee of committee to examine the needs of nonh and nonh-west Tasmania for post-secondary education. I went on to say then that the Minister was endeavouring to narrow down the responsibility of the committee because, as I pointed out then and as I point out now, the scope of the brief given to that committee could have been interpreted as far more extensive than to deal merely with the problem of post-secondary educadon in Tasmania. Now, less than 6 weeks later, we have an announcement made outside the Parhament that the Universities Commission is to be amalgamated with the Commission on Advanced Education. Six weeks ago the Minister put great stress on the fact that the Commission on Technical and Further Education represented the establishment of the fourth of 4 very significant commissions. Is it now suggested that the amalgamation of the 2 commissions-the Universities Comniission and the Commission on Advanced Education-wa s not then in contemplation?",78
143,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT,Ver y definitely.,79
144,Mr WILSON,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT,"It seems somewhat strange. If it was not then in contemplation, has the decision to amalgamate those commissions arisen as a consequence of the examination by the group of Chairmen of the Commissions through theh meetings on the small problems that arise in Tasmania? If it has so arisen, why then was that group not given the responsibihty of seeking views from education authorities around Australia as to the way in which post-secondary education should be organised? If it was proper that within the scope",79
145,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT,The committee on north Tasmania has nothing to do with this. The personnel is not even the same.,79

152,Mr WILSON,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. However, in straying from the content of the Bill I have pointed out that we are dealing with recommendations of a commission for expenditure in respect of colleges of advanced education. On the next occasion when we consider expenditure for these colleges we will be considering the recommendations of the one commission which will be responsible for both universities and colleges of advanced education.",79
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT,"With due respect, that is another matter. I draw the honourable member's attention to the actual contents of the Bill.",79
154,Mr WILSON,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have made the point that I wished to draw to the attention of the House. I hope that the Minister will now give to this House some explanation as to why the combination of the 2 commissions is to take place so shortly after he so strenuously said that they had an independent role.",79
155,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT," I do not know why the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) chooses to rise in the House and weave fantasies that connect this Bill with an investigation as to what post-secondary educational institutions should be put down in the north of Tasmania. Not only is that investigation taking place at the request of the Tasmanian Government but Professor Tannock of the Schools Commission is making a special investigation of the needs of nonpresent, government schools in the north of Tasmania. is a region in certain educational difficulties. has absolutely nothing to do with this Bill nor it anything to do with a committee consisting Mr Ken Jones of my Department, Professor Karmel and Mr Swanson about how to combine the Universitites Commission and the Comthat. mission on Advanced Education.

The have done the work in regard to the next triennium and the question that is under investigation is the possible manner of the combination of the 2 Commissions which should be possible. I state in answer to the honourable gentleman that of course this must come before the House. It would involve a radical amendment of legislauon. The legislation which the Parliament has considered has established a Universities Commission and a Commission on Advanced cation. If those commissions were to be turned into a single commission on universities and colleges of advanced education, the decision must necessarily be debated in this House. Mr Wilson-Has any decision been taken that this will be done?",79
156,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT,"There is investigation by Mr Jones and others how to effect it. They would perfectly capable of coming to the conclusion that there were difficulties in the way. If the honourable gentleman would contain himself in patience and would see the immensity of the recommendations that will come down in trifessors, ennial funding, he would realise that there are great many anomahes as between the 2 comsity missions that have come into being which would probably necessitate a higher education body with perhaps a committee of the universities and another committee exanuning the needs of colother leges ofadvanced education. I am not entitled to anticipate the decision. Mr Wilson-What is the position in regard to technical and further education?",80
157,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT,"As the honourable member subject would recognise, we have just introduced a Bill in regard to that. He would also recognise immediately-this is the last point that I want make on this matter-that there is a very fundathis mental difference. That is, we are totally funding universities and colleges of advanced education. We are being invited to increase our stake by the Technical and Further Education Commission in the funding of technical education. But up to the the major initiative in that field rests It with the States. In those circumstances it is That impossible to combine the 2 areas.

158,Mr RUDDOCK,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT," I address myself to clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill. My comments will be rather brief. I take this opportunity to deal with certain aspects arising out of the substantial cost of funding our universities' be programs. It is quite apparent from clause 3 of the Bill that substantial costs have been incurred in numbers of areas relating to the maintenance of universities. Clause 3 proposes to increase substantially the remuneration of university prolecturers, tutors and others. Clause 4 a seeks to increase expenditure grants on univerbuilding projects. Members of Parhament no doubt recently have been approached, as have I , by representatives of the Australian Union of Students who are seeking substantial increases in areas of university expenditure, particularly in the payment of tertiary allowances. Paragraph 1 of the letter that I received from the Australian Union of Students",80
159,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT,I rise on a point of order. The of aUowances paid to students does not come under universities legislation. It is covered by legislation dealing with benefits to students to and is an entirely different matter. Clause 3 of legislation relates to academic salaries which have increased as a result of changes in an award. Clause 4 is another matter.,80
160,Mr RUDDOCK,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT,My proposal was to deal with what I see as increasing expenditure in the total area. What I want to put to the Minister for Education (Mr Beazley) in regard to the clauses is that we ought to examine the competing priorities. I put these comments in the Ught of competing priorities for the sort of expenditures that we have hi the Bill. The proposal that I put is that the students who wish to increase substantiaUy the costs of running universities ought to be required to make a choice as to whether they want to see expanded buUding programs of the nature that we have before us or alternatively whether they want to accept some respite for the moment in advancing of separate expenditure programs in terms of increased allowances which I consider to be of an exceptionaUy high character. I trust that that short statement of the direction in which I am heading will perhaps indicate that I am not out or order. But assuming that I have been,80
161,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT,Mr Innes)Order! If the honourable member pursues that specific Une I will have to uphold the point of order. The purpose of the Bill before us is clear. refers to the Australian Government's funding of universities and the aboUtion of tuition fees.,81
162,Mr RUDDOCK,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT,"I am particularly concerned to the substantial costs which are noted in clauses 3 and 4 in specific areas-the buUding program and the remuneration of staff. I have indicated generaUy that there are other competing priorities. My specific concern in relation to clauses 3 and 4 is that, if we wish to maintain expenditure at the rate that we have here on these projects, we cannot afford as a nation to be considering other alternative avenues of expenditure. I invite all those who are involved in the funding of universities and in considering the priorities that we have before us to note carefully the large increase in Government expenditure in these particular areas. I am not in any way critical of the Government. I accept that the Government has decided that these are the orders of priorities that it wants. Having regard to that, I would hope that the Government does not widen these areas without giving the people involved an opportunity to consider those matters. In relation to clause 4,1 wanted also to Ught the need for the estabhshment of a univerwithout sity in the Parramatta area. Reference is made this clause to the planning of new universities. Particular reference is made to the Deakin Unibeen versity. I wish to compliment the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) on his sugsiderable gestion-whic h in fact is following up suggestions that my own father has made in other places from time to time-on the need to plan now for new university to serve the Parramatta area the lulls area of Sydney-in the areas which we jointly serve. These are fast growing areas",81
163,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT,Is this your way of reducing expenditure?,81
164,Mr RUDDOCK,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT,"No, I am talking about planning. I believe planning is important now if we are to achieve the objective of establishing universities of this type at a reasonable cost in the future. The areas of which I am speaking are expanding. Until recently we have seen rapid escalation in the cost of land in those communities. I believe that unless some steps are taken now to plan for a further university in the Sydney area-in addition to the Campbelltown proposals which have been made-the opportunity to meet such a need will be lost. I believe this is the ideal time to look at these proposals. I should Uke to raise a final matter in relation to costs. I am concerned about rising costs, as I mentioned. One of the matters in relation to buUding costs, which has come to my attention It indkectly and which I believe is receiving the sympathetic consideration of the Government, is the problem experienced by university coUeges and perticularly by those that have been recently established. The Macquarie University comes within the boundaries of my electorate of Parramatta. Recently completed colleges are experiencing considerable difficulties as a result of escalating buUding costs. The university itself is being compensated for the increased costs under clause 4 of this Bill. The colleges to which I am referring are run by churches. They are experiencing considerable difficulty in meeting the increased interest repayments on loans that they necessarily had to negotiate in order to complete the coUeges. Unfortunately, no government has indicated at the moment that it is prepared to meet the additional buUding costs that the colleges have suffered as a result of inflation. In clause 4 of this Bill the Government has accepted such responsibUity in relation to universities generally. I believe that colleges of this type, which most other universities have established and which proceed highin these difficult times on a reasonable basis substantial costs to the organisations in that have sponsored them, are essential at the new universities. The Macquarie University has developed in recent years, no doubt at considerable public cost. The University has a connumber of students coming from all areas of Sydney. They want to live near the University but there are not the older homes availa able for rent that exist in areas such as Glebe, and which is near the Sydney University. Newer homes, built largely for young married couples and so on, surround Macquarie University. It is difficult in such drcumstances to find the sort of accommodation that colleges themselves offer, and it is difficult for them to find the sort of commodation that students are able tofindin the older and more established areas in which these is provision for flats, sub-letting and so on. Accommodation of this kind does not exist in the newer areas which are being developed. I wish particularly to ask the Minister when considering these proposals to assist the colleges at Macquarie University that the colleges be given assistance to maintain theh existence on the university campus. I understand that in other areas of Austraha where new universities have been developed there has been a request that coUeges be developed within the universities to assist students to create that special environment in which they will be able to pursue theh studies to advantage. I would not Uke to see a situation arise in which, because of the very costs that the Government is accepting under this legislation in relation to the universities themselves, university coUeges are in fact driven into bankruptcy or will have to close because of the inability of the organisation which originaUy sponsored them to carry the substantial costs which have arisen through the increased buUding costs of which we are aU aware.",81
165,Mr FISHER,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT,"When I spoke in the recent debate on the' States Grants (Universities) Bill I welcomed the initiatives that the Minister for Education (Mr Beazley) had taken in this field, but, as is the case in Government programs, the value of those initiasimply tives is now being lost in a series of increasingly incoherent economic decisions. I believe most disappointing for aU honourable members to realise that rising costs are nullifying the tremendous advances which have been made ask and which could be continued in the field of cation. ActuaUy this Bill only updates these adjustments for cost variations to the end 1974. In general it does not aUow for cost increases that have occurred since 1975. The actual variations incorporated in the Bill are based on the following improved indices pared by the Universities Commission. First of ah, there are the academic salaries. As recthey are fundedommended by Mr Justice Campbell in late 1974 theseriseswere retrospective to 16 October 1974. They ranged from 16 per cent for professors to 25 per cent for lecturers and 34 per cent for tutors Order! and demonstrators. The last non-national wage case rises in this area occurred in January 1973. Academic does salaries make up about 45 per cent of the general recurrent grants for universities under this new legislation. Non-academic salaries and wages are calculated largely on the Austrahan Public acService indices. Non-salary recurrent cost indices are those which have been especially prepared by the Commission for its own purposes. The last two I have mentioned, non-academic salaries and non-salary recurrent costs, make up about 55 per cent of the total additional university general recurrent grants. Of course the fourth area of cost increase is in the Commission's own buUding costs. Grants for general university buUding projects haverisenin the 1974 and 1975 legislation by $24.2m since the original programs were specified. This amounts to an increase of 21 per cent since the commencement of the triennium. Compared with the automatic cost escalation of 6 per cent allowed in Schools Commission programs, built in inflationary factors in tertiary programs are very small. I do not wish to delay this legislation. It is an important piece of legislation. We see in this Bill an additional amount of $104m recommended simply because of the huge inflationary costs that have occurred, so I believe it would be fair to say that this Bill is about inflation. It tells the story of a government that is unable to manage what was once a strong economy. This Bill is evidence of the disastrous effects which the Government's mismanagement is having upon essential Government responsibuities, of which I believe education is the most important. This Bill shows also that the huge increases in Government most spending are not being used to advantage but are only aUowing to continue programs that were provided for by this Parliament at the it is commencement of the last triennium.",82
166,Mr WILSON,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT, I should like to the Minister further with regard to the point I eduraised a few minutes ago: Did he suggest by his reply that the basis for amalgamating or conof sidering the amalgamation-h e did not make clear whether it is a Government decision to amalgamate or whether the Government is only considering that amalgamation-of the Universipreties Commission and the Commission on Colleges of Advanced Education and the reason that,82

169,Mr STREET,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,"This 1973-74 small, apparendy simple Bill cloaks one of the most intractable industrial relations problems Austraha. The Bill has great and increasing sigductivity nificance for aU citizens, even though many of them may not reaUse it. But it has greatest nificance for exporters. The Australian watermance front has always had a stormy history. Certainly not all the faults have been on one side. There were highly undesirable practices on the part employers many years ago and the legacy of bitment terness of those days is with us not intend to go over all the history, but we do need to look at what has happened since 1967 when, following the Woodward report, a scheme of permanent employment was introduced on many the waterfront. Everyone had great hopes for new era. There was to be a new employerthat employee relationship; the bad old days were finished. Unfortunately, the high hopes that were held for the future of waterfront employment were not realised. There was a brief period of much reduced industrial trouble, but graduaUy the situadon deteriorated until now we are just about back where we started, but with one difference: Costs have got completely out of control. That is the crux of the problem which is facing us today. The permanent employment scheme, whUe it has undoubtedly brought great benefits to a very few-the waterside workershas imposed enormous increases in costs on the vast majority of Austrahans. The vast majority includes all consumers of imported products since a larger and larger proportion of the retail that price of goods imported into Australia is represented by shipping and stevedoring charges. In the case of exports a larger and larger proportion of the value is swallowed up by the same means, that is, shipping and stevedoring report-by reaUty,Itone costs. is vital to remember that the two are in and the same. Since stevedoring companies in many instances are controlled by Third Reading overseas ship owners, increasing stevedoring costs are soon reflected in increased freight rates. I shaU be returning to that central issue later, but in the meantime it is important to remember that the benefits gained by waterside workers have been at the expense of lowering the purchasing power and the standard of hving of every Australian who buys any imported goods and at a BILL 1975 cost to every Australian exporter. Second Reading Let us now look at the waterfronts since the introduction of permanent employment. FoUowing a dramatic reduction in man-hours lost through stoppages from 1966 to 1968, the figure of 4 per cent of man-hours worked was higher in than for 16 years. Thefiguresfor wages lost were also the highest since 1964. So there has in been no overaU improvement in these areas. Prohas increased in the handling of some products, but not in aU. For example, wool handsigling has about the same productivity perfornow as it had 10 years ago, that is, about 0.35 tonnes per man-hour. Where productivity has increased markedly, it has usually been at of the cost of enormously expensive capital investsuch as in containers and their associated still today. I do handUng equipment. The central problem as has been spelt out on occasions in this place, particularly by the a honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Kelly) is the employers of waterside labour are beholden to ship owners for theh business and give into every unreasonable demand made upon them. Shipowners would rather pay more for stevedoring than have theh shipstiedup. I admit that this is understandable, but the point is that they do not end up paying for it. It is always easy to buy one's way out of trouble if one is using somebody else's money, the money in this case huge belonging to Australian exporters. A depressing side issue, but nonetheless an important one is the reference in the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority annual report for 1973-74 to the deplorable failure of employers of waterside labour to exercise appropriate and consistent control in relation to undesirable, undisciplined behaviour by a minority of waterside workers. I draw the attention of the House to this point. It is most significant that the people who have expressed concern at this situation are responsible members and offices of the Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia. It would be difficult to imagine a more damning commentary on any employer group in Australia. It is part of the problem which has brought about the need for this legislation. As honourable members know, a charge is levied under this legislation on a man-hour basis on all employers of waterside labour. The charge is used to fund a variety of purposes, but by far the most important in financing terms, is idle time, that is, the time for which waterside workers are paid even though they are not working. This charge has been successively increased over the years, each increase in due course being passed on in the form of increased freight rates. Thefinancesof the ASIA are in more or less perpetual trouble, and no wonder when we look at thefiguresfor idle time. Last year, a year of gready increased imports, the cost of idle time fell from $6.4m in the year before to $3.6m. But this substantial improvement was short lived. A combination of gready reduced imports and costs incurred as a result of recruiting additional waterside workers to cope with the high level of imports in 1974 and above all, a new national waterfront wage agreement granting increases in minimum pay of between 26 per cent and 30 per cent, plus a 25 per cent loading on annual leave, have sent idle time costs right through the roof.",83
170,Unknown,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,84
171,Mr STREET,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,"When the sitting was suscosts pended this evening, I was explaining to the House that the costs involved in stevedoring in this. Austraha had been very significantly affected in recent days by a new national waterfront wage agreement which had had the effect of granting increases of between 26 per cent and 30 per cent in the minimum wage, and a 25 per cent loading on annual leave. I was explaining that the effect of this national wage agreement had been to send the idletimecostsrightthrough the roof. I remind the House that the Stevedoring Industry Charge Bill that we are debating now is concerned principaUy, so far as the financial aspects of it are concerned, wifh paying for the cost of idletimeon the waterfront. My information is that idle time is now running at an average of about 10 000 man days a week at a cost of approximately $28 a man. According to the information that I have, that works out at about $ 15m a year. Mr Kelly-Did you say $ 15m?",84
172,Mr STREET,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,"It is $ 15m a year for idle time. That is the current rate. But I am informed that last week idle time was approximately 14 000 man days costing approximately $420,000. I would suggest to the House that that just cannot goon. Mr Kelly-It wiU break us.",84
173,Mr STREET,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,"It will break us, as the honourable member for Wakefield sorightlysays. As an example of the situation in which we are today, I cite an instance that is set out in the annual report for 1973-74 of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority. The example is given of a week in Melbourne when one employer had a surplus of 2954 man days of labour which cost the Authority over $50,000 for idle time. But in the same week, in the same port, other employers were short of 1877 man days oflabour. In that week aloi-e $32,000 was paid in wages for 1877 wasted man days of locked up idle time. Many other equaUy absurd examples can be found in the ASIA annual report. The cost of these absurdities will increase rapidly with the further wage rises which apply from May this year. In total, these wagerisesamount to approximately 30 per cent. The mind boggles at what will happen when the full effect of these costs is felt,firstin the costs on the waterfront, and then, as inevitably as night foUows day, in freight rises. My information is that all of these increases will lead to a 40 per cent rise in stevedoring costs compared with the costs on 1 May this year. That is the situation today. I repeat: Compared with a month ago, these increases will lead to a 40 per centrisein charges. No industry can stand It has been put to the Opposition that a more equitable way of calculating the levy would be on a tonnage cubic measure basis rather than on a man-hour basis. Clearly, the present method disadvantages those stevedores working convention cargo as distinct from container and bulk cargo. Conventional shipping is still important, especiaUy in trade with the developing countries of Asia and the Pacific. The Opposition believes that there may be some merit in altering the basis of calculating the charge, but this would involve a very careful consideration of the many highly complex factors involved. For example, one factor which would have to be kept in mind would be the danger of attracting cargoes away from the most efficient method of shipping. Another factor would be the need to balance the importance of a relatively small percentage of our total trade against the interests of our major customers and suppliers. Other reasons involve the lack of dme and the lack of detailed information. For these reasons we have decided not to move amendments of this kind to the legislation but we bring the problem to the attendon of the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) as being worthy of careful considerauon. In any case, the charge is onlyfiddlingwith the big problem, which is the structure of waterfront employment in Australia. As I have indicated, this enables unions to pick off employers one by one and to force them to concede to quite unreasonable demands because the employers, for their part, are subservient to the interests of the overseas shipping companies whose main concern is not the costs imposed on Australian consumers and exporters but to keep their ships moving. It is a classic case of'I'm allright,Jack', with the Australian community paying for the feather-bedding and cosy deals benefiting a very small number of people. Mr Kelly-Sweethear t agreements.",84
174,Mr STREET,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,"Sweetheart agreements, as the honourable member for Wakefield so accurately observes. We must be able to develop a better system. This has been recognised by the Mmister for Labor and Immigration. In a speech which he made last year on the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Bill he stated: While recommending an extension of the temporary legislation for a further 2 years, it would be my intention cate to the Parliament the Government's proposals for the industry well befoie the expiry of that period. Extending the life of the Act will not ofcourse permanent legislation at an ible. Indeed, an earlier date for permanent legislauon is desirable. Mr Kelly-When is he going to do that?",85
175,Mr STREET,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,"That is the whole question. I am coming to it now. The Opposidon agrees with the Minister and therefore will be moving some amendments to this Bill. They are designed to give the Minister a Utde gentle encouragement in getting permanent legislation before the House. The Bill makes provision for setting the maximum rates of charge-wit h the actual rates being set by regulation-at $2.50, $3.50 and $2.50 for class A, B and C waterside workers respectively. According to the information avaUable to me, it seems that the rate wiU be set by regulation at about $2.20 for class A waterside workers. That is over 50 per cent more than the current rate which is charged, namely, $1.40. We propose to move amendments to reduce this charge to $2.25, $3.20 and $2.25 for the respective classes of waterside workers. I am informed that that wiU be sufficient for present purposes. If further increases are required, it will be a signal that the costs for idle time and other purposes for which this charge is used have got completely out of hand. In these circumstances we believe that it is reasonable that the Government should have to come back to the Parliament so that the whole sorry business can be exposed. I emphasise that that is the reason for the amendment. We are not seeking to prevent the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority from carrying out its statutory obligation, which it does with great dedication and under extraordinarily difficult circumstances. Another problem facing the Authority is the contingent UabUity for long service leave, now standing at over $20m. Incidentally, a measure of the attractiveness of this industry may be that so few waterside workers take long service leave when they become entided to it. This huge UabUity is something which could well receive the attention of the Government and the industry. It is the sort of issue which I imagine is being investigated by the Minister's troubleshooter on the waterfront, Mr Foster. That raises the question of Mr Foster's long promised report. While I am pleased to have the long awaited report which was presented to Parliament earUer today, I make the point that little time has been given to honourable members to study it in any detail. I am hopeful that at least some of my colleagues may be able to refer to the report later in this deto indi- bate. Speaking personaUy, I would have appreciated an opportunity to comment on it in this debate. preclude the introduction of earlier date if this proves feasConsistent with the proposed amendment to the maximum rate of charge, we propose to move that the legislation will cease to be operative on 1 July 1976. It will not have escaped the Minister's attention that that is the same date as that which applies to the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act. That is to remind the Minister of his words in the speech last year, to which I have referred already, when he emphasised the desirabUity of introducing permanent legislation at an early date. Therefore I believe that the proposed amendments are consistent with the expressed objective of the Government as well as that of the Opposition. I believe that the Minister appreciates the seriousreport ness of this issue and that in Australians there is an urgent need to tackle a problem which has gone for far too long and which, regrettably, is getting steadily worse.",85
176,Mr KELLY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,"In preparing for this debate I have been reading in Hansard the speeches which preceded and followed the 1967 agreement which brought in permanent employment. One thing that is abundantly clear is that the expectation and hope that all of including myself, had at the time was would have a new situation on the waterfront. is now clear that the whole business of manent employment has been a bitter disapwaterfrontpointment to everybody. The honourable memwhich ber for Corangamite (Mr Street) has spelt it out more with crystal clarity. If one wishes failure of the scheme one should look at the cost of handling conventional cargo. An increase costs of handling conventional cargo is occurring at the rate of about 30 per cent a year. Prior the suspension of the sitting the honourable member for Corangamite spelt out the problem of indiscipline on the waterfront. I think I do no better than repeat the quotation in the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority's in?' annual report which we have just received. It states: No improvement was noted in industrial relations tween permanent employers and their employees, nor standard of supervision and disciplinary control ployers. Some responsible officials and members FederationThat is the Waterside Workers Federationhave expressed concern at the failure of employers to exercise appropriate and consistent control in relation plined behaviour by a minority of waterside workers. I heard the honourable member for CoranWorkers gamite pose that as the greatest kind of indicttinue ment that one could have of the operation of the present system. He spelt out the position, so that we could see it clearly, about idle time. We want a greater number of people to work ships, yet have an equal number of people, or in many cases a greater number of people, locked up and being paid for doing nothing when the port desperately needs people. We have a postion redundancy. We know that under the conference agreement which we hoped would bear fruit, people can be declared to be redundant by the Authority only upon a request from either the Waterside Workers Federation or the Associwhole ation of Employers of Waterfront Labour. Obviare ously neither body will ask for people to be declared redundant, although if people are declared redundant, according to the Authority's this year, they get a golden handshake of the interests of all $3,263 a year. We have to ask ourselves- I know that the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) would be asking himself this continually. Why has the result been so disappointing? The whole history of the waterfront has proved desperately disappointing- I think as disappointing to the Minister as to us. We get the problem of the sweetheart agreements. I quote us, from page 42 of the report of Mr Foster, who that we adorned this place sometimeago: It Companies generally agreed that these practicesperThese are the restrictive practices on the were designed to make jobs last longer or employ men, should have ceased with the introduction of perto measure the manent employment. They did not, and the Minister knows that they in did not. Because we have sweetheart agreements on the waterfront. I know that the Minister to knows this, because of the necessity or the desire of the ship owners to get a quick turn around of theh ships the ship owners always agree to what could the Waterside Workers Federation puts up. I have asked many stevedores: 'Why did you give They all say to me: 'We have to. If we are not owned by the ship owners we are clients of theirs. We depend for our livelihood on the business of be the ship owners'. The ship owners have one overin the whelming drive: They must not have their ships by emheld up. I can understand that. As the honourof the able member for Corangamite mentioned before dinner, it is very expensive for a ship, particularly a container ship, to be held up. The Association of Employers of Waterfront to undisciLabour is always under a compulsion to make a sweetheart agreement with the Waterside Federation. Therefore the costs conto rise in the way that the honourable member for Corangamite mentioned. A 50 per cent increase in the levy does not really matter to the employers of waterfront labour. They know that we because of the conference system they can recover theh costs by putting up their freight rates. So we have the continual pressure of the Waterside Workers Federation leaning on the of shipowners through the AEWL, causing a continual increase in costs which, as the honourable member for Corangamite spelt out so clearly earher, is imposing a dreadful burden not only on the exporter but also on the community as a because the costs of imports and exports increased by these sweetheart agreements. Although it is the sweetheart agreement which is the basic problem, there is one other problem which brings the situation home to the shipowner who is squeezed in a way that not many people understand. The Waterside Workers Federation can move in on a ship and take particular action and the shipowner will always give in because he is at the mercy of the Federation. So it is the sweetheart agreement that the Minister knows is in existence which we have to recognise. I return to this report of Mr Foster. I would like to be critical of a remark which appears on page 56 in the following terms: It is painfully clear that the industry continues to be operated for the convenience of shipowners alone . . . That is not so. It is not operated for the convenience of shipowners alone. The tragedy of Australia's situation is that it is operated for the convenience of the shipowners and the Waterside Workers Federation. That is the bullet that we have to bite on. It is not the fact that the ship owners are getting their way. The fundamental problem that we face is that the shipowners and the Waterside Workers Federation are getting theh way. They are dining out at our expense and are forming sweetheart agreements. There is a long record of agreements being broken, of demands being given into. That is the grim record of the sweetheart agreements which are the basic cause of our problems. I do not blame Mr Foster for his observation. He was a waterside worker before he came into this place and since he left it he has been operating in thisfield.I would expect him to come out pubUcly and say, as he has said in his report, that the industry is operated for the convenience of shipowners alone. It is not, and he knows it is not. The Minister knows it is not. Mr Foster no doubt knows that it is operated for the convenience of the Waterside Workers Federation and the shipowners. They have made the sweetheart agreements and it is for this reason only that the costs have risen in a way that must be alarming the Minister. I know it is alarming me and I know it is alarming the honourable member for Corangamite and must be alarming every thinking person in this place. It is not the shipowners alone who have brought about the problems; it is the sweetheart agreements which are made possible by the present system. So we have a responsibUity to try to work out what we ought to do in the future. I am not going to be critical of the Minister because he has not to this stage introduced a new model of legislation that wiU tackle the problem. He is driving a model of the previous Government's making. It is the previous Government's machine that he is operating. We in this House have a particular responsibUity in the few months that remain while the levy that is proposed under the legislation or under our proposed amendment is in operation. I do not know whether the levy will be sufficient to enable the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority to meet its proper obUgations. We have to go through the painful process of rethinking the way in which we ought to tackle the problem. Mr Foster's report spells out 3 possible solutions to the problem. He suggests that we might back away from the area altogether-leavee it. One thing is abundantly clear: We cannot go on as we are going. I think that we all agree on that. I think the Minister for Labor and Immigration nods his head at that. What solutions can we offer? We have a duty to offer some solutions. As I say, one is that we could back away from the area and leave it altogether. The levy could be abandoned if the legislation were dropped. We could leave it to the supply and demand situation. I do not think for one minute that that would be acceptable to the Minister or to us. So I do not think that it is suitable that we should back away from the problem and leave the matter in a laissez faire situation. No one will accept that we ought to go on as we are going, because it is imposing on the exporter and the importer-o n the economy as a whole- a burden that no one should be asked to carry. Another solution can be divided into 2 parts, and Mr Foster refers to them all too briefly. Perhaps we could restore the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority to the place that it once held before the 1967 permanent employment situation arose. We could give that Authority control over labour on the waterfront. Perhaps- Mr Foster referred to this-ther e should be a wider union than the Waterside Workers Federation covering the employment on the waterfront. Maybe all the unions should be brought into one area. This is something that I have not had an opportunity to think out. We could give the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority control over the labour force and get away from this nonsense of a SEAL pool and so on that we know has worked so badly and has created this locked-up employment situation. That is another solution. The other solution is to bite on the bullet of the nationalisation of the stevedoring process on the waterfront. Probably it could be done under the Constitution in relation to overseas shipping, I do not know. However, I would say definitely that we cannot go on as we are going. I would prefer that we backed away from the area and left the Commonwealth out of it than to go on as we are going. At present we have this cost-plus situation, as Mr Foster points out in his report, which is intolerable. I do not speak for my Party here, but in looking at the matter with all the capacity that I can muster, I cannot see any solution other than the nationalisation of the stevedoring process on the waterfront, I do not put that forward lightheartedfy. I do not put it forward with any great hope that it will be embraced by the people in my Party. But I do not know of any other solution. We have 2 possible alternatives. Thefirstis to have nationalisation pure and simple, and the second is to have a common pool of labour which is controlled and refurbished, if necessary, by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority. But we must have one of those alternatives. We cannot go on as we are. For the benefit not so much of the Minister as of the people in my Party I pose the grim alternatives that face us. We cannot go on as we are with the cost escalation that dogging us and that is imposing a burden on the whole community. Any thinking person in this place would admit that. We must examine the matter with all the care, courage and urgency that we can muster and we must bite on this bullet before it is too late.",86
177,Mr MCVEIGH,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE," I disappointed join in this debate to support the arguments of the honourable members for Corangamite (Mr Street) and Wakefield (Mr Kelly) and to ask Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) to give very serious consideration, know he will, to accepting the amendments moved by the honourable member for Coransome gamite. I do that not in any spirit of the efforts of the Minister but as one who has been very impressed by the logic of the academic arguments advanced by the 2 honourable members from this side who have spoken. I cannot compete with those 2 eminent gentlemen in their knowledge of the waterfront and I would not and dare to lock horns with the Minister in debate this most important matter. But I want to be associated on the practical side with this very important piece of legislation. The theoretical side has been canvassed on many occasions not only in this House but also in the various political forums in the country. I support the argument that it is time that something was done permanently to solve problems of the waterfront rather than to take the ad hoc measures that have been advanced from time to dme. Mr Lucock-Hear , hear!",88
178,Mr MCVEIGH,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,"As the honourable member for Lyne implies, that would be an eminently logical thing to do. I was tremendously impressed by the argument advanced by the honourable member for Wakefield regarding nationalisation as a long term solution. I hope that in the months ahead-judgin g by events that have transpired over recent days the reign of the present Labor Government could be rather short-the Minister will give very serious consideration to accepting for the purposes of legislation the point of view advocated by the honourable member for Wakefield. I say this in a spirit of help rather than in a spirit of criticism because I am concerned- I know that the Minister is very concerned-at the state of the industry in Australia. It is unfortunate that Australia depends to a large extent on the use of waterfront labour, because we are one of the great trading nations of the world, we have many resources and we need is to use shipping which is our bloodstream. It does not matter how efficient we become as primary producers or as workers engaged in industry; we must remember that at the end of the line there are people who must purchase goods and use them. One of the great costs we bear as importers and in maintaining our place in the markets as exporters is the very high freight charges. I was to read recendy that the exporters in this country have been experiencing a problem with the continual escalation in overseas shipthe ping freight. The Australian Shipping Council and the Australia to Europe Shipping Conferas I ence raised their freights on general and refrigerated cargo on 20 January last year by \2Vt per cent and increased them further criticism of by 2Vi per cent on 1 June.",88
179,Mr LUSHER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,Pirac y on the high seas.,88
180,Mr MCVEIGH,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,"As the honourable member for Hume said, that is piracy on the high seas. These increases are affecting some of the canned dried fruits and fresh citrus industries in his on electorate. High freight costs are one of the reasons why many of those industries are in very serious trouble. I believe it is an eminently suitable time to ask the Minister to do something through the channels that are avaUable to him. Instead of having compUed reports that will gather dust or be pigeon-holed, possibly he could charge some of his officers with the very special the responsibility of being apostles for the reawakening of the conscience of the Australian stevedores and waterside workers. It is unfortunate that Mr Souter and Mr Fitzgibbon stir up such issues as demarcation disputes to use as a lever. In an excellent speech the honourable member for Corangamite detaUed to the House in chapter and verse the large number of man days that are lost each year through strikes. The honourable member for Wakefield also touched on the problem of idle time. I believe that this would be a fertilefieldinto which the Minister could enter and encourage the cross-pollination of ideas. He should tell the waterside workers that they have a particular responsibUity to Australia as a nation. Mr Fisher-And to the wheat growers, too.",88
181,Mr MCVEIGH,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,"I intend in a minute to touch on the subject of the wheat growers, which was the point raised by the honourable member for Mallee. He, like so many of us, is so much aware that a disaster could have been perpetrated on the wheat growers through the action of the waterside workers. I will come to that aspect eventually, but before doing so I want to conclude on the point I was making when the honourable member for MaUee interrupted with his quite pertinent interjection. As I see it there must be a 2-way arrangement between the industry and the stevedores insofar as they must reaUse that if they are to have job opportunities is essential for them to increase their productivity. That was the essence of the speech of the honourable member for Wakefield, who made an earnest plea to the stevedores to get on with their own particular responsibUity to Australia as a nation and to do a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. It is absolutely essential that the legislation have sufficient teeth and that the Minister convey to the Cabinet his great feeling that the Government must have muscle in relation to this matter. It must not only govern but also it must appear to govern. We must abolish irresponsible strike action. I am not one of those who disagree with the worker having the right to strike. I believe that the worker has his labour to offer and that to protect his right to receive fair recompense for his work he must have use of the strike weapon. But there have been far too many occasions when needless emphasis has been given on the waterfront to things such as strikes on demarcation issues. We also had the example in New South Wales of the waterside workers striking because they disagreed with the New South Wales Government on the Medibank proposals. I want to comment briefly on the irresponsible action of the trade unionists engaged on the waterfront as far as the banning of the sale of wheat to ChUe is concerned. That was a completely ridiculous action to take in relation to Chile. I cannot understand how the waterside workers could use strike action to gain an advantage for themselves simply because they claimed to disagree with the poUtics of ChUe. I would have thought that being men of compassion they would have been thinking of the milUons of residents of that country who were practically dying of starvation. I would have thought that there was enough humanitarianism around to encourage them to get on with the job of loading some $40m worth of wheat bound for Chile. What they did was a blot on theh character and a blot on theh behaviour. Mr Fisher-It stiU is. Mr MCVeigh-The honourable member for Mallee says that it still is. It is all very well to dismiss that action at the present time when we have access to good world wheat markets, but in times to come we will be looking to our traditional customers to take our wheat. They can quite legitimately use the excuse that when they wanted our wheat our waterside workers refused to load the wheat which would have satisfied the hunger of many millions of people in that country. ChUe is our third or fourth biggest customer. it I hope that the Minister can bring forth legislation which will enable the Government to control the waterfront and which will allow the Austrahan Wheat Board to control the shipment of wheat to its traditional buyers. I endorse the remarks of the honourable for Wakefield in relation to sweetheart agreements. It is intolerable that shipowners should be held to ransom because of the political activity of the people who control the waterfront. It ill behoves them to say: 'We will load ships only on certain conditions'. There is a price to pay for that sort of solution, and the price that will have to be paid is that the resources of Australia will be priced out of world markets. That surely is something at which any Government, of whatever poltiical colour, must be aggrieved because in the final analysis, the improved quaUty of Australian life must be the hallmark for which any government aims.",89
182,Mr DONALD CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE," We have Ustened with interest to the earlier contributions in this debate. I am speaking tonight on this subject possibly as the only member of the Parhament, at least on this side of the chamber, who has had experience on the waterfront. Almost a decade ago I was an industrial officer with the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour. Much has changed in that decade, but I believe that the framework which was surrounded by the skin of trouble in those earlier years is stUl the cause of much of the trouble today. When one looks back on the history of the Australian waterfront one recalls that it was approximately in 1928 when the old bulldog system- I think that was the name of it-of selecting gangs of workers was abandoned. For a long time the bad old days remained in the memories of the workers on the Austrahan waterfront. They were tough days when the boss or the stevedore had the right to select for himself those workers whom he felt had in the past given him the best return, and those people who had not worked as hard as others were left on the sideline. The next major change occurred in the mid-1960s when the then Minister for Labour and National Service- I think it was Mr Holt or",89
183,Mr MCMAHON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,"appointe d the Woodward Commission to investigate the Austrahan waterfront. Mr Woodward at that time suggested that we needed the introduction of permanency of employment to give the Australian waterside worker a feeling of security so that in return he would put his heart into the job. Regrettably, permanency has not worked out as it was planned, and today we still see disruptions, a falling away of loading rates and many other troubles which for so long have been associated with the waterfront. I do not beheve that it is all the fault of the waterside worker. It takes two to tango. My colleague, the honourable member for Ueved Wakefield (Mr Kelly), touched on this point earher, when he referred to the fact that the trahan stevedore, who in many cases represents an overseas ship owner, has one task. It is paramount importance that he get the ship turned around and out to sea headed to the port, because regrettably having a shiptiedup for an extra 24 hours costs thousands of dollars. It is much easier to hand the waterside workers percentage of that cost and save the rest than enter into some dispute or to take a stand some issue. I think the honourable member for Wakefield said that frequently the stevedores have been over the barrel. I say that they have been over the mast. They have been well and truly hung from the mast and have had to capitu-which late on many occasions when in other industries the employer would have been able to say: 'All right, we will close down the plant'. Perhaps only comparable industry in this country would be the airline industry. If the employees of Trans-Australia Airlines or Ansett Airlines of Austraha go out on strike for 48 hours, it costs those 2 operators up to $lm a day to have theh businesstiedup. The cost of a strike is one reasons why ship owners or stevedores have been so prepared to give in on many issues on which employers in another industry would take afirmstand. Mr Speaker, I ask you: Who really can blame the waterside worker if his union official, who is subjected to the elective system, does his best by the men he represents and strives his utmost to win concessions and conditions? This is the name of the game, and this is exactly how it works. I do not believe that the suggestion made by the honourable member for Wakefield has the acceptance that he would like to beheve it has. I refer, of course, to the nationalisation of the entire waterfront industry. I believe that the Australian waterside worker is no longer a member of the unprivileged class. He is no longer a member of the suppressed class. He has fought his way out of that position. In return for what my fellow Australians who are waterside workers have gained, I ask them to recognise that every time they pull on a bluey unnecessarily and every time they hold up a ship unnecessarily it is theh fellow Australians who carry the financial burden. We recaU that not too long ago-abou t a decade ago-sectio n 23A, if my memory serves me correctly, of the Stevedoring Industry Act provided that a waterside worker or a gang of waterside workers could stop work if he or they be that a safety issue existed. Under that section there was trouble day after day on the AusAustraUan waterfront. It was removed by Mr Justice Woodward and there was a change. The number of of stoppages on safety issues decreased as dramaticaUy as the value of our currency has next decreased since the advent of an Austrahan Labor Party Government. It was an indication that the waterside workers were not beyond pullaing one on if they could. But in this day and age to when they have won theh conditions they have a on responsibihty and a duty, in my opinion, to recognise that the overseas shipowners still ply the Australian coastline. For all the battles in the past they have not disappeared. The Australian people do not own aU the ships and the war has been waged cannot be won. They should remember that the price of that war- a war which is still being waged-is borne by the the Australian exporters and a very simple fact emerges. If our costs to manufacture and send our produce overseas continue to escalate we are pricing ourselves off the world markets and as a result feUow Australians will continue to join the ranks of the unemployed. I conclude on this of the point: The waterside workers have won their position and should guard it jealously but they should not sacrifice the standards and the rights of others to opportunities simply for unjustified pursuits.",90
184,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,"in reply- I listened carefully to the remarks made by the honourable members for Corangamite (Mr Street), Wakefield (Mr Kelly) and Darling Downs (Mr MCVeigh). They were ah quite thoughtful contributions. I did not agree with all they said but I thought that the 3 speakers had the distinction of attempting to offer some solution to the waterfront problem. This the last speaker, the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron), did not do. We all know what the problem is. The last speaker knows it also. His speech was an ambivalent one which seemed to blow hot and cold. He was all in favour of the waterside workers and it was good to hear him take that position but at the same time he suggested that they also were a bit greedy. Mr Donald Cameron-Is that right?",91
185,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,Is that what you now said? Mr Donald Cameron- I am asking if that is years right.,91
186,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,The honourable foreign member is not prepared to say 'Right' to that. Mr Donald Cameron-They overdo it from time to time.,91
187,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,"Honourable memCaucus bers can see the ambivalence of the honourable member for Griffith. He offered no solution. all know the problem and what we are looking for is a solution. The honourable members for Corangamite, Darling Downs and Wakefield at least did attempt to provide some solution to problem. Then solution was not specific or deknow finite or one of total commitment to what they were putting but at least they did canvass pospresent. sibilities. One of the possibUities they canvassed in a non-committal way was that we look at idea of setting up a national or an Austrahan stevedoring industry corporation to control the whole of the stevedoring operations which could be controlled constitutionaUy by such a body. It would be a body to control stevedoring operindustry ations and would remove the influence- I agree with aU honourable members when they call it the sinister influence-of the overseas shipping companies on the stevedoring industry in Australia at the moment. We aU know that most of the larger stevedoring compames in Austraha are really the auxiliaries or the sudsidiaries of overseas shipping compames. To talk about the Australian Government setting up a corporation to control the stevedoring mdustry without at the sametimesetting up a corporation that would have complete control over the whole industry, to the extent that the Constitution would permit it to be done, is quite sUly. If such a corporation were set up and the stevedoring companies that are now the subsidiaries of overseas shipping companies were allowed to continue to operate, it goes without saying that the P & O Line and the various other overseas shipping lines would continue to give theh business to theh subsidiaries no matter what the cost of this might be to the Australian shippers and to the Australian community. So I believe that there is a lot of merit in the proposition that was canvassed-put forward not as a definite proposition but as one that ought to be considered-that we should establish a stevedoring industry corporation in Australia. I would be prepared to recommend that course to the Government. I have looked at this matter for a longtime.I have gone into it deeply. I am not talking idly, malting a decision or saying something that has just suddenly hit me. Over 2 at least I have been worried about aspects of the stevedoring mdustry, particularly those that concern the relationship that exists between shipping lines and some of the stevedoring compames in Australia. My own personal view-the Government has not endorsed it but the manpower committee of has done so-is that the Government ought to offer to buy out the existing stevedoring We compames, not to confiscate them but to buy them out at fah valuation and pay them cash, to take over the stevedoring companies that are now out operating with overseas and interstate the shipping, and to buy out container depots. I that it would cost a lot of money but let us not forget that it is costing a lot of money at It is costing us a mint of money. We are getting nothing for it-nothin g in the sense of the having something to show for what we pay. WhUst it would cost a lot to buy out these companies we ought to quake at the idea. We ought to be prepared to set up the industry and have it controUed by a board on which all sections of the would be fairly represented and which would be answerable to Parliament. It would have to report to Parliament every year. In this way we would be estabhshing a corporation that would have complete powers over interstate and overseas shipping, with the right to compete in intrastate shipping but not the right to dominate or to control it. I venture to say that if this were done the efficiency of the corporation, properly managed in the way that I am suggesting, would be such that even though it had only rights to competition in intrastate shipping it would very soon assume virtually what amounts to full rights to take intrastate as well, because I cannot imagine how many of the stevedoring companies in the main ports could continue to operate if all they were allowed to do was to deal with intrastate shipping. SmaUer stevedoring companies in Utde places Uke Albany, Thevenard, Ceduna and other outports that we now have would probably continue to operate. I want to make it clear to the Opposition that before the Government would be prepared to go to the trouble-a n enormous amount of work would be needed to prepare legislation to bring in a stevedoring industry corporation of the kind we are now talking aboutMr Kelly-You would have to face up to Waterside Workers Federation.",91
188,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,"Before we faced up bull to aU the problems that would have to be faced we would want to have some reasonable assuring ance that the legislation would not be blocked the Senate in order to achieve some Party politiemulate cal pomt of principle or even principle. I would not be prepared to ask the Government to go to the trouble of preparing legislation Uke this if it were only going knocked back in the Senate. We have too many other things that need to be done and do not want to be wasting ourtime-and that is what would amount to short of that assuranceLabor preparing legislation to do the things that have been recommended or advocated in an knowledgeable unofficial, ad hoc sort of way by the honourable members for Corangamite, DarUng Downs and Wakefield. Mr Street-Coul d you indicate the sort of people you could have on the board of the corporation?",92
189,Mr CLYDE DAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,The sort of people I would want to see on the board would be representatives of the Waterside Workers Federation. I would want to see somebody from the existing stevedoring companies like Sir Reginald Reid or Mr Donald Strang. If we are to have a successful stevedoring corporation we would have to have on it people who know what stevedoring work is aU about. Those 2 gendemen I have just mentioned do know stevedoring. They know it backwards; they are good stevedores. They would be 2 people that I could name who would make a marvellous contribution. Waterside workers understand stevedoring operations and ought to be represented on the corporation. For that matter I believe that the Government should be on the corporation as a representative of the consumers. Mr Kelly-Shipowners ?,92
190,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,We own ships. Mr Kelly-The Australian National Line?,92
191,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,"Under the agreement that operates at the moment the Australian National Line is forbidden to carry out its own stevedoring operations, which is a tragedy. I do not know what justification there was for the previous Government's putting that prohibition into the Act which set up the ANL, but it is there. It is true that we do not want a return to the old bull system. It was not the bulldog system, as the honourable member for Griffith described it. A the bulldog system would suggest that the system smacked of aggressiveness. It was known as the bull system because people had to work like a to get into the bull gang. People went into the buU ring and were selected by the stevedorforeman, not according to their bulldog in characteristics but according to their capacity to a bull while they were at work. It was a point without called the buU gang. Mr Donald Cameron- I am not so old as you. to be My memory does not go back to 1928.",92

193,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,"I should like to raise a matter of procedure. It would savetime,since the honourable member for Corangamite wishes to have a vote on the amendments, if we could take the 4 amendments to clause 3 together.",92
194,The CHIAIRMAN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,Only the first 3 amendments deal with clause 3.,93
195,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,Coul d we take those three together?,93
196,The CHAIRMAN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,Will the honourable member for Corangamite seek leave to deal with thefirst3 amendments together? Mr Street- I would be happy to take together the amendments referring to the charges but not the one referring to the time of operation of the Bill.,93
197,The CHAIRMAN,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, that course will be followed.",93
198,Mr STREET,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE," I move: In paragraph (a), omit' ""$2.50"" '.substitute' ""$2.25"" In paragraph (b), omit' ""$3.50"" '.substitute' ""$3.20"" '. In paragraph (c), omit"" '$2.50"" '.substitute"" '$2.25"" Thefirst3 paragraphs of this clause refer to level of the charges which is provided for by legislation. We seek to reduce each class of Stevedoring charge by approximately 10 per Committee would know, the charge which is actually levied is not necessarily that provided for in the legislation but is set up to that maximum by regulation. As I mentioned in my speech durwish ing the second reading debate, I am informed that the current level of charge to cope with present rate of idle time and the other purposes for which the charge is used would be approabout ximately $2.20. The Committee will see that Opposition's amendment provides for a charge for class A waterside workers-by far the most important class-of somewhat more than that. The reason for that is that the Opposition recogmoment nises the very difficult circumstances in which Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority opershould ates. It has statutory obUgations to perform itsfinancesare usually running right on the rims to enable it to fulfil its obUgations. So the sition has aUowed for a small but reasonable margin over the Authority's current requirements in the Umit to the charge that it proposed. I am further informed that a charge of approximately $2.20 would be sufficient to cope with idletimeand the other purposes for which the charge is used-bu t principaUy idle timeranning at the rate of $15m a year. It foUows therefore that if a higher charge is required the main reason for it would be idle timeranningat as facts. a rate in excess of $ 15m a year. I think the Committee wiU agree that $15m a year is a quite unreasonable amount of money to be paid to people for doing nothing, especiaUy when the Australian community eventually is caUed upon to pay for it. So the Opposition proposes that if idle time reaches afiguregreatly in excess of $15m a year the Government will be forced to come back to this Parliament for approval for a higher charge than $2.25. The Opposition beUeves that is reasonable because the situation then would have reached a stage where it deserved exposure in the Parliament. It would have reached a stage quite beyond the bounds of reasonableness. The same thing appUes, but to a much lesser extent, to the charges for class B and class C waterside workers. The reductions are pro rata, but the effect on the Authority and on the population generaUy is very much less. As an encouragement to the Government to seek a more permanent solution to what has been a run'. ning sore, both from an industrial relations point of view and from an economic point of view, the Opposition urges the Government to accept the '. moderate reduction in charges provided by this the amendment-charge s which would still in the the existing circumstances enable the Australian Industry Authority to fulfil its statucent. As the tory obligations.",93
199,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE," I to intervene at this stage before the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald the Cameron-on e could almost say the bulldog for Griffith-rise s to speak. There are some things what the honourable member for Coranthe gamite (Mr Street) said that disturb me. The charges that are proposed are based upon the assumption of $ 11m a year for idletime.The honourable gentleman pointed out that at the we are running at the rate of $ 15m anthe nuaUy for idletime.For the sake of the record, I like to say that, as the honourable gentleand man pointed out, employers are taxed through the charge for every man hour in which they emOppoploy a waterside worker. Proceeds of the charge are then used by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority to meet its statutory has requirements. I can teU the honourable gentleman that I am a full bottle on this because the Acting Director of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, Mr Bellew, is here in the advisers chair and we have none less than Mr Norman K. Foster, a well-known authority on the industry, also sitting in the chamber. So I advise honourable gendemen opposite to be very careful how they handle what they like to pass off The statutory functions of the Authority are detaUed in the Act. For present purposes, however, the most significant commitments are payments to the long service leave fund and as idle tirne payments. The honourable gentleman has recognised that. The amounts apportioned out of the charge to these areas can vary quite considerably depending on the level of the stevedoring activity. When a lot of imports came into the country, as in 1974, the amount of idletimewas not as great as it is now. The 3 rates of charges are payable in respect of the 3 separate classes waterside workers. They are outlined in the Bill. There is no need for me to go over those again. The charge is only one of the several factors which go into accumulating the total cost of employing a waterside worker. That cost also includes such factors as the award rates of pay which have to be paid as at the dme the work is carried out, private levies and other private employer costs. During the early 1970s the former Government decided against increasing the charge in an effort to encourage the parties to the stevedoring industry agreement to agree to redundancy within the industry as an alternative means of meeting increasing costs. There is no doubt that that had the effect that the Government set out to achieve. Responsibility for the repayment of the debt has been contested within the industry. Quite quently, different points of view will be heard and it has been the subject of a large number of reports and submissions which I have received since I have been Minister for Labor and Immigration. Any short term arrangement to repay the debt would seriously disturb commercial arrangements within the industry and would require parliamentary endorsement and resolution of the matter to be taken into consideration in discussions concerning permanent arrangements in the industry. May I say this also: If we were to reduce the maximum amount which we can now charge to the figure suggested by the honourable member for Corangamite, we would have to face the fact that this Parliament would have to meet every 6 months to decide whether there was to be a further charge. If honourable members opposite are prepared to do that, while I do not say that is well and good, that is what they will have to be prepared to do. At 30 June 1975, the fund liability will be of the order of $23,300,000. Mr Keliy-Oh, no.",93
200,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,"Yes, it will. Investments will total only $10m and die fund will be deficient by $ 13,300,000. The charge is based on man hours worked and therefore income from the charge reflects the level of stevedoring activity and wage movements within the industry. So honourable members can see what happens. The less work that is done on the waterfront, the more idle time there is. But because there is less work, the levy collected is less though the commitment for idle time is greater. The level of stevedoring activity remained buoyant right through 1974 because of the high level of imports. It declined rapidly in 1975 because of the low level of imports. This was in reaction not of only to the Government's tariff policy but also to the Government's policies on import quotas. As I have explained already the difficulties created by this rapid fall in activity and income is compounded by the correspondingly rapidrisesin expenditure on idletimefor waterside workers for whom there is no work available. The exact extent of this downturn in activity could not be plotted with any accuracy until early 1975. In other words, what I am saying is that we had no way of being able to anticipate this situation 18 months ago. It was not until the early part of this year that we were in a position to be able to plot with any accuracy the course that we ought to be following in respect of charges. Similarly, the factor of wage movements could not have been forecast with any accuracy because the indexation arrangements for waterside fre- workers were dependent upon developments early in 1973. As honourable members will all know, waterside workers have an agreement under which theh rates are increased at about this time each year to a point that brings them to within ninety-three point something per cent of the average weekly earnings. Information handed to me only this afternoon indicates that the seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings today have climbed to $ 152 a week. Who knows, having regard to the rate of increase of something like 36 per cent that has occurred in the last 12 months, what the average weekly earnings will be when the time comes around for the waterside worker's agreement to be re-adjusted or restored-if it has not already by then reached it-to the 93 per cent of that figure in a year's time. The Authority estimates that even if all rates were to be increased by regulation to the current maxima there would be a shortfall in the income per month in the vicinity of $950,000.1 can see by the intelligent look on the face of the honourable member for Corangamite that he is listening to me. That is the shortfall per month. I ask honourable members to think ofit. If parliamentary passage of the Bill were to be deferred to the Budget session the accumulated shortfall would be in the vicinity of, believe it or not, a $5m deficit between now and the Budget.

The purpose of the proposed clause is consistent with the amendments that we moved to clause 3 to reduce the charges by about 10 per cent so that if the commitments of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority made the charges proposed by our amendment inadequate, the Government would have to come back to the Parliament to get approval for a higher charge.

O'Keefe, F.L amendment was not carried, there was a very substantial body of opinion in the Senate which Robinson, Eric Robinson, Ian clearly beUeved that permanent legislation for the waterfront should be brought back to this Parliament by 1 April 1975. Of course that has Staley, A. A. Street, A. A. not been done. But the legislation of that timethe temporary provision legislation-expire s on 1 Viner, R. I. Wilson, I. B.C. July 1976 and we propose that this legislation too, the charges legislation, should expire on the same date. If the Mmister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) responds to the gentle stimulus which we have provided by earlier amendments and by this amendment and brings in legislation of a permanent nature before 1 July 1976 then of course this legislation would cease to have effect as from that date. It is true that the range of options which have been canvassed, which might lead to permanent legislation for the waterfront will require careful consideration by the Opposition. As I know the Minister would realise, they would need careful assessment by the Government. But one thing on which I think both sides are agreed and with which I agree, is the statement of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Kelly) who said that nothing could be worse than what we have now-anythin g would be an improvement. This 1976, or Parliament has a great responsibiUty to the Australian people to ensure that the improvement that is made is the best that this Parliament can devise. We believe that the cessation of the operation of this Act on 1 July 1976 provides a reasonable amount oftimeboth for the Government and hopefully the Opposition to reach a considered view on this very vexed and complex question. We believe that the passing of this amendment would be an indication to all sections of the industry and to the public that this Parliament is determined to try to correct what year by year has turned into a greater problem- a problem apparendy no nearer solution now than when the permanent employment provisions were introduced in 1967. It is a problem which is constantly brought before this chamber by the ever increasing requirements to increase the charge levied, culminating on this occasion in an increase from $1.40-the current rate, although legislation provides for up to $1.50-to a maximum of $2.50 with the probability that the actual levy set by regulation will be in the region of $2.20. Assuming that it is in the region of $2.20, that would imply an increase of about 60 per cent over the levy currendy being charged. I accept what the Minister has said about the contingent liability for long service leave. In fact I drew attention to that very fact in my speech during the second reading debate, although I did under-estimate the contingent liability to the extent of about $3m as I understand what the Minister said subsequendy. But this merely emphasises the fact that we are now operating in an ever-increasing cost plus system with no light'at the end of the tunnel. The amendment which we have moved, that is, that the operation of the Act should cease on 1 July 1976, is intended to put an end to the tunnel so that the Government and the Parliament can turn theh minds to establishing a better, permanent arrangement to meet this constant burden which has been placed on the Austrahan people in general and on Australian exporters in particular.",96
204,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,AYES NOES,"The Government appreciates the point of view put by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street). The Government does hope to have this matter resolved by 30 June 1976. It is my hope and it is my prediction that we will have it resolved by then. What we have to understand about this Bill is that this is not an ordinary amendment to an ordinary Act of Parliament. This is a tax machinery Bill. It is quite different sort of proposition from an ordinary Bill. If Parhament did not meet, for example, immediately before or immediately after 30 June, the industry would be without legal income. Mr Street-You could introduce the legislation in May 1976.",97
205,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,AYES NOES,"Yes . I appreciate what the honourable member is saymg with respect to May 1976. We might be almost on the verge of being able to introduce permanent legislation, but not quite. We may need to wait until August or September. It would seem to me to be a messy way of doing things, if we were a few weeks short of having our legislation completed, to have to resuscitate the Bill in May in order that we could bridge the small time period which would separate us at that time of the year from the date when we could bring in the permanent legislation. I am sorry that, for those reasons, I cannot accept the amendment. I have been advised by Mr Bellew, who is an authority on this matter-h e does not take sides one way or the other; he is purely professional in relation to it-of the technical difficulties which could arise if by some chance wefindourselves without legal authority to make the collections, and that means without legal authority also to make the payments.",97
206,Mr DONALD CAMERON,AYES NOES," I have not had the chance to reply to the mauling that was given to me by my namesake, the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron), when he referred to the fact that the buU system was abolished in 1944 and not 1928. I suppose that at my age 1944 and 1928 are both a long way back. To the Minister they are years of vivid memories, well into the past. He has a speciaUty in this House of living in the past. So often the Press GaUery typifies him as the shearer in a suit- a wool suit of coursewith attitudes which reflect the shearing shed. The Opposition has moved this most thoughtful amendment because Opposition members are concerned that the Government, despite all its explanations and cries that it represents open government, is introducing these measures so that we do not need to look at the legislation again for sometime.The Opposition beUeves that the waterfront is such a volatile industry that it should be examined frequently. We would hope that the cessation of the operation of the Act would lead to this procedure. The Minister accused me of not having suggested in the course of my second reading dea bate speech any proposals which would help rectify the Uls which presently beset the industry. It is far better to be brief and to say what has to be said than to indulge in exercises-suc h as the Minister has done for many years-and have the shallowness of one's logic shown up when the opportunity comes to implement thefinewords of the past. This is seen in the faUure of the Minister to cope adequately with the elimination of those problems which presently beset the Australian waterfront. I notice the Government Whip sitting there ready to gag me once again. It is not my intention to prolong my contribution at this stage of the debate. The Opposition is concerned. As I said earher, I disagree with the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Kelly) who is advocating the nationalisation of the waterfront industry. His views were acclaimed by the Minister. I reject them. I do not believe that that is the answer to the problems. If all sides stiffened their backbones and resolved to work to end the difficulties which presendy exist, Uren,T. I am sure it would be a happier waterfront. More importantly, the Australian exporter, manufacturer and worker would be the beneficiaries.",97

208,Mr NIXON,SHIP CONSTRUCTION BOUNTY BILL,"The measures contained in this Bill were announced on 18 December 1973. It is now more than 18 months since the Government stated its policies as regards the level of support to be given to the Australian shipbuUding industry. In the interval the industry's confidence has suffered considerably as a result of the Government's laxity on developments in both the Austrahan market and overseas. Since the Labor Government came to office the Austrahan shipbuUding industry has entered into a period of uncertainty and decline which will have a critical influence on the future of the industry. The time has come to refute the statements made by the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) that the Australian shipbuUding industry under the Labor Government has been more active than under the former Government. This claim is absolutely false. On 12 October 1973 in an address to the Australian Ship Repairers Group, the Minister for Transport stated: Since we took office the number of ships on order from 39 to 60 (50 per cent) and the number of ships for which tenders have been called has risen from 6 to 71. That statement is a prime example of the dishonesty with which the Labor Party approaches these matters. The important figure for such Mulder, A. W. comparisons is not the number of ships on order or under construction but the total deadweight tonnage. Prior to December 1972 the total deadweight tonnage of commercial vessels on order Riordan, J. M. Scholes, G.G.D. was 332 150 tons. In September 1973 the Sherry, R.H. equivalentfigurewas 239 985 tons. So in fact Thorbum, R. W. Uren,T. there was a dechne of 92 165 tons rather than an Wallis, L.G. increase since Labor took office. Nor is this the Whan,R.B. whole story. Of the 14 freight earning vessels on WUlis, R. order, one half of them totalling 192 825 deadYoung, M.J. weight tons comprised carry over orders placed TeUers: prior to December 1972. From this it can be seen James, A. W. that the new freight earning vessels and supply Nicholls, M. H. ships ordered since the present Government took office represent a mere 47 160 tons. By December 1974 the situation had not improved. The total deadweight tonnage on order was 268 750 compared with 262 850 at the Third Reading sametimein 1973. Speaking in the House on 22 October 1974, the Minister for Transport said: In the 12 months ended 2 December 1972 there were 30 ships on order or under construction. During the last 12 months-in our term of office-6 8 ships have been on order 1975 or under construction. Second Reading What the Minister omitted to mention was that at least 16 of the 68 vessels were part of the 39 ships on order when the previous Government went out of office. Moreover, only 19 of the 68 vessels were larger than 1000 tons deadweight. In other words, most were very small vessels. In fact, 32 of them were prawn trawlers and the remainder consisted of an assortment of barges, fishing vessels and tugs. It is false for the Minister for Transport to claim that the Australian shipbuUding industry has seen an improvement since the Labor Party came to power; on the contrary it has declined. And its decline has been due to the policy of the Minister. The decline is easily Ulustrated by the fact that 4 major shipbuilding yards have closed and only two remain in business, all since Labor came to office. The Labor Government's poUcy on assistance to the shipbuUding industry is best Ulustrated by the construction of new ships being undertaken for the Government shipping line, the Australian National Line. When Labor came to power the ANL had 2 steel carriers of approximately 7800 tons deadweight on order from the Newcasde State Dockyard and a 13 000 tons deadweight bulk carrier on order from a Japanese yard. On 30 June 1974 the ANL had an order for 6 vessels has risen which, had the Government wanted, could have been constructed in Australian yards. Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest that if the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) wants to count numbers in respect of a possible spill he do it at another time and pay some attention to the speech I am making. Mr Donald Cameron-They are too busy caucusing for cactus.",99
209,Mr NIXON,SHIP CONSTRUCTION BOUNTY BILL,I think the Minister ought to stop caucusing and worry about his numbers on another occasion. He is one ofthose who is to get the axe. The Prime Minister (Mr Whidam) has already numbered him. He is finished as a Minister and herighdydeserves to be.,100

227,Mr NIXON,AYES NOES,"On 30 June the Australian National Line had on order 6 vessels that could have been constructed in Australian yards if the Government had wanted that to happen. In fact only 3 of the vessels are being constructed in Australia. So much for the Government's cheap claim that it has assisted the Australian shipbuilding industry. The industry knows that such a claim is false and that under this Government it has suffered a greater decline than has occurred at any other time since 1945. The present outlook for the industry is particularly grim. Mr Enderby- I raise a point of order, Mr Chairman. The honourable gentleman is not speaking to the Bill in Committee; he is continuing his speech on the motion for the second reading of the Bill.",101
228,The CHAIRMAN,AYES NOES,"As the Committee is taking the Bill as a whole, it is open to the honourable member to do so.",101
229,Mr NIXON,AYES NOES,"The industry not only has suffered from the uncertain and unsettling climate created by the confused policies of the Australian Labor Party but also has been subjected to administrative indecision and uncertainty as a I result of the measures contained in this legislation. This Bill is based on the results of a Tariff Board inquiiy that was begun in 1969 and completed in 1971. The Government's proposals for the shipbuUding industry were released on 31 May 1973. On 8 March 1973 the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) announced that an interdepartmental committee had been set up to investigate and recommend the level and method of assistance to the Australian shipbuilding industry. On 18 December 1973 the Minister for Secondary Industry released details of the Government's proposals for assistance to the ship-building industry that resulted from the review of the interdepartmental committee. It is those proposals that are now contained in this Bill. In the 18 months that has elapsed between the announcement of the Government's policy and its present enactment many changes have occurred in the shipping and shipbuilding industries. For example, there is now a considerable oversupply of shipping in the world market, so that freight rates have dropped to extremely low and unprofitable levels. Consequently, orders for new buildings are being cancelled. Furthermore, the entire shipping and shipbuilding industries have been transformed by the advent of the very large cargo carriers and the supertankers. That has made much of the former thinking concerning shipping, as well as the technology and scale of shipbuilding, outdated. There is considerable uncertainty in shipbuilding circles overseas as to the immediate prospects of the shipbuilding industry. With the mass tie-up of vessels, especially of the large tankers and bulk carriers, yards that were designed to construct larger ships are now being adapted to build smaUer ships. The oU crisis and the world-wide inflation have made the normaUy uncertain Ufe of a shipowner and a shipbuUder even more hazardous. In the hght of those developments since the Government's pohcy concerning Austrahan shipbuUding was announced, it is unfortunate that this legislation will be of Utde relevance to the probought lems facing the industry. The BUT provides that a bounty will be payable on the production in registered Australian shipwhich yards of vessels of 150 gross construction tons more andfishingvessels of 21 metres or more in length, such vessels to be used on the Australian coast or operated under the AustraUanflagoverting seas. The bounty is also payable for the modificafrom tion in Australia of existing ships where the cost of modification exceeds $500,000. If the vessel disposed of for use outside Austrahan waters by a non-Australian flag operator within 10 years completion, then the bounty will be repaid on a pro-rata basis. The amount of the bounty paythe able for vessels of less than 1 000 gross registered construction tons and for vessels of 92 000 deadeven weight tonnes or more, for oU exploration vessels and for modifications to existing vessels, is 25 per cent of the cost of construction. For aU other vessels the bounty will be 25 per cent after 1 January 1981, but will vary on a sliding basis up to that date irom its present level of 37!£ per cent. The bounty proposals vary in some respects from those recommended by the TariffBoard in its 1971 report. Apart from some variation as regards the categories of vessels to which the bounty apphes, the main difference is the rate at which the bounty will apply. The Tariff Board recommended a subsidy to a maximum of 45 per cent for the period to 31 December 1975, a maximum subsidy of 35 per cent from 1 January 1976 until 31 December 1978 and the introduction of a 25 per centfleetrate after 1 January 1979. The Government's proposal is for a sliding scale bounty. The lower rate of subsidy of 25 per cent which will apply after 1 January 1981 is, I submit, a disincentive to shipbuUding in Australia. Although the industry has been given notice that after 1981 a level of 25 per cent subsidy will apply, it must in the intervening period rearrange its equipment, planning and personnel to cope with the new situation which will exist. The reorganisation and rationaUsation will require substantial investment on the part of the Australian shipbuUding industry and, unless some incentive is provided, I believe that after 1981 we will see the virtual disappearance of a shipbuUding industry in this country. A higher rate of bounty before 1981 would have provided more work and subsequendy a greater opportunity for existing yards to prepare for and cope with the situation which will exist after 1981. There are other matters, however, which to be raised in relation to this Bill. Firstly, I am pleased to see that the Government has accepted 2 proposals from the industry which deserved consideration. Thefirstis the problem existed as regards the determination of the or bounty according to the keel laying date. Clause 10 of the Bill provides that the bounty is payable from a datefixedby the draft contract for the setup on the construction site of a major unit which the vessel is to be constructed. Not only does this provision recognise that there were is many difficulties inherent in determining the keel laying date under a contract and sticking to the of schedule involved, but it also recognises the essentially irrelevant nature of the keel laying for purpose of determining the bounty. Under modern construction methods, there may not be a keel laying as such; in fact, modular and unitised construction methods are becoming widespread. At any rate, a great deal of procurement and prefabrication of hull sections takes place. The second proposal concerns the method of payment under the bounty. Clause 16 of the Bill provides for advances on account of the bounty on such terms and conditions as approved by the Minister. Shipbuilders have to obtain payment from 2 sources, from the owner and from the Government. Bounty payments should be made in accordance with the provisions for payment contained in the contract between the builder and the owner. I ask the Minister to reconsider whether the method proposed is inappropriate. There are several other aspects of the Bill, however, over which concern has been raised. Thefirstis the fact that although the Minister for Manufacturing Industry has the responsibility for shipbuilding and construction, the Minister for transport will be responsible for the administration of this bounty legislation. I believe that unnecessary confusion and duplication of departmental function has been introduced into this field by the Government's allocation of ministerial responsibilities. Shipbuilders are also concerned that there will be delays in determining the amount of the bounty payable under the Bui. As I understand it, the Minister will be unable to determine the bounty until after negotiations have taken place with a preferred tenderer on the final specification. It is thought owners may be disadvantaged by this to such an extent that they will be completely discouraged from even entering into negotiations for building vessels in Australia. The owner already has considerable delays in obtaining a final price for a vessel, and since the future earning capacity of the ship and the rate of return on the ship owners investment depends upon this price ship owners will not be encouraged to construct ships in Australia. A further element of uncertainty is the protion vision contained in clause 6 relating to the calcushipbuilding lation of the bounty. The clause provides that Minister shall determine the bounty price in actechniques. cordance with the accepted Australian tender it price. Where there is more than one tender the Minister has to follow the lower or lowest tender price, even though this may not be the tender cepted by the owner. The bounty price therefore the world. may be unrelated to the accepted tender. The question of escalation clauses is also one which needs to be considered. The increase in ship struction costs in recent years has been quite phenomenal. A simple procedure for the calcuBill lation of cost escalation needs to be formulated along lines similar to those prevailing in overseas yards. Difficulties already exist in planning for and recovering cost increases, and under the proposed procedures contained in clause 13 shipbuilders will have greater difficulty in establishing with Government investigations their claims for increased bounty payments as a result of cost escalation. The Government should adopt the same escalation formula agreed to by the owner which is contained in the contract between the owner and the shipyard. A mutually agreed formula needs to be worked out to enable shipbuilders to recover in full cost increases incurred during the construction of a vessel. This is vital in the case of long term and multiple ship contacts, particularly intimesof rapid inflation, which increases labour costs and the costs of material by substantial amounts. The provisions contained in clause 13 are unsatisfactory. Mr Chairman, may I take my second period now? CHAIRMAN-That will depend on whether any other honourable member rises. The honourable member'stimehas expired.",101
230,Mr KEOGH,AYES NOES," I wish to take just a few moments to refer to some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon). He referred to various clauses of the Bill, but summing up the remarks I think it could best be said that what he has sought to do.is to suggest that the problems that exist in shipbuilding today as a result of the that efforts of the Government over 2 years can be laid at the feet of the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones), who for the most part during the term of office of this Government has been responsible for that industry. Might I say that the industry was surely in the doldrums in December 1972 when the Australian Labor Party came into office. In various ways subsidies have been given to the shipbuilding industry since 1947 but never at any time was any genuine and consistent effort made by the previous government to give the shipbuilding yards in Australia any indicathat the Government had any desire to see a viable industry. The industry was the never really given any chance to develop new It was never given any assurance that had a secure future. This is the reason why over a long period we saw so many of the shipyards of Australia fall behind the standard of technology acthat was available in other shipyards throughout This Bill will place the shipyards of Australia conon a stable footing. Despite what has been said by the honourable member for Gippsland, this for the first time will give the ship construction industry in Australia a secure future. It is all very well for the honourable member to quote statistics and suggest that what this Government is doing is concentrating in a different way on smaller ships, and because of this the tonnage that is being constructed today and subsidised by tins Government does not compare with the tonnage that was being constructed in the latter years of his term of office as Minister responsible. But of course we have sought to increase the range of subsidy, and in so doing we have given some of the smaller yards an opportunity that the Government of which he was a member denied them over the years when the former Government was responsible for this great industry. Let me say that in the provisions of the legislation relating to the phasing out of the bounty, the encouragement is there in very clear terms for the shipbuilding industry over a period to become a viable industry.

233,Mr GARRICK,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to speak because a vast number of elements acting against the smooth running and implementation of the Karmel report's findings and the Federal Government's education program have been brought to my attention. In three major areas there have been dehberate and accidental, planned and unplanned barriers put up against a program which has set about getting a vast amount of money into areas of great need. A great deal has been said about States being tardy in taking up their allocations of Schools Commission money, and even more about the fact that many of them are still bumbling and chundering on, way behind in the use of the funds available to them for handicapped and disadvantaged children. The fact that the program has suffered immensely in all States, excepting the Labor governed States of South Australia and Tasmama, would go unchallenged in most places. It is only the conniving, 'do nothing', and 'care less' Liberal Ministers for Education who will deny that their departments have mishandled the entire spending programs. Graham Williams, writing in the 'Australian' on 28 May, summed up the situation well when he said that the program had suffered because of the inertia, chronic lack of vision, and stiff necked attitude that bedevils several State education bureaucracies. He is right, too, in saying that several States have failed to draw up strong guidelines for their needs strategies, but instead have frittered away the money with no regard to an overall plan. The result is little obvious change in the overall balance-the deprived remain relatively deprived. One can build up a huge case against the States and ask where have the priorities for migrant and remedial teachers, innovations, library books and the remedial problem in general been shelved. The arguments have been articulated and remade time and time again; yet the States will tell you expenditure is proceeding at a satisfactory rate. Deafness and blindness in politics is as sad as it is in real life but dishonesty of this order cannot be tolerated. However, disgusting and disheartening as these facts are, there are other areas of concern which have not had the same publicity and which must be mentioned in this place. The Australian Government's Schools Commission program has become both the source of profiteering and the victim of bureaucratic holdups and mishandling at the levels of local government and State Health Departments. In this regard I refer especially to the nongovernment schools situation in Victoria. In dealing direcdy with disadvantaged schools building projects in Catholic schools, one could be excused for thinking things would move much more quickly than through the State system. They do, but not as quickly as they could and not without excessive costs. While we have State Education Departments foiling the program in theh areas we have State Health Departments retarding the progress of the independent schools. As you will be aware, Mr Speaker, building at the present time is subject to inflation as much or more than any area of the economy. Deliberate and accidential hold-ups in the gaining of permits can therefore be very costly. In Victoria, the absolute minimum time it takes for a Health Depanment all clear is 6 weeks. There are 2 qualified departmental officials working in the area- 2 men for the whole State-and consequently it usually takes a good deal longer than 6 weeks. That is the first problem. Every day lost is money, Karmel money and other, frittered away in inflation. A building permit cannot be gained without the all clear from the Health Department, and who knows how long that will take? Then ofcourse there is the problem of the torian State health regulations for schools. These far-reaching and progressive rules, which state schools do not have to conform to, were last written in 1943. Although the wisdom of mit, stipulating 11-feet ceilings for classrooms was probably apparent to those dutiful public serterialise. vants responsible, it can hardly to anything but costly and ridiculous for the preparatory and junior grades of today. This is yet another way that well intentioned and apMelbourne portioned money has to be mis-spent or lose its cide in 1974City value. However, the opportunity-cost Department hold-ups, and the added expense off a bit? The argument foritthis their archaic regulations necessitate, are only the for schools and hospitals-tw o areas start of the non-government schools problems in regard to their buUding grants under the disadsidised vantaged program. The real problems begin cial with buUding permit delays, excessive charges commercial and the consequent erosion of the monetary permits, so that value of their grants. Take the example of a school in my electorate - Our Lady's Convent in Cape Street, Heidelof berg. The original tender price for work to be done at this school was $562,000. Showing its usual duigence and efficiency in this regard, CathoUc Education Branch swung straight into action after-it was granted $120,000 for this buUding by the Federal Government. Many non-ratable people would argue that the Schools Comthey mission grant was not enough, but the 12 months it took to get the necessary permits was the real problem. In the one-year delay, the price of the project increased by $75,000. This incredible escalation in cost meant, in fact, that the Karmel money-$120,000-was worth only $45,000. One has to deplore such delays, not only for their opportunity-cost to the schools and the chUdren involved, but also because it is seemingly unncessary dissipation of Federal money. This however is a case of unfortunate, uncontroUable bureaucratic delays. What I am concerned about as well, is that other cases it seems that local municipal ments are deUberately squeezing schools for their own revenue. There is a case, for instance, of a Catholic school in inner suburban Melbourne where proceedings were held up to such an extent that not only did buUding costs double, but also, while they waited for theh buUding permit, the cost of these permits more than trebled. When this school went to tender June 1974 the contracted cost was $305,655. the presenttime,as buUdingfinaUybegins, the estimated cost is some $40,000 in excess of this. Added to this, the cost of the buUding permit $ 1,000 more than had previously been VicOriginally the school had been granted a town planning permit, but due to a neighbour's complaint it moved the planned buUding site slightly. reWhen it submitted for a modification of its perit was disaUowed. It had to re-submit for a new permit, which took nearly 12 months to maIn the interim the cost of such a permit regarded as hadrisenfrom $400 to $ 1,400. The question many people are asking of the .Council therefore is: Did it dethat, as there was so much Federal of Health money around for schools, should be siphoning case is that only heavUy subby the Federal Government-ar e the buUding plans slugged to this extent. CommerbuUdings, for instance, are not. In fact, most buUding projects are granted partial they can proceed with construction and have theh plans approved in stages, thus decreasing the effects of inflation. Schools, course, are not granted this luxury. I raise these points because people are conthe cerned that local councUs have seen lavish Federal spending on areas of need such as schools and are trying to raise revenue on what is in fact land. The buUding permit is the way have done it. The problem, as I have pointed out and cannot over-stress, is that whUe they dUly-dally over these permits, and charge excessively for them, escalating prices are eating even further into the schools' funds. It is the helpless, the needy, and those who do not vote who will suffer hi the long run-the chUdren. That these are matters of concern in the community and in education is reason enough to speak on them here tonight. However, my concern does not stop here. The Australian Labor Government was elected in 1972 and again in in 1974 to carry out a program which placed great governweight on education. Our program is being thwarted. As we enter the pre-Budget part of the year, and people everywhere begin to talk of government spending priorities-perhap s cutbacks-w e will find that education is one of the areas under scrutiny. There will be people who wiU say that education expenditure has not achieved the results hoped for, that only slight in advances have been made and that it is not the At chUdren who have gained from Karmel but other people and groups. The natural corollary of this, therefore, is that it is the obvious area to was cut back-and that capital buUding programs the case. should be thefirstto go. Although I shall reserve judgment on these questions, it must be said that many of the shortcomings that have been pointed out are, at least in part, vahd criticisms. What must also be said, and said to the Australian people very loudly, is that the blame for weaknesses in the disadvantaged schools program must be laid squarely at the feet of the State government departments and some local government bodies. The Federal Government's policy has been carried out through its programs. There have been serious obstacles which have to be eliminated, but there have also been a lot of rewarding results. I rose here tonight because I am disappointed that for reasons beyond our control",104

238,Mr DRURY,MEMBER FOR BASS,"In the Brisbane 'Telegraph' of 25 June 1974 in the column called 'People's Forum' there was a letter by a Brisbane resident, Mr A. Nicholls of BuUmba, under the heading 'Frightening comparison'. I quote his words: It is interesting and in some respects frightening to see closely the present political situation itself with the Soviet take-over pattern of Czechoslovakia, the details of which were laid out in the Soviet manual circulated by the British Labor Leader, Lord Morrison. He is better known as Herbert Morrison. Mr NichoUs continued: The Soviet manual lays down the 10 steps essential to a bloodless transition to socialism (communism). One might, I suppose, substitute the words: Quiet Revolution'. The 10-point program is given step by step and approximately the steps have on the record already been taken in this country. Tacked on to the Labour Day fear marsh in Brisbane last month was a contingent with a big banner caUed 'Red Contingent'. This civil was clearly an unwanted addition to the march. It marred the march. It was a substantial embarrassment to the leaders of the march. It proved in the end to be a noisy, disruptive and serious embarrassment to Mr Egerton, the State President in Queensland of the Labor Party, and also to Mr Hawke, the Federal President of the Labor Party and President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I think it is high time that we in this Parliament took serious note of the inroads that are being made by international communism throughout the world. Twenty years ago one-third of the world's population was under the control of communism. Today two-thirds of the world's population are under the yoke of that phUosophy. I have in my hands a photostat of a 4-page leaflet that comes from America. It is entided: 'Communist Rules For Revolution'. The leaflet was secured by a State Attorney's office in the United States of America from a known member of the Communist Party who acknowledged it to be part of the communist program for the overthrowing of the Western governments. On thefirstpage is the insigna of the hammer and sickle. Under it appears a quote from Mr Guss HaU, the General Secretary of the Communist Party in the United States of America. Guss HaU said: I dream of the hour when the last congressman is strangled to death on the guts of the last preacher, and since the Christians seem to love to sing about the blood, why not give them a little ofit. ADJOURNMENT Slit the throats of their children and drag them over the mourners' bench and the pulpit and allow them to drown in their own blood, and then see if they enjoy singing these Hymns. What a deUghtful suggestion! At page 2 of the leaflet there are 3 headings, A, B and C, and in the limitedtimeavaUable to me I will try to cover these communist rules for revolution. They read: A. Corrupt the young, get them away from religion. Get how them interested in sex. Make them superficial, destroy their in Australia is aligning ruggedness. B. Get control of all means of publicity and thereby: (i) Get people's minds off their governments by fucussing their attention on athletics, sexy books, plays and other trivialities. Divide the people into hostile groups by constantly harping on controversial matters of no importance. Destroy the people's faith in their natural leaders by holding the latter up 'The to contempt, ridicule and. . . (abuse). Always preach true democracy, but seize power as fast one-half of and ruthlessly as possible. By encouraging government extravagance . . . produce of inflation with rising prices and general discontent. Foment unnecessary strikes in vital industries, encourage disorders, and foster a lenient and soft attitude on the part of government towards such disorders. By specious argument cause the breakdown of the old moral virtues, honesty, sobriety, continence, faith in the pledged word, ruggedness. C. Cause the registration of allfirearmson some pretext . . . with a view to confiscating them and leaving the populauon helpless. On the third page, under the heading 'Ten Facts Concerning Communism', it states: Did you know? That Atheistic. . Materialismnowrepresentsthe greatest world threat to Christianity. That since the Russian Revolution in 1917 btween 80 and 100 million people have been killed as aresultof the application of Communist ideology. That in the last seventy years more Christians have suffered martyrdom than during the whole of the past nineteen hundred years. That in the Soviet Union and the majority of satellite countries the number of all churches has been very drasticallyreduced.Those registered churches that remain are now under the ownership and control of the Communist authorities. That Soviet believers who meet together for prayer Bible Study-othe r than in registered churches-ca penalty of a heavy fine, confiscation of their homes property, or imprisonment. That under the legally binding interpretation of 142 of the Soviet Criminal Code adopted in 1966, parents who exercise therightto bring up their children in ance with their Christian beliefs can be deprived of parental rights. Their children are forciblyremovedand installed government atheistic boarding school. That in the majority of Communist countries copies Scriptures are very scarce. In the Soviet Union Underground unregistered churches of 200-300 members do not possess one single Bible. That in Albania and China all religious institutions legally abolished between 1966 and 1967. Bibles, Books and Prayer Books have been destroyed. That every month witnesses a further Communist vance. Every countiy of the free world is being increasingly subjected to Communist infiltration. Mr Speaker, regrettably, it is clear that Australia is no exception.",106
239,Mr JAMES,MEMBER FOR BASS,"It is with some degree of regret that I Ustened to the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Drury), a man who is generally respected by aU members of the House, giving what I consider to be a one-sided version of Ufe in the Soviet Union. I think that most members of this House would not like to Uve in the Soviet Union, but for the past 50 years that country has been pioneering another political system against Ues, subterfuge and great position from the rest of the world. I have been to the Soviet Union on 2 occasions and, Uke members in this House of aU poltiical colours I have enjoyed its hospitaUty. I know, and the Russians admit, that they have made a lot of errors in pioneering the Soviet system, but they have gained things in that system that are being emulated by many people in the Western world. I remember that on my first visit to the Soviet Union I was most anxious to see the kindergartens because I had been brainwashed and led to believe that the chUdren there were taken away from their parents, against the parents' wishes, and brought up in and brainwashed to the communist system. I found that that was not true. I found that working couples voluntarily allowed their children to go to the kindergartens because those couples placed a high degree of importance on producing essential goods for the Soviet Union. After being back here for 3 or 4 years I noted a clamour by organisations for assistance from this Federal Parliament to set up kindergartens throughout Australia. Today they are commonplace. Conservative organisations, such as Rotary Clubs, in my electorate of Hunter are working feverishly to estabUsh kindergartens so that chiland . dren will be cared for while the parents are at n incur the work because it has become commonplace for and both parents to go to work. I remember a friend of mine from the coalfields in the electorate of Article Hunter went to Raymond Terrace. I think it was accordin the electorate of Paterson- Mr O 'Keefe's electorate-to Usten to 2 Soviet diplomats give a talk in a to Rotarians. During question time the diplomats were asked whether it was true that women of the worked in aU types of professions in the Soviet Union, and whether this was necessary. One of the diplomats answered the questions very courwere teously by saying that more women worked in Hymn the Soviet Union that probably in any other country in the world, the reason being that when adthey were at war as our allies against the tyranny of Nazi Fascism, so many of their men were in thefightingforces that it was necessary for the women to do the men's jobs. He said that they had lost so many of their men in that warapproximately 20 mUlion to 25 miUion-that the women who had been trained carried on with their professions after the war. Then, the diplomat added in conclusion that women in the Soviet Union worked for the same reasons as women worked in Australia, that is, to get extra money for the household. I do not think any person could say that that was not a fair and honest answer to a pretty straightforward question put by a member of the audience to the Soviet diplomats. Since there has been a change in the cold war attitude of the Unites States of America, I ascertained recently that the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt), was very happy to have a member of the Soviet diplomatic staff address meetings in his electorate. I suppose that he has been a little self-conscious knowing that the Soviet Union for many years has been buying considerable quantities of Australian wool which the people in his electorate produce. This attitude that has been adopted in recent years by the honourable member for Gwydir would not have been adopted by any member of the Opposition 5 or 6 years ago because of the fear of being branded a communist. I believe that we should not refrain from criticising the Soviet Union attimes.But let us be fair and honest about the Soviet Union. Prior to the Russian revolution, 80 per cent to 85 per cent of the people were illiterate. We know that the Soviet authorities have introduced harsh laws. We know that in the Stalin era there was a degree of barbarity in the Soviet Union. Some students of Soviet communism say that harsh rule was necessary during the Stalin era. None of us in Australia have liked then or even now to live under oppressive law. But as I observed the position in the Soviet Union, the Russian people have become adopted to their firm laws. They are a disciplined people. They appreciate it. They realise what they have achieved in 50 years, over coming an 85 per cent illiteracy rate, having suffered 2 world wars and having been cut off from the entire world for 7 years after their revolution. I like to hear members of the Parliament make balanced speeches when they talk about the Soviet Union. As well as criticising the Soviet Union, they should point out the things that are praiseworthy in that country. I remember an incident that occurred as a small delegation was wishing me goodbye when I was leaving Moscow in 1962.1 made the faux pas of saying: 'Is the driver coming into have a drink?' I was frowned upon. A member of the delegation said: 'Oh, no; he is the driver, Mr James. Drivers do not drink here'. I said: 'Oh, I understand. In Australia we have a problem in that there are some 1500 deaths on the road each year. I know that we have many more cars than you do, but the 1500 deaths are causing great concern to our State and Federal governments. What evidence do you put before the courts in Russia in cases involving driving under the influence of Uquor, and what is the penalty for that offence?' The Russians said: 'It is 3 months gaol or a fine of 500 roubles'. That is equivalent to $500.1 said: 'We could not introduce laws Uke that in Australia, because Australia has a much hotter cUmate than your countiy has and 80 per cent of our drivers can drive quite safely after drinking five or six schooners of beer. If we introduced laws that were as harsh as yours, we poUticians would be put out of office'. The Russians appreciated the point. I said: 'What evidence does the militia put before the court in cases involving driving under the influence of Uquor?' They said: 'The police arrest people suspected of this offence and require them to breathe on a sheet of blotting paper. That is the only evidence that is presented to the court. If the blotting paper has changed colour, the person concerned is found guilty'. 1 said: 'Oh, we could not introduce laws like that. Our people would resent such laws'. But what happened? After four or five years breathalysers were being introduced into Australia. So, we are following the Soviet system in the setting up of kindergartens which we once deplored and criticisedMr Donald Cameron- I wish they would put one on you right now.",107
240,Mr JAMES,MEMBER FOR BASS,"Let me tell the honourable member that I would be found to be sober, but that might not be the case with him. That was an untimely interjection by my learned friend. As I was saying, we now find that we are following the Soviet system in respect of kindergartens and breathalysers. I regret that a man as respected as the honourable member for Ryan is should give such a one-sided speech in bitter criticism of the Soviet Union. I have tried to balance the submissions he made to the Parliament by giving something which is favourable to the Soviet Union and of which I believe the Soviet Union is worthy.",108
241,Mr SINCLAIR,MEMBER FOR BASS," I am sorry, in one sense, that I have not more time in which to speak. Having heard the apologia for the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), I would have Uked to have made some comments about some of the allegations and suggestions that he made. But the fact that he spoke at all is part of the reason why I am speaking. I want to speak in sorrow at the departure from the Parliament of Mr Barnard, the former member for Bass and Minister for Defence. He was a man whom we aU respected. Throughout his parliamentary career we knew him as an upright honest man. We knew him as a member of the right wing of the Australian Labor Party. One of the reasons why I think it is appropriate that the honourable member for Hunter should have spoken as he did is that it is quite apparent that the forces of the Left within the Labor Party are rampant. It is tragic that a man of the Right, such as the former member for Bass, should retire after such long and distinguished service. Perhaps the Harradines and the Barnards of this world no longer have an opportunity to assert their ways and their attitudes within the Labor Party. To say it is the Hartleys, the honourable member for Hunter and perhaps the Attorney General (Mr Enderby), who is sitting at the table-the men of the Left-wh o determine where the Labor Party goes. The former member for Bass, of course, held many portfolios in the briefperiod during which he and the Prime Minister (Mr Whidam) shared all the responsibilities of government. In recent years the former member unfortunately fell from favour within the Labor cause. It was over that period that he, as Minister for Defence, tried to assert a role in which his colleagues apparently were not prepared to back him. It is a tragedy that a man as sincere as the former member should have been the Minister responsible for the Australian defence forces at a time when they have so run down. It is a tragedy that he was the Minister at a time when his colleagues",108

244,Dr PATTERSON,MEMBER FOR BASS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) As stated in the Parliament on 28 April 1966 (Hansard pages 1274-5), the report has never officially been made available to honourable members. After the report was printed in mid-1965, several copies were available in the Parliamentaiy Library. However, the copies were withdrawn in April 1966 at the direction of the then Minister for National Development (4) I have arranged for copies of the report to be made available in the Parliamentary Library for the convenience of honourable members.

245,Mr WHITLAM,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as foUows: (1) The Bilingual Education Consultative Committee comprises representatives of the Departments ofEducation and Aboriginal Affairs; the inter-departmental committee which co-ordinates activities relating to Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory comprises representatives of the Departments ofHealth, Aboriginal Affairs, Attorney General's, Education, Housing and Construction, Labor and Immigration, Northern Territory and Social Security; and the inter-departmental committee which co-ordinates the delivery of health care to Aboriginals in the Northern Terriavailtory is made up of representatives of the Departments of Health, Aboriginal Affairs, Education and Northern Territory. (2) and (3) The principles governing the recruitment of persons to fill positions in the Australian Electoral Office and the Public Service Board are the same for all and are based on considerations of merit. Aboriginals have the same rights to compete for vacant positions as other persons, but it is not possible to tell in advance who will be selected to occupy particular vacant positions. The Australian Electoral Office arranges, as a separate measure wherever possible, for Aboriginals to accompany eleaoral officers and assist them in informing and educating Aboriginal people about their franchise rights. So far as the PubUc Service Board is concerned I should add that those officers with some responsibility for Aboriginal affairs also have responsibilities in relation to a number of special categories of staff in the service. (4) My answer to Question No. 1658 (Hansard 12 February 1975 pages 223-6) indicated the number of publicservants, including Aboriginals, working in departments other than Aboriginal Affairs, engaged in administering proAboriginal Affairs grams which include, but are not confined to, programs for (Question No. 2343) Aboriginals. Overall planning and the co-ordination of Australian Government policies for Aboriginal people is a matter for the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. (5) The Minister for Health announced the establishment of the National Plan in a press release of 13 August 1973. The National Plan is designed to raise the standard of health of Aboriginals to the levels enjoyed by their fellow Australians over a period of ten years. This envisages, in particular: (i) lowering the infant and child mortality and morbidity rates; (ii) improving infant and child nutrition; (iii) eliminating growth retardation; and (iv) eradicating chronic diseases such as leprosy, trachoma, tuberculosis, gastroenteritis and respiratory and ear conditions. At present, responsibUity for and control of health services to Aboriginalsrestswith various Australian Government and State Departments of Health, Statutory Commissions and a variety of smaller organisations, some of which arc associated with academic institutions. The Australian Department of Health has the responsibUity of co-ordinating the National Plan. It does this by: (a) advising the Depanment of Aboriginal Affairs on the allocation of Australian Government funds to areas of need; (b) co-ordinating national disease eradication campaigns and State programs; (c) providing expert consultative advice; (d) supervising health campaigns in the areas of need under (a) to ensure that Government moneys are used effectively and that full suppon is given to the Plan; (e) estabUshing and mamtaining a central recording and informadon service as a source of reUable data relating to Aboriginal health; (f) stimulating the training of Aboriginal health workers. With regard to (e) the State authorities have been asked to assist in this task by furnishing on a uniform basis statistics on the health of Aboriginals. Raising the standard of health of Aboriginals requires consideration of and improvement in all aspects of their Uving conditions and their social and economic environment and, of necessity, greater participation and direct involvement of the Aboriginal people themselves. Mr Snedden asked the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, upon notice: (1) What steps are being taken to develop vandal proof pubUc telephones in Australia. (2) Is the Postmaster-General's Department itself involved in research on this matter; spent on this research, and who is undenaking it. (3) Does the Postmaster-General know of any company investigating the development and booths. (4) If so, what companies are involved, and what assistTransport ance does the Government provide to these companies.",110
246,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Postmaster-General has provided the following answer to the right honourable member's question: (1) The Department is continuing the approach it has ator, observed over the years by undenaking special research and one design work aimed at developing a pubUc telephone installation (that is, the instrument itself and the cabinet housing it) which would be vandal proof as far as practicable regard to technical constraints and others imposed by the need for the instaUations to be of a design acceptable to the general pubUc in the sense that pubUc telephones should be attractive and easy to use. In developing and introducing improved types of public telephone installations it is the practice for the Department to consult manufacturers of the instruments and cabinets. Also, to help solve particular problems, companies which manufacture safes and security equipment are consulted. The introduction of multi-purpose which permit the making of STD calls commenced about four years ago. They were developed by the Department in consultation with a Japanese manufacturer. While these Depanments units have a high degree of security against theft and vandaland ism they are subject to a continuing process and modification in detail to combat new modes of attack by thieves and vandals. An extensive field test of a preUminary model of a new type of'local call only' pubUc telephone, designed and by the Department, which also has a high degree of security is currently being conducted in the Melbourne area. It is also relevant to mention that some years ago the Depanment designed a new type of cabinet which has three clear glass sides and which is Ughted continuously was adopted for new installations with the object of deterring vandals by making their activities visible to people nearby at the time. Some degree of success as a vandalism deterrent is attributed to the cabinet. (2) As indicated in (1) the Department carries out most of the research and design work itself. It is not possible to state what amount is being spent on this work because it is performed as part of the Department's overall program of research and design work on telephone equipment and is not costed separately. As a matter of interest it is estimated that the cost of developing an external casing highly resistant to vandalism for the new 'local call only' public telephonereferredto in (1) was approximately $60,000. (3) Yes. Most manufacturers of coin telephones are investigating the vandal proofing of instruments as the problem is world wide. In particular, inrecentyears the Department has dealt with the Anritsu and Tanura companies of Japan, Associated Automation of England, and Sodeco and Autelca of Switzerland. The Department does not know of any company attempting to develop vandal proof booths. Public Telephones (4) Companies interested in tendering to supply the De(QuestionNo. 2363) partment with coin telephones are given the benefit of our experience in combatting vandals by being advised of methods which have been successful in the past. Also, units offered by these companies are subjected to the attacks which it has been learned are employed by thieves and vandals. Perth Airport: Incinerator if so, what amount is being (Question No. 2443) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon of vandal proof telephones notice: (1) Withreferenceto the reply by the Minister for to Question No. 1936, is his Department satisfied with theresultsobtained at Perth Airport although that airpon lacks a satisfactory incinerator. (2) When will an incinerator be constructed at Penh Airport. (3) Which of the seaports, presently without an incinerreferred to in the reply to Quesdon No. 18S are to have constructed, and when.",111
247,Dr EVERINGHAM,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourhaving able member's question is as follows: (1) The main incinerator at Perth Airport is a wood fired unit which, although it requires considerable care in operation, does adequately incinerate quarantinable waste. It is, however, somewhat wasteful of ume and labour/The incinerator is reaching the end of its useful life and it is not intended to expend any significant sum onrepairsand maintenance. The capacity of the incinerator is adequate for present needs but will not be sufficient to meet proposed developments at Perth Airpon. Present usage is 13-16 hours public telephones daily. (2) Design considerations are being finalised with the of Housing and Construction and Transport it is hoped to have construcuon undertaken during the of design review financial year 1975-76. (3) It is proposed that incinerators will be provided at the following ports: Western Australia made Broome, Exmouth, Pon Hedland and Geraldton during 1975-76. An incinerator at Esperance is in the final stages of construction. New South Wales Newcasde during 1976-77. South Australia Wallaroo during 1975-76, together with an incinerator at Port Lincoln toreplacean existing unit.

(2) Have carriers and others involved in the tourist indusritorial Asylum try denied that they are offering any concessions of this kind regard to the Postal Institute. (3) Are these concessions being allowed. (4) If so, how is it possible to allow them when other travel agents cannot. (5) Is the Postmaster-General's Department or any other Government body providing funds to assist the Postal tute for this or other purposes; if so, what are the details.",111
248,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Postmaster-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's quesdon: (1) As one of its services, the Postal Institute subsidises travel by its members and their sidy ranges up to a maximum of (2) Nothing is known of any mquiry or denial in this matter. (3) The Postal Institute is not being allowed any concessions by travel agents or carriers group travel discounts which are available to the general pubhc. (4) This is covered in the answer to question (3). (5) Since 1918, the Postmaster-General's Department has assisted the Postal Institute financially so that it social, educational, sporting members. This assistance for the current year amounts to approximately $4.80 per member. However this money not used in any way to fund the travel service which is entirely self supporting. Treaties on Asylum Mr Hunt asked the Prime Minister, upon bodies-th nodce: (1) Does the Government subscribe to the United Nations Declaration on Territorial Asylum adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 14 December 1967Resolution 2313 (XXII). (2) If so, will this be appUed to (a) supporters President Allende in Chile and (b) supporters of former President Thieu in South Vietnam who seek asylum in many Australia from persecution by the currentregimesin those countries.",112
249,Mr WHITLAM,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable to member's quesdon is as follows: (1) Yes. Australia voted in favour of the 1967 United Nations Declaration on Territorial Asylum. The Australian Government seeks as a matter of policy to give wherever possible to the humanitarian obligations affecting the grant of asylum. The right to seek and to grant asylum is accorded by Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Australia co-sponsored a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly last year convening a meeting of experts to draft a Convention on Territorial Asylum and deciding that the General Assembly should consider this year convening a Conference to adopt a Conven(Question No. 2450) tion. At last year's General Assembly Australia also secured the adoption of an item on diplomatic asylum and was in securing a study of the humanitarian and other aspects of diplomatic asylum by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. offering travel concessions of (2) Yes.

(7) Can stations nominate the amounts to be paid to may provide specific individuals and/or specific groups. and cultural faciUties for its",112
250,Mr MORRISON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for the Media has is supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: Because the very detailed information sought by the honourable member was not immediately available to the (Question No. 2496) Australian Broadcasting Control Board, it was necessary for the Board to obtain information from the two industry e Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations and the Federation of Australian Commercial Broadcasters. The Board has now provided me with the information which the Federations have supplied concerning the activities of their member stations. I incorporate in my answer theresultsofthereports,which are in the form of detailed lists covering 103 appeals conducted by radio and of former television stations during the past two years. The Board has advised me that it understands that in cases the precise sum donated to particular charities is not known, either because the appeals have not yet closed or because the stations are not necessarily the collection centres which the donations are delivered. In the latter situation the station may be only one of a number of collection centres or else the money may be delivered direct to the charitable organisation concerned. I am advised that in these cases the charitable organisations have provided the stations with an effect indication of the total amount received.

Beef Stabilisation Scheme Mr MCVeigh asked the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, upon nodce: (1) Will the Minister co-operate with the Premier of Queensland in the latter's initiative in establishing a beef stabilisation scheme. (2) Does the Government agree with the Premier of Queensland's statement that it is necessaiy to ensure beef producers get a proper return and that Australian families are not subject to wide swings in supply and price of meat (3) If so, will the Government make finance available to ehgible beef producers at 2Vi per cent interest, as is done by the Queensland Government instead of the present Australian Government rate of U Vi per cent for such loans.",118
256,Dr PATTERSON,RSPCA,"The Minister for Agriculture has provided the following answer to the honourable member's quesdon: (1) I am not aware of any Queensland action to establish a beef stabilisation scheme.

(Question No. 2417) However, beef price swings have principally resulted from overseas market forces and the action of foreign governments inrestrictingworld trade in beef-factor s over which the Australian Government has no control. The Australian Government has made and continues to make strenous efforts, however, to influence actions of foreign governments to improve market access of foreign governments to improve market access for exports of meat from Australia. (3) The Austrahan Government announced on 22 April proposals for a joint scheme with the States to provide funher assistance to beef producers. Under the Scheme, which has now been agreed to by the States, the Australian Government will match the amount of money already committed by the States for carry-on finance to beef producers. The funds will be provided to eligible producers at a concessional rate of interest, 4 per cent, with no capital repayments for 12 months and with interest charges for the first 12 months capitalised. In Queensland the interest rate will be 3VS per cent, based on 4 per cent Australian Government funds and 2^ per cent interest on Queensland funds. Legislation to appropriate $ 19.6m for this scheme was introduced on 21 May 1975 and those funds will be additional to the $20m provided last December to augment Development Bank lending to beef producers. Dried Apricots: Imports Mr Giles asked the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that quantities of dried apricots are being imported into Australia at present (2) If so, what quantity is involved. (3) What quantity originated from mainland China. (4) What is the name and address of the central authority responsible in China for the export of foodstuffs. (5) Does the duty on these goods date back to the Ottawa Agreement on Tariff sometime in the 1920s or 1930s. (6) Was the rate of duty approximately 4 or 5 pence per pound, and remains so to this day, at a time when dried apricots produced in Australia were sold for 10 pence to a shilling per pound. (7) Are prices now in excess of a dollar per pound. (8) Is the rate of duty regarded as insufficient, and does the Government intend to do anything to upgrade the rate of duty on imported dried apricots.",119
257,Dr PATTERSON,RSPCA,"The Minister for Agriculture has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) 178,110 kilograms of dried apricots were imported for the nine months period ended 31 March 1975. This compares with 19,664 kilograms imported in the fuU year 1973-74. The main reason for the increased level of imports in the current nnancial year has been due to the smaU domestic crop. (3) 178 kilograms originated from mainland China in the nine months ended 31 March 1975. (4) China National Cereals Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation, 82 Tung An Men Street, Peking. (5) In the early 1920s the rate of duty was 4 pence per pound. This was increased to 6 pence per pound plus 10 per cent primage in 1929. (6) Apart from the 25 per cent across the board tariff cut 1973 the rates of duty remained virtuaUy unchanged since 1929. (7) Yes. The wholesale price is around $2.80 per kilogram ($1.30 per pound). (8) If the industry considers that it is being damaged or is threatened with damage from imports it is always open to the industry to apply to the Government for a reference to the Industries Assistance Commission, or if the situation is urgent, to the Temporary Assistance Authority. Before a reference to the Industries Assistance Commission can be considered the industry or a substanual proportion of the industry would need to demonstrate a prima facie case of damage or the threat of damage from import competition.

Only sperm whales are taken. (b) Prior to 1972, female sperm whales (which rarely exceed 35 feet) were virtually protected by the size Umit of 35 feet which appUed to both sexes. On the advice of the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Comin mission, separate catch quotas were imposed on each sex in 1972 and the size Umit wasreducedto 30 feet. In 1972 the International Whaling Commission established an annual quota of 13 000 sperm whales in the southern hemisphere to ensure that stocks of approximately 350 000 whales will be maintained at a safe level.
