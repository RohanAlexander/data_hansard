1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sii Elliot Johnson) took the chair At 3 p.m., and read prayers, PRIVILEGE.",19
2,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"I have just found in my letter-box an intimation that a lecture on Anglo-American relationships is to he delivered to-night in 'the Senate club-room, by a Washington professor. I do not wish to throw any reflections on the gentleman who is to lecture, but I suggest to you, Mr Speaker, and, through you, to the House, that at this juncture to allow an unauthorized and irresponsible person to deliver a lecture within the precincts of the House on such a difficult and dangerous subject iB open to very grave objection. I call your attention also 'to the fact that the .parliamentary building is being used frequently for advertising purposes, and that members have sometimes sat listening to lectures the substance of which could easily have been obtained from any elementary textbook. It is derogatory to the dignity of Parliament to have lecturers coming here to inform us on matters about which we should be fairly well ('acquainted, and there are methods by which these gentlemen could obtain the publicity that they wish other than by the use of naxhamentary accommodation.",19
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," The honourable"" member'scomplaint concerns the President of the Senate rather than me, because the - Senate club-room, together with all other accommodation reserved for senators, is wholly under his control; but I shall bring the observations just made under hia notice As to the using of the parliamentary building for advertising, I myself have had occasion to take exception to it more than once, and have refused permission, when appeals have been made to me, for the holding of exhibitions which I have considered would have purely a commercial advertising purpose. There have been occasions when, with the permission of  Hall has been used for exhibitions which it was considered would be of an intellectual and informative character, and of interest to members generally. In this connection I might say that something of the kind is contemplated next week, in the nature of a musical programme associated with "" music week "" under the direction of a University Professor, to which, I think, no real objection can be taken. Members might obtain from the entertainment some relief from the tension and nervous irritation sometimes created by political discussion; but if serious objection is offered to what is proposed,- I shall confer wibh the President of the Senate with a view to preventing the use of the Queen's Hall for similar purposes in future.'

6,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Las t week I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) if he had noticed that a prominent member of - the Nationalist party had advocated the use of indentured labour for the development of Central Australia, and whether, as leader of the party, he did so. The right honourable gentleman emphatically denied that he advocated any such thing, arid I have since received the following telegram from the member to whom I referredDo not blame you asking question, but I did not advocate indentured labour, let alone black labour. On contrary, I stated that like every other member I was for White Australian policy. Naturally I did not mention what Government was or . was not in favour of. Newspapers reported exactly what I did not Bay. GUTHBIE. I did not at the time mention any name, but I feel hound to make this statement to prevent injustice being done to Senator Guthrie.

10,Mr MATHEWS,HOME FOR TUBERCULAR,"On a point of order, is the honourable member in order in referring to newspaper reports when asking a question?",21
11,Mr SPEAKER,HOME FOR TUBERCULAR,"If the honourable member were to ask his question without reference to any newspaper report, he would be in order, but a question founded, upon newspaper paragraphs and reports can be asked only if the honourable member asking the question makes himself personally responsible for the accuracy of the statement he is quoting.",21
12,Mr FOWLER,HOME FOR TUBERCULAR,"Is the Prime Minister aware that certain preposterous statements have been made in a certain London newspaper regarding the condition of parts of Australia, particularly the north-west and Queensland?",21
13,Mr SPEAKER,HOME FOR TUBERCULAR,"I have already reminded honourable members that questions founded upon newspaper statements are not in order, but I intimated to the honourable member that if he asked his ques- tion without reference to any newspaper, I would not know whether or not it was founded upon a newspaper report..",21
14,Mr FOWLER,HOME FOR TUBERCULAR,Will the Prime Minister take steps to have sent to the High Commissioner's office in London all available information regarding those parts of Australia that are still awaiting occupation and development in order that the people of Great Britain may be advised authoritatively as to the actual condition of those territories?,21
15,Mr HUGHES,HOME FOR TUBERCULAR,"I saw a cabled statement in this morning's newspaper, and it did not surprise me at all. It is in keeping with those reports that are made from time to time, and which emanate from this country, regarding what are alleged to be the conditions obtaining in parts of Australia. They are infamous lies, and those who make them know them to be lies when they make them. As to the statement that the north of Queensland is not suitable for white settlement, all I can say is that some of the finest soldiers and specimens of manhood sent from Australia came from those areas which the writer in the London Times says are not suitable for white settlement. In regard to the western, .north-western, and northern portions of Australia, the^people who write of them have no knowledge whatever of them; or, if they have, their [491] Red Flag. 12311 infamy is still more obvious and contemptible. I do not pretend to have that knowledge of the nor.th-west or Northern Territory that some people have, but one part of Australia which has been called a desert I have recently passed over; and I say, advisedly, that it is very much better than a great deal of the country in South Africa about which people say little or nothing. The north-western part of Australia is well watered and has a good climate, and will in the fulness of time carry a very large population. I hope this refutation will be published in London.

17,Mr ANSTEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I know that it is utterly improper to base any question upon reports published in the newspapers, and therefore I shall not do so; but I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether he is aware that the steam-ship Themistocles recently arrived in Sydney Harbor flying at its mainmast the red flag; if so, will he take steps to,suppress such disloyal conduct on the part of the captain of any ship visiting this country?",21

22,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Richmond--Ministp r for Trade, and Customs:) [3.28]:-- I propose . to agree to the Senate's request to make the duty on wire of No. 16or finer gauge, - British, 20"" per cent., instead-' of 25 per cent.,, because these wires go up to fair l y high .values, and the rate suggested [491]- 2 by the Senate should be sufficient protection against the United Kingdom for the persons here who are engaged in drawing wire. However, I cannot agree to the Senate's proposal to reduce the duty upon other wire from British, 52s. per ton, to British, 44s. per ton, because a duty of British, 44's. per ton, has already been agreed' to' upou the rods from which this wire is drawn. If the duty upon wire were to be the same as that upon the rods from which it is drawn, people will i m port wire instead of rods.

23,Mr WATKINS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"So that the Minister supports Free Trade so far as fencing wire-is concerned, although it is being drawn here at the rate of a mile and a , - half per minute. 1 '",23
24,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Not at all. We are, only asking for a lower, rate - of duty on fencing wire because it is not of anything 1 like the same value as the higher grades of. fine wire - When the Tariff was originally before us, and we were making cer-. tain adjustments of this item;. one, or two shipments were, caught by the - high ad valorem duty on' fencing wire.' That wast not the intention of the Committee. T have, therefore, arranged the dates in ; such a way that it will not be compulsorjr for us' to collect the duty at the higher rate ori those shipments of fencing wire which came'in during thei period''of adjustment in ' this Oommittee.",23
25,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Suppos e the importers have already passed it on 1 We may be sure that they have.,24
26,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not think they have. The whole matter has been hung up. I am endeavouring now to redeem the promise that I made, and I ask the Committee to accept the Senate's request with the modifications set out in the motion.",24
27,Mr WATKI NS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Newcastle) [3.34] I do not know who is advising the M in i ster (Mr Greene) on the items relating to iron and steel, but it seems to me that he is treating very badly those who stood by the Government in relation to other items in the Tariff. The iron and steel industry is the key industry of Australia. When the items relating to iron and steel were originally before the Committee, statements were made by responsible Ministers to the effect that those engaged in the industry had not approached the Government, and did not require the duties that I was urging should be i m posed. On the House resuming, in September last, after a short vacation, I made a personal explanation, in which I showed that the people engaged in the industry had not only approached the Government in support of higher duties, out had done so as far back as 4th June, 1919. ancl, by request, had supplied tha Department of Trade and Customs with particulars as to their requirements as late as May last. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) would have supported the duties which I was urging the Committee to accept but that he was I ' d to believe that the people engaged in the industry had not asked for them. P-e. saidAnd I have not heard that the proprietors of the Newcastle works have asked for additional protection. If they had done so and made out a case, as they might have done through the Minister, or the press, or by circularizing honourable members, there might have been some excuse for giving their industry additional protection. The Leader of the Country party (Dr .Earle Page) also saidTt is remarkable that the Broken prietary Company Limited, who are producing the bulk of the steel, are not asking for this protection. . . They have not asked for it, unless it be within the last few days. I i i fairness to those who supported the increases for which I moved, I think it should be known that those engaged in the industry here had actually asked for the increase, and had supplied the Department from time to time with information as to the duties that were necessary to keep the iron and steel industry of Australia going. It is not fair that responsible Ministers should make misleading statements. One of the firms engaged in drawing wire- I refer to the Messrs. Rylands-*-carry on operations in my electorate, where they have established big works. They came 'here from Britain practically at the request of the Government. There was a general invitation to manufacturers abroad to establish their industries here.",24
28,Sir ROBERT BEST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is the object of the Tariff.,24
29,Mr WATKINS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is so.  is too ready to impose duties at other people's expense.,24
30,Mr WATKINS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The farmers of Australia, were lucky during the war in being able to obtain supplies of locally drawn wire.  buy it .",24
31,Mr WATKINS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Let the honourable member give me an order, and I will see that it is executed.",24
32,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But at what price ?,24
33,Mr WATKINS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"At a price below that, which the farmers would have to pay but for the establishment of the industry here. The local industry enabled the farmers to get supplies of fencing wire during the' war at prices much below those which they would otherwise have had to pay.",24
34,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That statement is made in the circulars of the local manufacturers, but it is hot correct.",24
35,Mr WATKINS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Some honourable members of the Country party were glad enough to make use of these local industries during the war, but they would now wipe them out. When this item' was originally before the Committee amendments were made in the gauges of wire set out in it , and the effect was to rob the local industry of a considerable amount of protection. The Senate has Hill Pro- made a request that the protection granted in respect of one particular size or gauge of wire shall be wholly wiped out, thus leaving the industry at the mercy of the most glaring dumping that I think we shall ever be able to find. People are going about asking for contracts for next year, and are prepared then to sell cheaper than at the prevailing Australian rate. The following is a statement from Rylands Brothers (Australia) Limited:We started manufacturing wire in Australia in 1911. Finding ourselves unable to compete with continental wire under Australian condiof tions, 'we were compelled to discontinue, but again started in 1915. We then made arrangethe ments to obtain the raw material from the have had to pay. Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, now have large works in Newcastle, New Wales, capable of supplying the total requirements of Australia and New Zealand, and, in addition, hope to secure a good share of the trade of the Pacific and in the East generally, as also South Africa. Our mill at present covers an area of 3 acres, and further large additional buildings are being erected in junction with Messrs. Rylands Brothers Limiwire ted, of Warrington, England, in which wire netting and all classes of fine wires will manufactured. We usually employ many of whom earn very high wages as wiredrawers; and with the present additions comT pleted, in three months' time we shall employ 1,400 men should the business be available.",24
36,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Why bounty which the whole would pay 1 Mr WATKINS . ' - That is a matter that we cannot go in to at presentWhen we first put our wire on the market imported wire was £56 per ton. Our price was £30 per ton, and the selling price had to reduced by the merchants to the farmers and others in order to compete with us.  was that ?",25
37,Mr WATKINS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The firm, is d r a w p r e t t y w e l l all gauges at t timeSince then our policy has been to suppiy the the primary producers at the lowest price possible, showing a reasonable working return uu and capital. The following comparison of prices confirms our statement, the English prices where there are farmer s and being taken from the monthly price list of the leading exporting London house-Messrs . man, Sons, and Deekes, New Oxford-street, m i London:8-Gauge Black Varriished Fencing Wire.

It will be seen that throughout the war .we have 'supplied the Australian market with fencing wire at practically one-half the price the British manufacturers charged. The price in the United States and in Canada FENCING WIHB . was practically the same as in England. We adopted the policy of fixing the price merchants had to sell our wire at, and the result this is that Australian farmers have been able to buy their fencing wire at less than half price the farmers in any other country Our prices (as above) are and the best proof of our attitude toward the setSouth tler and farmer in giving bim a fair deal. Owing to the low prices being quoted for Belgian wire, large quantities of which are now coming into Australia, we had to reduce the price of our wire to £20 per ton, which is below actual cost of production, and at which we are ' conmaking a material loss. As so much imported is in the market we have heen compelled to close our works to one-third its capacity, be and two-thirds of our menand two-thirds of 750 men, our plant is now lying idle. h at is w h at the farmers desire-to see Australian key industries dispensing with t w o - t h i r ds of the i r employees.

If the amendments requested by the Senate are made, those interested in the manufacture of wire in Australia will have to seriously consider whether they should not close their works.

41,Mr WATKINS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes . This Chamber fixed the duty on wire at 52s., although, as I have mentioned, the average duty in the United States of America, over a long period was 140s.j yet the Senate seems to 1 regard our proposal as equivalent to a prohibition against importation.",26

53,Mr WATKINS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes . Then there is the banana duty and there are others. My opponents are good, solid Protectionists when it comes to protecting the farmer; but they wish to throw open todump1 ing competition key industries which employ thousands of persons. At the present"" time supposedly Belgian steel, which I honestly believe, to be German steel, is being brought to Australia. I should like the Minister to withdraw his motion, and to move that the amendments requested by the Senate be not made. What he now proposes will mean the strangling of our industries, because of the fierce competition to which it will suibject them. When the Tariff.' was originally under discussion in this Cham- „ way. regulations ber, the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) promised that,. if it could be shown thattheseindustries would suffer for want of' increases, the whole schedule would be re-cast. He made that promise to. get, the Tariff through. A majority of members was then in favour-.of certain increases, and the promise was made to defeat an amendment to provide for such increases:. Having succeeded in that instance, the Government now propose ' t c make the amendments requested by the Senate, so that they may get r i d of the Tariff quickly I am in favour .of giving the fullest preference' possible to Great Britain, but ' I say that there should, be a' closer scrutiny of importations, because there are British traders who are. no better than, the traders of other nations.

I again ask the Minister to stand by the duties agreed to in this Chamber,, "" , ;  honourable m,ember for, ""Newcastle (Mr . Watkins) spoke of the difficulty that Messrs. Rylands Brothers had in . making what for Australia .is a necessary commodity', because of the great cost in volved. This cost must be passed on to one section of the community-the primary producers. I should like' to know why the proposed duties on wire are necessa'ry, seeing that the local manufacturers of it are protected against importations by the high freight chairges, and seeing, too, that they get cheap coal.' The prices that were quoted by the honourable member were entirely misleading. When we were dealing with a previous i'tem interested influence was suggested, and we were told that we could not take much notice of either side. But as one who purchases 'this black wire, I know positively that the information quoted: by the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr . Watkins"") is wrong. I was .accustomed in pre-war times .to purchase No. 8 'black wire for between £ 1 0 and £ 1 2 per .ton.",27

The trouble with the local industry is that it commenced under war conditions, and those defending it desire to retain those conditions, whereas the general tendency in pll industries, is to return to pre-war conditions. The primary producer has to submit to pre-war prices for his product, but those who .supply him with . the material used in his in dustry ask that . .he should be compelled to continue to pay war-time prices. The. prices, of these commodities , have fallen in other countries, but by means of,,a high , Tariff the prices in , Australia are maintained, and .become a burden upon the primary producer,,, who is obliged to accept for,hi3 loufcput a price in keepingi with ithe .(markets of the world. We :are told of the - difficulties of > manufacturing in - Australia. The same difficulties arisei 'in all 'forms of pro1 duction in Australia, whether primary or secondary. The -' honourable 'member fori Newcastle,!-whois in favour of high 1 duties, supported - the - following - doctrine when the 'Committee was dealing with - explosives- - -- : You, will, therefore, .see that if the, Tariff be(comes operative as set out, the prices of explosives imported will immediately increase; and as.the miner has to purchase hisexplosives, it will immediately affect him,",27

Therefore, we have to adopt the antiquated method of the poison cart to battle against what is almost a tidal wave of rabbits. I do not know how honourable members can claim to be good: Australians, when they are prepared to k ill . industries which are truly Australian, and. expect one section of the community to bear the unnatural burden, they are .creating by means of a Tariff.",27

The primary producer in other countries is buying his requirements more cheaply than is the Australian producer, who is thus seriously handicapped in the markets of the world. I have no objection to prohibiting the importation of any article that Australia can make properly, and at a reasonable price. The Committee seems very ready to come to the help of the secondary producer, and no doubt it is nice to extend gracious patronage at the expense of the other fellow. The census returns indicate the ruination that is being caused in Australia by the building up of the cities at the expense of the country, and that evil will be accentuated by a high Tariff which places the whole burden upon one section of the community.

In fact, this Parliament has encfeavoured to foster the whole of the iron and steel industry, and Rylands, a British firm of great reputation, and with vast business connexions, have, in response vitation given by the Tariff, established themselves in Australia, and proved their bona fides by expending over £500,000 the very fine wires. on a plant to supply local requirements.

The Senate has not rethe quested an amendment of the general Tariff. It has merely asked for a reducan tion of the duty under the British subTariff. I was hopeful that the Minister war (Mr Greene) would see his way to make even a greater reduction than that which another place has requested. I am sure that the Committee, when the item was originally before us, did not full y appreno ciate the effect of the duties imposed The remarks made by the honourable to member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) n regard to the iron and steel industry should not be allowed to pass without comment. In view of his comparisons his statements as to patriotism and it is well that some of the facts relating to the iron and steel industry should be placed before the Committee and the country. The Country party has said again and again that it is prepared to support a moderate Tariff, but only when such a Tariff is essential to the building up of an industry. We have had the sworn statement of the manager of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company that it was prepared to enter upon the steel industry here, and build up its business, without any assistance whatever fro m this Parliament. He said that it wanted neither a duty, a bounty, nor a subsidy. The value of the ore obtained by the company from the Iron Knob, South Australia, is double that of the ores that are imported into Britain , so that it takes 2 tons of the latter to produce *what 1 ton of I r o n Knob ore will give. The Broken Hill Company has this enormous deposit of high-grade ore right on the sea-board, and it has its own vessels and wharfs, and coal within a mile or two of its works. It has also one of the most up-to-date plants in the world. What more should it require? We have a right to expect manufacturers with all tliese facilities to be able to compete with those of other countries. No greater advantage could have been given the manufacturers of Australia than was conferred on them by the recent great war, when prices advanced by leaps and bounds. There was then no l i m it to the price which a manufacturer could get for 1 his output. He was able to make enormous profits, out of which he could provide for up-to-date plants, and so f it himself to compete manufacturers in other We are prepared 'to give a moderate Tariff, and I regard it as unfair for honourable member after honourable member to quote statements every one of which is from the circular issued by the Rylands Company. Let us take the price that that firm says they were supplying goods at in Australia in December,. 1919. Their price, according to the circular, was £ 2 2 10s., when the British price was £39. Can any one who has been compelled to buy wire say that they obtained any advantage from those low prices? Again, we are. told that this firm was' selling at £ 2 4 10s. when the British price was £43. Did purchasers in Australia get any advantage? I think the general reply, if it were given, would be that nothing was seen of any such low prices.",32
111,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the honourable ber say that th© statements in the . cular are untrue?,33
112,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not; but if this firm were selling at such low prices the. wholesaler and retailer must have got abnormal profits. It would be unfair for me to suggest that the statements made by the firm are untrue; but I say that the consumer did not gain any advantage iby it . They are now asking that on wire over 12-gauge there shall be a duty of 20 per cent, as against Great Britain . In the firm's circular we are toldI t will be seen that throughout the war we have supplied the Australian market with fencing wire at practically one-half the price the British manufacturer charged. Now, I cannot believe that- The price in the United States and in Canada was practically the same as in England. Mr - GREENE - Why does the honourable member say that he cannot believe the statement?",33
113,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Because the prices quoted to me, when I was obtaining figures for the general Tariff debate, were double those quoted in the circular from Rylands.",33
114,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The circular makes a very definite statement of fact.,33
115,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Of course, it is possible that their output would be so small as to be unnoticeable in the market. If so, the consumer again has to pay. The circular goes onwith countries. We adopted the policy of fixing the price merchants had to sell our wire atThat is a most dangerous policy^ one to which I have grave objection. When wo were dealing with the Tariff Board Bill , and also when the Tariff was before us, I pointed to the undesirability of such a practice. The circular continuesand the. result of this is that Australian farmers have been able to buy their fencing wire at less than half the price farmers in any other country have had to pay. Then furtherOwing to the low price being quoted for Belgian wire, large quantities of which are now coming into Australia, we had to reduce the price of our wire to £20 per ton, which is below actual cost of production, and at which we.are making a material loss. 1 It would seem that this firm cannot produce No. 8 black wire at £ 2 0 per to n , although the pre-war price was below £ 8 . memAre we to understand that there is to cirbe a duty on wire sufficient to enable the firm to charge £ 2 0 per ton in the future ? 0 Is the price they pay the .""Broken- 'Hill Proprietary Limited for their rods 'so high-that they cannot manufacture fencingwire at lees than £20 without loss, although it is from 230 to"" 260 per cent, above - pre-war prices? Any representative of a country electorate realizes 'the necessity of primary producers, who are devjaloping the country, having their', requirement? supplied at the lowest possible .price. We have a prospect in - the near future of a large stream of immigration from the .Old Country,, efforts to Which end. are now being made' by the Imperial and Australia^-. Governments. However honourable members opposite may believe, .iii High .Protection, they cannot fail .to isee the great importance of building up'the. nor them portions of this Country. During my recent trip to. the north-west I was-told, that ordinary wire fencing is costing - £100 per mile. On the boat on which I travelled' from the nor tb I met a wheelwright; wh o r told me, he .had a contract for building ,a waggon, and that in submitting his price hejsaid there-would be on© extra, namely, the 6-in. by l j - in. iron required for the tyres, - which alone cost- £44 forAhe 'four tyres. Of course, this included heavy freight and handling charges' afc Onslow. I Mr GREEN^ - When was the' waggon being built? I do no't think we are rolling any of that steel in Australia. believe it is all imported. ' ' Mr 'GREGORY - We have not quite returned to normal conditions; but I do not see'why this iron cannot be turned put by the same people who turn out steel rails. ' We are asked to impose 30 per 1 cent, against. Great Britain, and 40 per cent, in the general Tariff, on' all wire of 12 gauge dr larger'. ' When the Minister ([ Mr Greene) proposed his ad valorem duties on wire 14-gauge and smaller, ' it was not realized how heavy the impost would be. The result was that the duty on 14-gauge wire amounted to £1& 7s. 6d. per ton. ' ' . : ' , -' Mr iGEEENE - In twelve-months' time the ad valoremduty, whatever it may be, may not he so Heavy-it depends entirely on Jhe priqe of the wire. , , "". Mr GREGORY,-Then it would .have been .only fair to the Committee .for the Minister to have told ,us. how.,much .the duty,- approximately, would amount to. I .am surethat.;no honourable member believed, when he agreed to the ad valorem duty, that it would amount to'so'much!",33
116,Mr GBEEITE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It would not' amount' to RO much under normal cohditions. Wire then must have been very dear. ' . Mr GREGORY' - That does not affect the issue; the duty is, abnormal. ' The Minister has power,, by departmental regulation, to .ajdmit wire, for,barbed wire an,d wire netting at a lower rate."" .What, about all those other industries, in our midst; in which woven wire is.used to a large extent ?

124,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The local people were not manufacturing earlier. They' came into the business during the war.,36
125,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes , and during the war freight charges were so heavy as to make it impossible to bring here in any quantity the commodities referred to. The prices were then 300 and 400 per cent, above pre-war prices, so that had the commodities been available they would not have been purchased. No one could buy wire or wire netting at the prices that' then prevailed, unless it were a bundle here and there for the repair of a fence.",36
126,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Wir e went up to £80 a ton. 0,36
127,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wir e netting did, but the maximum price for wire 'Was £50, and during the greater part of the war it could not be obtained for less than £40 a ton. I do not expect to get these commodities nOw at pre-war prices, but we may hope to get them for prices much lower than we have been paying, and much lower than the latest quotations. During the war no purchases of wire and wire netting worth speaking of were made. There were no improvements or extensions carried out. Everything was in abeyance until prices should come down to a reasonable figure. What is now proposed is a very big impost on commodities that are a plain bread-andcheese line for the primary producers. Wire and wire netting can be made without the manufacturers having to pay large sums for patent rights. The processes are simple. They are not the result of brainy experiments, for which the users of the articles might fairly be expected to pay highly. Both commodities are essential, especially in the far interior, and are needed to open up new country to provide for immigration. Fcr a bread-and-cheese line the duties are excessive.",36
128,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What is the ad valorem equivalent of the rates on the present prices of wire?,36
129,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is considerable. The Minister can work it out for himself.,36
130,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is about 12£'per cent.,36
131,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes ; but what are the prices that are being' charged, and that are likely to obtain? It has been contended that Parliament has only to protect an industry sufficiently to greatly benefit the consumer. Something in that way was done for the woollen industry forty years ago, but the consumer has got no relief.",36
132,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"To-da y you can get a decent suit made of Australian tweed for £8, and pay £18 for a suit made of impelled tweed.",36
133,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Minister could get a suit made of the best tweed that ever came out of the mill for half those prices. The firm of Rylands Brothers is one of the finest in the world. There are no better people in the business. But we have been told that they will act benevolently towards the community, and will see that the merchants do not step into increase prices. Before the war the Government of South Australia said that this bread-and-butter line, as I have termed it , must be cheaper, and it imported wire and wire netting for the farmers. That importation had not to be continued long, because the big merchants said, "" We can get this stuff out as cheaply as the Government can,"" and until the war commenced it was brought out on an interest charge of only 5 per cent. There was not much robbery in that business, for the settlers could then extend and develop new country very cheaply, so far as material was concerned, but by this high duty the Government are simply placing an embargo on the development of the interior, while they are putting a duty upon people who participate only to a very small degree in the advantages of the Protectionist policy. I ask the Minister to consider this fact. He says that the raw material is in Australia; that is so. There is only one other place in the world like the Iron Knob, and that is in Sweden. With that one exception the Iron Knob is unique in both extent and character, and it is almost inexhaustible. I am, prepared to be very generous in regard to this new industry that is established in our midst, but the proposal of the Senate goes beyond the limit of generosity, and I shall oppose the Minister's motion.",36
134,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Melbourne Ports) [5.22] - I am. sorry that the Sovernment have agreed to hand over to the importing - section df the community, who are a bane to Australia, a clear profit. We know that they have no soul, and that any duty they have paid has been passed on. to their customers. If the duty is now given back to the importers the persons who bought from them, and paid th© duty, will get no benefit. I therefore object to a proposal that-will mean a loss of revenue to the Department, and a g if t to the importers, and I think the Minister should make some better arrangement. There is not an honourable member of the Committee who would support a refund to the importers of a duty which has already been passed on to their customers.",36
135,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We do not do that sort of thing.,37
136,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Then what is the true position ?,37
137,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We are adjusting the duties in such a way that they shall apply to all wire that was imported from the moment we started in this Committee to deal with the duties on wire.,37
138,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,So the Minister is not making the importers a present of a penny?,37
139,Mr GREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We are not.,37
140,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am glad to hear industry. that. The debate on this item has shown the inconsistencies of some honourable members. I listened with appreciation to the fight which the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) put up for the wire-netting industry. listened to the mutterings of honourable members in the Corner, who do not represent the farmers, although they profess to do so, and get kudos on that account. We saw also the fiendish grin which is usual on the part of the hon when any reduction of duty is proposed. He administered a severe body blow on the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins), when he twitted him. in regard to his attitude on the duties on explosives. If I had been the honourable member for Newcastle, I would have retorted by quoting the attitude of the honourable member for Swan timber. If any honourable members have adopted peculiar attitudes during the discussion of the Tariff, they are the honourable members for Newcastle and Swan - The former advocates the protection of the wire-netting industry, but he will not concede to the men who work in the explosives factory the same assistance as he demands for the men who are employed in another industry in his own electorate. And we have heard the honourable member for Swan speaking against duties on timber and voting for them. The whole of the members of the so-called Farmers party are opposed to the duty upon wire netting, but quite recently we heard a great deal about maize. I remind honourable members in the corner that if maize could be imported cheaply into Australia, a factory in my electorate could give employment to three or four hundred extra men and women, but I voted for a duty that would exclude imported maize, because I know that the Australian farmer's product cannot compete with the cheaper grown article of South Africa .",37
141,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It was the manufacturer who got the dnty imposed upon maize.,37
142,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Does not the honourable member realise that if the manufacturer could get cheaper maize he could use more of it ? It is absurd to suggest that the manufacturers asked that a duty should be imposed on imported maize, which is the raw product for their",37
143,The CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY, I ask the honourable member to connect his remarks with the item before the Chair.,37
144,Mr GIBSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the honorablo I also member expect the farmers to enclose their holdings with wireless fences?,37
145,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I expect the farmers of Australia to concede to other sections of the community the protection they desire themselves. When the farmers demanded 9s. per bushel for their wheat and caused the price of bread to rise, and yet will not give adequate protection to the wire-netting industry, they are not acting fairly. The farmers know that during the war, and since the war, they would have been in a sorry position but for the local production of wire and wire netting. When they were unable upon to import wire netting because of its scarcity and cost, they exulted in the fact that the article was produced in Australia', but now, having got all they could out of the manufacturer, they are ready to see foreign wire dumped in this country, thus showing that they are anxious to get all they can from the rest of the community, but will give nothing in return. The Minister's motion has been proposed in such a way that I and others will have to vote against him , because I will not agree to a reduction of the duty to 20 per cent.",37
146,Mr GREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member for Newcastle has moved an amendment which will, give the honourable member an opportunity - to vote in favour of the 25 per cent, duty, and when that pro-r posal. has been .disposed-of he can vote-on my motion. , .",37
147,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I ' cannot understand - why the Minister grouped his> proposal in this way.

Whenthis item was before theCommittee previously good reasons were advanced for fixing the ratesagreed upon - I notice that the Seriate do not propose that we should interfere with' the intermediate or general rates. Possibly' it is an endeavour, on the part of senators,' to give Great B r it a in a greater measure of preference, and it is a - principle to which we can all , agree,, but the question is whether the extra margin suggested , in this case can be given, with safety to our own industries, , I am, given to ; understand that the rods from which, wire is drawn, in .Great B r it a in are imported, possibly from,Germany, so that German goods may .eventually find their way out to Australia |in the for m of , . B r it is h goods. If . this he..the case, and I have no-reason, to doubt that it is , - it is surprising to. find men in .Australia! prepared to - argue in favour - of utilizing foreign goods in preference toi those made-locally.

Mr 'GEEGOBY - Why should the p r i mary producer pay this duty instead of the' burden of establishing, this industrybeing placed,on the whole community? ' - Mr Francis - The primary producer has a right to' help -'to build up Australian industries - - - The masses of people have been called upon by this 1 T a r i ff to buy Australian-made. ar-fcicles, and I believe that they are prepared to p.ay a' little more for the m ' t h an they would possibly pay for importedgood!.'

155,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not think that so. We know, as a matter of fact, that practically no rods are being drawn in England, except from German and Belin gian blooms. The German and Belgian blooms are being mixed in the works. They send us the result of the Belgian blooms, but the average price at which they can sell is very low, and the English furnaces are out. We have to see that our furnaces do not go out.",40
156,Mr FRANCIS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If that is so, would it not be better to impose the extra 5 per cent, for which the amendment vides, and so save the Department the trouble involved in finding out whether imported wire has been drawn from English or German rod? If we agree to"" lands Brothers tendered. the Senate's request we shall destroy industry, and the men now employed it will be pleading to us for assistance. We shall throw out of action £500,000 worth of plant, and, to put it shortly, will, in my opinion, disgrace Australia.",40
157,Mr CORSER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wide Bay) [5.53] - I hope the Committee will consider the visableness ' of protecting, not only this, but every industry in Australia. We only by Protection increase our populaduty. tion and thus prevent this country from being overrun by peoples whom do not wish to come here. It goes without saying that we shall not be able to hold this enormous territory ours for long unless we people it, and we can hope to people it only by establishing industries which will give ample employment at satisfactory rates. In connection with, not only this try, but many others, British manufacturers were promised that if.they established works here substantial protection would be granted them. The firm of not Rylands Brothers, Australia, Limited, were induced to establish their industry here on the distinct understanding that they would secure the benefit of a protecface tive duty, such as was recently passed this House. On that understanding they expended £500,000' in setting up works in New South Wales. At the present industries time they are employing 750 hands, and their plant, if in full use, would give ployment to 1,400. No large establish-, ment could be expected to produce at the lowest cost unless its machinery was is fully and constantly employed. Certain overhead expenses must be incurred whether the plant is wholly or only partially use; and, in order to reduce the costs of production to a minimum, all the machinery in a big industry must be kept going. We have to take care that by cutting down these duties we do not make it possible for goods to be largely introduced from overseas, and so lead to the partial closing down of Messrs. Rylands Brothers' and other big works. In a circular issued by the firm it is stated that as recently as 9 th August last an order for pro1,000 tons of wire for the Hume Pipe Company of Australia Limited went to a British firm, which was able to quote a price below that at which Messrs. RyThey state this distinctly-and their statement can be in verified-that during a given time they had not been making a profit of more than 5 per cent, on their undertaking. It is quite clear, therefore, that if , notwithstanding that they were not making more than 5 per cent., and that they cut their price to the lowest possible extent, they adwere unable to get this order in ^ competition with a British firm, there is no can room for any further reduction of the By reducing it to the extent of 5 per cent., as now proposed, we shall we jeopardize the business of this firm, which has set up very large works in Australia. 0 The plant will be only of partially, instead of fully, occupied, and the manufacturing costs will necessarily be increased. The overhead expenses on the reduced output would be greater than they would be if the whole indusplant were constantly employed.",40
158,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If an additional 5 per cent, is necessary for this firm, why give it to' them by way of a bounty ?",40
159,Mr CORSER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We are not dealing just now with bounties. We are face to with a difficulty, and, as reasonable by men, should deal with it . Are we going to risk the ruin of this industry? Are we prepared to reduce the duty, and so to discourage other firms from setting up new here. Is it not better that we should keep faith with those who have embeen induced to commence operations here? By helping them to employ tlieir plant to its fullest extent we shall reduce the cost of their output to the consumer. Some honourable members of the Country party, however, are now advocating a division of the work of drawing wire amongst factories here and overseas. Such a division would lead to increased, instead of reduced, costs. W it h reasonable protection there is every prospect of this firm being able to employ 1,400 men. We have to consider not only the men but their wives and children as consumers of primary products. mary producer will benefit by the influx of population. We should view these matters in a brighter light than some honourable members are prepared to do. We can hope to keep Australia white, 1 repeat, only by peopling it , and we cannot people it unless we adopt much the same policy as that which was followed by the United States of America.",40
160,Mr FRANCIS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If we reduced the duty to 20 per cent, the firm mentioned by the honourable member would have to close down.",41
161,Mr CORSER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"At all events, even if it carried on under the lower duty, its plant would not be full y employed, and its cost of production would be increased. The duty that we are now asked to agree to in respect of some classes of wire is the same as the duty on the raw materialthe rod iron from which it is drawn.",41
162,Mr JOWETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Whose f a u l t is that?,41
163,Mr CORSER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The blame rests with another place. This fact goes to show that honourable members of another place have not taken that degree of interest in this question that others have, and I see no reason why we should reduce the duty merely because another place, by a majority of five, has requested us to do so. I hope we shall not agree to the request. Question-That the amendment (Mr . WATKINS ' ) be agreed to-put . Committee divided. Ayes .. .. Noes .. .. Majority Blundell, R. P. Makin, N. J. O.

177,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the honourable comes member had a farm,, and had tp protect his paddocks with barbed wire, he would not consider that these rates were merely intended to produce revenue. An important meeting was held in Melbourne last week. A scheme was inaugurated in New South. Wales some little while ago with the slogan, "" A .million farms for a",43
178,Mr GREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member is wrong if i he attributes the meeting in Melbourne totheM ill i o n Earms movement - of New South Wales. The gathering in this city was entirely the outcome of the immigration policy of the Government and of 'the organization which the sheets, Government are attempting to create in 1 ! ' Mr GREGORY - Interes t in the per matter was first created by the efforts of Sir Joseph Carruthers.",43
179,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The . honourable, member is, entirely wrong.",43
180,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"And I say that the Minister knows nothing of the matter. Anyhow, the people of Australia are taking a greater interest in this matter than ever before. All the States are anxious to f ill the waste places with genuine settlers, but the encouragement of the right type of immigrant, must be practical. The Government cannot be said to be assisting those who are on the land and encouraging others who desire - to settle outback by imposing heavy duties upon these wires.",44
181,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The manufacture of barbed wire is not a new industry in Australia.,44
182,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is not.,44
183,Mr GREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Not the actual making of the wire, but the enterprise of drawing it from the local raw material is entirely new.",44
184,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Jus t as in the case of the manufacture of nails, the machine for which does all the work, even to the packing in the cases. An y one can import a barbed-wire making machine duty free; after which he may go ahead and flourish because of the special duties put upon barbed wire. The man who pays, however, is the man whom the Government say they wish to encouragethe man who is really developing this country. The requested reductions of the duties are fair and moderate, and this Committee should accept them. I hope that the Committee will agree to this and many other of the amendments requested by the Senate.",44
185,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.15] - I think it was generally admitted when we were discussing the iron and steel duties, which, honourable members will see, are carefully balanced, starting from the pig iron as a basis and proceeding through all the various stages of manufacture",44
186,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,G o them again.,44
187,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not think it is necessary for me to go through all these items. They constitute one big, carefullybalanced scheme, going from the pig iron to the bloom; from the bloom to the rod, from the rod to the wire, and from the wire to the barbed wire or wire netting, and to each particular process the requisite measure of protection is accorded.. It was generally admitted that the iron and steel industry is essential to this country, and that the defence of Australia is utterly impossible unless the in dustry is developed. Upon that point I do not think there are two opinions in this Committee, with the possible exception of "" the representative of Russia "" (Mr Considine). Honourable members must recollect that these products of the steel furnace represent a very large proportion of the total output of the f u r naces, and unless we secure for the Australian manufacturer the local market as far as practicable, we shall close down the steel furnaces, and the whole of the iron and steel industry will disappear. It is useless for honourable members to say that they believe that the iron and steel industry is essential to the welfare, nrogress, and safety of the country, and at the same time declare, as they would to all intents and purposes do by not giving a sumcient measure of protection to those items,. that we should impose low duties, which in their final analyses would mean - - that we should be collecting a revenue duty for all time, because the iron and steel industry would never become established. If there is one industry that depends more than another unon massed production and continuity of operations; it is the iron and steel industry. W it h out those conditions the whole scheme collapses. That is why I feel that it is essential that these items should be sufficiently protected. These are not high duties. What is happening today is this: The British iron and steel furnaces are nearly all cold; the proportion of them working today is practically negligible.. In Germany and Belgium every one of thera is working at high pressure night and day and is employing a full complement of hands, and, owing to the conditions of exchange between Great Britain , Germany, and Belgium the British manufacturer finds it is cheaper to import Belgian and German steel in one form or another and work it up. We are today meeting with competition of that charthrough acter.",44
188,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The coal strike in England was largely responsible for that.,44
189,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That has nothing whatever to do with the actual condition of affairs. The British iron and steel"" furnaces are not working, but the manufacturers are^purchasin? steel abroad and"" working it up in England , from which we are now getting low-priced wire. If"" Great Britain were manufacturing iron and steel from the products of her own iron mines, and working it up into the finished article she could not compete with Australia, but she is not doing that.",44
190,Mr EICHABD FOSTEB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does not Minister see that he is imposing a permanent impost in order to cope with a temporary condition of affairs?,45
191,Mr GREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No , because the only way to put the Australian manufacturer into a position in which he can turn out a cheap article is to give him, as far as we can, the run of the home market, so that he may keep his works going night and day. Even with the present measure of protection-it is not the Senate's proposals that are operating today-the local works are two and three parts idle.  products are too costly to use.",45
192,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not think so. I have used a fair amount of them myself, and I know pretty well what the cost means. After all, how much wire does the average farmer-no t the man engaged in pioneering work-us e in the course of a year?  fenced because the farmer cannot buy the material.",45
193,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,-What is the general effect of encouraging local manufacture? The fact of an Australian industry having been established has enabled the farmer to purchase agricultural machinery cheaper than if we had hot manufactured locally.,45
194,Mr GBEGOBT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We say that statement is wrong.,45
195,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is a matter of opinion, but the whole of the evidence shows that, but for the Australian manufacturer, the farmer would have paid,' very much more for his agricultural machinery than he is paying today, and I am only too glad to know that the Tariff is accomplishing its purpose, and that the foreign competitors with Australian manufacturers are coming here to compete on Australian soil. After all is said and done, that is as it should be. I am credibly informed that the foundations of one big factory are already laid. A firm from abroad has purchased the necessary land, and is making all preparations to proceed with the erection of a factory.",45
196,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Minister stated that if it were not for the Australian manufacturer the farmers would he paying more for their machinery. If that be so, how is it that the manufacturers want the increased duties? .",45
197,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Notwithstanding these duties over £1,000,000 worth of agricultural machinery is imported each c year. If that money .were put into Australian factories, instead of foreign factories, and the local manufacturers could get that additional turnover, they would be able to supply the local market at an even cheaper price than they are charging today. I am satisfied that if these duties operate, as I hope they will eventually, when we escape from the exchange difficulties which surround us at the present time, they will enable the Australian manufacturer to compete successfully with all outside competitors. If he is to do that, I have not the slightest doubt that, as a result of the big turnover, he will be able to reduce the prices considerably below those which he finds payable today, and the ultimate result of these duties .will be that the farmer, instead of paying something extra, will be getting his wire cheaper. There is another phase of this matter of which country representatives should never lose sight. The establishment of these industries does provide a home market for hundreds of Australian producers. Today potatoes are marked up in Melbourne at 30s. per ton, and onions at £1 per ton. Do those prices pay for the mere digging and bagging? Honourable members' say that we should put more people on the land so that more people may grow potatoes and onions. There are not enough people in Australia to eat the potatoes and onions that are already produced. Honourable members must know that the places where we can have intense rural settlement are those places which are pre-eminently suited for growing, not the things which we export, but the things for which we require a local market, and it is utterly impossible to get that intense rural settlement, which I desire to encourage, as does every other honourable member, unless there is a local market to consume what is produced. I know of quite a number of cases in which the British manufacturers establishing themselves in . Australia have brought with them, a large number of skilled employees. There is not one of those in dustries started recently with British capital that has. not resulted in a considerable increase in the population, and' a very valuable increase, too, because it is not. merely .that fif ty or sixty. em'ployees,- with their wives and .families, settle in - the country, but the presence of these people in Australia provides iemployment for many more people. Thus a local market .is .created;,men in constant employment, at good wages .are , able to purchase the goods which the primary producer (grows - Unless, we have a local population to ""Consume. a vast amount of what the Australian soils are preeminently, :fitted to produce, .we ;cannot make the best use of them. That is .the argument. I , have p ut forward . in . this. Oommitteeipreviously. . , Mr ! GREGORY - Your 'arguments are only .excuses.",45
198,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They , are inot excuses. Thsy are reasons which go to show, in the most conclusive way, that .unless we . are able to build up o u r Australian indusr tries' .and provide .a local market for that which the rural producer grows, it is impossible to make the best use of o.ur Australian ;soil. That is why. I have stood all through my political, life, ever since.I was able to think for myself, for the protection of Australian industries. I believe it is the only way in which We can get that real rural settlement which is 'so 'necessary for this country.' '  must compliment the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) on his speech. He ' dealt with the ' subject ably, from his own stand-point. He thinks that, in the long run , the policy o i high Tariffs for Australian 'industries will be the best for the primary producer. I do hot think that any members ""of this Committee - will live long enough to see the end of thei'run. my mind, an inordinate attempt is being made to foster secondary industries. We would'all like to'See Australia manufacturing all her own requirements, but there is a l i m it to what the producer can afford tc pay for it . There is not one 'thinking person in Australia, and certainly not one of the great newspapers :of this .country, but is. becoming alarmed at the evil of centralization,;which is increased by every move in the direction of higher Tariffs. When, this. Committee, in its attempts .to foster secondary industries, offers, better conditions to those industries than persons on the land can obtain, it aggravates the evil and increases that. centralizedvote which clamours for mpr,e, and still more, protection. It - is impossible, for the small secondary industries of this country, with a - limited turnover; and supplying a population of only 5,000,000 people,, to compete with other industries that are turning out the goods like lollies. ' Mr MASSYGREENE - Does the honourable member say it'should not be done""? 1  t point at which it becomes too costly to be done.

W it h the small profit that .they, get - on their - capital, they cannot .see, their way clear to purchase the netting,,, and are adopting poisoning aird other antiquated methods . to prevent the destruction, of their crops and herds. On more than one occasion, the Minister for Trade, and Customs, when arguing on this question, has. asked, ""What amount of wire does a farmer employ, in fencing his crops ?'' By-and-by the .question will be, "" What amount per acre does the Tariff add to the cost of machinery to a farmer ?"" I can point the Minister to a case where £30,000 has been invested in a. farming - property, Ion which the o ovvmer has lost money. Hemade £250 profit one year; a loss of over £1,000 another year; and the net result of seven or eight years' working was less than' 5 per cent, return on his capital. When the Government comes along with its Tariff and wants to take this or that out oil the profit-£12 0 for a harvester', and £20 for a binder-that little bit of profit is eaten into. I say that the labouring man on the farm is not getting a fair deal, because his brother labourer in the city, working fewer hours, gets more money. This policy is forcing men off the land by making the conditions such that it is impossible for them to continue there. I would like to see the Senate's suggestion accepted, and the manufacturers and labourers in the secondary industries bend a little, and make up the difference, instead of passing it all on,to the man on the land, whose produce is suffering ,a slump in the market. The prices of prir maoy products are such, to-daythat it .is impossible, for the man on. the land to buy. the things ..that he needs without screwing himself down, to the eartb and working fif,ty, sixty, or seventy hours a week. It is ""up ""to"" the working men and . the manufacturers of Australia ta contribute alittle.; I want, them to bear a share of. this burden, andnot to pass it all,on ,to the one sec-: tiou. If the Committeeis. sincere in its desire to foster this industry, for the pro* duets of which only one - section of the community pays> it should do it by a bonus, so that! the whole community will share the expense. Australia would be more self-contained if the vast rural Darts of the continent were- - developed more rapidly, instead of the - population being squeezed into four or .fivo capital icities. Those who are complaining of the centralization evil are aggravating it by inflicting this Tariff upon the comparatively few people who are still struggling on. the land.",46
199,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Barrier) [8.49] Thehonoraible member for 'Swan (Mr: Prowse) reminds me very muchof' an. Irish friend I was talking to recently. Speaking of a gentleman with a reputation for generosity, he remarked, ""Yes, he is a very generous man. What he has to. give away he still, keeps for himself."" The honourable member for Swan reminds me of that gentleman. He is so generous that , what he has to give a.way he still keeps for himself. ;So that the cultivator of the soil shall be enabled to get cheap agricultural implements, he desires that the industrial working classes shall have it taken out of them. He suggests that the industrial workers of Australia should comport themselves like their cheapwages brethren in Europe; that they should "" bend a little"" and should take "" a little less,"" in order that the man on the land may have a little more. No doubt, he would also"" agree with the manufacturer, who says, when the industrial worker complains about the high cost of living, that it is due to the people on the land wanting extortionate prices for^their products, and suggests that theagricultural labourer should take a little less, in order, that both these gentlemen should have a, little more. 1  to work the harder because of this Tariff:",47

201,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Some of them are"" working, but, unfortunately, at the present time, the majority of them are not, be/ cause of our old friends Codlin and Short. They cannot decide among themselves whether it will pay to exploit the 'miners of the Barrier. When it becomes profitable to do so again, the Arbitration Court will be honoured,, and the award of the Court carried out by. the employers.  workers at Broken Hill do not go on to the land. ;",47
202,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They go into it They .go down into the mines to provide the, raw material that is afterwards manufactured and permits the man on the land to carry on. While our friends the manufacturers are endeavouring to point out that it is the agriculturists who are responsible for the high cost of living, et cetera, the producers' representatives tell the workers, just as the honourable member for Swan has done, that, the wholetroubleisdue to the Tariff. If the contention of the honourable member for Swan is correct-and I contend that it is not-that the "" high T a r i ff "" w crease the cost of living, then under a high T a r i ff the wages of the workers will have to go up. Wipe out the T a r i ff and, according to the honourable member's'argument, down will go the cost of living, and down will go wages also. The worker, whether he be employed in agricultural or secondary industries, if he has any brains at all, will see that he is only the pawn that is used in the game between the # ' agricultural exploiter and the industrial exploiter.",47
203,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Did you tural exploiter?,48
204,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Yes .,48
205,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I did not know that there was such a person.,48
206,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Have you never been exploited?,48
207,Mr STEAVART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The class I represent do not exploit; they compete in the world's markets.,48
208,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"E i the r you exploit, or you are exploited. Either you are working somebody else, or somebody * else is. working you. I was endeavouring to point, out that this is a question in which there are two conflicting interests. It is a struggle to shift the incidence of the burden; it is a quarrel between the agricultural, importing, and manufacturing interests of Australia. We have the Minister coming along to the Committee with renewed strength after listening to a lecturette in another part of this building, and saying that hardly any one would object to his speech, except, perhaps, the honourable member for Russia-referrin g to myself. out of the mouths of babes and sucklings cometh forth wisdom. Out of the mouth of this Minister, perhaps inadvertently, has come a truth,' though he may not be able to grasp the full significance of it . He is, perhaps, not aware that today Russia is the only country in the world run by a working-class Government. In that sense I do represent Russia, and I am proud of it .",48
209,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,You have a big constituency.,48
210,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes , and an exacting one. The Minister again trots out the old wheeze that - this particular in dustry is essential to the defence of the country; but can he name one industry in Australia which is not essential to its ill in - defence ? We were told during the war that not one industry could be named which was not essential to the defence of the country; and, in fact, every word the Minister has uttered in regard to the iron and steel industry in this regard could be applied with equal force to e^ery other industry in Australia. We are told that for this reason the whole of the local market must be monopolized by the local manufacturer; and the honourable member  industrial worker must take less so that the local manufactories may be buil t up say agriculuntil they blossom into monopolies and Combines.  his share.",48
211,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have a fairly good idea of what the honourable member means by the worker's share. But when compulsorily or voluntarily the worker has accepted less in order that local manufacturers may blossom for t h into monopolists and ultimately become exporters, we shall find that he is again asked to take less in order that the manufacturing monopolists may be able to compete in the world's markets with the more cheaply-produced goods pf other countries. Having assisted the manufacturer to monopolize the home markets, the worker must again take less in order that the monopolists may reach out and take"" the other fellow's markets. In the indust r i a l revolution Great B rita in certainly had a unique advantage by having a flying start, but even now it is introducing a Tariff under the plea of safeguarding its manufacturers from foreign It is said that competition, dumping, and so forth . The history of France, Germany, America, and every other industrial country, however, has been the same-firs t a Tariff, then monopolies and Combines, then overseas exports, then Imperialism, and with it the need for bigger navies and bigger armies, and eventually war. The working class are squeezed in peace time and then asked to sacrifice themselves in war time in order that the profits and dividends of the manufacturers and the combined interests of the wealthy classes may be safeguarded. Therefore, from my point of view, the workers have nothing to gain from a Tariff. I have not spoken for a considerable time upon this subject, and, therefore, take this opportunity of again emphasizing my view-point.",48
212,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,After this Tariff has increased the cost of living to the workers in every sense you find that the miners at Mount Morgan have been asked to less. accept a reduction of 20 per oent. in their wages.,49
213,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am pleased that the honourable member has become a conemploy vert to the proposition that the workers of this country should not accept a reducphilanthropist. tion of wages.,49
214,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am not a convert to that proposition. I am merely pointing out of their labour. out what the action of your party has done for the workers.,49
215,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Does the honormanufacturer able member suggest that because these mining companies are not getting suffimore cient protection they are asking the workers to accept .a reduction of 20 per cent, in their wages?",49
216,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,They are getting too much protection.,49
217,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the honorA ablo member mean that because they so well protected they want still greater orable profits ?,49
218,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"My meaning is plain enough. The action of your friends has made the position of the worker worse, and j-et he has been obliged to accept lower wages. The mines cannot carry on otherwise.",49
219,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member evidently means that the workers at Mount Morgan, and, I suppose, also at Broken Hill and other mining centres, production. have been asked to accept reductions in wages, not because the companies cannot afford to pay.them the award rates, but because they have too much protection. In that case he cannot support the deH i mand of the companies that the men shall accept a 20 per oent. reduction wages, because he contends thab the companies are well able to pay the higher rate.",49
220,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I did not say that. said that your friends have made the position worse.,49
221,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is useless at- to tempting to camouflage the issue with me. The Mount Morgan, Broken H i l and Mount Lyell mining companies are seeking a reduction of wages, not cause of any Protective Tariff, but the same reason which actuates the  and other honourable members, whether they represent manufacturing or agriculaggravate tural industries. They seek a reduction of wages so that the employers' profits may be greater, and the workers'' share",49
222,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Has not this Tariff in creased the cost of labour? ' = Mr Considine - Employer s do not people because they are philanthropists. The man on the land is not a He cultivates the soil in order to make a living, and if he employs others he does it in order to make a profit ",49
223,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Ver y well. The also employs men, and in stals machinery for the same reason. The men he is able to employ the greater will be his profits, and the less he pays his men in wages the greater will be his own share of the profits. It is useless to talk about thei workers bearing their share of building up an industry. t no time do the workers get anything are approaching their share. ' The honmember for Dampier (Mr . Gregory)- says that it does not pay the mining companies to work their mines, but, according to the statements of the companies themselves, the mines are idle because, owing to the dislocation of Europe as a result of the war, there is no market for the metals they produce.",49
224,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"As the price of copper is so low, it does not pay the Mount Morgan mine toi work at the present cost of",49
225,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"What the honourable member says about Mount Morgan applies also to Mount Lyell and Broken l l . All these companies are in the samp boat, and, according to themselves, they in cannot sell their product overseas.",49
226,Mr BELL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Profitably .,49
227,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member knows that when they sell their I goods they do not sell them in order to give them away. Time and again I have asked the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) give me particulars in reference to the Broken Hill Company's products. The l , T a r if f makes no difference to them. The Prime Minister has told us that be the metals produced by the Austrafor lian mining companies cannot be got. honr i d of because the world is flooded with metals at the present time, and any attempt to dispose of more would merely the position, but it suits the books of the mining companies to promulgateamongst the unthinking portion of. the populace> the ideathat their mines are hung up because of extortionate demands made by the workingmen.",49
228,The CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY," Order.! , I think this discussion is very wide of the item, before the Chair.",50
229,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member for Dampier was contending, by interjection, that our metalliferous mines are lying idle because of. the operation of this Tariff, and he argues that we ought to reduce this particular item,because of the adverse effect a high duty would have upon Australian labour. On the other hand, I am endeavouring to point out that the Tariff has - had actually nothing to do with the working or non-working of the particular mines in questiou, and that, therefore, his argument is absolutely fallacious in its application to this item. My attitude towards the Tariff is well known to honourable members, and I merely content myself with pointing out to the workers outside that this discussion, as with all Others we bave had upon'the Tariff, really resolves itself into a contest between the importing interests and the manufacturing interests to get the better of one another irrespective of what' may happen to the working' classes as a whole. It is merely a competition between two sets of economic thieves to get at the working classes of this country, and, as a representative of thoseworking' classes, I say that, as between these two sets of thieves, I have no preference.",50
230,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wakefield) [8.58J - The Minister; (Mr Greene) is endeavouring to create one industry at the risk of destroying another which is our biggest and oldest-established industry. He went far afield to justif y this duty when he talked about potatoes, because', - while at times the price of potatoes is ruinously low, it-is at other times extravagantly high. On the average, year in and year out, the potato-grower is not badly off. However, it is not a question of what effect the duty may have - on the small inside farmer who merely needs barbed wire - for renewals. is the outside man who will have to bear the cost. It is in the outside areas that this heavy duty will certainly risk Australia's future. I think, it right to remind the Minister that the outside country in South Australia would not today be occupied with sheep if it had not been .for the enormous outlay of capital which was undertaken in that: State for the erection of rabbit and dog-i proof fenoes. If the Government are in terested, in the farmers at all,i I may in form them that the amount of capital so invested in South Australia was more than the actual rent pf. the country occupied. . If it had nob ibeen for that expenditure on rabbit and dogproof fences,, the outside country in South Australia now carrying sheepwould, as has been the case with some of the stations owned by the honourable member for Grampians, (Mr Jowett), have had to go back to. occupation by cattle, and honourable members know what that would mean so far as the increase of population is concerned - Land-holders in South Australia, undertook that expenditure with prices then ruling, and prices today, are two and one half times higher, than they were then. Some of the other States are threatened with the invasion of' vermin which land-holders in South Australia have been through, and at present prices there is much outlying country in the other States that it would not pay to preserve from vermin.",50
231,Mr MARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member should remember ,that the price of wool increased by three or four' times - what it was at the time to which he has referred.",50
232,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The prices, of wool have, increased,- and have been reduced again - To-day.. meatis at zero. ' Meat is at such a price now - that on many of the interior - stations it cannot be.grown at.a profit.",50
233,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Growin g . beef r is no good at all today. Mr RICHARD . FOSTER - That is so. Many outside stations are. today an absolute liability instead of an asset' to their owners. In the circumstances, I ask the Government to-consider whether they are justified, at this particular juncture, in imposing this enormous impost cn the occupiers of land. "" I listened to what the Minister had to say .as to the necessity of the establishment of works for the manufacture of iron and steel. I It agsree that, for our safety, we musb have such a development,! - but if the development: of the iron and steel, .industry, by means of the Tariff is .calculated, to do serious in j u r y . to the agricultural and pastoral industries, .then;I say that assistance should .be given,- to the - iron, and steel industry . in the iform of a bonus. Theduties proposed on these items threaten the stability of one of - our largest and most important - industries, and the impost will fall on one section of the community. I remind the Minister again of the statement which was made by'the manager of the company when it was first proposed to establish the Newcastle Iron 'Works. He is one of the biggest and brainiest men who ever came to Australia. In the matter of the development of the country, I , am . of opinion,, that Australia owes him . a greater obligation than it , owes to any other man who ever .came, here. I have the greatest admiration, for him - When he was. laying the plans for this big development of the iron and .steel indiistry he said that as the raw materials were to be., obtained in the country the company would not need to come to the . Government for assistance. Mr . FENTON - What does he say now ? Mr RICHARD .FOSTER - li e .says something different. now,, and I admit that ,he is justified in revising his - estimate,. , because the conditions altered. ,.",50
234,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I can see that Dave Watkins has his' eye .on - the honourable member. Mr RICHARD .FOSTER - I know that he has. I sympathize with the honourable member for, Newcastle (Mr Watkins). . He is putting up a good..case for .his.people, and they sheuld. appreciate what he is dping for . them. I ani trying to put up a case for one of the biggest industries,, in this, couptry, which should not have to carry the burden which the Government propose ,to place upon it . The conditions today are different from those which prevailed when Mr Delprat made his first estimate as to the prospects of the iron and s'teel industry, .but they will not always remain as' they are today. The prices of these items are two and a half times more today than they were'prior to the war, and I say'' that, at the prices' rilling today million's of acres i r l Australia are threatened by vermin. The cost at present prices of rabbit and dpg-proof fencing-and to be any' good there must be a large proportion' of barbed wire in it is such that people grazing sheep Cannot afford to fence against vermin, and they must walk off their' country,' and let it go back to the raising of cattle. In my o opinion, the request of the .Senate in this matter is a reasonable one, though - the duty suggested is considerably in: advance of that proposed in 1914. I think the Minister would do well to think the matter over again. . MT.. WATKINS - The Minister let me down on a previous item. . Mr RICHARD ' FOSTER - Yes, , and then he treated the honourable member very wsell. The honourable member's friends up north should think a lot. of him, .and he should think a . l o t of the Minister. , Mr . BELL (Darwin) [ 9 . 8 ] - I intend to support the request of the Senate with all the means at my disposal, which arerepresented .merely by my vote, because the arguments for and against a high duty on i these items have already been put .by both 'sides. The Minister (Mr Greene) has argued that if we agree'to'the duties!'he proposes, the result will be that the cost of these materials will be. less. If ""we could-believe that, contention there would be .no further debate, because all would haye be satisfied. The trouble is that we are. , , not. prepared to accept the honourable gentleman's view of. the .matter. I support the statements made by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gr-egory) and other honourable members, with regard tb the in j u r y which will be done, if we impose high duties on these items, to those who attempt to settle the outside districts, which it is .especially necessary in the in terests of the people bf the cities should be' developed.' 'The Minister said that the extra cost of fencing that would be in volved by the duties proposed would amount to very little.' .The extra cost of fencing annually involved on a well-estab-lished farm may'not'be"" a serious matter, but the Minister overlooks the fact .that it is in the initial stages'of development, that the man' on the land requires assistance. ' The honourable gentleman would not contend that because one man was carrying on a manufacturing industry profitably that would be a good reason for withdrawing a protective 'duty operating in its favour. It has'been argued over and over again that although some manufacturers may have successfully established an industry there are others whose factories are in .their infancy, and' must be - assisted. It is further said that we need competition in our own country, andfor these reasons we m-ust-continue the imposition of protective duties. The same argument applies witli equal force to the agricultural and pastoral industries. Because some farms are already protected against the ravages of rabbits or wild dogs, that is no reason why we should not come to the assistance of those commencing settlement in the back country. I am afraid that the Minister and other honourable members do not appreciate what vermin-proof fencing costs.",51
235,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I have put up a few miles of it .,52
236,Mr BELL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then the honourable gentleman should know that the cost of fencing is a very serious item. To fence the boundary of a block of land 100 acres in extent would, at present prices, run into considerably over £ 1 per acre. If the block is to be subdivided into paddocks, which is very necessary for dairying and other brandies of the industry, it will not be long before the cost of fencing on a 100-acre farm runs into something like £ 3 per acre.",52
237,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,If I could not do the fencing for less than £ 3 per acre I would eat my hat.,52
238,Mr BELL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Has the Minister any idea of what it would cost at the present prices of wire to put a boundary around"" a block of 100 acres 1",52
239,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It would cost about £75.,52
240,Mr BELL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am sure that even in the districts where timber for posts oould be obtained at a reasonable cost, no one could erect such a boundary fence for less than £ 1 per acre. The Minister must recognise that the subdivision of such an area into small paddocks is very necessary, and if he thinks that the fencing of the boundaries of a 100-acre block, and it s . subdivision into the necessary paddocks, could be done for' less than £ 3 per acre, then I can only conclude that he is quite out of touch with the cost of fencing at the present time. When this item was previously under consideration, I referred at some length to the ravages of the rabbit pest, and other honourable members had a good deal to say about the ravages of the wild dog pest. I do not wish to repeat what I said then, but it must be obvious to honourable members who know anything of the country districts that fencing against vermin is absolutely necessary in all of the States if our lands are to be profitably used. posed constitute a very serious impost on the man on the land. Over and over again honourable members have affirmed that the one thing necessary for Australia is to people our unoccupied lands. Certain people take the platform and assert that what we require most is decentralization, and then they do everything possible to prevent it . It is in the interests of city dwellers more particularly that our country spaces should be occupied, and our large areas subdivided, so that the empty spaces of Australia may be put to the most profitable use. I - endorse the view expressed by some honourable memc bers that an attempt is being made to bolster up certain industries at the expense of others which are certainly of equal importance. I invite honourable members to give special attention to that aspect of the situation. It is impossible to maintain the high wages that are being paid in the secondary industries if as the result of duties imposed to encourage them our mining and agricultural industries cannot be profitably carried on. Whilst certain honourable members in the interests of the workmen employed in the production of iron and steel and other secondary products desire the imposition fence of a high Tariff, it must be obvious to them that it is impossible to maintain the present high rates of wages in that in dustry if others of equal importance are, as a result of that Tariff, to be rendered unprofitable. Important although these secondary industries are, it is unfair to ask the agricultural and mining industries, which cannot benefit by high Protection, to bear the whole of the cost of the Tariff which we are imposing for the purpose of building them up. Throughout the consideration of the Tariff, I have supported what I have considered to be a reasonable measure of Protection, recognising that it is essential that new in dustries should be established. At the same time, I think that in respect of many items, and in the case of this one more particularly, we have overstepped the mark. I shall support the Senate's request, and I sincerely hope the Committee will view it in the light that I do.",52
241,Mr MARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Parkes) [9.20] - The majority of those who have spoken on the motion have supported the request made by the Senate. I wish to re-affirm The duties pro- my belief in the duties imposed under the item in the T a r if f as sent to the Senate. The people of Australia at the last general election declared for a policy of reasonable protection to all our primary as well as secondary industries. If we hope to develop this country, we must have regard to our secondary industries. For forty years a firm in New South Wales has been manufacturing barbed wire and wire netting. It commenced operations when blooms and rods were free, and was thus able to compete with the products of other countries. With the object of developing the iron and steel industry in Australia, we have now imposed heavy duties on rods and blooms-the raw material of the barbed wire and wire-netting industry-and it is tlierefore absolutely necessary that we should give reasonable protection under this item. Messrs. Lysaght Brothers, of Sydney, have employed as many as 1,400 hands. ""  Greene) says that Protection will make things cheaper.",52
242,Mr MARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not think any will say that, but it must be conceded that a Protective policy helps to develop the country. It will help Australia to come more self-contained, and it also has the advantage of keeping in the country money that would otherwise be sent abroad. Why, for instance, should sending our wool to other countries to be manufactured into woollens and various other things for our use? Why should we not convert the raw material into the manufactured article here? By working up one-third of the Australian merino wool the land."" clip alone we could find employment for 500,000 additional hands in Australia. are. The effect of that increased employment in secondary industries would he felt by the primary producers, who would thus have a larger home market.  from working up our wool into the manuless factured' article?",53
243,Mr MARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The lack of patriotism. What is to be said of a man who oa the street corner urges the people to patronize Australian industries, yet obtains his requirements from foreigners. Go into a big city house and ask for a suit of Australian serge, and you will be told ""We do not make serges here."" We for thirty or forty years? [492] could produce them without trouble if the necessary encouragement were only forthcoming. In order to develop Australia we should stand by our secondary and primary industries. Messrs. Lysaght have been manufacturing wire-netting for forty years, and it is up to us to see they "" do not go to the wall"" for lack of protection. In February last they employed 1,400 men, some of whom had been in the trade for thirty years, but quite a number of them are today walking the streets, because, while we have imposed big duties on the raw material of the industry, we have not ""sufficiently protected the manufactured article. Last week I obtained the latest figures with regard to German and Belgian barbed wire. Belgian barbed wire is quoted f.o.b., Antwerp, at £12 per ton, and German barbed wire, of the same gauge, at £15 per ton. It can be landed (Mr here, after payment of freight and duty, at £24 per ton, yet the same material cannot be made in Australia 'to-d'ay under £31 per ton. Why should we not keep one the local industry fully employed?",53
244,Mr FOLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,And tax the primary inbedustry in order that that might be done?,53
245,Mr MARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Not at all. If we tax the primary producers they will see to it that the man who has to buy over the we he counter recoups them.,53
246,Mr HILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,They cannot do it.,53
247,Mr MARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But they can. We are producing more wheat than ever, and it is idle to tell me that men are going off ",53
248,Mr MARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the number of people on the land is growing less, then those remaining must be acquiring larger areas. In this industry, in which 1,400 us men were employed in February last, than 500 are engaged today. I was told, only last week, by a member of the firm, that unless the Parliament took a reasonable view of the claims of the industry ' they would have to close down own these works and import wire-netting. Would that be a fair thing to those who have spent years' in learning the trade, and have been employed in the industry",53
249,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member's argument is that this firm was able to build up a big industry when wire-netting was free, and that noAv there is a duty ou wire-netting it is likely to close down.",54
250,Mr MARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I explained that when their raw material was free they were able to carry on, but since their raw material has been taxed, with the object of building up the iron aud steel industry, they require reasonable protection to enable them to carry on. ""We should carry our Protective policy to its logical conclusion. At a deputation which waited on the Minister for Trade and Customs in„ Sydney recently, I heard evidence given by representatives of the New South ""Wales branch of the Wire-netting Workers Union. Men with thirty years' experience of Messrs. Lysaght's Limited said that they desired to express their appreciation of the manner in which it had dealt with the union. Surely we have a right to consider a firm that has dealt fairly by its employees. I shall always he prepared to vote for the encouragement of Australian industries.

252,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Dampier) [9.37] In order to test the feeling of the Committee, I move That the requested amendment be made with the following modification:-""pe r ton, Britisb, free; intermediate, 10s.; general, 10s."" We have just listened to an important speech by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr), dealing with the progress made by this industry during the last forty years, and before these NOES. duties were imposed. Prior to March last wire netting was admitted free.",54
253,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,-T n pre-Federation days there was a duty of £3 per ton in Victoria.,54
254,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The industry, according to the honourable member forParkes, is employing 1,400 nien. I had no idea it had grown to such proportions.",54
255,Mr EICHABD FOSTEB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Where are - they employed ?,55
256,Mr GEEGOEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member foT Parkes said they are employed in Sydney.,55
257,Mr GREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There . is nothing like 1,400 men employed exclusively in the making of wire netting.",55
258,Mr GEEGOEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"1 do not think the honoraible member, when he spoke, realized that the Senate had requested a reduction of duties in a .suibsequent item dealing with the iron and steel wire required for the manufacture of wire netting. On the Estimates there is .still a sum of £10,000 for the payment of bounties on the production of iron and steel. I do not know if it is the intention of the Government to offer these bounties in. addition to the enormous duties that have been imposed; hut it is .a very significant fact that no effort has been made to repeal the Act. I .suggest that, instead of the man on the land being called upon to bear the whole of the burden apparently necessary for the development of the wire-netting industry in this country, some proportion of the cost should fall on the general community. If the primary producer is to be encouraged to wire-net his property, in order to keep out rabbit3 and other vermin pests, and so increase production, it is essential that he should be able to get his requirements in the way of wire netting at a reasonable cost.",55
259,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Do you think that if we had Free Trade in this industry tomorrow we Would get wire netting any cheaper ?,55
260,Mr GREGOR Y,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Most decidedly, I do. Why ask such a foolish question?",55
261,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is well known that a combination of importers is infinitely worse than a cdmbination of local manufacturers.,55
262,Mr GEEGOEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Does the honourable member suggest that the man on the land should be specially taxed-for that is the effect of these duties-for the purpose of building up the wire-netting industry?

Senate's Request - British , 15 per cent.; intermediate, 25 - per cent.; general, 30 per cent.",55
263,Mr MASSYGREENE,E M IS K,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.49] - This and the following six requests deal, for the most part, with agricultural implements. We adjusted these duties by adding 2^ per oent. to the duties that previously were in force to cover the protection on the raw material from which the implements are made-this , of course, is a rough and ready way-and then we raised the foreign duties 5 per cent, in favour of Great Britain . In that form these duties were passed by this Chamber; and the Senate has requested a reduction of the British preferential duty below the pre-war duty. The Senate has not taken - into account the fact that we are now manufacturing this machinery entirely from our own raw materials. The request slightly increases the amount of British preference, it is true, bu t by reducing the duty on British goods by 7\ per cent., and the foreign duty by 5 per cent. I do not think that ought to be done. I am most anxious to see foreign machinery altogether cut out of the Australian market. We can make, and have made in the past, the best agricultural machinery that Australian producers have ever used, and it is to Australian inventors that this fact is due, particularly in the case of wheat. The Government are very anxious to see this industry still further developed. I am quite satisfied from figures that I have already given honourable members that it can be shown that the establishment of the Australiaif industry has led to the farmers getting their machinery at a lower price than they would if the industry had not been established. ",56
264,Mr MASSYGREENE,E M IS K,"The honourable member must admit that the American manufacturers, who are selling machinery in Australia, 'are accepting a lower price here than they do in other countries.  is paying more for his machinery than do«s the American farmer.",56
265,Mr MASSYGREENE,E M IS K,"That is true, but if the Australian farmer were as loyal to Australian machinery as the American farmer is to American machinery, I venture to say he would be paying a great deal less. The reason our own agricultural machinery manufacturers have not been able to reduce their prices is that they have always had this influx of foreign machinjBty to face, and they cannot get the necessary turnover to enable them to reduce overhead charges, and, as a result, reduce costs. I do not think that we should accept the request of the Senate; we should not be justified in doing so. I regard the original duties on this machinery as moderate and as sumcient to effectively do that which we desire shall be done-secur e for Australia the manufacture of practically all we require. I am glad to see that the Tariff is proving effective, and that one of our biggest competitors is coming to manufacture in this country. That is exactly what the Tariff is designed to do, not only to secure the manufacture here of what we require, and can manufacture, bu t to create within our own borders the necessary competition which I admit is in the circumstances desirable, and provide employment that heretofore has gone i o other countries. This industry will result in the employment of a very large number of men. If the £1,500,000 worth of machinery, which the honourable member  ing about, is manufactured in Australia instead of abroad, in all probability it will mean the employment of at least 3,000 additional workers in this country. ",56
266,Mr MASSYGREENE,E M IS K,"What does it matter where the employment is given so long as it is in Australia ? These 3,000 additional - workers, with their wives andfamilies, will mean at least 9,000 persons; and when we take into consideration the butchers, the bakers, and all who administer to their needs, we have a population of at least 15,000 persons for whom work is found. This population, in its turn , will put hundreds of primary producers on the soil, and give them an immediate and ready market. That is the object of a Protectionist Tariff. It puts men on the land and keeps them there. 1  so?",56
267,Mr MASSYGREENE,E M IS K,"It is doing so all over Australia today. Were it not for the secondary industries the primary producers would be in a parlous position. , I am satisfied that if this country is to develop rurally as well as industrially, the only way is by the establishment of big secondary industries. I move That the requested amendment be not made.  the Committee will agree to the requests of the Senate. I am sorry that I cannot accept the view put before us by the Minister (Mr Greene). I admire the honourable gentleman for his fidelity to that which he conscientiously believes, but I have grave reasons for thinking him convinced ou wrong lines. He must manifestly be wrong in his deductions as to manufacturing in Australia developing rural industries. For eighteen years of Federation it might be said that Victoria and Melbourne were the great Protectionist centres, and did the most manufacturing; but during that period Victoria has increased her population by only 190,000 persons, whereas the population' of Melbourne has increased by close on 220,000 persons. It will be seen that Melbourne not only absorbed the whole of the increase in the population, but. drew nearly 30,000 persons from rural parts. How can the Minister say that additional manufactures here have not affected the rural districts ? The recent census has disclosed a similar state of affairs in all the States. The populationa of Western Australia during the decade increased by 48,000, while the population of Perth increased by 51,000. Necessary manufacturing is a good thing, but there should be a proper balance. Unless there be a sale for the things manufactured, the manufacturing is to no purpose. All the money that we live on comes out of the soil. The agricultural machinery is paid for by what the soil produces-al l comes from the soil. We should not do anything, to retard the proper development of the country districts, for that not only injures the primary producer, but every form of industry. There is no doubt about the logic of that. If we bring 3,000 additional people here to manufacture machines, it may ba more than are necessary, and it means that there are a greater number to feed out of that produced by the people on the land. This additional number will clamour for higher wages and cheaper food, a demand which can be met only at the expense of the man on the land. I have no objection to the extension of these industries, but they ought to be established in reasonable proportion to the rural producer, who has to buy the costly output. At present, everything is out of proportion.",56
268,Mr FENTON,E M IS K,"We send millions of pounds out of this country every year. Would it not be better to employ the people here and provide additional customers for the products of those who work on the land?  done here; but if the primary producers have to pay £12,000,000 for machinery manufactured here, which would cost £10,000,000 outside, it is difficult to persuade them that they are being assisted when they have to enter into competition with those in other countries who are able to purchase agricultural implements at a lower rate. I am paying, at least, £120 more for a harvester than an American competitor, after deducting freight and all other incidental charges. An Australian wheat-grower is 9,000 miles farther from the world's principal markets than an American primary producer, and it is time the members of this Committee began to study the question of Protection all round.",57
269,Mr FENTON,E M IS K,"That is the position in country with a Protective policy. Give us a. chance, and we will do even better.  Trade arid Customs (Mr Greene) has repeatedly quoted the Protective policy of America; but does he not see that Congress has had sumcient foresight to admit agricultural machinery free, because it is highly essential in any country that primary production should not be hampered. Here we are bleeding the producers as if they were an insignificant section. We are not taking any lesson fro m statistics, and are bolstering up an industry to an extent that is not justified.",57
270,Mr FENTON,E M IS K,"Compar e Canada with Australia, and how do you stand?  protective duties than we have, and many of the principal countries in the world admit agricultural machinery free of duty. I believe that some honourable members are regarding the manufacturing business in the lighti n which the English manufacturers are considering it , although the position is entirely different. The Britis h people make their money from their manufactures; that is their means of livelihood and method of obtaining, new money. They sell their manufactures abroad, and that is how they derive capital upon which to operate. We are a primary-producing country, and proNduce to derive the money on which Australia lives. It is very desirable if we - can .manufacture the goods we require and save at both ends, but snobody would ^suggest that we should set manufactures above primary production, from which - we.get the - whole of our money.",57
271,Mr MATHEWS,E M IS K,"They should be considered side by side.  each other closely; but primary production should always precede and Jiave preference. The Minister for Trade and Customs seemed to ridicule j n y interjection concerning the 3,000 employees, because he said, "" W h at of that ? "" It would be infinitely better if that number of men were placed on the land, because there would then be an additional demand ""for manufactured implements. week a farmer in Western Australia - said, "" I want another machine; but what a price-£23 0 for a harvester."" - costs are piled on to falling prices there is likely to be further centralization, and when that reasoning is carried to the extreme it means that there will be no one in the country to earn the money. In such circumstances, for whom are we going to manufacture? We cannot sell to America unless the overhead charges are reduced. The only men to whom we can sell are those developing Australian land, and it is by the votes recorded in this Parliament that men are being driven off the land, and I warn honourable members not to assist in doing anything in that direction. We speak of a Protective policy; but what protection is being given' to the primary industries which provide new money with which to pay our debts?",58
272,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,E M IS K,"I l l a w a r r a ) [10.8] - T do not intend to detain the Committee .at length, but in listening to a speech by an honourable member who claims to be logical I naturally looked for some logic in his utterances. His remarks have puzzled me a .good deal. The hon and those associated with 'bam are very fond of referring 'to the people engaged in - primary industries as though they were the only ones --who did any useful work in the community. 'The man who produces - wheat :is - not going Ito eat it as wheat. Before *he consumes it :h& must be raided - by those 'who convert the wlheat in to flour, and - by those who make '.the f o u r into, bread. It seams to me that these gentlemen, if they apply their logical minds to the real facts, will find that instead of directing their fight as they do against those who wish to develop the industries of this .country, they would be better employed in attacking the parasites who exist on all classes. I am prepared to pay a little more for Australian wheat than for grain that is im ported, and I believe that I am interpreting - the - minds of a m a j o r it y of the Australian people aright when I say that they are prepared to pay more for goods manufactured here - than for those imj1 . ported from abroad, - and particularly those imported i r o m cheap-labour countries, which seem to have such an 'attraction for some honourable members. The honourable .member for Swan .spoke .of the (growing demands - of the Australian Only this workers, but he shut his eyes to the fact .that the .American workmen are organized trade unionists, and the Canadians, for If the whom he bas so many .good words, are also highly organized. If the honourable member cares to ascertain the wages paid to the American workmen engaged in the manufacture of agricultural implements he will find that they are receiving a good deal more"" than the Australian workmen. Therefore, the oratory we heard a moment ago concerning the difficulties and high wages associated with Protection all goes by the board; because it has no bearing on the matter whatever. The honourable member for Swan delights in quoting figures, and submits tables when it suits his case; but lie failed to tell us what quantity of these goods were imported into America under a free T a r if f . As a fact, America deals with Canada, and 'Canada with America, and that is the end of the agricultural machinery Tariff. There are practically no importations of agricultural machinery into the United States of America, and I believe the time will come .when our agricultural machinery will be made under such conditions that importations will cease also. I am sure that if protection were needed to safeguard the American industry, it would .be afforded.; but the industry - has been developed in America uftder 'the .highest [Protective T a r i ff in the world ; and if , as the honourable member sajvs, it has resulted in the production of the cheapest agricultural machinery in the world, she has set Australia an example which we ought to be proud to follow. 1",58
273,Mr GEEGORY,E M IS K,"Dampier) [10.18] - I was anticipating that the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) would have made some concession in regard to these duties. When the Tariff was previously .under discussion, the matter was full y debated, and it is not now my in tention to repeat the arguments that were dwm adduced. Careful consideration has been given to the matter in another place, where it has been suggested that the duties should be reduced to some extent. The honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) referred to the manufacture of agricultural implements in America, and the statement has been made that lower wages ar.e paid therethan in Australia. That is far from the fact, because I quoted a statement made by Mr Brownley, a Labour leader,, who was. sent to America in. May last to report on, the question of wagesi n the industry. He found that the American workman: in the iron; andsteel industry was-receiving', on. the aver agej 3s. l d . per hour, as against ls. Sd. in Great Britain . I . gave figures from the Australian and : Canadian Te.ar-Boo3c - s. showing that th<» wages paid to workmeni n the machinery manufacturing industry in Canada were 34 per ceut. higher than those paid in Australia. It is strange that the Canadian farmer should be able to obtain a reaper or a binder for £ 6 0 , while the Austnalian farmer has to pay £102 or £ 1 0 3 for the same machine advioe I had was that those reapers and binders had been landed in Australia in November and December, 1920, and were being sold on a duty of 10 per cent. W it h an: extra duty of 45 per cent, the price would be £ 1 3 0 .",59
274,Mr MASSYGREENE,E M IS K,"Do youthink the price"" will go up to £130 ?",59
275,Mr GREGORY,E M IS K,"I have not seen this year's figures, but the Minister has not been fair and generous to the Committee. I protest strongly against the attitude he took up the other night, when he gave a lecture on the want of loyalty on the part of honourable members. The want of loyalty has been on the part of. the Minister himself. Mr GREENE. - What is wrong, now ?",59
276,Mr GREGORY,E M IS K,"Everything is wrong. Honourable members will recollect that I challenged"" th© Minister, and asked him to let us have the information received regarding the price at which reapers and - binders were being sold to the producers i h Canada and the United States of America. The Minister had that information. I was aware that he had sent for it , and after pressure we had it placed on the table in the Library. To the cost of the machine the Minister added the exchange fixed here to Canada, raising the cost of the machine by £ 6 . The exchange had nothing to do with the matter. The Canadian farmer paid in Canadian money, and the fact that there was a difference in exchange values of about £ 1 7 in £100 at that time made no difference in the price the Canadian farmer hadto pay. He gave £ 6 0 , while tha farmer in Australia had to pay from £ 9 6 to- £102.. Probably the price will, come down. We know that wages are-beingreduced, and that there has been a big reduction in the cost of iron and steel since the war; that is why the Minister has been so anxious, in connection with many of the iron and steel duties. The principal things-needed in Australia today are population and'- production. When the back country is settled there will be ample demand for the 1 output of our great manufacturing' in -, dustries, and I hope there will be a market that will give the producers machinery at the same prices as obtain: in other countries. I very muchresent the atti tude the Minister has adopted on manyoccasions. He is looking after the in All the terests of the manufacturers only, and. he has persuaded honourable members opposite that, in supporting him,, they are doing what is best for the workers. I object to the way in which the suggestions of the Senate are being treated. I had hoped that, after the care taken in another place, more favourable consider a, tion would be given to the requests sent dlown.",59

If the Minister studies the schedule he will see that it applies to machines most of which are not made in Australia. The rates provided for in item 161 are revenue rates. Personally, I do not regard such items as of much importB u t the duties on reaper and * threshers, reaper and binders, hay rakes, and machinery of that sort are important. This machinery has but a short life, and is very expensive. It should not be dearer in Australia than in other countries. Our workmen are the equal of those of other countries, but our methods must be defective if they require duties of 45 per cent, to protect their industry. had The persons employed in our workshops can get nearly all the machinery they need practically free of duty, but the farmers ? pay highly for everything they have to The Minister has told us that under item 174 millions of pounds' worth of of goods have been admitted duty free; but why should one section of the community get .its machinery free while the primary producers pay heavily?

Furthermore, our manufacturers sell their machines in the Argentine for less than they charge in Australia, and therefore any want of patriotism that there may be in this matter is not on the Bide of the farmers.",60

293,Mr FOLEY,E M IS K,"There are many farmers in my electorate. In September last these men were paying £ 8 0 for a reaper and binder, bub the price of that machine went up to £ 1 0 0 , and now it is still higher. The price of the reaper and thresher has increased, and a decent-sized harvester now costs nearly £200. If Australian manufacturers ' can sell mors cheaply in the Argentine than they sell in Australia, why do they need extra protection ? Agricultural machinery is admitted free into sixty-eight countries. There are forty countries in which slight duties are imposed, and only one in all the world which has established a prohibitive duty. That country is Great Britain . . Secondary industries are as necessary as primary industries; the one group should work with the other. But. unless farming life is made more attractive, and farmers afforded some f a ir amount of sistance, we cannot hope to keep primary industries going. I doubt if any honourable member 'would, as a matter of principle and practice, pay more for Australian machines, or goods, or articles in preference to purchasing cheaper imported lines. Price governs the buyer's solection almost every time; the origin of the article is Beldom worried about. I desire to help Australian industries, but I do not propose to abet Australian manufacturers in cnarging a higher price for these machines than is paid in the Argentine. The request of the Senate is fair, and should be acceded to.",61
294,Mr BELL,E M IS K,"Darwin) [10.43] - Milk - this country. ing machines are among the manufactures embraced in the group under discussion. It is rather curious that there has been no consideration of the manufacture of these machines since the Tariff was in troduced. Previous opportunities for suggesting that, in the interests of the dairying industry, milking machines should be admitted duty free, have been missed; and, unfortunately, the Minister (Mr . Greene) is absent from the chamber at this moment. I desired information concerning the extent of the manufacture in Australia; and I had hoped to succeed in pressing upou the Minister the fairness of admitting the machines free of duty. - Shortly before the Tariff Bill was despatched to another place, I pleaded for the recommittal of (his item, but I had to he content with a promise that my arguments and suggestions would be gone into, and that, if my representations impressed the Minister and his Department, certain steps would be taken elsewhere. Nothing was done, however. I presume that the Minister was not convinced of the wisdom of permitting milking maohines to be imported free of Customs charges. If child lahour is to be eliminated from the dairying industry, and if dairy-farmers are to be given reasonable encouragement, my suggestion should he adopted.",61
295,Sir JOSEPH COOK,E M IS K,"I am informed that departmental inquiries have been made, and that it has been ascertained' that eight Australian firms are making milking machines.",61
296,Mr BELL,E M IS K,"That is news to me. I have not been able to discover them. T as- know of one machine which is said to be manufactured in Australia, but I understand that only portion of it is made here. In any case, the degree of protection afforded to local manufacturers is more than ample. In the circumstances, all I can hope for is that the request of the Senate will be agreed to.",61
297,Mr GREGORY,E M IS K,"Dampier) [10.48] The Government should consider whether they cannot fairly and reasonably give way upon the matter under discussion. By their unsympathetic attitude, honourable members lay themselves open to a charge of deliberately favouring, if not actively helping, a body of exploiters in Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.60 p.m.",61
