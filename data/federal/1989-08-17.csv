Interest Rates To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families. Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House require the Hawke-Keating Government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.

Family Allowances To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That taxpayers with dependent children have been gravely disadvantaged by a serious decline in the level of recognition provided in the taxation system for the costs of maintaini-g a family, in particular: the failure to index family allowances which has resulted in an erosion of more than 50% in their real value since May 1976; the abolition of family allowances for dependants who have turned 18, even those still at school; the abolition of concessional tax rebates for education, and other expenses. That this erosion in horizontal tax equity has placed an intolerable financial burden on many larger families, particularly those on middle incomes who fail to qualify for means-tested benefits such as TEAS but' whoseJ'living standards are now well below average due to heavy expenses on necessities such as education, housing, food and clothing.

To the Honourable the Speakei"" and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned endorse the actions of Graeme Campbell MP, in pursuing his stance against removing company tax exemptions for gold producers. We further commend the work of the Western Australian Government to have the Federal Government's decision on gold tax reversed. Unlike the assistance provided to Australian manufacturing industry, the taxation arrangement applying to gold is transparent and therefore an easy target. Moreover, because of the concentration of the industry in remote areas of Western Australia, far from Canberra, the legitimate voice of the industry is drowned out by special interest groups close to the capital. The proposed change to the gold taxation regime has already produced substantial distortions in exploration drilling activity and development plans of gold mines. Exploration drilling has declined and there is a real risk that some mines could begin the high grading of their ore bodieS which will shorten the life of the mine. The Western Australian Government has strongly opposed the proposed tax changes because of these distorting effects. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you will ,give this matter earnest consideration and your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Campbell (from 290 citizens).

At the same time there has been a considerable reduction in the amount of Federal fuel excise taxation spent on roads, reduced from 66 per cent in 1983 to 20 per cent in 1989.

The report of the Senate Committee recommended in October 1986 that the Commonwealth Government make unlawful any destructive experiment which frustrated the development of the human embryo.

They know the Flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war 4. They recall that millions of native born Australians and newcomers to these shores from other parts of the world have become united under its proud symbolism 5.

The continuation of rising horne loan interest rates are imposing a crippling burden on mortgagees causing a decline of the Australian family lifestyle. 2. The continuation of high horne loan intereSt rates is creating personal financial hardship and will precipitate increased marriage breakdowns, family separation and divorce placing further demands on the Australian Welfare system. 3.

(b) makes food look fresh for longer but damages vitamins A, B,. C, E. & F; at a time when people are encouraged to eat more fresh foods. (c) has been used by major food companies to cover up and sell condemned foods. As there are no easy tests to detect irradiated foods, public health bodies cannot stamp out these abuses or guarantee irradiated foods will be labelled. (d) will make necessary the use of unwanted chemicals and additives to cover up the many unpleasant side-effects of the process on taste, smell, texture and colour. (e) inevitably, irradiated products from countries with questionable safety standards will be dumped on Australia, to the detriment of our health and our food producing economy. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the Australia are essen- House to: (a) impose an immediate moratorium on the process of ""Food Irradiation"".

Beyond the mortality figures, all sheep endure the stress of the voyage and the cruelty of halal slaughter (which has recently been banned in Britain). Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled should accept the findings of the Senate Select Committee. In particular: I. to phase out the live sheep export trade over 5 years and to sub-titute for it a refrigerated sheepmeat trade, 2. in the interim, to give the Australian Agricultural Health and Quarantine Service responsibility for the welfare of export sheep in Australia, including the power to stop abuses, 3. in the interim, to implement the Senate Select Committee's recommendations regarding the improvement of current conditions and husbandry practices.

And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Spender (from 31 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that they are totally opposed to any change in the present Australian National Flag as declared in the Flags Act (1953).

Child Pornography: X-Rated Videos To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives of the Parliament of Australia assembled. We, the undersigned, being appalled that the Government has set no penalty for importing unclassified child pornography, do ask that Parliament urgently legislate to: Make the importation of child pornography, and the possession of child pornography, and all tapes and goods banned by Customs, to be a criminal offence, with deterrent penalties, and Close the Customs barriers to pornography in the A.C.T., in respect of X rated videos, (and ER) and end the shameful Canberra trade, and the Mafia connections. Because 98% of Australians in other States have banned X rated videos. Because the trade is still flourishing, and it's availability escalates sexual crime. Because importers of child pornography face only a fine for lying. Because child pornography peddlers are safe if they cross a border, and cannot be extradited for a summary offence. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you will give this matter earnest consideration. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Webster (from 20 citizens).

2,Mr LEE ,ELECTORAL MATTERS,"Dobell) (10.17) - On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the Committee's report incorporating dissenting reports on the conduct of the 1987 Federal election and the 1988 referendum entitledÂ· Who pays the piper calls the tune-minimising the risks of funding political campaigns, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",131
3,Mr LEE,ELECTORAL MATTERS,"This report was released 10 days ago. I am very grateful to the House for agreeing to allow it to be released during the winter recess. Two major proposals are contained in its recommendations. The first is that the current system of free time that applies on Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio and television be extended to commercial radio and television. However, it would be conditional on all political parties disclosing all donations, all income and all gifts and, in addition, agreeing to undergo spot audits by the Australian Electoral Commission. . I would like to place on record my appreciation of the contribution of all members of the Committee during the consideration and the drafting of this report. As men and women of goodwill we have had our disagreements about which recommendations we should be bringing forward, and I am sure that in the debate today all members of the House will become. aware of our differences of opinion as to the best thing we can do to ensure that corruption does not get a foothold in the Australian political system. We have come down with different points of view. They are strongly held but, of course, that is part of the democratic process. I would encourage as many honourable members as possible to read the report and the dissenting reports. I am very disappointed that in the debate that took place in the Senate yesterday some members of the Opposition sought to attack me personally, and my Party, for this report. I certainly know that members of the Committee have not sunk to those depths and I hope that that does not occur. I would like also to place on record my appreciation of the work done by Trevor . Rowe, the former secretary of the Commitbe tee; Denise Denahy, who helped out in parcandidates ticular on this report; Helen MisaÂ·, who always there to help us; and our new staff, including Allan Kelly, the new Secretary the Committee. Turning to the recommendations in the report, the main motivation for our recomture mendation is that at the 1987 election all the political parties spent $9.17m on adverAustralia tising on radio and television. That wa,s an increase of 130 per cent over such expendibreak ture at the previous election-more than double. Unfortunately, public funding is dexed according to the consumer price index, so while the cost of radio and television advertisements to political parties went by 137 per cent, the public funding they received went up by only 32 per If nothing is done we will. find that the political parties will be spending double the amount on commercial radio and television at each subsequent election. There is a choice which. the Parliament and the people face. Do they want a system in which our political parties become dependent on major donors, be they the corporate sector, individuals trade unions, or do they want a system that makes sure that our political parties do not have to be out there begging for donations? I believe that if we do nothing we will simply be seeing the system of political ruption that we have seen exposed in that Queensland extend to all parties in all States. That is something I believe we have to stop. Some people have said, 'Well, there are ternatives besides free time'. Some, like honourable member for Warringah ( Mr of MACKellar) might say, 'Why don't you inone crease public funding?'. Of course, that would be at a massive cost to the taxpayer. The problem with that is that the taxpayer would be paying double the public funding at the next election, double at the subsequent tion, and double again at each subsequent election. So that is simply a recipe for makFitzgerald in Queensland. ing the taxpayer pay massive sums of money because of the rates that are charged by commercial radio and television. Other people, such as Senator Harradine, have argued passionately for limits on penditure as a way to stop the problems get occurring. That has, of course, been tried in the past in Australia. I think there used to a ceiling of 150 pounds or 250 pounds on for the House of Representatives is and 'the Senate many years ago. We all know that those limits were simply ignored; most of candidates spent more than the limit and nothing was done. It was a joke; the rules did not work. Limits on campaign expendihave been tried before in Australia and of they have not worked. The Liberal Party of argues for tax deductability for political donations. Again, this would be a tax funded by ordinary taxpayers. It is my view, and the view of the majority of meminbers of this Committee, that we should not be putting that burden on the taxpayerthat we should be extending the current sysup tem of free time which applies to the Auswhich tralian Broadcasting Corporation to cent. commercial radio and televisioh. Senator Puplick in the Senate yesterday said there was not the slightest evidence that money had corrupted the Australian political process. I refer Senator Puplick to the Fitzgerald report. Tony Fitzgerald argues passionately in favour of a public register for donations. In the Fitzgerald report it was or exposed that companies like Citra Constructions Ltd were donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to win contracts to do work in the Queensland public hospital system. Companies like Electric Power Transmission corPty Ltd and Citra were making donations so they could win contracts to electrify the Queensland railway network. Also we have had evidence that a particular Asian busialnessman left aÂ· donation of more than the $100,000 in a brown paper bag in the office the Premier. What greater evidence would need that we have a problem with political corruption in our system already? In Queensland there are no rules at all for any disclosure at the moment, and from the messages coming out of Mike Ahern's office it is elecvery clear that the Nationals will try to block disclosure as recommended by Tony . . It is not only in Queensland that the problem exists. The problem exists particularly at the State level. It is at the State level that land rezonings have to be approved. It is at exthe State level that development proposals the nod. It is at the State level that the greatest danger exists, and at the moment New South Wales is the only State where there are any disclosure laws for State election campaign donations. What is happening in New South Wales? We are able to read what is happening in the inquiry of the Independent Commission against Corruption into what is happening on the New South Wales north coast. We have had two Ministers of the Crown in New South Wales appearing to give evidence before the Independent Commission against Corruption. We have seen a developer admit that he has made donations of tens of thousands of dollars, not only to the conservative side of politics, but also to my side of politics. The State Minister for Natural Resources in New South Wales denied that he knew that this particular developer had made a donation to his party. He denied that he knew that the Leader of his party, the Deputy Premier of New South Wales, had had lunch with the chief lobbyist for this project. What did that National Party Minister for Resources say? He said, 'If only I had known'-Mr Tim Fischer-On a point of order, Madam Speaker: The matter before the House is debate arising from the tabling of an extraordinary report from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I put to you, Madam Speaker, that the Chairman of that Committee, the honourable member for Dobell, is now straying outside the terms of reference, and I would put a second consideration-MONICA",131
4,Mr LEE,ELECTORAL MATTERS,"Stop wasting time. Mr Tim Fischer-I am not wasting time. The honourable member is also now referring to matters which are in part. sub judice before the ICAC of New South Wales. There is an agreement between Robert Carr, Nick Greiner and others, and the Chairman of that ICAC, that political capital will not be made out of those hearings until the matters are brought to their finality. Therefore the honourableÂ· member for Dobell should be brought back to the specifics of his particular report.",133
5,Madam SPEAKER,ELECTORAL MATTERS,I think the honourable member for Dobell was supporting his argument. He will now continue with the recommendations.,133
6,Mr LEE,ELECTORAL MATTERS,"Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would finish my comment by saying that Mr Causley in evidence at the ICAC simply said that if only he had known that that donation had gone to his party, he would have dealt with the matter differently. That is in evidence and it has been reported. What is the policy of the honourable member's party on disclosure of donations? What is Mr Greiner's policy on disclosure of donations? The Deputy Chairman of this Committee, when we tabled the report, said that it was his personal view there should not be any requirement to disclose donations. Yesterday we had Senator PuplickÂ· in the Senate saying that, in the same way as there is a secret vote, he thought it should be secret as to which parties people donate money to. We are suggesting that by introducing a system of free advertising time, we make that free time conditional on disclosing all donations. We are suggesting that the system of free time would be one minute per hour. Of course, we all know that during elections in the past the television networks have been able to make windfall profits by running up to an extra minute per hour of as. It is no loss for the television networks. It is a system that we believe will nip in the bud any threat to our political system that is the result of corruption. The people opposite say it is draconian, totalitarian, socialist, Orwellian. My friends, it is a system that works now in Maggie Thatcher's Britain-she is their pinup girl-and it is a system that has worked for years in Britain. For some reason democracy stills exists in Britain and democracy would be made stronger and less corrupt in Australia if we adopted this report.",133
7,Dr WOOLDRIDGE ,ELECTORAL MATTERS,"Chisholm) (10.27)This report, the fourtJt of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, is the low point of my two years in this place. It is no more than the action of a desperate and tired political party that appears to have run out of ideas except for those that may save it at the polls. In a democracy, respect for the electoral process is essential. This cannot be maintained if the political process is subjected to arbitrary changes based on partisan political interest. This report seeks to do no more than that. Put quite simply, what this report attempts to do is to overcome the fund raising problems of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) by requiring someone else to payÂ·the cost of its television advertising-either the public or the television companies. It is a complete nonsense to suggest that this would lead to any less demand for funds. Simply what would happen isÂ· that the advancing technologies of direct mail and voter targeting would be free to be used, and I will talk about this in a moment. There was never any justification for this report in the first place. I disagree totally with the assertion that the issue of poli-ical advertising and, in particular, the proposal for the extension of political advertising to commercial radio stations, as was put forward by the Labor Party, was evidence of sufficient importance to require the preparation of a report examining these issues in detail. This report was not the result of an investigation held in response to public demand. Indeed, there is very little evidence any public interest at all. Rather, the invesAgain, tigation was simply a response to the expressed political demands of one party. What is being suggested is quite extraordinary: a prohibition on paid political adverelse. tising by parties; provision of free time to political parties on an agreed formula which largely excludes new parties and. small parties; that all political advertisements be of two minutes duration; and that no third party advertising be permitted. Perhaps, not surprisingly, Madam Speaker, this report very strongly follows the Labor Party submission. It is essentially flawed. The report argues that, on the basis of overseas experience, paid political advertising should be banned. It fails to acknowledge that in many countries with which Australia is commonly compared, such as New Zealand, the United States of America or Canada, paid political advertising is allowed. I do not believe that what happens in Finland or Israel is particularly relevant to what we should do in Australia. The report mentions it is the view of the Committee, or to be more precise members of the Committee, that the Australian system of political broadcasting is probably the most laissez faire. Even if that had been demonstrated by serious political study, it might simply lead to the concltision that the Australian democratic process, relatively free of bureaucratic intervention, has much to commend it and has little to learn from the rest of the world. More seriously, the international comparisons that were made simply overlook or fail to explore overseas practices which offer options differerit in character from the demands of the Labor Party submission on which the report was based. For example, the report notes that each of the political parties in West Germany has adopted selfimposed ceilings on the financing of election campaigns due to the cost to their party members. This form of regulation is far superior to the system of enforced controls and bureaucratic regulations proposed by this report. One of the most incredible suggestions in this report is that time should be allocated at no cost to the parties and that the broadcaster should bear the costs. I believe that of political parties should bear their own costs. this is an example of one party attempting to abuse the privileged position of a political party in the legislative process in an attempt to pass on its costs to someone As I shall outline in a moment, the notion that abolishing paid political advertising would in any way change a party's fund raising requirements is, quite simply, ludicrous. Further, I totally reject the proposition that political advertising should be seen as a form of community service announcement. Many different organisations have to advertise to promote their products, their services, or their views. Many could argue that advertising constitutes a form of community service announcement. In this respect, the difference between political parties and other organisations is that other organisations do not have the same access to the legislative process so that they can make laws to pass their costs on to the community. What has been the response of the newspapers? I have been ashamed to have been associated with it. I am saved only by the fact that I disagree with everything in the report and have said so. The Melbourne Age talks of 'this draconian proposal' which happens to 'fetter democratic rights by such a silly move on advertising'. The Sydney Morning Herald states: If there is to be assistance for political parties to advertise on television, there would be an honest and a dishonest way of providing it. Our politicians, having little difficulty with the question of whether their parties should get public assistance, are, typically, proposing to go about it the dishonest way. The Hobart Mercury states: The suggestions on advertising are draconian. They reek of 'Big Brother'. They should be rejected. The Adelaide Advertiser states: The National Government, with its attitude of free advertising for major political parties, is abusing its constitutional powers over broadcasting . . . The Daily Mirror speaks of the Committee's 'naive plan': About the kindest thing to be said about the Joint Standing Committee's plan . . . is that it is outrageously naive. What is the real reason for this, Mr Deputy Speaker? A note that arrived on my desk some time ago gives some idea. It is a note to the honourable member for Makin ( Mr Duncan), who is sitting on a 3.4 per cent majority. If he performs in his electorate like he performs in the House I can understand why he is worried. The note says: Given current developments, there is one issue that should be carefully considered. Clearly, it would be possible for the Government to distribute both computers and a copy of a poll-file type program to all members, both ALP and Opposition. However, given that the Opposition throughout Australia is behind the ALP in developing an electoral office direct mail system, this may give the Opposition an unintended advantage. We have learnt in the last week that members of the House of Representatives are to have unlimited stationery and, at a cost of $4.5m to the Australian taxpayer, a postage allowance that is to be more than tripled. This is simply to allow the ALP to use the advantage it perceives in a direct mail campaign. To finance this, it needs a lot of extra money. The only way it can get it is to try to find someone else to pay its costs-hence this report. A recent article in the Melbourne Age reported that the ALP was looking to raise $2m to do telephone polling in marginal electorates. All the money that would be saved as a result of adopting the recommendations of this report will do is give the ALP money to spend on new forms of advertising in which it believes it will have political advantage over us. Mr Deputy Speaker, this report had no initial justification, other than that the ALP wanted it. It treats the issue superficially; it does not fully explore options; and it makes recommendations that are unsubstantiated. It is difficult to see any reason for this report other than to advantage the ALP at the expense of the Liberal and National parties and to get someone else to pay its election costs. The report is a sham, and it should be treated as such.",133
8,Mr LA VARCH ,ELECTORAL MATTERS,"Fisher) (10.35)-The report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters which we are this morning debating confronts, I suppose, one of the dilemmas of the modern political system, that is, balancing the absolute right of free expression and the ability of all those participants in the political process to have access to the various means of getting their views across. Of course, currently the most important means in our society is through the electronic media. All the studies, both in terms of the information given before the Committee and broader studies, indicate that most people obtain information about the political process, about' political parties, about election campaigns and about the policies being promoted by the parties within an election campaign through the electronic media. The electronic media has far more credibility in terms of the messages that are being promoted than does the print media. Naturally enough, therefore, the political parties have been driven to a position where increasing amounts of money are being spent on advertising through the electronic media. As far as it goes, I suppose that is fair enough. It is an inevitable consequence of the extent and the influence of the electronic media. But that is not the end of the story. We have just heard from the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) a rebuttal of the idea that some sort of control should be placed on the use of the electronic media, but by the same token we heard absolutely nothing from him on the issue raised by public disclosure and the funding of political parties. He is terribly pious and concerned about the idea that controls and limits should be placed on political advertising, but there is not one word from him about the funding of the political parties. In fact, we previously had an interjection that it was the policy of the Liberal Party that there should in fact be no disclosure of private funding to the political parties. Of course, to see what the real motive behind this defence is one need go no further than my own home State of Queensland and to the governing conservative party in that State, which has, of course, the track record of what the conservatives would like there to be-that is, no disclosure provisions, no control whatsoever over funding of political parties. The Committee has, in fact, reported upon and recommended about-and this is what the honourable member for Chisholm conveniently forgets to outline in his particular opinion-the link between disclosure provisions and the advertising argument; that is, there would be no access to advertising on the commercial radio or television networks without full disclosure of funding sources. That would also extend to the States the Commonwealth provisions, as they will be enhanced by this particular report, if adopted, in that, if the States want to have the same benefit through the Commonwealth legislation on broadcasting, they must make themselves open to scrutiny of their funding sources. In Queensland over the last number of years, probably the last 30 years but more particularly from the time Joh Bjelke-Petersen became Premier-and it has been carried on by his successor, Mike Ahern-the funding of the National Party has been no problem: it happens by divine right; people walk into the office with the brown paper bags full of a couple of hundred thousand dollars and they are just slotted onto the desk. Of course, we do not ask questions about that. We are all God-fearing people in Queensland, and of course we support the National Party: that is the right thing to do, is it not! Sensible people do it-those are the words of the former Queensland Premier. Of course, a piece of paper does not make someone honest and a dishonest person cannot be made honest by having these disclosure rules and no accountability-that was the argument being put forward by the Nationals in Queensland and that is the implicit argument being exposed by the honourable member for Chisholm and by the Liberal and National parties, who so vehemently oppose the recommendations in this report. They want the Queensland system to be extended to the Federal level and throughout the rest of Australia. That is the hidden agenda behind the Liberal and National parties' opposition to these proposals. Let us look at the reality. We are saying that the idea of free advertising time is a terrible imposition to impose on the commercial television and radio networks. Both these organisations, of course, are using a public resource-the limited airways and broadcasting frequencies which are given to the particular networks under licence from the Parliament. Is it terribly unreasonable to expect these networks that have control of such a powerful weapon in terms of the dissemination of information and in terms of people getting their information about the political process to give a limited amount of time during the election campaign in order for the message of the democratic process to get across? Is that such a terribly unreasonable proposition? That is all this report is suggesting. Not only is it suggesting that; it is linking access to the public airwaves through the disclosure process. Unless the party is able to disclose all its funding-not only for the election campaign but for its total party operation from whatever source-then there is no right to get access to the airwaves. Is that a problem? Let us look again at what happened for the Queensland National Party in terms of its funding of the Queensland National campaign in that State for the last Federal election. The Nationals disclosed, as they are obliged to under the current legislation, donations amounting to some $400,000. They also disclosed, as they are obliged to, what they spent-$1.9m. They spent $1.9m; they disclosed $400,000. It is interesting to compare that with the Liberal Party and the Labor Party in that State. The amount they have disclosed as receiving and the amount they actually spent is roughly equivalent. It is not the case, as it is with the National Party, that they spent three or four times what they disclosed as receiving. That in itself is hardly a wonder. If we look back to the 1984 Federal election in Queensland, the National Party received a $300,000 donation from a company. That is fair enough. But this company was actually incorporated some eight days prior to the donation being made. The company was formed obviously for the purposes of avoiding the current provisions of funding disclosure and that money was laundered through that company into the National Party's funds. That is already disclosed under current reporting principles, but they do not go far enough because it is easy to get around those particular reporting principles. They relate only to the actual funding of the election campaign. The Committee's recommendation will extend that to all sources of funding for all operations of parties extending far beyond the actual six-week campaign period. That is what the. Liberal Party and the National Party are really opposing. They are opposing that but they are putting their hats on the peg and saying, 'Look, we are restricting the democratic process here. We are making the television stations and the radio stations give up a bit of free time'. It might displease their friends in the big media organisations-the Alan Bonds of the world. Alan Bond does not like the idea of having to lose all this extra revenue he is getting in; so he sets the dogs baying. Of course, they come into the Parliament today and oppose the Committee's recommendation. That is what it is all about. Let us forget all this pious nonsense about restricting the democratic process. That is not the case as it has operated for many years in Great Britain, and that is the system, of course, on which our parliamentary system is based. The British have tackled this problem which Austrl!-is is today tackling. That is the 1I01ution they have come up with. It has not restricted democracy in that nation. It has not opposed or limited the emergence of new political parties. In fact, the recommendations allow for and contemplate the emergence of new political parties. The recommendations are sensible, they are well balanced, they are well thought out, and they are linked to the disclosure provisions, which are a direct fight against corruption. As such the Committee's recommendations should be supported. ,",135
9,Mr COBB ,ELECTORAL MATTERS,"Parkes) (10.46)-The report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters contains a number of the most outrageous recommendations ever presented to the Australian Parliament. I believe that, once the man in the street comes to realise what lies in these proposals and in particular the precious loss of freedom that goes with them, we will see a backlash and revolt against this report and its perpetrators that has the potential to rival the opposition to the ID card in its proportions. The proposals are dynamite. Australia is supposed to be a free country. Implicit in this statement is that we have the right to free speech. However, if the recommendations in this report are implemented in legislation, as the Government and the Australian Democrats members of the Committee intend to do, then free speech as we know it in this country is dead. In fact, most people in Australia would be banned from saying anything in advertisements on the electronic media during an election campaign. The proposal is one of the most extraordinary departures from democracy, from freedom, from the sense of fair play and a fair go that this great country has ever had put before it. Let us imagine it: all paid political advertising on radio and television is to be totally banned during election campaigns. Only Australian Broadcasting Corporation-type advertisements will be allowed to be run as a type of community service. I find that horrific. I cannot express too strongly my own revulsion, my Party's revulsion and, I believe, the coalition's revulsion at this proposal. What is even worse, in a sense, is that the commercial radio and television stations will be forced in this move towards a police state not only to run these ABC-type advertisements but also to pay for them. It is worth reflecting on what this latter requirement means. To me it is nothing more nor less than theft-plain, unadulterated, outright theft. The radio and television stations are to be forced to provide these advertising spots free, in a manner not dissimilar to a military regime demanding a farmer donate a portion of his wheat crop to the state for the so-called common good. Mr Tim Fischer-It is confiscation of assets.",137
10,Mr COBB,ELECTORAL MATTERS,"Yes. The Government is simply saying that our .commercial radio and television stations must provide 17 minutes a day free, with supposedly no economic harm to themselves, for the common good, using the same illogic as marauding armies use to justify taking parts of farmers' crops in analogy I have just given. At the very least one would expect this Government to have suggested that taxpayers' funds be used compensate the television and radio stations for this pillage. If such theft is to take place via the misuse of parliamentary legislative powers, then we should all pay for it. is no logic whatsoever in forcing the full cost onto just the radio and television stations. A specific flow-on from this particularly worries me. This is the situation that will tomorrow. apply in by-elections. It follows, of course, that if all such paid advertising is banned Australia, all electronic advertising of any kind, paid or otherwise, will have to be banned during a by-election. Even this Govdisclosure ernment could not force ABC-type advertiseand ments down the throats of all city viewers a city by-election. But what of a by-election in a country seat? Let us say, for example, that the honourable member for Calare ( Mr Simmons) retired or was run over by a bus and a by-election was held. Surely the people of Orange, the people of Bathurst, the people of Lithgow and the people of entitled to be informed of the policy of the candidates. Surely they are entitled to hear what they have to say in advertisements. ban all advertising of any kind is a total denial of even the most elementary rights the people of these areas to hear the policies of those for whom they have to vote. Telenately vision and radio can and is specifically geted for country areas and country people, and I can tell this Government that country people will fight these recommendations tooth and nail to retain those basic rights. The coalition is also horrified that all parties are to be denied advertising access the electronic media. The National Farmers Federation, for example, will not be allowed to advertise. The automobile associations not be able to advertise their concerns the need for politicians to give a higher priority in allocating road funding and so It is blatantly obvious, of course, why the report. Australian Labor Party (ALP) is blocking these parties' access to the media. It is nothpublic ing more nor less than outright censorship the people's views in an attempt to prevent criticism that would mainly be directed at the Labor Party. This Government will stoop to anything in its desperate attempt to cling the to power, even resorting to communist bloctype denial of free speech censorship tactics. What is to happen to the public funding left to over that will not be spent on radio and television? That is not going to be handed back to the taxpayer; it is going to be channelled into direct mailing in marginal elecThere torates in the Government's desperate attempt to cling to power. If it is radio and television stations today, I can tell the newspaper proprietors that it is going to be them Time is limited in this debate, so I cannot in talk about the other draconian proposals in respect of giving increased power to the Australian Electoral Commission for spot audits, of donations to political parties forcing television to broadcast political in launches. But I say to the Australian people that this report amounts to a denial of free speech, it amounts to theft perpetrated on commercial radio and television station and it amounts to censorship of individuals and organisations such as automobile associations. It is draconian and horrific and should Mudgee are be rejected outright.",137
11,Mrs JAKOBSEN ,ELECTORAL MATTERS,"Cowan) (lO.52)-As people will now be aware if they have been To listening to the debate, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters has had to of grapple with a number of difficult problems. But contrary to many accounts, unfortusome of which have been put forward tartoday and others in newspapers, the Committee's report is not about bureaucratic empire building or reduction of free speech. Neither is it an attempt to inhibit new political parties, or third parties for that matter, third from emerging or succeeding in future elec"" to tions. I was interested to hear the comments of both the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) and the honourable memwill ber for Parkes ( Mr Cobb) which were cyniabout cal in the extreme. Their parties do not believe in disclosure of donations and that is on. the root cause of their objections to this The report is about the desperate need for accountability of Australian political of parties through the complete disclosure of donations received from all sources. We have had a farcical situation in Australia whereby party donations have had to be disclosed under the provisions for public funding. The Australian Electoral Commission has been trying to find out why people. have been giving donations to political parties and what these donations have been used for. But under a secret clause people can be putting donations into the administration side of a political party and nobody need know about it. The Electoral Commissioner has spoken widely on this matter and I believe that his comments should be taken into account, as 'should indeed the comments of Commissioner Fitzgerald on page 137 of the report of his Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct where he says: There is a legitimate entitlement, ordinarily, to privacy in respect of membership of or loyalty to political organisations. It may be that, however, that private right should be subservient to the public interest in proper standards in public administration. I could not agree more. We really need in this country to start to address the possibilities of corruption. We know that it exists. We have to address it properly and ensure that when people in this country elect people and parties to office, they are not also electing some shadowy figures who have supported those parties through political donations that were never disclosed. EmptyHere",138
12,Mrs JAKOBSEN,ELECTORAL MATTERS,"I will not make any references. The honourable member can draw his own conclusions. I am quite happy for people to draw their own conclusions. The report is also about the need to limit television and radio advertising during the few weeks immediately preceding an election-that is, after the issue of the writs. I draw that to people's attention. We are not saying that no third party, such as road interests, tobacco interests or gold tax interests, can put an advertisement on the television. We are saying that they cannot advertise after the writs are issued because they are not political parties. I think it is important that we make that distinction. In our society people are informed about the aims, objectives, philosophy and policies of political parties via a number of media. They come from public comment and advertising in newspapers and pamphlets, radio and television. The latter forms of communication, as the honourabie member for Dobell ( Mr Lee) pointed out in his contribution, are more intrusive and much more effective. They are also in the advertising sense much more expensive, particularly television. This form of communication at elections is now incurring a great deal of resources, and I do not just mean the Labor Party's resources. It is a nonsense to suggest, as the member for Chisholm did, that .the Labor Party is incapable of raising sufficient funds to pay its election campaign. We actually raise funds very efficiently and probably better than the Liberal Party does. We also put on better political advertising. But that is not what we are getting at here; we are saying that parties have to be accountable for the donations they receive and, ifÂ· they are to be accountable for donations, there will be circumstances when donors will not contribute because they do not want their donations to be known and, therefore, there will be a reduction in the moneys coming to all political parties. So free advertising on all channels of television is the best way for us to go. ' Limiting advertising on television will help the electorate because nobody in this chamber really pretends, I am sure, that political advertising informs the electorate a great deal. It is really a way of getting our message across to the electors, but they do not always make up their minds on the basis of electoral television as. I believe that the electorate is well informed by other means but that the capacity for television to influence the electorate in a hasty way needs to be avoided as much as possible. The cost of'television advertising and the propensity for political parties in modern day Australia to use it without compromise must be addressed.",139

16,Mr WEBSTER ,ABORTION FUNDING ABOLITION,"Macquarie) (10.57)One of the responsibilities of this Parliament, in facto its first responsibility, is the protecannually. tion of the life and rights of the citizens of Australia. It is usually accepted on both sides that there is a particular obligation upon us to safeguard the life and rights of those in our community too wea- to protect themselves. For many years now, for both ethical and political reasons, members of parliament and senators have been asked to make their own judgment as to what rights are held by unborn individuals, that is, individuals in the antenatal stage of their human development. We have been obliged to assess what rights exist and to what extent we will protect and affirm those rights. Notwithstanding our direct involvement in the funding of abortion, there has been over the last few years a conspiracy of silence in the Parliament over the greatest threat to the rights of the unborn, and that is abortion. I believe it is time we ended that silence and made our position on the question of the rights of the unborn, abortion and our responsibilities clear to ourselves and to the electorate. I am introducing today the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill 1989. I believe, and here I echo the Senate Select Committee on Human Embryo Experimentation, that from conception what we call an embryo and then a foetus is a human life with a status and set of rights which command respect. I believe that scientific and metaphysical logic suggests that an individual human's antenatal and postnatal development constitutes a single process of becoming what she or he already is-a human being. I am consequently obliged, I believe, to protect the basic right of unborn human beings to life. I therefore submit this Bill for the consideration of the Parliament. The Commonwealth's main involvement with abortion is through Medicare subsidisation of abortion procedures. Th- Bill therefore addresses Medicare subsidisation of abortion and seeks to allow Medicare funding only for abortions performed to avert the death of a mother or in cases where the procedure was for a different purpose and the doctor was unaware an abortion would occur. The Bill also requires doctors to certify that the reason for an abortion was to avert the death of the mother. Honourable senators may not be aware that around 80,000 abortions are performed in Australia That is, for every three live births there is one aborted life. Since 1975 approximately 750,000 abortions have been subsidised by Medicare with the current subsidy to the abortion industry running at just over $8m per annum. That is the background to this Bill. I have written to all' honourable members asking for their consideration of the Bill and the basic issues that it addresses. I intend, notwithstanding the normal practice of this House of not allowing private members' Bills, especially controversial ones, to reach a final vote, to ensure that this Bill is voted on. We do not have the right as members of parliament to ignore this issue or to refuse to make out position on the matter clear to the electorate. I challenge the House and the Government to allow this Bill time for debate and resolution. A number of detailed arguments, misgivings and misperceptions are widespread about the Bill. I intend to deal with these in my second reading speech and in subsequent debate. In the meantime, given time restrictions, I commend the Bill to the House and challenge honourable members to come to grips with this important ethical and urgent political issue. I seek leave to table the explanatory memorandum. Leave granted. Bill read a first time.",140

18,Mr REITH ,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"Flinders) (11.02)-Of all the issues confronting our nation I do not think there is any doubt that our economy is crying out for reform in a number of key areas. Of all the areas on that long list we nominate, by the introduction of the Industrial Rehitions (Directions to Stop Industrial Action) Amendment Bill today, industrial relations as one area where we could do things a lot better and a lot more efficiently than we are now. We have in this country a very poor industrial relations record. We have, as I think everybody in this chamber and the people in the gallery know, too many strikes, too many disputes, in this country. The Opposition says that it is time that we as a parliament came to grips with this issue and took some firm action, and that is why we introduced the Bill. We have a very simple straightforward idea that we believe would really make a difference. Looking at the bottom line, since the Hawke Government has been in office this country's debt has moved from about $23 billion to $103 billion. That is why we have to sell off the family farm and the family silver. This week, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the air pilots are holding the country to ransom. What an indictment it is on the management of this economy when we are screaming out for dollars from overseas to try to do something about our debt that the reputation of our tourist industry is jeopardised in the way that it is. Of course, one of the reasons that we have so many strikes is that we have a one-sided system. If one obtains a direction from a tribunal and one is representing a union, what happens? The members just thumb their noses at it. I am from Victoria. If Melbourne and Collingwood are having a game of footy on a Saturday afternoon in Melbourne the umpire may give a free kick to Collingwood. In the industrial relations area the Melbourne team would stop, they would gather in the middle of the ground and they would probably have a vote to see whether they would go along with the umpire's decision; That is what happens every day of the week. We read about it in the newspapers. We see today that unions have had a stop work meeting to decide whether they will go along with the umpire's decision. This is just not good enough. It is no way to run a system. We do not want a one-sided system; we want a fair system. The only way to have that is to have a system in which if people refuse to abide by the decisions of the umpire there will be certain penalties as a result. I think most fair-minded Australians would agree with that. We say that if the umpire-an industrial relations tribunalsays, 'You shall go back to work', that ought to be obliged and there ought to be an injunction procedure. That is what this Bill allows for; it allows for. the industrial tribunal to issue an injunction. If the union concerned wanted to act outside of and in direct contradiction to that industrial tribunal's decision it would be subject to two things: firstly, heavy fines for the union, thus allowing the courts, as a result of contempt of court through the injunction procedure, to go after the assets of the particular union and, secondly, for the public at large, for third parties, for people who suffer as a result of unreasonable trade union action, there ought to be a means by which they can obtain damages. So if some union acting against-and we stress acting against-an industrial relations tribunal's decision, the umpire's decision, causes a person to suffer damages that person ought to be able to go to the courts and have that union recompense him for the damages that it has caused. It is a simple idea, as I think everybody here would agree. In fact, the. Government itself put up a proposition like this a couple of years ago and before you could say 'Jack Robinson' the ACTU had told it to withdraw the proposal. Even members of the Government, as that example illustrates, have in fact supported this idea and, as I say, most fair minded Australians-people in business, people in unions, hundreds and thousands of unionists-unquestionably would support this. This is a simple, straightforward idea, in fact one of hundreds of good simple ideas that the Opposition is putting forward to the Parliament, which we believe ought to be enacted and which would provide one avenue for us to improve industrial relations greatly in this country.",140

21,Mr SMITH ,NATIONAL SPACE PROGRAM,"Bass) (11.08)-I move: That this House: (1) recognises the need for Australia to develop urgently a national space program; (2) acknowledges the growing contribution of industries to the nation's economy; and (3) recognises the catalytic role of Government providing a suitable environment for spacerelated industries to work in. This motion has been on the Notice Paper for some time and it arises out of my deep interest in matters relating to space policy in this country during the period when I was preparing the science policy for the Opposition parties. That science policy has now been completed. At the launch of that policy the Age newspaper stated quite correctly that the coalition would give science a high priority. One of the many coalition science policy initiatives concerned space policy. We said in that policy that space aCtivities are state of the art technologies that have profound technological sovereignty and economic implications. We recognise that the benefits of space activities, .particularly in a continent of vast size with a small dispersed population, include significant advances in search and rescue communications, remote sensing and navigation. We appreciate that the applications of space technology are almost limitless and the spin-offs---:and that is what is important in space technology-in the form of advanced technologies and services are potentially enormous. It is indeed an activity ripe for the development of high technology export-oriented industries. At that time. I warned that Australia is already a significant importer of space technology and services and that in years to come the burden of such imports will be enormous. I remember discussions with one of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) scientists who alerted me to the massive imports that would be required to meet our future communication needs. We realise that we are in a position to take a more prominent role in the Pacific region and our space industry should be encouraged to achieve significant import replacement, and also seek exports, and enter into joint space ventures with other countries. I saw then a need to coordinate and supervise all space activitiys and facilities as a matter of urgency. Thus we propose that there be a more broadly based coordinating body taking into account the activities of COSSA-the CSIRO Office of space Space Science and Applications-the Australian Space Board, and other space-related in activities and participants. I envisage that the existing Space Board and its secretariat, the Australian Space Office, would be part of the new coordinating arrangements that need to be established. Also at that time comments were made in the policy, and by myself publicly, that we saw the proposed .Cape York spaceport as a development of vital significance to Australia's space industries and that .there was a potential role for Australia to playas a space centre in the Pacific region. Before diverting to the Cape York issue, I point out that this is the first time in the five-year period I have been a member of this House that we have had a debate on broad space policy and Australia's future role. I find it quite significant that we have neglected to address those issues in the national chamber. The Cape York spaceport proposal has been studied in depth by two separate organisations. The first is the Australian Spaceport Group, which is made up of a consortium of Aussat Pty Ltd, Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, Comalco and an American firm called Martin Marinetta. It decided recently that a commercial spaceport would not be viable in the short-term and it would not proceed further with the possibility of setting up at Cape York. However, the rival proposal being put forward by the Cape York Space Agency, which is underpinned by a company of a property developer called Essington, has indicated that it will proceed in a place called Temple Bay in Cape York. It intends to approach government, both at State and Federal levels, over the next 18 months. It will be important for whichever party is in government in this country to make some determination as to what approach government might take to that future development. For my own part, I hope that government attitudes will be positive towards the proposals. There will need to be environmental studies. The traditional landowners-the Aboriginals-will need to be consulted. Once all those things are undertaken, given the commercial viability which I hope would there, I think that it could present an excithas ing challenge for Australia as we move into the next century. If we look at the Government's record space, we find that while there has been plenty of rhetoric, unfortunately the record is poor. In 1986 the Madigan committee was called on by government to investigate potential in the space industries. It said in its findings that government ought immediately to spend $100m over five years to help develop an Australian space industry. though the Government accepted the committee's recommendations, funding Against for the program has not exceeded $6m a ance year, and funding for this financial year has of been cut to $4.4m. Indeed, in the Sydney Morning Herald of 16 August, the day after the Budget, a senior space adviser in this country, Mr Stan Schaetzel, formerly of De Havilland, described the Space Board as potent. He said that it has spent about $800,000 this year-that is, the last financial year-on preparing a comprehensive space program but nothing had come out of it. The space program saga is one all too familtems iar to those in this House. Funding has sawed between $3m and $5m during the first five years of its now-doubtful life. Those in the Public Service who work dedicatedly in these areas have no clear goals to work wards as we in the political system cannot make up our minds whether or not we want to be part of them. In my view, at a time when Australia relying ever more heavily on information from space-based systems such as satellites for vital meteorological, exploration, resignificant source assessment and environmental data, the Government has shown an outrageous lack of commitment to develop a local space industry and a total lack of vision which will relegate Australia to the status of a third rate outpost in the twenty-first century-that is, if we are not already pushed down path more quickly by its economic policies. It may, of course, already be too late to develop Australia's comparative advantages in the field of space science and technologies. The Hawke Government has dithered over implementing the Madigan report entitled A Space Policy for Australia. It has tried to be do it on the cheap. This myopic approach made industry reluctant to risk entry into the international space industry. The Hawke Government's grocer-shop mentality into research has been well demonstrated during its years in power. Research is not a commodity which can be taken from the shelf as it is needed. Ideas are not commodities; they must be nurtured in an environthe ment of substantial research activity. In April this year Associate Professor John Simmons, who is Chairman of the Australian AlInstitute of Engineers National Committee most of on Space Engineering, said:Â· this clear trend of increasing national relion space systems, two decades of virtual neglect space activity is rapidly closing off our options. He warned that if the Government did not begin long-term planning for a space industry and to establish an independent statutory space authority and national space projects, imAustralia could become wholly dependent on other nations' space projects. He pointed out that Australia was locked into spending large amounts of money on space related activities to maintain its communications satellite sysand access to vital remote sensing data. seeMost of that hardware will be imported. He predicted that by 1995 Australia's annual expenditure on space services would be tobetween $370m and $500m-most of which would be spent overseas unless Australian industry received the support of a strong government space program. No country can develop a space industry without targeted is government assistance to overcome the many barriers to new entrants into the field. It must be recorded that all nations with a or emerging capability in launches or . satellite. hardware such as the United States of America, Russia, France, Canada, China, Japan and, significantly in our immediate region, India and even Pakistan and Korea, have not been required to go it alone. These countries not only save their own curthat rency; those such as France and Canada eventually make a net profit on their country's investment in the space business. In all cases the establishment of a credible domestic industry through government funded research and development projects has preceded the acquisition of export orders. Dr Bruce Middleton, the Executive Director of the Australian Space Office, in April this year told a national science forum in Canberra: We need . . . to note that there are no level playing fields in the space business-it is a potent mix of big money and international. politics . . . unless we consciously seek our own role it certainly will not be tilted our way. What we are seeing in Australia is that there are three windows of opportunity for local industry: remote sensing, in which we lead the world, communications and launch services. Those opportunities are beginning to swing away from us and the door is beginning to shut. It will be a 'tragedy for this nation and for future generations if we have to pay for this Government's failed vision. We will not be part of that. I would like to refer to Australia's comparative. advantages in the space area. We ought to have our own space industry; it is not pie in the sky stuff. We have real comparative advantages over other countries that we ought to be exploring and nurturing. These comparative advantages are natural and technological. For example, in astronomy we have good optical and radio telescopes to observe the southern skies. In the physics of the interactions between the earth and the sun many phenomena in the upper atmosphere-the ionosphere for exampleare distinctive because of the great tilt of the south pole of the earth's magnetic field towards Australia from the geographic south p(jle. In remote sensing, Australia, including its Antarctic and island territories, has many qualities-size, position, climate and ocean environment-that make the technology of remote sensing particularly beneficial. We have skilled and inventive people whose work places them in the league of the world leaders in thisÂ· particular field. The most recent example; of course, is Dr Ken MCCracken, who formerly headed up COSSA and who recently retired. Our national research capability in remote sensing is the most developed, certainly in the southern hemisphere, and our scientists have demonstrated their world-class research abilities in a whole range of areas. These skills and the country's location mean that Australia can take advantage of the rapidly developing international remote sensing industry. It is an industry worth many billions of dollars. This potential, however, is almost entirely dependent upon the will to exploit. There is no better example of that than the early aviation industry in Australia. We created some of the earliest airlines in the world. We pioneered the air carriage of cargo. We developed new applications for aircraft such as the Flying Doctor Service. We used air transport to overcome the tyranny of distance. We used aircraft to open up the outback. Another example is Woomera. Twenty years ago, Australia was able, despite its limited resources, to design, manufacture, integrate, test and launch a competent scientific spacecraft. A space science program could again enrich and inspire the nation. What aircraft helped us to do in the 1920s and 1930s-that is, to weld this huge continent into one nation-space can do for us in the last decade of this century. We have the educational and industrial infrastructure to launch our science and industry into space. The only thing needed is the political and the national will. We need a vision of the future and a realistic appreciation of our capabilities. I think we have our heads in the sand. We ,could provide commercial services in communications, 'remote sensing and meteorology. We could have one of the world's main spaceports for the twenty-first century. The Japanese would be very keen to be involved in a future spaceport. Indeed, the Russians have indicated to the Cape York Space Agency that they are likely to join, and have already 'offered the relevant launch vehicles for consideration by that agency. A whole range of other issues needs to be considered in that context. Other countries are looking at Australia to provide a lead, yet we do not seem to be aware of it in this place. The costs of not having an Australian space program can be put into an argument, I suppose-the opportunity lost cost argument. If we are not involved, how much will it cost us? In all advanced industrialised nations, space science drives technology development. The links between space science, technology and commerce are clear. This is demonstrated, as I have already mentioned, by the hundreds of millions of dollars Australia adds to its foreign debt by purchasing existing ,space technology, particularly communications satellites, from those countries which have pursued space programs. The longer Australia postpones entry into space, the more costly it will be to the nation-notÂ· just in terms of technology for space but also in terms of education, mining, agriculture and environmental protection-simply to maintain a relatively prosperous lifestyle. The lack of continuity in Australian space research also has implications for Australia's human resources. Many of our most experienced researchers, when they retire in the next decade, will leave a huge gap to fill. Doubts about the future of our space programs affect the young, many of whom have gone and will go overseas to contribute. to other nation's space activities. We have allowed our educational base to run down since the Woomera heyday. We have also allowed the spirit of adventure, which accompanied the early days of aviation in Australia, to evaporate. Space activities have profound sovereignty implications. How many people stop to think that our sovereignty ends at some 100 kilometres above our heads, less than half the distance between Canberra and Sydney? Other countries can orbit in space observation or eavesdrop satellites, from which little can be hidden. The economic costs of not having an Australian program are estimated to be around $400m to $500m. The social and strategic costs are immeasurable. There are many benefits of an Australian space program. Space can help us to delineate, exploit and manage our natural resources, to understand and predict our weather, to improve our communications and to oversee the seas around us. How successful, for instance, would our search and rescue efforts be without the use of satellite transponders working in conjunction with emergency locator transmitters on boats and aircraft? There are many issues such as that which we need to consider. We already have in this country the Australian Centre for Remote Sensing, to allow users such as mineral exploration companies to access data from the newest remote sensing satellites. So space industries do have a role. With the transfer of the European rocket launching activities from Australia in the 1970s, space industries have rapidly declined. They are now limited to remote sensing, tracking, meteorology and communication through Intelsat, Inmarsal and Aussat, mainly in built-to-print assembly but with no in"" volvement in launches. Despite the purchase of the domestic satellite system, Aussat, the whole space industry has many impediments to further participation in the world scene. These impediments include limited and fragmented research and the need to get better qualifications and to retain those human resources which I referred to. There are limited local design skills, limited basic facilities and a lack of expertise and knowledge of wider market opportunities. There is a need to develop an Australian industry and scientific community able to participate in world space science. We need a strategy which will position industry to participate in new high technology fields as they develop. The present task is to identify and fill niches in the world space industry where we have .the expertise, and so enhance our reputation. The international aspects of space would be apparent to all. Considerable benefits arise from Australia's participation in these programs. I have already referred to the skill inventiveness of 'Australians working in space research and one can find Australians in space research in many places around the globe. Scientists, and in particular those scientists engaged in space research, form part of this international community where interaction enables our scientists to siphon technology from more advanced countries to Australia. Now, and in the future, Australians scientists will have many opportunities to participate in bilateral or multilateral space research which will allow Australia to reap the benefit of the new technologies used in space science projects, technology which is at the forefront of development. We cannot afford to lose such opportunities. We ought not settle for second best. The significant space program would gain for Australia access to the latest technology overseas and, by space qualifying our key technologies, we would demonstrate to the world our manufacturing and commercial competence. We need to link Australia to high profile international space projects and perhaps we could include here those projects related to greenhouse and ozone. Our expertise in remote sensing, for example, is already bringing inquiries for a specialised high speed computer developed in Australia for processing radar images. An exciting prospect is the proposed $30m gravity telescope, the world's biggest, for detecting black holes. Although a joint project of physicists at the University of Western Australia and the Australian National University, they would collaborate closely with teams of scientists from the United States of America, Europe and Japan who have expressed interest in such collaboration. Building the telescope would certainly put Australia into the world league of big science. Spin-offs would include new lasers for medicine and higher precision optics and vacuum technology. What about the Government's role, and this is the crux of the issue, I suspect? Despite the call on the Government seriously to engage in a long term national space program, no-one is suggesting that the Government should do it all; it does not happen in other countries and it ought not to happen here. But the Government's role is a catalytic one and that is the point that I make in my motion. The Government should provide a suitable environment for industry to work in. It should be cognisant of the needs of space industries in their infancy, but mately it is up to industry to get out into the marketplace and sell its not inconsiderable talents. Again, I come back to the point that space industry and the technologies involved have shown in other countries, as they have developed their space industriesand some have done so more recently, particularly India and Canada-that industry cannot be expected to do it all on its own. We need to be a little more imaginative in our policy settings and a little more consistent in what level of support we decide to give. To see, as we have, this Government over the last little while move its space projects up and down in terms of funding, to create confusion, to not consolidate all the resources that we do have available, limited though they are, has meant that people have become dispirited and that many have left and gone elsewhere. Indeed, when I went with the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, ( Mr Barry Jones) to the opening of the major telescope in northern New South Wales I met an Australian physicist who had been working in the American space program for some years. He could not understand why it was that we as a nation, irrespective of what views one might have about politics, chose not to further our opportunities to get behind the industry that is here already and give it the opportunity to become involved. If one adds up what it is going to cost us as a nation in terms of capital outflow to acquire the necessary communication technology, one can see that a little money spent now will save millions and perhaps billions into the future. I am making the point that we need to be encouraging our space industries and not leaving them to wither on the vine because, in my view, in the future we will be all the poorer if we do that.",142
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,NATIONAL SPACE PROGRAM,Mr Leo MCLeay)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Is the motion seconded? Mr Downer-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,146
23,Mr CHYNOWETH ,NATIONAL SPACE PROGRAM,"Dunkley) (11.28)It is very pleasing for me to speak on something that is very dear to my heart. Some years ago I spoke about exactly the types of ultimatters that have been raised in the motion now before the House and I am very pleased that the honourable member for Bass ( Mr Smith) has brought it up. I do not think he seconded my motion but he agreed with what I had to say about the greenhouse effect. Once again, I agree with him. We have a lot in common, especially in the science and technology area. Australia must do something in this area and it must do it well. In 1985 the Madigan report entitled A Space Policy for Australia was presented to the Parliament. There are a couple of lines in the foreword by Sir Russel Madigan which I would like to read: The commitment to a space programme must be a government decision, not a commercial one. It is a decision to 'be in it', or be left behind-to maintain an optimum degree of self-determination or become dependent on others. However, the decision having been made, on behalf of all Australians, to become part of the world's inevitable progression into the space age, Australian industry will have the incentive to channel its resources into the development of a whole new field of profitable enterprise and employment . . . will we recognise and take advantage of the new opportunities which the space age offers? It could be argued from our post-war performance that the answers are in the negative. But the 'lucky country' syndrome, which is responsible for much of our economic indifference, is undergoing change. The time may soon come, as we see our relative standards of living declining within the region, when Australians will be taking stock of their situation and asking themselves what they have to do to put it right. The excitement of implementing the recommendations in this report may provide some of the inspiration they need. Many of these recommendations have not been taken up, I am sorry to say. I would like to see the Government do a lot more in relation to space. However, having spoken to Senator Button's office this morning-and I will speak about that later on-I am quite certain that we will see a lot more action in this area very soon, which I believe is about time. We can always ask: What is a space program? These points were, made in a recent space science discussion paper presented to a Melbourne meeting by Professor Keith Cole: Australia occupies a very important position in the Southern Hemisphere. Science of today generates tomorrow's technologywhich is quite correct. He continues: Are all the nations that have a space program wrong? The United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, India, Japan-are they all wrong? To continue: Why is Australia the odd one out? Involvement in space projects yields access to the latest technologies. I can assure honourable members that it does. To continue: A space program will develop an international outlook in high technology industries. A space program will develop stronger positive links between universities, CSIRO, industry and government departments. A space program will present attractive, exciting training for young scientists and engineers in the technologies of the 21st century. It also will bring about, which he did not state, a national pride which is most needed sometimes. Australia was one of the top three in space exploration in the early 1960s and 1970s and we have dropped behind. It is about time we got back into it, and this sort of project will do that. The Australian Space Office in 1988 had funding of only about $3.05m, down from $5.1m a year earlier. We cannot allow that sort of thing to continue. We must put money into our space agencies. We have the opportunity and the capability to make a very significant impact on the international space industry. We can do that here. We are not ' a country that has fixed thoughts. We have some extremely inventive scientists and we have a great deal of technology and knowledge sitting there which we must tap. Mention was made of Dr Bruce Middleton. He is the Executive Director of the Australian Space Office. In May of this year Dr Middleton suggested that the funding needed to develop such an agency and an Australian space program should be based on the recommendations made in 1985 by a committee headed by Sir Russel Madigan. That report has been out and around for four years. In that report Madigan proposed that expenditure of over $100m be spread , over a five-year period. I believe that We should implement the recommendations of that report. The Government broadly endorsed the Madigan report. It created the Space Board, which in turn established the Space Office with a budget of round about $3m to $6m to investigate the feasibilities of Madigan's proposals. That is still going on right at this very time. Canada has recently established its own national space agency. Canada is a nation of about the same size of Australia, with the same sort of population and the same sort of economic mix. If Canada can do it, why can we not do it? I quote from the April edition of COSSA Space Industry News: The formation of a new Canadian Space Agency, based in the greater Montreal area, was announced on 1 March by the Minister for Regional Industrial Expansion, Mr Harvie Andre. Mr Andre said that the Agency would be a focal point for the development of key technologies with broad application to Canadian industry that would carry the country into the 21st century. It is about time we moved in that area, too. The article continues: The government announcement said that Canadians in all regions would benefit from the development and use of space technology in a range of fields impinging on the national economy. Specifically mentioned were communications, weather services, search and rescue, resource management, and navigation, with the space industry providing jobs, export earnings, and industrial fits throughout the country. The Agency will have a staffing base of 300 person-years and will manage Canada's civilian space program, directing space expenditures of almost Can$3 billion to the end of the century. They have jumped into it in a big way over in Canada. I am quite certain that they have not done it just to put their money into something that will lose a lot of money. Obviously, they expect to get some sort of return. It is time for Australia to establish a space authority. In 1967, Australia became only the third country to launch its own satellite. It was launched from our territory. Admittedly it was on a US-made rocket. It was a previous Liberal government, the Sir Robert Menzies Government, that decided that space was not really the business of a small country like Australia. That is a pity. We had that advantage back in the 1960s and 1970s. We should have improved on it. We could have been a leader in that area at this very time if the money had gone into space programs. I would like to mention the Cape York spaceport, probably the only good thing that the former Premier of Queensland, Sir Johannes Bjelke-Petersen, has ever suggested. I do not know how he dreamt it up. Perhaps someone put it to him and in a brief moment of saneness he actually said that it was a good idea. Mr Downer-They even said he was mad at the time.",146
24,Mr CHYNOWETH,NATIONAL SPACE PROGRAM,"Yes, they did. However, to me it is a very good idea. Its proximity to the equator makes launching easier. With proper environmental studies and controls I am quite certain that we could build such an establishment in the area. There is a lot of land there. In the future I can see a huge industry up there, with people living on the coast around Cairns and the surrounding area, travelling to work along the coast to this twenty-first century, high-tech area, a spaceport at Cape York. It would be quite spectacular. Space is something that I have always been interested in. Sometimes I wish I had been born a bit later in this world and thus have the opportunity to go into space. I have actually experienced it a little, one could say, beneon this earth by going down to Antarctica. Going down there one experiences, I imagine, the same sorts of feelings as one would experience in space-quietness and peacefulness, with no people around. While I am talking about Antarctica, I must mention that satellite information is transmitted to the base down there but it comes from American satellites, Russian satellites, and Japanese satellites, not from an Australian satellite. There is one satellite for telecommunications down there, but most of the information and data on weather pattern conditions and satellite photographs of the Antarctic continent come from overseas satellites, which is not right. That is the sort of area we could be involved in. The Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) satellite down there-I experienced this last summer when I was there-was a bit of a problem for the expeditioners. They had to send the satellite signal to Sydney and then back to the Antarctic Division in Kingston, Tasmania, by landline. On the way back it lost some of the voice production and one could not quite understand the replies one was getting back from Australia through the satellite. OTC was working on it, and I hope it fixes that problem for the people who have to live in Antarctica and quite often want to ring home to communicate with their loved ones in Australia. The Federal Government and the Queensland Government, I am quite certain, will back the plan for the spaceport at Cape York. A proposal has been put forward, as was mentioned before, by Essington Ltd to build it. I think it is in, partnership with a big United States company. There has also been some interest in buying a Zenit rocket frolll the USSR. It would be quite an interesting mix. We would have American companies, Australian companies and USSR rockets, and on board would be Australian satellites, Japanese satellites or satellites from somewhere else in the world. It certainly is an area where a huge expansion could take place. Environmental concerns have been raised about the Cape York spaceport. They are quite valid. An area called Temple Bay has been suggested as the site. It would have to be looked at closely before this project could get the go-ahead but I am quite certain that, with the amount of land and the lack of people in that area, we could build quite successfully a fairly large spaceport which would service Australia and the rest of the world. Two former Defence Force propulsion engineers who have left the Defence Science and Technology Organisation in South Australia have started to think about building their own rocket. They have not just gone off with an airy fairy idea that they could do it; they have put a lot of thought into it and have got a very large engineering company called Transfield involved in it. Transfield Engineering Co., one of the largest engineering companies in Australia, is looking very seriously at this proposal. So we could actually see the rockets, or parts of the rockets, being made here in Australia. That would be a great fillip for our engineering industry. Some great engineering projects in this country have been announced recently because of the Government's changes in defence purchasing policies, especially in relation to the ANZAC frigate ships which will be built in Victoria. I am very pleased to say that that will make a big difference to the Victorian economy. The Space Office over the last 12 months has been gathering information and preparing a submission to go to the Government. I spoke to Senator Button's office this morning and I am pleased to say that he will be putting a submission to Cabinet in the next few months. The benefits to our whole nation of being involved in space exploration will be immense and we must act very swiftly to be participants. I see many young faces in the gallery. Who knows-one day they may be in space and it will all have come out of this little speech here today. I sincerely hope so. I think that space is for those people. I just hope that I can lay a bit of a stepping stone.",148
25,Mr DOWNER ,NATIONAL SPACE PROGRAM,"Mayo) (11.44)-1 do not know how the young people in the gallery would feel about the suggestion of the honourable member for Dunkley ( Mr Chynoweth) that they may at some stage be sent into space. The prospect for them of ending up on the moon, Mars or somewhere like that"" one day must be a fairly daunting one. It is something that I have never wanted to do. But for them, of course, the future of this country will involve space and space industries. What the Parliament discusses today and what governments do today in terms of advancing the technology of this nation is going to be fundamentally important to the young people in the gallery and to the very real future of this country. What we are discussing today is not some airy-fairy prospect, as the pubic may see it, of Australians landing on the moon, having their own National Aeronautics and space administration space project of that dramatic kind, or sending space vehicles-MONICA",149
26,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,NATIONAL SPACE PROGRAM,Mr Blanchard)-Order! The time allotted for the debate has now expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. The honourable member for Mayo will have leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. NA NA,149
27,Mr NEHL ,PACIFIC,"Cowper) (11.45)-I move: That this House acknowledges the importance and. significance of South East Asia and the Pacific to Australia's future. We in this country are affected by South East Asia and the Pacific in very many ways-in terms of economic and trade relations, our strategic and defence situation and our great political significance. Of course, we need to have a great deal mOre emphasis on cultural exchanges and education. There is a diversity of social values, cultures and political ideologies am;i vastly differing levels of economic development within these regions. Perhaps it would be appropriate to define what we mean by them. South East Asia comprises 10 states. There are six Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) members-Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Within the South East Asia region there are three Indo-China states-Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, plus Burma sitting on the outside. Just to emphasise the political importance of South East Asia, we are talking about 413 million people, which is a great many indeed. There are 300 million people in the ASEAN countries, 74 million in Indo-China and another 39 million people in Burma. Those 413 million people are of great significance to Australia. The Pacific region is made up of Micronesia, Polynesia and Melanesia. There are 14 Pacific Forum countries which include Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Tonga, the Solomon Islands, Nauru, Vanuatu and Western Samoa, plus 10 territories such as New Caledonia and American Samoa. Contrasting with the 413 million people living in South East Asia, there are about five million people in the South Pacific. If one looks at the history of South East Asia and its relations with Australia, there have been quite a number of limits and constraints on how Australian influence could be exercised. We do not really carry a great deal of political or economic weight in terms of South East Asia because we are small in population. We are wealthy, which ,is more than can be said of most of the South East Asian states. We are not Asian; we are basically white. We are Western oriented. We are territorially large but that territory of ours is almost empty. We are separated from mainland Asia geographically and also psychologically. We have to realise this and accept it. At the very best we have been an associate member of the ASEAN group of states and we are capable of making a contribution. We must continue to do that and expand it. Australia and South East Asian countries must work together much more closely in the future. I must say I welcome a public inquiry referred to the Joint Parliabetween mentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade by the Senate which calls on the Joint Committee for urgent investigation and report on the concept of Asia-Pacific regional economic cooperation and its application in a way that would best serve the interests of Australia and the region. That a step forward and I look forward to participating in thilt public inquiry. There have been dramatic economic performances in South East Asia since the 1960s and I do not really believe that we in Australia quite appreciate just what has been happening. But we should realise that since the 1960s the economies of the South East Asian countries have grown with an average real rate of 6 per cent a year. That compares with a growth rate of 3 per cent a year for the European Economic Community and the United States of America. So it is more than double the growth of Europe and the United States. The share of gross world product produced in South East Asia has tripled in that period since the 1960s, from 6 per cent to 20 per cent. Its share of manufactured goods is up from 8 per cent to 18 per cent and its imports have grown in - he same period from 12 per cent to 17 per cent. There has been dynamic growth in the region over the last 20 years. Frankly, we should be well and truly aware that over 50 per cent of total Australian exports are now directed to Asia which, in turn, supplies 40 per cent of our imports. When I started looking at the information available on this I was quite startled to find that between 1982 and 1987 while Australia's global investment increased from $16.5 billion to $60.2 billion-that is, investment by Australian companies around the world-our investment in Japan increased from $365m to $3.35 billion. I must confess that I found that quite surprising and remarkable. While there is concern in Australia about Japanese investment in Australia, it should be balanced by the fact that currently we have $3.35 billion invested in Japan and in mid-1987 Japanese investment in Australia was $3.1 billion, which is less than we have invested in Japan. Again emphasising that perhaps we have placed too much emphasis on the North Asian area, our investment in Hong Kong, went from $199m to $2.2 billion 1982 and 1987. Regrettably, in the same period our investment in ASEAN countries declined by about 50 per cent from $2.2 billion to $1.4 billion. That is not good enough. I emphasise that that $1.4 billion of investment in ASEAN countries is barely greater than the amount we have invested in is the Netherlands, which is $1.06 billion. To put it in perspective, private enterprise has to invest further in the ASEAN and South East Asian states. Of course, that could be a little more difficult-if not very difficultoutside the ASEAN states because of the socialist and communist governments in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Nonetheless, if we isolate it to the ASEAN states there has be a great deal more investment by Austrato lian industry. There are barriers to that and they include language, cultural differences and lack of established contacts. But we need increased business awareness so that we can get more investment in South East Asia. It is interestthe ing that while our investment in ASEAN countries is $1.4 billion, their investment in Australia is $8.1 billion. So again that ance of investment is very much going against Australia. I repeat that while Australia vested $69 billion overseas last year, only billion was invested in ASEAN countries. It is also significant that the ASEAN states have a marvellous record of growth with export-led and investment-led strategies. Thailand's exports are up by 30 per cent. growth rate is over 9 per cent and it is the major economic success story of the region. In 1988 Singapore's growth was over 11 per cent. In 1987 Indonesia's growth was 3.6 per cent, although oil prices turned that down little bit. In 1988 Malaysia's growth was 8 per cent, up from 4.5 per cent in 1987. In 1988 the growth rate in the Philippines 6 per cent. It is quite obvious that ASEAN states are moving rapidly. They are part of Australia's future and we have to do far more to maintain and increase our volvement with them. As I have said, the ASEAN nations are vital trading partners for Australia, not now but also in the future. What we have to do is continually consolidate and review our relationship with South East Asia to take advantage of trade and investment. markets, because we are facing rough competition from the United States and the European Comreliance munity for the trade markets in South East Asia. Australian investment has to be a key factor in the region. We must recall that far high investment has been in Japan, North Asia, and Hong Kong, with declining investlocations. ment in the ASEAN countries. Our political relations are vitally important too, and are based on our economic involvement and our overseas aid. In talking of aid, I believe we are putting our money where our mouth is; and we tries should do more in terms of aid in our region. Cultural exchange is incredibly imthey to portant, and what we have to do is to move assist Asian countries through student programs to allow more study in Australia. I was pleased to see that in the Budget on Tuesday night $40.5m was provided for the equity and merit scholarship scheme to allow students from overseas to come and study in Australia. We need continued interaction at education level to promote contacts. While we recognise the expansion of Asian baleconomies, this has not been accompanied by the promotion of the study of Asian laninguages and culture in Australian schools. In $1 1986 only 2 per cent of higher school certificate students took Asian languages, as compared to 3.3 per cent in 1983. Rather than having a decline in the number of Australians studying Asian languages, we really must Its have an emphasis on increasing the number, because this is part of our future .. Looking at the Pacific; it can be said that the Pacific is economically vulnerable but strategically invaluable. Rapid political and a social change has been occurring in many of the island states. There are limits to Australia's influence in this region, too. There is a was suspicion of Big Brother, and I can underthe stand why that would be so. Apart from that, Australia will always remain, and must remain, part of the Pacific. We are there and inwe have a responsibility to work with the Pacific states. The major concerns of the Pacific nations only are their economic security-economic independence may never be achieved by some of them-a decline in living standards since the early 1970s; poor trade balance; and reliance on foreign aid. Their difficulty, of course, is that there is a limited resource base and a ona small number of agricultural products for export earnings. There is a big lack of a sufficiel).tly trained employment so pool, and they suffer the natural disadvantages of their small size and their remote The larger countries, such as Papua New Guinea and Fiji, have reasonable they prospects for economic independence, but the medium size states will obviously need to contiilUe to rely on aid. The resources, available to Pacific counare fisheries, timber, and mineral reown sources-perhaps with seabed mining; but do not have infinite resources. Tourism, of course, is a significant resource to them. They have limited primary products-copra, sugar, some fruit-and there has been some growth in manufactured goods and in textiles and clothing. In fact, in Tonga woollen goods and leatherware are being manufactured by New Zealand and Australian companies. As far as trade is concerned, Australia is the dominant partner in the trade relationship of the Pacific nations. The trade balance is in our favour. We export food, manufactured goods and fuels to the Pacific. These exports have grown, but the rate of growth has slowed. The island nations compete with other nations and with Australian and Asian manufacturers for market share. In the medium term the trade imbalance for Pacific nations is unlikely to improve. Australian exports to island countries in 1987-88 were worth $1,025m, whereas our imports from the same states were worth only $228m. I think it is fair to say that the Pacific nations believe that the best form of aid is trade. They want Australia to be more receptive to goods produced by the region. They' want to promote the marketing of Pacific goods. I agree with this concept totally. The Pacific nations want to achieve economic self-reliance and to decrease their dependence on foreign aid. That is a hope that we can all agree with. In terms of the Australia- aid program, in 1988-89 for Papua New Guinea, South Pacific and South East Asia we spent $523.9m. This financial year, for Papua New Guinea we are providing $309.4m; for the South Pacific, $85.3m; and for South East Asia, $137.5m-with $200m going to other countries. It is inappropriate that over the next three years $210m is being given to the frontline African states. Security and defence rnean that we are all tied in together. Only Papua New Guinea and Fiji have any real army forces. Australia and New Zealand must have the opportunity, particularly through the ANZAC frigate project, to participate fully in the protection of the Pacific. In conclusion, in the past Australia has concentrated its efforts on maintaining good relations with the European Community and the United States of America. We must concentrate more on our own backyard. South East Asia and the Pacific are vital to the future of Australia's defence and economic ambitions. Our mutual remoteness, or economic. isolation, is a common bond but the cultural differences are a big hurdle to overcome. We, as Australians and as a nation, must make a total commitment to these two regions-South East Asia and the Pacific.",149

29,Mr SHIPTON ,PACIFIC,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,152
30,Mr SNOWDON ,PACIFIC,"Northern Territory) (12.02)-1 would like to acknowledge what the honourable member for Cowper ( Mr Nehl) said in his speech. I do not always agree with him, and I did not agree with everything that he said, but I must say that I found a great deal of sense in what he said, particularly in the last part of his speech when he referred to what I would refer to as the anglophonic predisposition of Australia in looking towards Europe and North America, rather than immediately to our north, to South East Asia. On that point, it is perhaps pertinent to quote Senator Gareth Evans who made the following observation in a speech: For most of the 200 years since European occupation, Australia has fought against the reality of its own geography. We have thought of ourselves, and have been thought of by just about everyone else, as an Anglophonic and Anglophilic outpost-,-tied by history, language, culture, economics and emotions to Europe and North America. While this self-perception may be slowly breaking down in other parts of this country, it is one that is rapidly disappearing in the north. In the electorate that I represent, the Northern Territory, it has almost disappeared. The Territory is the gateway to Asia-indeed, the gateway to the north and to the west of Australia. The Northern Territory is an integrated multiracial and multicultural community. Perhaps that is no better epitomised than by what are commonly called the Mindil Beach markets where every Thursday night during the dry season one can see 5,000 to 6,000 people enjoying cultures of many nations,Â· but predominantly cultures of southern and South East Asia, and enjoying the culinary expertise and delights of those particular countries. It is a credit not only to those people who contribute in providing their skills and providing the food that is so deliciously eaten by those people who have the opportunity to enjoy that occasion, but also to members of the Northern Territory community for being able to find within themselves the ability to mix and integrate in such a fruitful way. I would like to address a couple of important things in relation to SouthÂ· East Asia, but most importantlyÂ· the area of trade and investment. I would like toÂ· spend some time on the issue of cultural exchanges and the need for us to build within the Australian community a far greater depth of knowledge, not only about South East Asian cultures but also about South East Asian languages. I fully support the statements by the honourable member for Cowper in that regard. South East Asia is a rapidly changing regional environment, and that is particularly apparent in the trade and investment scene. As the honourable meinber for Cowper indicated, the Asian share of world output doubled between the early 1960s and 1985. It was 3.5 per cent in 1987. He pinpointed Australian investment in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN); I think he used the figure of $1.4m. The figure I have is about $1.1m compared with ASEAN investment in Australia of $8.1m, or $8.2m to the nearest decimal point. That investment, I think, reflects the Anglophonic and Anglophilic pre-dispositions to which Senator Evans referred. Not only do we have to bend our minds towards exploiting profitably our relations with Asia in terms of our economic relationships, but also We have to induce the South East Asian community to make more of its relationship with Australia: Much of the investment in Australia comes from only a couple of countries, particularly Singapore, and much of that goes into the Australian property market. We need to think about the way we relate to SouthÂ· East Asia and we need, especially in the private sector, to plan future investment strategies to take vantage of our growing arid profitable relationship. The liberalisation of our import regimes in Australia as a result of this Government's policies is encouraging ASEAN countries to look at us as a place to export. For example, our gross domestic product is $194 billion, which is almost the same as the amount for the ASEAN countries combined. We are an attractive market, but we do not yet recognise the importance of the South East Asian market to our economy. A number of forums have been developed in the region to encourage investment, trade and planning activity and some major developments have taken place with Australian companies. An Australian designed and constructed satellite earth station was formally commissioned a couple of weeks ago in Ho Chi Minh City. That is an important recognition of our need to not only share our knowledge but also help constructively in the communications systems of our neighbours. That telecommunications system, which was opened formally, I understand, by Senator Cook, has strengthened communications between Vietnam and the outside world. That has to be of benefit to not only the Vietnamese community but also the Australian community and the world generally. The earth station was built through a cooperative business agreement between the Overseas Telecommunications. Commission (OTC) and Vietnam's Directorate-General of Post and Telecommunications. The cost of the structure was around $15m. OTC built its first small earth station in Vietnam in 1987, establishing a basic telephone and telex system service with Australia. That is only one example. There are a number of examples of Asian joint ventureswith Australian companies in my electorate. One in particular is a Thai-Australian joint fishing venture which is working very well to the advantage of not only the Thai joint venture partners but also the Australian partners in the fishing industry generally in northern Australia. I want to address briefly some comments which have been made, I believe, in an ill informed way by a very prominent and important writer on defence matters relating to ad- Exercise Kangaroo 89. The accusation made . by Peter Hastings in the Sydney Morning Herald of 31 July 1989 that Kangaroo 89 reflects this Government's belief that Australia can exert a decisive strategic influence in the region shows a very poor understanding of the principles underlying Australia's regional defence policy. That is important in the context of our relationship with our Asian neighbours. This Government has clearly stated that its policy is based upon the belief that its security is interdependent with that of other countries in our region. That is the basis of Kangaroo 89 and it is the basis of our strategic policy. We wish to promote our common security interests by encouraging sound and constructive bilateral defence relationships and by promoting mutually beneficial bilateral defence activities with all neighbouring countries in the South East Asian and South Pacific area. I would like to say a lot more about this subject, but as the time allotted is almost complete I will have to do so at some other time.",152
31,Mr SHIPTON ,PACIFIC,"Higgins) (12.09)-I am pleased to support the motion, which reads: That this House acknowledges the importance significance of South East Asia and the Pacific Australia's future. I thank the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Snowdon) for allowing me time to speak. I say at the outset that I was interested in what he said about Darwin's place in the region. Darwin has a very important part to play in Australia's relationship with Asia and the Pacific. There is already a lot happening in Darwin. I was there recently. It was very interesting to note tQat, because of the high cost structure of Australian domestic travel, which the Government has not faced, the people of the Northern Territory, particularly those in Darwin, look to travelling in South East Asia rather than travelling south even to Alice Springs. There are lots of contacts between various sporting teams travelling in the South East Asia region. I welcome that. We live in the area of the Pacific. We are fortunate to do so, because it is the area of dynamic growth in the world today: it is the century of the Pacific. Many people in the West, in Australia in particular, fail to recognise that the world's economic superpower is not the United States of Europe, as they will be following the 1991-92 economic community and not the United States of America-but Japan. The economic superpower of the world today, the world's wealthiest nation, is in fact Japan. It has always seemed ironic to me that, as this region is an area of growth containing the so-called tigers, the growth economies north and south Asia, this Government and previous governments for that matter, have not developed direct air links with two of those dynamic economies-Korea and Taiwan. Not to do so is detrimental to Australia's trading interests in terms of both imports and exports, and particularly in the development of tourism. We have got the Australian tourist industry on its kne-s because of failure of Government policy. Wealthy tourists from Taiwan and Korell want to come to Australia and they have to come via Bangkok or Hong Kong. There is no direct air service to encourage tourism and the growth of trade. I also want to look at a couple of other important matters concerning the region. I spent last week in Indonesia and passed through Singapore on my way to Djakarta. and It is important that members of this Parliato ment from both sides understand and get to know one of our nearest neighbours well. I was well received by Indonesian authorities and by, in fact, the Australian Embassy in Djakarta. I interested myself in a number of matters when I was in Djakarta last week. One was the negotiation of a new seabed boundary and regime, a zone of cooperation between Indonesia and Australia on the so called Timor Trough. Negotiations are proceeding. Both the Australian and Indonesian Foreign Ministers made a statement in October last year, saying they hoped that those negotiations would be completed by October this year. I hope that that is so. It has been acknowledged by both sides that that will not happen perhaps before the end of the year, but it certainly should be brought to a conclusion by the end of this year, and I ask the Australian Government to see that that happens. A number of Australian interests need to be protected in those negotiations. They are those Australian oil exploration' companies that had permits in the area that is now the subject of negotiation with the Indonesian Government. A number of companies in AustraliaBHP and Woodside are two that come to mind-have permits that have been frozen since 1979 pending negotiations between Australia and Indonesia and pending a clearing-up of Portuguese claims to the area. I say to the Australian Government that it is important that Australia's interests be protected by giving those permit holders some security of title, recognising that negotiation with another government has to take place. We wait to hear from the Government details of the administrative regime that in fact will be established and set up as a result of the negotiations with Indonesia. There will apparently be some form of joint authority. We need to know the form and structure of this joint authority. Will it be one that issues and grants the permits of first instance? What will be the management, the administrative and the supervisory procedures? For instance, what will be the criminal law that applies? What will be the civil law, including insurance laws, employment laws, laws governing vessels, and laws covering employment opportunities-all important economic matters? It would be a boost to Darwin, I would think, if, for instance, the administrative authority were to be located in Darwin. That is an option in the negotiation and one that I favour. The administrative authority for the joint zone of cooperation between Indonesia and Australia should be established in Darwin. I understand that the Northern Territory Government is actively supporting that and doing everything it can. But the Government must protect Australia's interests and put in place a regime that works and that is administratively and economically of advantage to this nation, recognising the legitimate claims and rights of the Indonesian Government in this matter. Another matter I refer to quickly in relation to Indonesia is a statement by President Suharto apparently yesterday-and I welcome his interest in relations with Australia-that ASEAN ought to be the basis of the Australian Prime Minister's so-called regional economic initiative. I think what President Suharto's statement means is that the Australian Government has not worked through the form of structure that it has in mind in relation to Australia's closer integration in the region. I support, as ,does the Opposition, the move towards closer integration of the Australian economy with that of the region. I think it is very important that we do so but in the formulation of both bilateral and multilateral relations it is important to know where we' are going, and what we are doing. There are a number, of options and structures that can be used. There is the existing Pacific Economic Cooperation structure, for instance. There is the ASEAN economic Ministers structure. There is the post-ASEAN meeting structure, and there are a number of others. I think the Australian Government clearly needs to tell us what its views are and what it proposes. The other matter that I refer to briefly in conclusion is the move to the development of democracy. We have seen it in Eastern Europe but, regrettably, there is not a lot happening in our region in China and Burma. Mr Hand-Particularly Burma.",154
32,Mr SHIPTON,PACIFIC,"The Minister says 'particularly Burma'. I agree with him. The Burmese Government has said it is moving towards elections in 1990. There has been a going slow on that; there is no freedom of speech, there is no freedom of the press; martial law decrees are in place; the Leader of the Opposition, Aung Sen Suu Kyi, is under house arrest; and there is no access to the media, as I said. How can a credible election be held if the conditions for democracy and discussion do not exist and political . parties cannot enter into debates? I would hope that both the Burmese and Chinese governments .would recognise that the development of democracy is important and that Australia has a role to playas a middle economic power with a well-established tradition of democracy. We could in fact play a part; this Parliament and its parliamentary officers could contribute through the interparliamentary union which is having its centenary conference in London in a fortnight. I propose to put to other nations at that conference that we establish in this region a joint approach with other democracies such as Thailand to putting together an interparliamentary group that offers to assist both Burma and China in the development of democratic institutions. I think that is. very important. I see the honourable member for Reid ( Mr Uren) is in the House now. Thedistinguished honourable member for Reid, with whom I disagree on many matters but with whom I agree on a number-he probably agrees with what I am saying now about the development of relations in the Asian region-chairs the Asian group at Inter-Parliamentary Union meetings. Australia is the chairing body of the Asian group of nations that covers nations from east, west, north and south, for instance, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Vietnam. It is a very interesting group and Australia has a role to play as a Western nation which is a different role from the European nations. Australia in the future will have to make up its mind-I think this is a long way down the track-as to where we stand in the world. That is why I welcome this discussion today. On the one hand, at these international organisation meetings we are members of the so-called Western group which includes, of course, New Zealand, the European democracies and the North American democracies. On the other hand, we have just joined the Asian group with New Zealand. We are the only Western powers to be members of that group. We are going to have to decide where our future really lies. Obviously it is global, but we have to put more emphasis on the Asian-Pacific region. That is why I have looked forward to these meetings of the Asian group. I would say to the member for Reid that I hope we can achieve something at these meetings. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER Blanchard)-Order! The time allotted for the debate has expired.

33,Mr TICKNER ,COASTAL DEVELOPMENTS,"Hughes) (12.21)-I move: That this HOl!se: (I) expr-s- its concern about the impact of poorly planned and damaging coastal developments, already proceeding and planned, particularly along the coastline of Wales and Queehsland; and (2) cans on the governments of New South Wales and Queensland to control developments to prevent further damage to fisheries, reefs, mangroves, wetlands and the coastal environment. The motion expresses concern about the impact of poorly planned and damaging coastal developments alreadyÂ· proceeding and planned, particularly along the coastline of New South Wales and Queensland and, secondly, calls on the governments of New South Wales and Queensland to control developments to prevent further damage to fisheries, reefs, mangroves, wetlands and the coastal environment. I have moved this motionÂ· unashamedly. I have passionate feelings on the matter because I had the great privilege to grow up on the north coast of New South Wales. One of the first things that made me wake up to the importance of politics in the life of this country was the ravaging of north coast beaches by sandmining that was permitted during the time of the Askin Government. I remember so many of my young friends in those days being absolutely amazed that pristine parts of Australia's national coastline could be ravaged in an open slather and unaccountable manner as a result of the policies of the then Liberal and Country party Government of Premier Askin. The Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) said in his statement on the environment that when the earth is spoiled humanity and all living things are diminished. We have taken too much from theÂ· earth and given too little back. It is time to say that enough is enough. In relation to coastal development, of course, ( Mr the issue focuses for so many Australians, in a practical way, the impact of the neglect of those Liberal and National party governments on the environment. The issue that caused me to move this motion in the Parliament was a visit to the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Townsville, which I uncJertook together with the honourable member for Dundas . ( Mr Ruddock) and the honourable member for Denison ( Mr Kerr). We spoke there to Dr Baker, who is the director of the institute. He drew our attention, in his independent, scientific and forthright manner, to the concern of the institute about the impact of New South coastal developments, particularly in Queensland and on the far north coast of New South Wales. The institute, of course, is strictly divorced from any political considerations and Dr Baker is recognised in Australia and internationally as an independent professional in this area. He makes the very important point that it is vital for parliamentarians and the public to understand the crucial role that marine scientists play in providing independent advice for us so we can, in fact, put policies in place to protect the marine environment. In the course of his research, he has compared what has happened in other parts of the world and he has found that in the Philippines, for example, the massive destruction of mangroves has led to a loss of fisheries, siltation of rivers, and a tremendous amount of damage to that country. The problem is that we have not learnt the consequences of those developments in the Philippines and many of those things are being repeated in our own developments on the north coast of New South Wales in particular, throughout the coastline of New South Wales and in that notorious State-as it has become-of Queensland. I have only a limited amount of time to speak today, but I want to alert the House to some of the things that have happened in Queensland. The fact is that, from the New South Wales border to the Torres Strait, the Queensland coast has been absolutely ravaged by developers. Of course, we have seen a scant regard for proper procedures and processes by the Queensland Government. Environmental assessment procedures are bypassed. Big name operators clear mangroves in defiance of State laws. Favoured developers are given the green light to proceed without having sufficient capital to build, and holiday resorts are erected for the sole purpose of speculation and selling off to the highest bidder. The amounts of money involved in those developments are absolutely massive. The figures from the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation show that projects worth $2.6 billion were recently completed and projects worth another $3 billion are under construction with almost $6 billion worth of further projects firmly committed. I repeat that the consequences of that rampant development have led to the destruction of the mangroves and the damaging of so much of the Queensland coast line. It is not just we in the Labor Party who are concerned about this. It is not just the conservationists who are concerned. The fishermen of Queensland and New South Wales are also concerned-those people that the National Party ought to be representing. The Queensland Commercial Fishermen's Organisation has produced. a. chart of proposed marinas, tourist resorts and waterfront developments in Queensland-150 projects of massive size involving billions of dollars, all of which are placing at risk the Queensland fishing industry. As a result of research undertaken at Sydney University there is evidence that sewerage and agricultural runoff are going to threaten the Great Barrier Reef. They are the kinds of policies that the Queensland National Party Government has implemented in Queensland which have led to that massive destruction. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would have thought that we would have learnt. You would have thought that the public pressure of concerned Australians would have made the newly elected government in New South Wales-the Greiner-Murray Govetnmentaware of the sensitivity of coastal development. But what do we find? Mr Murray, the Deputy Premier of New South Wales, speaking on Four Corners on 5 December last year, said on public record-an appalling comment from a person in public life: . . . I have a great deal of admiration for Joh Bjelke-Petersen. His principle of free enterprise, his determination to push those sorts of things along, his develoilment of Queensland is something that I admire greatly. That is a shameful statement, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is not my purpose today to explore those allegations of corruption which have been made at the Independent Commission Against Corruption. But I do not want to raise some other matters of a political nature that demonstrate the total failure of the Liberal Party at both the State and Federal level to have any control whatsoever over the National Party and its policies that clearly support development at any cost and destruction of the natural environment. The reality is that there are some people in the National Party who are prepared to speak out. The President of the Tweed Shire Council, Max Boyd, who has been a National Party stalwart for 25 years, has been described in one of Australia's major papers as a man under seige. He claims that he has been subjected to a campaign of harassment, back stabbing and treachery as a result of his council's stand in suppprt of protection of the environment. He is a good guy. At least some National Party members are. prepared to speak out. Who did he name as the culprits-the people who have been described as the 'gang of four'? The Deputy Premier, Wal Murray, in New South Wales; Natural Resources Minister, Ian Causley; Tourism Minister, Garry West; and Party Whip, Don Beck. These people have been prepared to override even their own Party member for clear reasons of advancing and pushing development contrary to the proper procedures that ought to be followed. In the very limited time remaining to me, just let me give an indication of how much control Premier Greiner has over this destruction of coastal development. On 11 March this year, a news release, on Premier's letterhead, was put out. It said: 'We have always recognised that the New South Wales coastline is the State's most priceless mental treasure, and we will continue to watch over it carefully,' Mr Greiner said. The very next day the Deputy Premier, Mr Murray, saiq: The State Government's new . . . .code will not affect any of the proposed projects now hotly opposed in New South Wales . . . I call on the people of New South WaleS to rise up and stop the damage of this Government.",156

35,Mr WILSON ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Sturt) (12.31)-Today I arranged for the presentation to this House of one petition containing 4,901 signatures. Those who signed this petition did so to draw to the attention of this House their concern at the increasing levels of foreign investment in Australia. In particular, the petitioners expressed their concernÂ· about the level of foreign investment in Australian homes, business enterprises, resorts, farms and basic resources, and their view that such investment should be limited to 45 per cent of each purchase. Most of the signatures on these petitions were collected by two concerned Australians, Mr Arthur Barnett and Mrs Helen Houston. From what they told me, the great majority of people approached by them readily signed the petition which so clearly expressed their deep concern. Among the petitioners are supporters of all major political parties. Significantly, many of the petitioners live in Labor-held electorates. They now believe, as do many Liberal and National Party voters, environthat the Labor Government is mortgaging Australia's future and selling off our assets. The petition I presented today comprised 196 separate pages each in petition form, with up to 27 signatures on each page. On the assumption of 65 sitting days per year, if I had presented each petition at the rate of one petition per sitting day it would have taken three years for all the petitions to have been presented. Clearly, the significance of presenting these petitions on one day in a consolidated form should not be underestimated. It is aÂ· message from a large number of those who were contacted by the two people I have mentioned. I am informed by Mr Barnett and Mrs Houston that many thousands more would sign similar petitions if they were given the opportunity. It is significant that, although neither Mr Barnett nor Mrs Houston lives in my electorate, they have asked me to present this petition to the House. This is because they know of my concern about the deterioration in Australia's net international liability position. In 1986, the international credit agency, Moodys Investors Service Inc., downgraded Australia's credit rating from AAA to AAI in response to our growing international debt. Earlier this year Moodys announced that it would yet again review Australia's international credit rating. The Treasurer ( Mr Keating) refused Moodys access to the information it sought to assist in making its assessment. His unwillingness to make this information available signalled that he had something to hide, not only from Moodys, but from all Australians. The July trade figures released yesterday show a record trade deficit. Exports fell, imports rose and consequently our foreign liabilities increased by $1.7 billion. The Government is complacent about this because it is using its own Budget forecast as a benchmark. It was complacent when it set the horrendous figure of $18.5 billion as its forecast for the annual trade deficit for the current financial year. If, on 31 March this year the Australian Government had decided on behalf of the AUjltralian people to pay off the debt owed by' Australians to foreigners and to repurchase any Australian assets owned by them, the cost would have been $209 billion. The cash amount required would have been less if Australian investments abroad and debts due by foreigners to Australians had been offered in exchange. However, Australia would still have been required to pay $135 billion to reduce its foreign liabilities to zero. These figures are so large they are beyond the comprehension of many. Let us, therefore, express these amounts in other ways; Firstly, net foreign liability of this amount on a per capita basis represents $8,100 per Australian. These figures are indicative estimates only. On the one - and, debt owed by foreign-owned companies resident in Australia is included in our foreign-owned debt. On the other hand, little information is available as to the current market value of the business assets of those Australian resident companies owned by foreigners. If a resident Australian company were funded by both foreign debt and equity investment and paying off the debt now counted in Australia's foreign debt, there would simply be a change in Australia's balance sheet to show an amount previously counted as debt as an amount counted as foreign equity investment. That is, we still have a foreign liability to the extent of the full value of foreign owned assets. However, to express in net terms foreign liabilities on a per capita basis is a valuable measure as most Australians can relate to it. An alternative way of Hlustrating our net foreign liabilities is to consider how long it would take to pay back net foreign debt and repurchase net foreign equity in Australian assets at the rate of $1 a second. At the end of a year we would have paid back a total of $31.5m but it would take us 4,200 years to repay our net foreign debt and repurchase net foreign equity in Australian assets. Foreign liabilities have two components: foreign debt and foreign equity. Since 30 June 1984 Australia's gross foreign debt has spiralled from $43 billion to $129 billion. The annual interest bill on this debt has risen from 13.5 per cent of export income on 30 June 1984 to 17 per cent of export income at 31 March 1989. Gross foreign debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) has risen from 13.5 per cent at 30 June 1984 to 39.6 per cent at 31 March 1989. My concern is that if this debt continues to grow at its present rate it will soon become unserviceable. However, foreign debt is not the only component of our foreign liabilities. The other component is foreign investment in Australian enterprises and other assets. Net direct investment .by foreigners in Australia as a percentage of GDP at 31 March 1989 was 11.6 per cent. Whilst the ratio has remained fairly well constant over the last few years, I am concerned that if we continue to experience current account deficits in our balance of payments the Government will seek to fund these deficits by urging those who would otherwise lend us the money to make direct equity investments in Australia. Such a course of action would result in a lower level of overseas indebtedness than would otherwise have been the case. However, it would not reduce our overall liability to foreigners; it would merely change the mix of foreign debt and foreign investment. If foreign investment is unduly high or if the source countries of this investment is not varied, I am concerned that it will become a threat to our economic independence. In recent times Japan has become a significant exporter of capital. This is the result of its huge international currency reserves. Figures released by the Japanese Ministry of Finance for the Japanese financial year ended on 31 March this year show that Japanese investment in Australia almost doubled to $3.2 billion whereas Japanese investment in other foreign countries was increased by only approximately 41 per cent. There is an increasing proportion of Japanese investment directed to our shores. Australians see, if investment is vertically integrated, few long term benefits arising from such a capital inflow. . I am concerned that anyone country, be it Japan or elsewhere, could become a domper inant source of our imported capital. We should be wary because of the influence that country could have on our' control over our own destiny and economy. To ensure the that we retain control, I believe that it necessary to strengthen and enhance the role of the Foreign Investment Review Board in examining foreign investment proposals that come into this country. In addition to ing recommendations to the Governp1ent about foreign investment proposals, the Board should follow those proposals through and monitor the number of investments which, after approval, are actually made. It should seek to assess the costs and benefits on a long-term basis of any investments it apposes proves. Australia's future foreign investment policy should be based on the results of these long-term assessments. If in its view the level of foreign investment from whatever source approached the 'limit of tolerance our economic independence-MONICA",158

37,Mr UREN ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Reid) (12.41)-It saddens me but it also angers me that I have to raise voice again in this House to put forward case for compassion for the former Japanese prisoners of war who served for 3+ years important under sadistic and barbaric conditions. I to present some simple facts which show clearly that these veterans, while serving nation, suffered as no other group of veterans suffered in the Second World War. have spoken on these facts before and I will again and again until justice is given to these veterans. There were 550,000 veterans who served in all theatres of war and 19,000 were killed in action. That is a little under 3+ per cent. Twenty-two thousand Australians took action against the Japanese and were taken prisoners of war. Some 14,000 returned Australia in 1945, 8,000 of them dying in action or perishing in prisoner of war but 36 per cent of them never saw Australia after the Second World War'. But this was not the end of the suffering of the veterans. From 1945 to 1959 the rate of death of those veterans was four times that of other veterans and the rate to this day is still 20 cent greater' than that of other veterans. Their illnesses are out of all proportion with other veterans. For example, 7 per cent of that prisoners of war contracted cholera compared with none amongst the servicemen in same theatre of war. Thirty-five per cent is contracted hookworms compared with 7 per cent of non-prisoners of war. Sixty per cent suffered from leg ulcers as opposed to 12 p-r cent of non-prisoners of war, and 83 per makcent contracted berri-berri compared with one per cent of other veterans. The list of illnesses goes ,on and on. The Budget brought down on Tuesday night does recognise the direct relationship between the experiences of ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese and their present medical condition. For the purof the claims by ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese, certain diseases now will be automatically recognised by the Government as war caused. These include peptic ulcers, hepatitis B, anxiety state, psychiatric depresat which sion and strongyloidiasis. The Government has clearly acknowlthat this body of veterans suffered more from illnesses and disease than others, yet it still will not accept my argument that this entitles these veterans to a special pension. As I have said, I have addressed this my House before on the matter. This special a pension should be called the former Japanese . prisoner of war disablement adjustment. It is that this special pension is created. want In previous Budgets the Government withdrew the right of all veterans to apply for their the totally and permanently incapacitated (TPI) pension if they had ceased employI ment or reached the age of 65 years. The Government created for all veterans a new benefit-the extreme disability adjustment (EDA) benefit. It is struck at a general rate of 150 per cent. But the conditions to qualify for this benefit are so stringent that not many veterans have been successful. At June 1989 2,400 veterans had applied for to this EDA benefit. The Department of Veterans' Affairs granted it to 353 of these apcamps, plicants, of whom only 24 are former Japanese prisoners of war. I am therefore arguing for this special pension to apply only to' former Japanese prisoners of war. The eligibility criteria should be more compassionate than those which apply to the EDA benefit. Of the 14,000 veterans who returned to Australia in 1945, less than 6,500 are alive today. Two thousand one hundred of them already receive the TPI pension, so about 4,400 would be eligible to apply for such a special pension. We should keep in mind that these former prisoners of war are dying at a rate of over 300 a year. If we wait much longer there will not be any left at all. Maybe all governments, all politicians, might be happy that they are out of the way but that is not the point. We should start to show them compassion. We should treat them decently. I estimate that, after a period of three years, if 25 per cent of eligible veterans were able to qualify for the pension,set down at 200 per cent of the general rate, it would cost the Government $5.6m a year-very little out of a Budget surplus which the Government has estimated at $9 billion this year. I am also arguing for the right of these former Japanese prisoners of war, if they so desire, to end their days in a nursing home free of charge. I believe that we owe that privilege to this group of veterans who suffered so much in the defence of democracy and freedom. We owe them the privilege of having the comfort and security of nursing home care in their final days. It is a privilege to which all veterans with war disabilities were entitled prior to the Budget of 1987. I am asking that this privilege be given back to former prisoners of war, in particular. The Government has rejected both my requests to date. The Government has succumbed to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, which wants all veterans to be treated on the same level. But they are not on the same level. No other group of veterans experienced 3t years of hell, as did these former Japanese prisoners of war. It is a disgrace that the Department of Veterans' Affairs would appear to be the major opponent of former Japanese prisoners of war receiving real justice. By automatically accepting the diseases of the former Japanese prisoners of war in this year's Budget as war-caused, the Government is recognising that they are a special group. Yet the Government persists in refusing to grant these former prisoners of war a special pension as compensation for the very conditions which in this year's Budget it has recognised. The logic of the Department of Veterans' Affairs on this issue is difficult to follow. I will quote from a briefi!1g paper which was prepared by the Department of Veterans' Affairs for the Australian Labor Party's Caucus committee on community services and welfare. The paper was prepared to answer my case that was being put before the Caucus committee members. I must say that the Caucus committee fully supported my claims-unanimously. I will quote briefly from the paper to show the mentality of some people within the bureaucracy. It says: The move from the focus on demonstrated need to one of a perceived characteristic of a particular group would be to undermine the integrity of the present system. It would seem that the Department of Veterans' Affairs is not prepared to recognise the unusual conditions under which these Japanese prisoners of war suffered for so long. I will table a briefing paper at the end of my speech to demonstrate the faults in the arguments of the Department. I will allow the public and the Press to read those arguments. I also find it difficult to follow the logic of the Ministers in the Expenditure Review Committee of the Cabinet. On the one hand, one Minister said to'me, 'They only accepted the Department's arguments on uniformity because they did not want to set precedents'. Yet on the other hand, another Minister informed me that the Returned Services League leadership was against giving any special allowance on the special benefits to the former Japanese prisoners of war. If this is the case, it concerns me that the RSL leadership is so opposed to this special pension when clearly many hundreds of people have written to .me personally. Many ex-servicemen and representatives of ex-servicemen's subbranches of the RSL have written to me personally saying that they support fully my fight for their POW mates and that they want their former mates, former prisoners of war, to get the justice they deserve. Might I say to all politicians in this House that it is politicians and governments who are responsible for the decision to go to war. It is politicians .and governments who declare war. It is governments which send young Australians overseas to fight wars, and it is therefore the responsibility of politicians governments to provide just and adequate compensation to those whom they sent off to war. Governments cannot ignore responsibility for the consequences of their own actions. I ask this Government, through the Prime Minister, to examine my request.",160
38,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Rocher)Order! I regret that the honourable member's time has expired. Is leave granted to table the report referred to by the honourable member? Leave granted.,162
39,Mr TAYLOR ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Groom) (12.51)-I rise today to refute, in the strongest terms, accusations in a Toowoomba Chronicle article of 9 August headed: 'Aboriginal group accuses Taylor of blackbashing'. Can I say at the outset that I regard such provocative untruths as not only a reflection of questionable journalistic practices, but also as an emotive smokescreen by minority, self-interested elements of the Aboriginal community in the electorate of Groom and surrounding regions. It is a smokescreen around the fundamental issue of public accountability-accountability in the sense that an amorphous financial sponge does not exist in respect of public funding for Aboriginal affairs and that the full range of accounting conventions has to be observed in the process. In November of last year, I addressed a number of questions without notice to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs ( Mr Hand)and I am delighted that he should be in the chamber this afternoon-regarding accusations of nepotism in housing matters and question marks about the funding justification for an alcohol rehabilitation centre at the Alma Vale horse stud outside Toowoomba, owned and operated by The Downs Aborigines and Islander Co. Ltd. Late in December the Minister confirmed the thrust of my questions, withheld housing funds pending further discussions, and terminatedÂ· funding for the alcohol rehabilitation project; and I acknowledge the Minister's timely and very effective response. Early in May of this year I was again approached by a group of Toowoomba Aborigines with accusations of further financial mismanagement and irregularities within the company. In a letter of 11 May, I sought and further answers from the Minister to a mimber of questions arising from these accusations. To date, a reply has not been received. On 24 July, a member of this group, Mrs Shirley Parkes, was suspended from membership of the company for having approached me on the matter, being labelled, in my view incorrectly and very unfairly, as a mentally disturbed troublemaker. On 31 July, at their request, I discussed these matters in my electorate office with the Chairman, Mr Jack Gibbs, and three other company board members. At that time, as I had done last year with the previous Chairman, Mr Darby MCCarthy, I reiterated the view that the issues were not ones of black versus white, but ones of power play within the Aboriginal community and, of paramount importance, of issues of public accountability. In his 9 August attack on me, Mr Gibbs said that I should look after the constituents in my electorate and that I should stop black bashing, leave them alone and recognise that the Auditor-General's March report had given the company a clean bill of health. Mr Gibbs's comments are both misdirected and inaccurate on all accounts. In raising the issues I am looking after my constituents, who increasingly demand public accountability. I have simply referred the accusations to the responsible Minister as the neutral umpire. On the issue of the company's clean bill of health, I refer the House, firstly, to the special audit report of the Auditor-General delivered in March 1989, which said in part: The company has had a long history of poor management. Its previous president, for instance, was asked to resign after he allegedly misappropriated $500 in employees' wages. In 1987 a special investigation was initiated by the Minister after complaints by Mr R. Robinson of Charleville that $7,000 had been misappropriated. The investigation confirmed misappropriation of wages and disclosed unauthorised expenditure on matters not associated with the provision of rental accommodation for Aboriginals. Loans had been made to directors, members and, in one instance, to a Â·non-member. Most of these were made prior to the year ended 30 September 1987. Rent arrears increased substantially during 1986-87. The company also appeared to be mismanaging the Alma Vale property. Secondly, I refer the House to the final report of the inquiry by Mr A. C. Menzies into allegations as to the administration of Aboriginal affairs, tabled in this place by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) on Tuesday last, 15 August. I will quote from that report. Mr Menzies quotes a comment by the regional manager of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Roma: The company has a history of poor management. The Toowoomba community is divided by family factions and at present the the name is deletedfamily has the most influence in the Downs company. In the past, AGMs of the Downs company have usually elected completely new boards of tors which go through the same management as previous boards without improving the overall situation of the company. At annexure A to the same report, Menzies quotes: One feature of Toowoomba is a high degree of factionalism, but to date no one faction has able to reign for any considerable length Most AGMs result in a complete change in board of directors of the company. Clearly, Mr Gibbs needs to get his facts right before he makes public comment of a very racist nature. I understand from informed comments from the Minister's office that further report by the Auditor-General intional volving the company is expected shortly. In conclusion, there were never any racist connotations last year or this year raising the issue with the Minister. It was done solely on the basis of a need for public accountability. I know that the Minister is addressing my questions, but I ask him provide a reply as soon as possible. Elements of the Aboriginal community are disadvanEvery taged. Let there be no doubt about that. hope that this unfortunate situation will corrected. However, mischievous, ill-inture, formed and arguably defamatory comment of the type generated by Mr Gibbs. helps nobody. We are one nation, and Mr should recognise that fact.",162
40,Mr LANGMORE ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Fraser) (12.59)-One a stance of the important functions of a member of parliament is to raise issues for public cussion outside the area of party debate. Politicians have to lead as well as follow. Today I want to raise the issue of what is the appropriate level of defence spending Australia. There has already been some debate about this in the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party Federal Council voted unanimously in June to increase defence spending by $3.5 billion a year. Coming at a time when the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Peacock) is promising cuts in total Commonwealth outlays of $1 billion, the Federal Council's proposal looks like partisan posturing. One wonders whether Council delegates imagined that the $4.5 billion of cuts would be made to make way for the massive defence build-up. Would such a build-up be warranted? Would it be in Australia's interests? The shadow defence spokesman thinks direcnot, and has rejected his own party's formal phases motion, calling it unrealistic. In the Budget that was tabled on Tuesday night, $8.327 billion has been allocated .,y Mr the Commonwealth Government for defence. This is estimated to be 2.3 per cent of the expected gross domestic product this year, been down from 2.8 per cent of GOP in the last of time. years of the Fraser Government and the the early years of the Hawke Government. This decrease parallels trends in such countries as the United States of America and Britain, where military spending increased strongly in the first half of the 1980s but is now falling a as a proportion of national income. Proporreductions are also occurring in the Soviet Union, China and Indonesia, while Japan continues to spend about one per cent in my of national income on self-defence. The most obvious economic feature of military expenditure is its opportunity cost; that is, the opportunities which are. forgone for to alternative. consumption and investment. Military expenditure is luxury consumption. dollar spent on military activity is it I dollar which. cannot be spent elsewhere. be While trying to reduce government expend the Fraser Government cut real public investment per person by about one-quarter, while real defence outlays per person inGibbs creased by about one-quarter. The Hawke Government has maintained of tight fiscal restraint within which real defence expenditure has risen by 9.3 per discent compared with a real increase of 6.9 per cent for tertiary education; 7.4 per cent for housing and community amenities; and real cuts of 16.2 per cent in industry assist for ance and development; 14.3 per cent in overseas aid and 30 per cent in funds for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. .' The question is: does this really reflect conscious priorities? Tertiary education, which includes not only universities and leges of advanced education, but also technical and further education, is an essential prerequisite for both economic and cultural development. Australia spends less on income maintenance as a proportion of national income than any other comparable Western country. Industrial development is essential for both economic growth and improvement in the balance of payments. Overseas aid is in part, like defence, an instrument of foreign policy. One of its uses is in enabling receiving countries to cope better with conflict inducing economic and social problems. For example, the central environmental problem is the speed of population growth. The Indonesian transmigration scheme to Irian Jaya aims to reduce population tensions in Java. The consequent movement of Papuan refugees, whose land has been confiscated, across the border into Papua New Guinea is the origin of tension on the border. Yet, as a result of the cuts overseas aid, Australia slashed support for the United Nations population fund from $2.1m-little enough, in 1982-83-to $0.2m in 1986-87; and it is now at $1.2m. The Australian National University Department of Demography received more from the United Nations Fund for Population Activities in 1986-87 for its work in Indonesia Australia contributed to the fund. It is ply unreasonable for Australia to be increasing spending on defence whilst withdrawing support for policies which would help Indonesia cope better with its population problems. Overseas aid is a cost effective means of contributing to reducing the problems of the people in our region, yet it is one-eighth of defence expenditure. As President Eisenhower said 30 years ago, 'Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies in a final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed'. These expenditure comparisons suggest that Defence is not subjected to the same rigorous scrutiny as are other Commonwealth departments. That is in fact the case. There is a tradition within the Departments of Finance and Treasury of treating Defence as sacrosanct. The Minister for Defence and his civilian and uniform senior officers have never been expected to justify in detail every aspect of their outlays in the way expected of col- every other Minister and departments. The latest Defence report notes with pride that the Department of Defence currently has 110 major capital equipment projects-that is, projects costing in excess of $10m-under procurement and involving a total expenditure of $18,000m. There must be real doubt whether such massive programs are warranted. At the very least the emphasis on expensive capital equipment has directed resources and attention away from personnel and has been the cause of criticism within the defence forces. At a time when universities and hospitals are being severely constrained, when there is a shortage of public housing, when poverty traps are oppressing many social security recipients, when urgently needed road improvements are being delayed by funding restraint, when public authorities are being refused commercially sound capital injections and when aid has been slashed, the in continuing high level of defence spending is difficult to justify, particularly when the international and strategic environment is more benign than it has been for 40 years. The announcement in the April 1989 fiscal statement that there would be no real growth in defence outlays in the following financial year is a step in recognition of this. Further, than the Minister for Defence ( Mr Beazley) ansim- nounced in early July that there would be staff cuts in both the Australian Defence Force and the Department of Defence; Senior ranks are to be cut by about 120 officers or 15 per cent and clvilian staff by 300 or about 10 per cent. This is a modest but positive response to the widespread recognition that Russell Hill bureaucracy has grown like Topsy-a quote from a former Minister for Defence Personnel and Science. Cost effectiveness is likely to increase as the duplication between the services and between uniformed and civilian personnel is reduced, and costs will be reduced slightly. These are significant steps in a process which should go much further. The most severe constraint on Australian economic policy at the end of the 1980s is the current account deficit. We import more than we export and have a substantial deficit on our net payments for services and debt service. Yet in 1986-87 Australia spent $1,700m overseas on equipment and stores and personnel and, in 1987-88, $1,100m. The military exports of around $250m and defence offsets of about $40m do not anywhere near offset that increase in the damage to the balance of payments which defence outlays cause. The respected and cautious World Bank also concludes the following in its most recent World Development Report: Research in the past decade, although not sive, points to a negative relation between military expenditure and economic growth . . . evidence increasingly points to high military spending tributing to fiscal and debt crises, complicating bilisation and adjustment, and negatively affecting economic growth and development. The reasons are obvious from what I have said. Since military expenditure tends toÂ· duce public and private investment, to unsector dermine growth of labour productivity, to divert funds and personnel from civilian search and development, and to increase current account deficit, it tends to retard rate of economic growth. This is not to argue that military expenditure cannot in some cirin cumstances stimulate economic activity but only to emphasise that economic growth would be faster if the resources used for military purposes were instead applied rectly to achieving the goals of economic and employment growth. The Government's goal must be to minimise military expenditure far as responsible defence strategy allows.",163
41,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Rocber)- tive, Order! The honourable member's time has expired.",165
42,Mr MCGAURAN ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Gippsland) (1.09)Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to address the House today on a matter which falls specificompetitive cally within my responsibilities as shadow Minister for science, but which touches, ditier rectly or indirectly, on a whole range of government administration and policy; that is, government research and development policy. The dismal collapse of the Governstorage ment's industry research and development strategy demands a radical review of the role of the primary sector in Australia's economic future. The recent admissions by Senator John Button, Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, as well as the failure of two vital research and development incentive schemes of the Government, being the 150 per cent tax incentive scheme for research and development and the management and investment companies scheme, which is centred on capital raising, show that the Government's preoccupation with creating a high-tech manufacturing base has jeopardised Australia's chances of economic recovery. Indulgent rhetoric by Government Ministers about the export potential of elaborately conclumanufactured goods has served to divert resources from the urgent need to develop our already successful primary industries. For too as conlong, Government Ministers have written off stathe primary sector as a sunset industry when the fact is that its growth in export earning continues to underpin our living standards and supply 80 per cent of our export earnreings. The minerals and minerals processing alone, apart from oil, exports 40 per cent of our merchandise exports a year and reis valued at $17 billion. More than a third the of these mineral exports were value-added the beyond the first stage of processing, The future of the Australian economy was providing the right policy setting and incentives to build upon our comparative advantages in the agricultural and mining sectors and not in chasing an elusive highditech based manufacturing industry. The Government's dream of turning Australia into one big silicon valley based on the Califoras nian experience has proved to be utterly unproductive and, indeed, counterproducbecause it has distracted Government initiatives and policy from the primary sector. Australia's mining and agricultural industries are outward looking and internationally and have a remarkable record in utilising research and development and frontechnology to improve their efficiencies and consolidate their market shares. The agricultural sector has developed means of protecting crops, enhancing yields and improving techniques while the mining industry has applied research and development to improve its methods of extraction and transportation as well as its processing technology in areas such as smelting. In fact, a better strategy than the present one employed by the Government would be to model our science and technology policy on the resource industry's inspired use of research and development. Its managerial structure, its willingness to work with research institutions such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and its capacity to identify the application of scientific innovation and hasten technological transfer ought to provide a lead to our manufacturing industries. The point I want to make is that the primary sector has displayed an adaptability and an embracing of research and development that, sadly, too many of our manufacturing industries have been unable to do. There is good science in this country which has not yet been able to be transferred to the manufacturing sector. Given this, the thrust of Government policy ought to be in encouraging the development of the primary sector as well as the downstream processing of raw materials. While it is important to broaden our industrial base, we must not lose sight of the fact that our primary sector alone has the high volume production and established market positions significantly to offset a foreign debt which is growing at more than $1 billion a month. This compares dramatically with the more diverse small volume manufacturing sector which will always struggle to find and win a modest position in niche markets. We must not forget that while the price of computers has fallen by roughly 20 per cent a year-and this is typical of high-tech merchandise-the price of, say, Australian wheat has fallen by less than 3 per cent while the price of wool has actually risen by more than one per cent a year. The lesson is clear enough: we can keep ahead of technological changes in established industries and consolidate our comparative advantages but the enormity of the technological challenge facing manufacturing in order to achieve the saine result is chilling, given its track record. The simple fact is that we need to direct more resources into improving new speciality crops and improving existing crop and livestock strains generally. We need to pursue value-added technological developments on the basis of our existing raw materials-for example, the development of ultra-hard ceramics derived from mineral sands like zirconium. The annual market for zirconium based ceramics alone is forecast to be about $150m in the 1990s. Australia commands the technological edge in this area. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, representing as you do a very proud and significant part of Western Australia, would be well aware of the advantages to this country in the exporting and processing of mineral sands. Only by aggressively supporting our primary industry will we be in a position to exploit tremendous opportunities for expansion in the sales of processed minerals and agricultural produce in the next decade. With the regional economies entering a period of rapid growth the demand for Australian primary exports is well placed to expand dramatically over the next decade. Given world bank forecasts of Asian bloc annual growth rates of 6 to 7 per cent over the next 20 years and more, demand for Australian commodities is set to grow rapidly in the areas of raw minerals as well as processed commodities such as aluminium and steel, all of which have very high gross value added coefficients. For the last 12 months the industrialising countries of South East Asia grew at a rate of 11 per cent-almost four times the rate of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. Specifically, the 75 million people in South Korea and Taiwan intend to double their per capita income as well as their energy consumption by the year 2000. Even more importantly, our agricultural products will benefit enormously from the anticipated high growth in regional demand for food forecast to be about 4.5 per cent per year. Additionally, the Government's narrowly focused push to redirect CSIRO and other institutions into applied manufacturing research has eroded the research and development base which would consolidate the comparative advantages we enjoy in agriculture. Currently our agricultural research and development effort languishes at only 3.5 per cent of gross domestic product which is about half of what other nations invest in their areas of demonstrated advantage. CSIRO's primary industry orientated divisions have suffered reductions in funding and staff levels which have slowed their level of research activity, sadly very considerably. These problems are compounded when set against the comparative disadvantages imposed on the primary sector by way of labour market rigidities and negative rates of assistance especially evident in comparison with the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing receives twice as much government assistance as agriculture and 20 times as much as that received by mining which is negatively assisted in reality. The central problems of the mining industry are derived not solely from international prices but in domestic constraints which impede efficiencies and cost competitiveness. Wage levels, tariffs and fuel excises which add to the cost inputs in the production process, as well as government charges, freight, levies, royalties and company tax, cannot be passed on to the international market which sets its own buying price. Generally, the vital task of government research and,development policy ought to be to encourage efficiencies within the primary sector so as to consolidate our comparative advantages and ensure that the agriculture and mining sectors are well placed to exploit emerging market opportunities.",165
43,Mr LEE ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Dobell) (1.19)-I wish to take advantage of the grievance debate this afternoon to make a few comments about an issue affecting my electorate. It is the decision by the New South Wales Liberal Government to shut down a power station in my electorate. Mr Carlton-This will be an interesting economics speech.,167
44,Mr LEE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"If the shadow Minister for defence is about to challenge my economic credibility, I would ask him to try to justify his party's Federal Council's decision. to expand massively spending on defence to purchase a couple of aircraft carriers. Perhaps he should start his economics lessons on his own Federal Council because he might then have a bit more credibility. Before I became a member of this House I was an electrical engineer employed by the Electricity Commission of New South Wales. In fact, I am very grateful to the Electricity Commission because it put me through universityon a cadetship and trained me during my university vacations. I am certainly grateful to the Commission for giving me an opportunity to further my education. After graduating I worked at Eraring power station-probably the largest power station in the Southern Hemisphere-commissioning plant, and then I worked with the maintenance crews at Vales Point and Munmorah. It was a very satisfying time. Before 1950 in New South Wales there were great difficulties with the power system. The tramways department had its own power stations, the railways had other power stations and the Sydney County Council had a few generators. The whole system was an absolute mess. It took a far-sighted Labor government in the late 1940s to establish the New South Wales Electricity Commission. That resulted in a power system which has rarely had any difficulties. If we compare that with what is happening in other countries around us which have not been able to meet the demands of their power system, we find that if we do not have a power system that is able to supply all the factories that need electricity it can really hold back our economic development. . I have been interested to see what is happening in Queensland lately. On 25 June, under the heading 'Peak power use leads to blackout', the QueenslancJ Sunday Sun stated: Queensland's cold snap yesterday led to power blackouts throughout the State as consumers overloaded the electricity supply. In Queensland, where those great proponents of free enterprise are letting market forces work, they find that their factories are closing. They are having to shut down because of blackouts. They are not able to have a reliable, secure power supply. I hope that that will not happen in New South Wales. However, the New South Wales Minister for Minerals and Energy, Mr Neil Pickard, seems to be working very hard at making that his target. A few months ago there was a lot of publicity after the Tallawarra power station in the Illawarra area was shut down less than a few months after EmptyHere promising, cross his heart and hope to die, that there would be no closure of the Tallawarra power station. When that decision was EmptyHere Electricity Commission management- Mr Pickard said that it was a matter for the independent power authority, the statutory authority, the managers of that authority; EmptyHere not mind coming up to my electorate and the Charlton electorate to plant a few trees as part of some public relations stunt on the greenhouse effect-that is something that he is able to make a decision on-but when it comes to making a decision about jobs, workers and the economic future of a local area, it is a matter for the management of the Electricity Commission: he is too busy making the decision about the trees. EmptyHere cided to shut down in my electorate four electricity units which make up Vales Point A station. I am disappointed to say that, whereas all members-irrespective of wh-ther they are Labor, Liberal or independent members-have been fighting hard to win the frigates for Newcastle, I have been unable to get the support of the local Liberal State member in my electorate to approach Mr Pickard to try to extend the life of the station and the jobs of the people at Vales Point A station. In fact, a few days before the closure Mr Graham was unwise enough to put out a statement which read: The Employees of Vales Point can their jobs are not in jeopardy. That resulted in the famous headline 'Local member backs Minister over power stations allegations' Coming out on Wednesday, 5 July. A newspaper with a later deadline also came out on the same day featuring the headline 'Vales Point goes'. That was the end of Vales Point A station. Four hundred jobs at Vales Point A station will disappear. People such as the shadow Minister for defence-the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Carlton) - would argue that this is economic rationalism and that other electricity consumers will have to pay more money to keep places such as Tallawarra and Vales Point A station open. They are plain wrong. They are spreading a lie and they know that it is wrong. It is wrong because when we shut down places such as Vales Point A station we bring forward the day that the New South Wales Electricity Commission will have to build its next power station. When one looks at the massive costs of these new power stations, one sees that we save money by extending the life of our existing assets, our existing plant. The deciEmptyHere Commission will not save electricity consumers money: they will cost them money; they will put electricity bills up. Mr Graham EmptyHere sacked and that people will be offered voluntary redundancy or redeployed. The difficulty with that is that there are not enough vacancies on the central coast for the massive number of people who will elect to take redeployment. I suspect that the Electricity Commission's plan is to move those people from Vales Point A station into something called the supplementary maintenance group (SMG). One of the conditions of working in the SMG is that people can be transferred at very short notice to other places throughout the State. If I were working at Vales Point power station and living at Budgewoi with my family, I would not like to be told that next Monday I had to report to Lithgow and go to work at Wallerawang power station. While I accept that the Minister at the table would be quite happy for work to expand at the Wallerawang power station, I do not think it is right that people living in BudgewoiÂ· should have to commute to Lithrest assured that gow every day. We have to ask why the Minister is trying to shut down Vales Point A station and these other plants. It is totally contrary to the recommendations of the MCDonell report, a report which was commissioned by the previous Labour Minister for Energy, Peter Cox. Gavan MCDonell is the only independent person who has ever examined the operation of the Electricity Commission. His conclusion was .that the Electricity Commission again would save money by extending the life of its power stations. In fact, that is what the Electricity Commission told Mr MCDonell a few years ago. The Electricity Commission said that it should try to extend the life of its plants so that they lasted for about 40 years, yet here we have the Electricity Commission shutting down the Vales Point A station, which is nowhere near that 40-year age limit. Why is it shutting it down? The answer is that the Electricity Commission, with its riding orders from Mr Greiner and the free enterprise Liberal Party, is determined to set up privately-owned and privately-operated power stations in New South Wales. It is a great leap backward to the days of the 1940s. New South Wales will again have difficulties in having a secure power supply, and already we are seeing the indications that that is coming forward. Last weekend the Electricity Commission advertised for expressions of interest by . vate .companies in the construction and operation of parts of the new Mount Piper power station near Lithgow. I think that is simply a foot in the door. Next we will see the Electricity Commission wanting to set up private power stations at Gunnedah and Oaklands and new privately owned gas turbine stations. Where will it end up? It will end up with the Electricity Commission being forced to negotiate special secret deals with private power station owners which will work to the owners' benefit at the expense of the New South Wales Electricity Commission and electricity consumers in New South Wales .. There has been a massive reaction in my local electorate to the decision by the New South Wales Liberal Government to shut Vales Point A station. We have had thousands of people sign petitions calling on Mr PiCkard to think the matter through again. 1 EmptyHere and a delegation of local residents about the EmptyHere I think that is unfortunate. Because I am EmptyHere questions to him. Can he guarantee that, under his plans to shut down Vales Point, there will be no blackouts or power shortages in New South Wales in years to come? Can he guarantee that there will not be an increase in demand in New South Wales that will require Vales Point A station to be brought back into service? Vales Point was shut down in early July and within a few days it had to be put back on a 48-hour standby. That shows the sort of long term planning which is being done by the Commission. It is going to hurt Wyong Shire in my electorate. We will immediately lose 400 jobs at Vales Point and up to 1,000 other jobs, indirectly, in the local area. I ask the House to join me in opposing-MONICA",167
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Rocher)o.rder! The honourable member's time has expired.,169
46,Mr DONALD CAMERON ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Moreton) (1.29)-1 raise here today an issue which an ever-growing proportion of Australians considers to be our most potentially destructive economic problem, namely, this country's foreign debt. Whilst the seriousness of our pri- foreign debt problem has received virtual universal recognition, this economically irresponsible and politically reprehensible Government-the Hawke Government-has refused effectively to address the matter and has even brazenly attempted to play down the extent of the problem. In the March quarter our gross foreign debt was $129 billion and our net foreign debt was $104 billion. The June quarter foreign debt figures are about to be released and both our gross and net foreign debts will have risen by, at very least, another $7 billion. Our. foreign debt is presently rising at an unprecedented rate. Eight times last year Australia recorded the highest current account deficit for a particular month in its history. Our total annual deficit of $17.7 billion was nearly $3 billion higher than the previous highest annual figure, during. 198586, which. was described by the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) as the banana republic year. Last year's $1.9 billion deficit is $lOOm higher than any other monthly figure ever recorded. It is proper to examine our debt burden in terms of individual Australians. Each year Australia as a nation borrows far more than it earns. This means that an increasing proportion of our earnings must be spent on servicing our escalating fQreig'n debt. Individual Australians have not gone out and raised these massive debts, but it is individual AustraliansÂ· who will have to pay for them and pay them back. We are now paying record high income taxes so this' Government can service its borrowings. We must pay higher prices for the domestic goods we consume so producers can finance their debts. We must bear the burden of exorbitant interest rates as this Government attempts to stem imports into our uncompetitive economy. Then we are made to finance an unfair tax system which encourages company debt and discriminates against equity, productivity and net profit. . Every man, woman and child in Australia owes in excess of $7,000 in net foreign debt. Last year every Australian would have needed to pay over $100 every month to have prevented our current account deficit from increasing our foreign debt. Our interest payments on our foreign debt alone are $1 billion per month, or $60 per capita. Australia has a per capita foreign debt which is double that of the United States of America, triple that of Argentina, quadruple that of Brazil and 10 times that of the Philippines, yet the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel ( Mr Simmons) sits at the table with a smug look on his face as if the Hawke Government had done a great job over the last six years. Our foreign debt is rising at an unnerving speed. In 1980 it was $7 billion, or 5.6 of our gross domestic product (GDP). By 1982 it had risen to $24 billion and 26 per cent of our export earnings were required to service the debt. Now our debt is over $100 billion, or 33 per cent of total GDP. Nearly two-thirds of our export earnings are required simply to finance this debt. Our foreign debt problem must be addressed on a long term basis. Its reduction or, more realistically, curtailing of its escalation, can be achieved only over a prolonged period when the value of our national production outstrips our spending. Our foreign debt can be stemmed only if export earnings outdo spending on imports. Without a continuing surplus in our balance of trade, we have to keep borrowing just to pay the interest on our debt. This has a domino effect on the size of the total debt. The solution to our foreign debt problem is a two-sided coin. On one side of the coin we must raise our productive earnings. On the flip sIde we must, at the same time, reduce our spending on overseas capital, equipment and commodities. By relying on its one-dimensional, high interest rate economic policy, the Hawke Government has attempted to confront the spending side but has totally ignored the productive side of the coin. High interest rates have caused an overvaluation of our dollar, resulting in our exports becoming less competitive and our imports becoming cheaper. It has also resulted in foreign investors plundering our finances and forcing our borrowers to seek more attractive overseas rates. The Government's ineffectual attack on the spending side of the foreign debt coin pales into insignificance in comparison to the disastrous effects that its ACTU-straitjacketed policies have had on the productivity of this country. In its December 1988 Economic Outlook publication, the Organisation for. Economic Cooperation and Development listed its 19871990 productivity projections for 19 OECD countries. In terms of total factor productivity, Australia rated equal seventeenth. In terms of labour productivity we rated even worse at eighteenth of 19 countries. A country can run up a large private sector foreign debt without detrimentally affecting its economy if it has the net productive earning capacity to compete successfully on international markets. This is not the case in Australia. Foreign debt is the cause of the problems in Australia today. It is interesting that the honourable member for Sturt ( Mr Wilson) raised this same subject in this grievance debate today. I believe that there is a growing acceptance that this is the most destructive element in the community today. Our net exports continue to have a negative effect on the growth of our economy and we the continue to incur trade deficits which are between 2 and 3. per cent of our total gross domestic product. Why is this happening? Because this Government is so hand tied by the trade unions, it has been reduced to pulling economic levers and finetuning an economy that is desperately in need of major structural reform. The' Hawke Government has been prevented by the union movement from linking labour costs to real productivity gains. The Hawke Government has not had the courage to remove the wasteful cost burdens on the waterfront, in coastal shipping and in the privatisation of inefficient government agencies. It has failed to foster a flexible and proactive education and training system which will sufficiently enhance the skills base of our economy and allow us to compete internationally. It has failed to adopt a long term comprehensive strategy of industry reform which will broaden our export base, replace imports and lift our international competitiveness. It has failed to provide an easily understood and consistent legal and taxation framework within which business can plan ahead with a degree of confidence. It has deserted our inventors, researchers and scientists and forced them to sell off their expertise offshore. . The Hawke Government's taxation system has actively encouraged debt and at the same time discouraged individual savings and investment in productive enterprises. The government cannot hide behind the fact that the majority of our foreign debt is owed by private borrowers. It is this Government which has actively encouraged the private sector to accumulate these debts and then failed to provide a competitive environment within which business can compete in the international marketplace. The Australian electorate really has but one choice. It must show this hamstrung Government that presently occupies the treasury bench the door and place its confidence in a coalition government which is committed to real reform. I repeat: one of the Government's biggest problems is its inability to introduce some of the changes which in it's own heart it knows are necessary to put Australia back on its feet. If it does not have the courage and the fortitude to do so, let those who have do the job.",169
47,Dr THEOPHANOUS ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Calwell) (1.39)I want to take this opportunity to bring to the attention of the House a very important and real human problem that exists in the community for which the Government is also responsible and which we must act upon. I refer to the whole issue of the adoption of children from overseas countries. I can say correctly that a crisis situation has arisen in this area. Thousands and thousands of couples want to sponsor children from overseas. Many of those couples have, at their own expense, gone to overseas agencies and governments and, through legal procedures, have been granted the opportunity to adopt children. But what happens is that when they apply to bring such a child into Australia they find that we have a whole frustrating chain of regulations and bureaucratic procedures which, quite frankly, are outrageous in that they are stopping those many genuine couples from being able to sponsor the children. I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not referring to illegal immigration of children, the illegal taking of children from orphanages, or anything like that. I am talking about the situation where Australian couples have received formal acceptance to adopt a child from an overseas orphanage and then they are prevented from doing so by the Australian procedures. This is a very serious situation. The result is that, instead of those thousands of people being granted those permits, last year, in 1987-88, only 470 Australian couples were able to adopt overseas children. This is an extraordinary situation when we consider that in many countries of the Third World the orphanages are overcrowded and the children need a good home. There are thousands of Australian couples who for one reason or anothermany of them are childless because they cannot have children-are desperate to be able to adopt children. But we have these bureaucratic procedures in the middle which are preventing that happening. I will say something about these bureaucratic procedures. They have been around for years and years; it has been recognised that it is a big problem. In 1986 the State governments and the Federal Government recognised the problem and established a working party to try to come to grips with it. Instead of coming to grips with the problem, it has continued even further. The working party was formed because, under the current regulations, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs becomes the official guardian of any child that is adopted from overseas. That is the position. But the Minister's decision as to whether to grant the permit for the child is not in the hands of the Commonwealth Government, nor in the hands of the Minister, but in the hands of the State government bureaucracies-not even the State Ministers, but the State government welfare departments. The procedures, the regulations, the rules are different from State to State. That is the situation. In virtually every State of the Commonwealth it is very difficult for a couple to get approval, because of the very tough rules that are being applied by each of these welfare agencies. In 1986, as I mentioned, having recognised the problem, the Federal and State governments established a working party to look into this matter. Many of the submissions to the working party said that the Commonwealth Government should set up uniform rules and regulations, and also said that the CDmmDnwealth Government ShDUld take unto itself the major pDwer of adDption fDr overseas children. But the working party rejected this recDmmendation and said that the matter ShDUld remain within the control of the State welfare departments for reaSDns which are, to. say the least, sPUriDUS. So, against thDse submissions, the working party made that recDmmendation. That was in 1986. It was said that there would be a mDve tDwards streamlining procedures and that we wDuld see an imprDvement in this situatiDn. But we have seen no improvement in the situation. In fact, all we have is a continually frustrating situatiDn those cDuples. It is time now to recognise that we must change all of this. The Ministers are meeting again at the end of this month and I want to. make this perfectly clear to them: those thDusands of Australian couples who. are in this situation deserve SDme justice and some humanitarian treatment. Those children who. are languishing in the orphanages-MONICA",171
48,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Rocher)Order!

49,Mr COWAN ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Lyne)-I rise to voice my concern at the fact that Australia Post has now taken telephone directories out of all post offices. I speak for New South Wales; I do not know about the rest of Australia. This matter is ofÂ· concern to my electors. I believe that people right across the State appreciate that Australia Post has a commercial charter, but the thing about it is that these books have been of great advantage to. people who want to know the addresses and the telephone numbers of certain businesses throughout the State. I think it is very bad business indeed that they should be removed. It is a service that the country people particularly expect; it is a service that they have always taken advantage of. And it is a great sl1ame that Australia Post has made the decision to remove these books. These books have always been available; they are available for the public who go along to the post office to get their numbers. I know that Australia Post can say that one can phone up for information and get the number, but the people call upon the books fDr to find the numbers of those who deal in furnishing and of the carpenters within a town, for - xample, and actually decide whom they want to ring. This advice is not available over the telephone. I ask the Minister to reconsider this decision and to make available telephone books in the various post offices.",172
50,Mr MILDREN ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Ballarat)-I wish to take the opportunity today to congratulate the board of Sovereign Hill Historical Park at Ballarat, its Director, Peter Hiscock, the Victorian Government and other sponsors, and the project workers and builders pn the successful completion and opening of the new Orientation Centre at Sovereign Hill. The Orientation Centre is aptly named the Voyage to Discovery. It was opened on Sunday, 12 August. It provides a context for the activities of the park and will give it much greater meaning for the half a million people who pass through its gates each year. The Orientation Centre gives a graphic, dramatic, interesting and educational introduction to the extremely important era of gold discovery, which gave Ballarat its fabulously wealthy beginning. Through the use of models of migrants departing from their homes in other countries and enduring the rigours of shipboard life and film demonstrations and illustrated commentary, the visitor is prepared for the interest packed journey through the park. Sovereign Hill is an historical theme park, and as such has no peer in Australia; and it ranks comfortably among the other top theme parks of the world. The park attracts not only Australians but also visitors from many other countries. It is a testament to the faith and hard work of a group of local enthusiasts who have given many years of dedicated work to bring this project to its current standard of excellence. I pay tribute to people such as Bruce McKnight, Dr David O'Sullivan and Dr Alan Nicholson, to name just a few, whose efforts have been crucial to the project's success. Those Australians who have not visited Ballarat and Sovereign Hill should do so and bring their children. It recreates our history and it plays a significant role in reinforcing our culture.",172
51,Mr DONALD CAMERON ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Moreton)I wish to make reference to the plundering of the public purse. by the present Government by its decision to increase the postal allowance of members of the House of Representatives from $9,000 a year to more than $30,000 a year, and to state that it is simply a political action of absolutely disgraceful proportions and without any justification whatsoever. It has been designed just to save the Government's marginal seat holders. Those opposite sit there with. smirks on their faces, but let me say that it will be the public that wipes their faces clean, come the next election. I would say that the publicity that surrounded this outrageous plunder will be such that every letter that a person receives from a Labor politician from now on will be clouded in a cloak of suspicion and contempt, because they will know where the money that paid for the postage came from. As far as I am concerned, if it had been a 20 per cent or 30 per cent increase it would have been reasonable, but to go to $30,000 from $9,000 is absolutely unjustifiable. I pray that the people of Australia recognise the desperate measures that these people are resorting to. They have taken it out of the hands of the Remuneration Tribunal just so that they can manipulate it, because they knew that, if they went to the Tribunal, there was no way in the world they would have been given that amount of money.",173
52,Mr MILTON ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"La Trobe)-I take the opportunity to express to this House my support for the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which has recommended that nuclear powered ships be banned from visiting certain Australian ports until safety provisions are set in place. I would go further, Mr Deputy Speaker, and support Senator Dunn's minority recommendation that the visits of all nuclear ships should be banned. I would remind the House that the Victorian State .Government has banned the visits of nuclear ships to Victorian ports. I also take the opportunity to protest at the lack of information made available on the operations of nuclear powered and armed ships visiting Australia by the governments of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union. The Australian public has the right to know whether nuclear ships visiting our ports are armed with nuclear weapons and whether their nuclear reactors are operating within strict safety precautions. The risks may be negligible as claimed but I call on all the governments concerned, including our own, to provide the necessary information to allow the public and the members of the Parliament the opportunity to make informed decisions on the visits of nuclear powered and armed ships.",173
53,Mr MACKELLAR ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Warringah)Madam Speaker, I was very interested in the contribution of the honourable member for La Trobe ( Mr Milton), who talked about nuclear ships. I have not heard a word from members of the Left or the Right of the Australian Labor Party about the absolute abrogation of proper responsibility by this Government in respect of overseas aid. Here we have a party which used to pride itself on its capacity to think about people less well off, to think about nations less well off, and it used to boast about its capacity to help them and its willingness to help them. What do we find in the Budget this time? The amount of overseas aid has been reduced to 0.33 per cent of gross dom-tic product. Mr Milton-It is disappointing.",173
54,Mr MACKELLAR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I am very glad to hear the honourable member say it is a disgrace. I hope he says that within his Party as well. What, of course, has happened is that under the economic management of the present Government there simply are not the resources available now for Australia to play the role that it used to playas a supplierÂ· of overseas aid and which it should be playing as a supplier of overseas aid. Australia is an extraordinarily fortunate country in terms of resources. We used to enjoy an extremely high standard of living. That standard of living is being swiftly eroded and cut away by the economic actions of the present Government.",173
55,Madam SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,174
56,Mr LAMB ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Streeton)-I speak in like vein to the honourable member for La Trobe ( Mr Milton). About a month ago the Shire of Healesville made a historic decision. After a vigorous and lengthy debate in front of a packed gallery, the council decided to declare itself a nuclear free municipality. With that decision Healesville became the' thirty-eighth Victorian municipality and one of 113 throughout Australia to declare the area within its boundaries a nuclear free zone. Healesville's action might appear superfluous given that Victoria four years ago declared itself a nuclear free State. In fact, in 1987 Healesville voted unanimously to add its voice to those elected governments worldwide to declare a desire for the cessation of nuclear weapons testing. Now, Healesville has put words into action. The council has taken a principled stand to show, through its elected representatives, that the Healesville community does not agree with nuclear power, warfare and the whole problem. In the words of the shire president: ""We're not going to change the world by making this a Nuclear Free Zone, but we are taking a stance not just on behalf of Healesville but for the We are adding our own small voice to the nuclear debate. We don't want to see another war happen, we are taking a stance towards peaceful negotiation of conflicts, towards peace and towards a positive approach to this world"". I congratulate the council on its principled stand. It has my total support. I call upon other councils that have not yet done so, especially those in the outer eastern municipalities association, to follow Healesville's example.",174
57,Mr GOODLUCK ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Franklin)-Madam Speaker, a lot has been said about the word 'poor'. Definitions are sometimes put forward on what a poor person is. In the gallery today are two friends of mine, Mr and Mrs Doran. Jim is a member of the St Vincent de Paul Society in Hobart and has done a lot of work for the society. I happened to read a letter from Mr Kinsella, the Victorian State President of the Society of St Vincent de Paul, in which he answered the question: 'What does poor mean?'. He stated: We as members of the St Vincent de Paul are not theologians, merely ordinary Catholi- wishing to show our love of humanity because we love God. We believe that the poor are not just those in material needs. The poor also include the sick (lack of health), the lonely (lack of companionship), the aged (lack of youth and in some cases vitality), the disabled (lack of mobility), prisoners (loss of freedom), bereaved (loss of a loved one). The Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity in 1965 clearly spells out who the poor are. Whether governments will ever overcome poverty as understood by them, is open to question. What is not open to question is the statement by Christ: 'The poor you will always have with you'. When politicians make statements about overcoming poverty and looking after the poor, they must be very careful because-MONICA",174

59,Dr THEOPHANOUS ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Calwell)-Earlier today I spoke of the importance of ensuring that the special ministerial meeting to be held later this month will lead to new procedures and regulations which will ensure that there is a big increase in the possibility of Australian couples being able to sponsor children from overseas. The bureaucratic procedures that have been put into place over the last few years have been very frustrating for many couples and have led to world. many dilemmas and problems. I strongly urge the Ministers ,to get their act together and put in place around Australia uniform regulations that are generous and humanitarian which will allow the thousands of couples who want to sponsor children legally from overseas to do so, rather than their being frustrated by, the current procedures and regulations. We do not want a repetition of a recent case-the heart breaking case of baby Kajalin which the Federal Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) had to intervene to override the determinations of the Victorian department because of all the things that had gone wrong. It is time to get uniform procedures into place so we can allow those many couples in Australia who want to adopt such children legally to do so and so that we can, in fact, have a humanitarian consideration of the needs of the couples and the needs of those many children languishing in orphanages in Third World countries who want to come here.",174
60,Madam SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! The honourable member's time has expired. EmptyHere the honourable member for Moreton ( Mr Donald Cameron) in denigrating the recent stamp allowance granted by the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr West). The Government has allocated marginal seat members $413 a week and has granted pensioners an increase of $2 a week. It has given members of the House of Representatives a $30,500 stamp allowances, which is $5,000 more than average weekly earnings. The Government's attitude has been that by granting members of the House of Representatives a 350 per cent increase, backbenchers will be able to increase the amount of mail they send to their electors. No-one would deny the work that goes on by members of tl)e House of Representatives but they have received the increase at the expense of senators who demonstrated today that the Government is very keen to remove funding for television advertising. It is quite happy to approve full-page newspaper and television advertisements regarding the family allowance supplement and the Department of Social Security, yet it shifts the burden of working the electorate back onto taxpayers at a cost of $30,000 a year. If the Government thinks that it will gain any credibility from the electorate of Australia for granting politicians this increase, when the election comes around it will be proved wrong.",175
61,Mr CLEELAND ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"MCEwen)-It is very difficult sometimes to listen to the absolute cant and hypocrisy of members of the Opposition.

The honourable member for EmptyHere his seat, said that he does not write to his constituents; he does not spend his allowances. I can tell him that I run out of money every year because on my present allowances I cannot afford to get my mail out.

62,Madam SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! it being 2 p.m., in accordance with sessional order 106A, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA NA EmptyHere to the Prime Minister. Is it not a' fact that the extent to which Australia's resources and foreign earnings must be diverted to future debt servicing is the same whether foreign debt is publicly or privately owned? If so, does the Prime Minister still consider that because the bulk of our net foreign debt is owed by the private sector it is of less concern to the Government than if it was owed by the Commonwealth Government?",175
63,Mr HAWKE,FOREIGN DEBT,"I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. I preface my reply by making it clear that both I and the Treasurer at all times in our comments upon Australia's overseas debt have expressed the clear view that there is no ground whatsoever for complacency. Our economic strategy has as one of its fundamental objectives the lowering of our current account deficit to reach a point where we can stabilise our debt situation. Let it be clear again, Madam Speaker, that that is the position of the Government. There is no complacency. But it is important for Australians to understand the structure of our debt profile because there has been, as there so often is when the Opposition is dealing with matters economic, an attempt to portray a quite erroneous and fear inducing situation. It is therefore appropriate when the attempt is made by those opposite, and by others, to equate Australia's situation with countries overseas that that structure of the debt situation be understood. I repeat for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, this House and the Australian community, just what the profile of that debt situation is. I put it in context by saying that Australia's $104 billion net indebtedness was 31.9 per cent of production in the latest year. The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures on the composition of that debt show that the private sector owes 61 per cent of that debt, State governments owe 14 per cent and statutory authorities owe 25 per cent. The Commonwealth Government owes almost no debt at all. Our fiscal policies have enabled the Commonwealth to undertake a massive program of debt repayment. This Government is the first government in the history of this country to have successive Budget surpluses and those successive Budget surpluses have enabled substantial net repayments of foreign currency and of $A national debt to be made. Further, by turning the overall public tor outcome from a deficit to a surplus we have reduced the level of overall public debt, not just Commonwealth debt. As the Treasurer said, and as I reiterate, 30 years of policy failure cannot be unwound overnight but I am confident, and I believe that the commentators are confident, Madam Speaker, that our policy approach will deliver sustained improvement in Australia's debt position over the long term. The situation is quite clear in the distinction between our position and that of other countries whose names are loosely thrown around on some occasions by the Opposition. The Opposition makes comparisons with Argentina and Mexico. In those cases, which cannot in any sense be properly or sensibly compared with Australia, debt as a proportion of GDP is of the order of 70 to 80 per cent and, of course, most of that debt is sovereign debt, owed by governments. We stand quite clear on the propriety of the policies that we have adopted. As I say, when analysed, there is no room for complacency but, when properly understood, what is predominantly represented by this growth in debt is the undertaking of investment decisions by entrepreneurs in this country on the basis of their understanding that the projects for which they are borrowing will be projects which will generate the capacity for the borrowers to repay that debt. That situation can be compared very sensibly with the situation which would apply under the Leader of the Opposition's inflation adjustment proposal-if it is still extant-which, as we know, has again been blown out of the water this morning by none other than the head of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP), Mr Loton. It was very interesting to hear what he said this morning. It was a very damning indictment of the record of those opposite when they were in government, importantly, and an equally damning indictment of this inflation adjustment proposal of the Leader of the Opposition. Let me make it clear, because it is directly related to the question that has been asked by the Leader of the Opposition-MONICA",175

68,Mr HAWKE,FOREIGN DEBT,"Even the honourable member for O'Connor will probably understand the relevance of what I am about to quote. I understand that he will not like it being said, but all honourable members will understand the relevance of what I am about to quote from Mr Loton to the question that has been asked by the Leader of the Opposition. In one statement it is a damning indictment of the record of those opposite when they were in government and what they had to do with Australia's exchange rate, how that skewed and adversely affected our whole borrowing program and our investment program. It is, at the same time, a damning indictment. in terms of a telling overseas comparison with the inflation adjustment that the Leader of the Opposition has put forward. Let me quote Mr Loton. This morning he said: Inflation has skewed our savings and investment patterns. And I can also say that some . . . in the mid-1960's and up until the mid-1970's, the artificially high fixed Australian dollar also skewed savings and investment patterns. The Leader of the Opposition's question was about debt investment patterns. What Mr Loton of BHP is saying is that because those people opposite artificially held up the exchange rate when they were in government our savings and investment patterns were artificially skewed. It was fascinating to hear what he went on to say. When he said that there had to be a more level playing field, he was asked, 'How can you do that?' Mr Loton replied: 'By reducing inflation'. He was asked, 'Not by artificial means such as indexing'. I invite honourable members to listen to Mr Loton's answer, which pointed directly to the Leader of the Opposition's proposition about inflation adjustment. Mr Loton said: No, no, no. If you want to see indexation at work, go to Brazil. That was his answer: 'If you want to see the Leader of the Opposition's proposition at work, go to Brazil'. So there we have it. Mr Loton condemns the Opposition, and properly so, for the fact that it was criminally neglectful of Australia's interests when it was in office by maintaining an artificially high exchange rate. It was criminally neglectful then. We had to fix its criminal neglect by floating the exchange rate and now it comes up with this half-baked idea about inflation adjustment of which Mr Loton properly says, 'If you want to see the effect of that sort of proposal, go to Brazil'. That is where it ought to go. It will not be sitting in any position of significance anywhere in Australia because it is empty and irrelevant. NA",176

72,Mr DUNCAN,YOUTH SOCIAL JUSTICE STRATEGY,"It is true that in the Budget we announced a series of measures designed to ensure that our social justice strategies for young people are better targeted to ensure that they reach those most disadvantaged in the community. What we are proposing to do is to spend more than $100m to ensure that disadvantaged young people benefit from the successful reforms in the youth area which have been achieved by this Government since it has come to office. Specifically the Government intends to ensure - that homeless young people are provided with better income support. It intends to ensure that there is more medium and long term accommodation for those young people who are homeless and it also intends to ensure that we take preventative measures which are designed to support the family. We are also intending to provide help for those most at risk of leaving school early to ensure that they have every opportunity to maintain their participation within the school system. We are also intending to provide increased employment and training support for the most disadvantaged young people in the community. We are developing initiatives in the health area to ensure that young people, and particularly homeless young people, have access to health facilities which will assist them to overcome the disadvantages that they have in relation to their health. We are also intending to improve information services to young people and will be establishing another 20 youth access centres across the nation to ensure that young people in those areas where there are concentrations of disadvantaged young people have every opportunity to make the transition successfully from the dependence of childhood to the independence of adulthood. We are, of course, carefully targeting our programs to ensure that we develop them across portfolios to make sure that there is effective coordination across the Government. We will also be looking for cooperation from the States and community organisations to make sure that the attack that we mount on the problems that face some young people is coordinated and effective. If we do not as a nation ensure that we get things right for people when they are young, then of course we will all pay the penalty-personally, economically and socially. What we are providing is a solid foundation for the future of Australia's young people and the future of our nation. NA",177
73,Dr HEWSON,FOREIGN DEBT AND TAX,I ask the Treasurer whether he can now provide specific answers to the questions I asked him yesterday concerning the projected ratio of net foreign debt to gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of 1989-90 and the revenue affected bracket creep for this financial year.,178

83,Mr KEATING,FOREIGN DEBT AND TAX,"We have had current account deficits in the last couple of years. foreign debt has plateaued more recently. It has been rising somewhat lately. It did because of movements in the exchange rate. Movements in the exchange rate are material to the stock of the Australian denomination of debt and the servicing of foreign debt. To make a judgment about what net foreign debt may be at the end of the year begs the question about how the exchange rate will perform during the year, what the size of nominal GDP will be and how the current account deficit will come out. This chap is supposed to be an economics professor. He can pick up the papers and find out-Dr Hewson interjectingMadamÂ· SPEAKER-The honourable member for Wentworth has asked his question.",178
84,Mr KEATING,FOREIGN DEBT AND TAX,"He can work out what nominal GDP will be. We have told him that our best judgment is that the current account forecast will be $18.9 billion. He can then take a judgment about the exchange rate and make a calculation. The Treasury is not in the business of making a calculation about what it thinks net foreign debt will be. We can only assume a tradeweighted index, as we have for the assumptions in the Budget, of 58-not a fluctuating exchange rate. And only on the fluctuations in the exchange rate and the size of GDP can that figure be understood. The honourable member should know that. For him to ask me such a foolish question on the day after the Budget about what the outcome will be for net foreign debt, when he knows that it depends on nominal GDP, on the outcome for the current account and on the exchange rate, means that he understands less than even I think he understands-which I can tell you, brother, is not very much!

85,Mr FREE,HOME EQUITY CONVERSIONS,My question is to the Minister for Social Security. I preface it by noting that the Government's retirement income policy includes measures intended to increase the access of age pensioners to savings and other income without any cost to their pension. Can the Minister explain how home equity conversion schemes will be treated under the social security income test and Net what benefits they would have for older Australians?,178
86,Mr HOWE,HOME EQUITY CONVERSIONS,"I thank the honourable member for his question. It is an issue that has been of some interest to age pensioners not only in the honourable member's electorate but throughout Australia-and especially in the New South Wales media today. As honourable members will know, about 70 per cent of age pensioners own their own homes. But quite a significant proportion of age pensioners who own their own homes have relatively small incomes, so the home equity conversion scheme provides an opportunity for pensioners to provide a modest extra income stream or a lump sum for them without affecting entitlement to the maximum pension. It is, of course, a purely voluntary scheme. Contrary to the assertions of the honourable member for Bradfield, home equity conversion schemes do not require pensioners to pay interest in the usual manner. Interest and charges on home equity conversion loans offered by a commercial financial institution are capitalised, which means that in most cases pensioners face no upfront costs. Interest and charges are repayable on the death of a pensioner from his or her estate, or from earlier voluntary sale. It is important that honourable members understand-and certainly so that we avoid, in this area, the confusion of pensionersthat what we have decided as a government is essentially to discount the income stream that flows from home equity conversion from the point of view of the social security income test; that is, from November pensioners will be able to borrow up to $40,000 against the value of their homes, excluding capitalised interest and charges, which will not be taken into account under the income test. This particular scheme, or the variants of the scheme that will be made available to age pensioners, could play a very important role in terms of our overall retirement income policy. They will particularly play an important role for pensioners with little income apart from the pension itself-those who need to carry out on their homes sometimes modest repairs that they are unable otherwise to afford and to pay for. Also, in some cases, people may have a necessity for an additional stream of income to provide a pensioner with assistance that, again in other circumstances they would not be able to take advantage of. So it is only part of the policy. We regard it as a modest initiative. But again, like other initiatives, we would find it helpful if members of the Opposition tried to understand and get on top of what is proposed rather than referring to their own rather vague and nebulous policy. If they do that, aged people will probably finish up agreeing with the former Opposition Leader who, I think, saw in this particular retirement income policy a great deal of merit. There was a recognition that we can build on our historic pension system in this country with initiatives which encourage self-provision and enable people to solve the very real problems that they face in ageing or in retirement. NA",178
87,Mr TUCKEY,INTEREST RATES,"I address my question to the Prime Minister. I remind the honourable gentleman that, following his projection made during the Western Australian election campaign in January this year that home loan interest rates would not rise, home loan interest rates subsequently rose to 17 per cent. I ask the Prime Minister: Did he rely on the same source of advice as previously, namely his own, to make his latest prediction that interest rates will move down 'before the end of the financial year'?",179
88,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,"I am in the fortunate position as Prime Minister of having these sources to call upon: one, the Treasury; two, my own Department; and three, my own very considerable resources. As a result of being able to call upon those three very considerable resources, I will put my economic record at any time against that of the Opposition. Would honourable members opposite like, for instance, to look at our record in the area of job creation?Â· When I announced at the beginning of our term of Government that we would create 500,000 new jobs in our first term of Government, you mob on the other side said, 'No, no, no way'. Honourable members opposite scoffed at Hawke when he said, 'We'll create half a million new jobs'. Hawke was right; they were wrong. Not only did we create half a million new jobs, we created more than half a million new jobs. When I said we would bring inflation down they scoffed at that. What has been the result there? They left us-Mr Shack-It is 7.7 per cent.",179

95,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,"If they want to look at the question of industrial disputation, I said with the accord we would get industrial disputes down from the mess in which they left it. Honourable members opposite had their doubts from day one. They said that theÂ· accord would not work. I have lost count of the number of times that people opposite have doomed the accord to the graveyard. They did it in the election campaign of February 1983; they have been doing it ever since. But it stuck. It has proved an extremely effective and malleable instrument. What is the result now? The Hawke prediction is right because the level of industrial disputes in this country is 59 per cent less than it was under honourable members opposite. So it does not matter where one looks-everywhere that we have made pre. dictions about what we would do, they have worked out. On the question of interest rates, I rely those three very substantial resourcesTreasury, Prime Minister's Department and Hawke's own intellect-to tell honourable members opposite that before the end of this financial year interest rates will be down. NA",180
96,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,SUPERANNUATION,"I direct a question to the Treasurer, and it concerns superannuation and people's access to superannuation. Can the Treasurer explain to the House details of the Government's plan to make superannuation more accessible to the Australian work force, particularly-and many people are interested in this aspectto low and middle income earners who previously have been excluded, and also, of course, to women?",180
97,Mr KEATING,SUPERANNUATION,"Madam Speaker, when the Government came to office in 1983 the superannuation industry was a postage stamp industry. It covered only people in the public sector and some people in the private sector. By and large most ordinary Australians had no access to superannuation whatsoever. Part of that was due to the fact that the tax concession was so generous that it could not be extended broadly to the whole work force-that is, we taxed at the marginal rate only 5 per cent of lump sums. The tax was next to zero. Therefore, to expand superannuation generally would have been an enormous cost to the nation through Budget that deficits as they were then or public saving over time. So the Government went about a change to the tax treatment of superannuation to keep it concessional and useful but to ensure that it would be extended. We did that first by changing the tax treatment in 1983. Then in 1988 we changed the tax treatment further by bringing forward the lump sum tax, making lump sums free of tax and putting a tax on fund earnings, thus aligning the tax treatment of superannuation 'Yith all other forms of saving. In the interim, the Government's 1985 wage arrangements with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) saw the work force take 3 per cent of wages as superannuation. That was done to open this concession up not just to the privileged, but to the whole work force to encourage people to produce for themselves a retirement income. In this on Budget we have said we will put on .the table, in .discussions for the next financial year, the question of a gradual introduction of a further 3 per cent for occupational superannuation. That is, we would then have over time a much higher contribution running-something more like a mature superannuation contribution. This of course has meant that we have seen the assets in superannuation grow from about $15 billion or $17 billion to over $100 billion this year. They have been growing at such a rate, as we say in the Budget, that there will be about $60 billion a year of asset growth by the turn of the century, which will be a massive injection into savings as well as a substantial provision for retirement. In this Budget we have done three or four other things to improve the way in which superannuation can produce a retirement income and add to savings. On 18 April for this Budget we announced that the income test area for pensioners would be 100 per cent tax free by 1990. For the pension we are allowing people not simply to earn within the free area and maintain pension; we will also remove tax from the free area altogether by July 1990. From 1991, as we announced in the Budget on Tuesday night, we will then index annually the free area, so the free area will be maintained in real value. There will be the pension plus the free area. So from 1995 no age or service pensioner will pay income tax. I am referring to full and part pensions. They will be removed entirely from the tax system. The only test which will apply will be the pension income test. Hence the withdrawal rate is 50 per cent and hence the effective marginal tax rate will fall from 70odd per cent to 50 per cent. As well as that on Tuesday night we introduced reductions for the self-employed to lift them to the position of everybody else. Instead of there being a limit of $1,500 or $3,000, now the only effective limit is the reasonable benefits limit (RBL). So a farmer, a sole trader or a professional can invest in superannuation and get full tax deductions up to the limits of the RBL-that is, full deductions up to $3,000 and three-quarters deductions above that to the limit of the reasonable benefits limit. This means an employee supported by an employer gets support for superannuation, and a person in a company-his own company-can order up whichever superannuation he wishes. The self-employed never could do this, but now this has been changed. From July 1990 the current $3,000 limit on deductable contributions by employees with award-based superannuation-that is, the ACTU's 3 per centers-will be extended to all employees with employer-supported superannuation of 4 per cent or less. In other words, those people who took their 3 per cent out under the ACTU-Government arrangements in 1985 can now top their superannuation up to get deductions for it, to add to superannuation in retirement. Any further 3 per cent award would be on top of that, so at the end we could have the whole work force contributing to superannuation at a rate of 6 per cent, 10 per cent or more, which is the level of a mature contribution from someone who was lucky to have been in superannuation years ago. We have revised the reasonable benefits limit. The question goes to women. There is a very important package for women. At the moment if a woman works less than 25 hours a week she cannot make superannuation contributions. That will be changed to 10 hours. Women who have been out of the work force for two years will be able to make contributions to superannuation. Many women come back into the work force to work part time, so their final average salary is quite low. Therefore, their reasonable benefits limit is quite low, because it is tied to their final average salary. We are now tying that to their highest average salary so they can pick any higher salary in their working life and tie the reasonable benefits limit to that rather than the lowest final salary, for most women a part time salary, which, of course, discriminates against them in superannuation. That is a vast change. The other change for women is improved vesting. Many women go in and out of the work force. Some go back to work for five years and then walk away. They walk away now with nothing. There is nothing vested in their names. No employer contributions or the earnings on employer contributions are vested in their names. Now vesting will be introduced on a sliding scale over 10 years. So the changes for women in this very important package are that if they are working 10 hours-not 25-they will be able to contribute to superannuation; if they have been out of the work force for a couple of years they will be able to contribute to superannuation; the RBLs will now be tied to their highest average salary, not their final salary; and there will be improved vesting so that when they leave they walk away with a vested contribution in their name which they can take from job to job or out of the work force. That is a very substantial package for women. In all, this is an enormous package and one which will totally reshape retirement incomes policy in this country, leading, as my colleague the Minister for Social Security said earlier, to an adequacy of retirement income. We will see retirement income added to pension because of a much more sympathetic interface between the pension and superannuation via reduced marginal rates of tax. Hence it is a very competent and I think a very mature scheme which will add to savings quite dramatically in the period ahead. Tonight the Leader of the Opposition is to reply to the Budget. Given the fact that in his mock election campaign of a week ago the principal issue was savings, I expect that, given the opportunity of a national television address, he will outline the details-Mr Tim Fischer-Madam Speaker, I take a pointÂ· of order on two counts.

Let me run through the cost burden, industry by industry, in order to put this in some proper perspective. The average increase in interest costs would be, for broad acre enterprises, in the order of $45 per week. If you take it at industry level, the costs vary considerably: for cereal growers and specialist wheat growers, $70 per week; $46 per week for mixed livestock and cropping enterprises; $35 per week for sheep producers; $40 per week for beef producers; $30 per week for dairy farmers; and $18 per week for horticulturists. That is the effect of the Leader of the Opposition's ill-considered, ill-advised and informed proposal. It is a lopsided version of the theoretical proposal of inflation adjustment, as it does not include property investments, stocks or depreciation. It would have little effect on overall savings. The cost of $4 billion to $7 billion would mean less government savings. Increases in business tax would reduce business savings, to which I would add that returns to savings have little effect on savings levels. It would distort the financial sector and investment pattern. The banks would be the big winners because they get a competitive advantage as well as a direct taxation benefit of several hundred million dollars. Exempting property loans would amount to a subsidy for property speculation at the expense of productive investment. What this country wants is productive investment-not another loophole-while grandfathering of old loans would effectively penalise new business ventures. It would mean a massive increase in business taxation. It would open up major new tax avoidance opportunities and add to the complexity of the taxation law. Grandfathering of old loans in particular, is just plain impractical. It would wreck Australia's economic performance. The rich would get all the benefit. The taxpayer on over $100,000 a year would benefit by about $90 a week. The typical taxpayer in the $20,000 to $30,000 range would benefit by only $4 per week. It is the old Liberal theory-only the rich need incentive. This is an absolutely disastrous proposition for the business community and the farm community in particular. Why the economically literate members of the National Party have not knocked this one out of the ring by now, I cannot understand. NA",184
136,Mr HAWKER,CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT,"I refer the Treasurer to the June 1989 edition of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Economic Outlook and, in particular, that section which shows all OECD countries' current account deficits as a percentage of gross domestic profit (GDP). I remind the Treasurer that his list shows that last year Australia ranked twenty-third, at the bottom for all OECD countries, thus giving us the highest current account deficit as a percentage of GDP for all of these countries. I also illremind the Treasurer that the current account deficit for the last financial year exceeded the Budget forecast by 80 per cent. I ask the Treasurer: What level of confidence should the Australian public place on this year's Budget forecast of another record deficit of $18t billion and, furthermore, what are our chances of getting off the bottom of the OECD ladder for the coming season?",185
137,Mr KEATING,CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT,"If the honourable member had looked at the ladder for employment and investment he would have thought we were. just about at the top. Of course, it is only investment which will change the nature of the Australian current account. As the Treasury says very eloquently in Budget Statement No.2, it is because of 15 years of poor investment that the structural weakness emerged in Australia to give us a six percentage point current account deficit in 198081. That was three years before this Government came to office; that is-unless he is quick on the uptake-when his lot were around. That occurred for the 15 years before, bearing in mind that the Australian Labor Party was in office for three of those years. The former Government went through a resources boom and for that period the average rate of investment was one per cent. If the resources were taken out investment would haveÂ· been zero. It had two and a third per cent for the previous five years when it also had investment. In other words, it had no investment for a decade. Is it any wonder our structural weakness was evident? As soon as any demand was placed on Australia when we got the economy out of recession, when employment was growing again and people were demanding and consuming things, it went straight to imports. Australia had no productive base left. The Opposition has the temerity to put questions to us about the current account deficit when it has been this Government which has swung investment around. I gave honourable members the numbers yesterday. For the five years the average rate of investment growth under Labor was 10.8 per cent. For five years of the former Government it was 1.6 per cent, with a resources boom which that Government had nothing to do with, and 2.3 per cent for the other years. That is the record. We have in fact made the shift to investment by lifting the profit share; by getting the public sector, through public sector dissaving, to shift the public sector borrowing requirement by 8 per cent of GDP; by shifting the profit share to its highest level in our history, giving us a competitive exchange rate. They are the basic ingredients of a shift in the current account deficit. While we were doing that we gave Australians decent employment growth notwithstanding a very high immigration program. We have decent employment growth and the highest participation rate in tory, particularly amongst women. As well as that, as I have said, we have very high investment records. What does the Opposition have in place as an alternative policy strategy? On the basic question of the stance of fiscal policy it does not have a policy. one in the nation knows what the stance of Liberal fiscal policy would be. Nobody! The Opposition would not know. Pilots at the moment want a 29 per cent wage increase. What would the Opposition do about it? It would give it to them, as it did in '1980-81. It gave them their increase. Costs immediately swung into double digits and the inflation rate went with it. What would the Opposition do about wages? Would it put out a press release saying they should be related to productivity? It would do nothing. Those opposite have no fiscal policy; they have no wages policy. As I said at the time of the April statement, if they cannot run wages in Australia, they cannot run Australia. That is why honourable members opposite are sitting where they are. That is what put them there in 1983, and everyone in the business community knows it today. That is why Brian Loton said today that we had a shocking fixed exchange rate murdering us for years. We are not having inflation adjustment. He is part of the Melbourne scene. He has taken the Melbourne hero and tipped him on his head today and said he will not have inflation adjustment. With regard to inflation adjustment he said, 'Go back to Brazil. Have a look at Brazil'. Those opposite just sit there. They are lazy; they have no ideas. They have been in opposition for nearly seven years, yet they have no fiscal policy, still no wages policy, and no policy for their industrial structure. They just hope that they will waddle back into office again, that they will crawl over the line again. As I have said in here before, they will be squashed like bugs on the way. MR LEeH WALESA",185
138,Mr GORMAN,CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. With the present government changes in Poland and the likelihood of Mr Lech Walesa becoming the first democratically elected Prime Minister in that country, when will the Australian Governour his- ment invite him to Australia?",186
139,Mr HAWKE,CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT,"I thank the honourable member for Greenway for his question. As we know, the political situation in Poland remains uncertain with the Communist Party nominee, General Kiszczak, unable to form Noa government. We are advised that Lech Walesa has been put forward as the next Prime Minister by Solidarity and by two minor parties which have hitherto supported the communists. Honourable members will recall, and I know the honourable gentleman himself will certainly recall, that Mr Wales a was invited to visit Australia by the Australian Council of Trade Unions for an International Confederation of Free Trade Unions conference in Melbourne in March 1988. That request was sent and I made direct representations in support of it, but the communist authorities in Poland at that time refused to let him come. How things have changed now. I am sure that I speak for all members of this Parliament when I say that Australia would warmly welcome a visit to Australia by Mr Walesa, whether he came as Prime Minister of his country or in his existing role as the leading reform figure. The Australian people and the Australian trade union movement in particular have enormous respect for the absolutely courageous way in which Mr Walesa has helped generate the welcome reforms which now see not only in Poland but also in a large part of the rest of Eastern Europe. During my recent visit to Hungary I was able to observe that process of reform at first hand. I am certainly convinced that a constructive Western response to Hungarian and Polish reform processes is necessary to give those processes a better change of success. For that reason Australia participated in a meeting of 24 states at the invitation of the European Commission to follow up the G7 economic summit proposals and coordinated Western assistance ,to Poland and Hungary. The Government is now examining what can be done by way of expanding our existing commercial relationship to help the cause of reform in Poland and in Hungary. We are exploring actively the extension of the Australian system of tariff preferences to Poland and Hungary. In the statement. I will be making to the House shortly I shall make further comments upon those developments in Hungary. In conclusion, I thank the honourable member again for his comment. That invitation to Mr Walesa is there. I am quite happy to associate myself with the honourable member in restating the fact that Australia applauds the courageous stance that Mr Walesa has taken in very difficult and at times very dangerous circumstances. He has our unqualified admiration and, as I say, we would welcome him here, either as Prime Minister of Poland if he accedes to that position, or in his current status as a reformer of very considerable distinction not only in his own country but in that part of the world.

I refer to your recent letters and the letter from the Minister for Administrative Services on the decision to increase postal entitlements of members of this chamber from $9,000 to $30,525, and also to provide a totally unlimited entitlement of personalised stationery. While I guess, Madam Speaker, that it would be improper to ask the rationale for this decision, I nevertheless ask you: Can you give a categorical assurance that these massive increases will not be used to facilitate political direct mailing campaigns of any sort, especially those professionally prepared outside a member's office but mailed from his or her office using these new entitlements?

156,Mr HAWKE ,THE SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM,"Wills-Prime Minister)by leave-I report to the Parliament on the two overseas visits that I undertook during the parliamentary recess: firstly, to France, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany and Hungary between 16 June and 3 July, and, secondly, to the South Pacific Forum in Kiribati, between 9 and 12 July. Both missions advanced Australia's interests and re-attested Australia's high international standing. The visit to the United States enabled me to renew a warm personal association with President Bush and to consolidate Australia's close contacts with the new administration. My visit to Britain and West Germany reof affirmed our strong and significant association with both countries, and, in the case of Britain, furthered the common endeavour to place the historic and traditional relationship between our two countries firmly in the context of modern realities.

Throughout this mission, the focus was placed on the advancement of Australia's commercial and economic interests. The reaa sons for this are plain. The United States, Britain, France and West Germany are all among Australia's 12 largest trading partenhancement ners. Together, they account for around per cent of Australia's total two-way trade and for nearly 50 per cent of the total stock of foreign investment in Australia. Most portantly, the visit took place at a time the whole world trade community is coming to grips with the implications of Europe 1992-the creation of a single market in Western Europe. It was within this framework that I addressed major business and official gatherings in each of the countries I visited. It was these reasons I was joined in Paris, Bonn Budapest by a delegation of senior Austrasystem. lian business executives. In London, more than 100 representatives of Australian busiuseful ness attended the Trade and Investment Conference which met under the auspices of the British and Australian Governments. At all these meetings they were able to observe at first hand the dimensions of change - place' in Europe, with all the challenges and , the opportunities that they offer to AustraliaI).industry. I pay unqualified tribute to the which all those Australian busirepresentatives made to the success of In Paris London and Bonn I reiterated ! publicly a-d privately Australia's concern of about the common agricultural policy and practices covering other commodi ties, such as coal. In all these capitals I it clear that, despite our concerns on specific matters, Australia wholeheartedly the growing unity of Europe as a force for peace and progress in the world. Prime Minister Rocard Prime Minister reThatcher and Chancellor 'Kohl each stressed in their government's commitment to making the single market a free and fair marketplace for all. Australia values these assurances that I received from those leaders. I the House that Australia will be folby lowing developments very carefully, staying in very close communication with EC mern10 ber governments and the European CommisEusion as we approach 1992 and beyond. In Washington, I reaffirmed Australia's strong desire that the United states should continue to play a leading role in achieving successful outcome to the ,Uruguay Round, especially in respect of agricultural trade. While accepting that the American export program was not intended to 30 harm non-subsidised agricultural exporters such as Australia, I stressed that Australia had nevertheless found itself in the crossfire imof an escalating subsidy war and that our when grain exports, in particular, had been adversely affected as a consequence. I am very pleased to report that the United States Administration agreed to examine my suggestion to seek a linkage between the provisions of the 1990 Farm Bill and the outcome of the Uruguay Round. Such a linkage would for help to achieve our declared common objecand tive of a more open international trading In Washington, I was also able to have discussions about Australia's regional economic initiative. As honourable members will know, the United States Administration endorsed this initiative. - pecifically, Secretary of State Jim Baker endorsed my protaking posal for greater regional economic consultation and cooperation as 'an idea whose time has come'. The United States will be represented at the ministerial level conference in Australia that we have planned and for which we have issued invitations for November of this year. My discussions' at all levels underlined fundamental and far-reaching changes under way in East-West relations. Nowhere was this more evident than in Hungary. The great significance of the changes in Hungary is that they are being shaped by the Hungarian leadership, in response to the clear wishes of the Hungarian people. I depart from my prepared text to say how exhilarating it was to meet those leaders in Hungary and to see not merely the commitment but also the enthusiastic zeal with which they were approaching the processes of establishing truly free democratic parliamentary elections in that country. Their zeal and their enthusiasm matched that of the 20 to 25 leaders of the opposition groups that I also had the opportunity and pleasure of meeting in Budapest. This difficult, complex and, may I say, courageous course is based upon the recognition of the inescapable link between economic reform and political reform. President Bush, who was in Hungary two weeks after my own visit, was good enough to state publicly that he shared my view, as I had put it at the White House, that the West must do everything we can to encourage the positive developments in Hungary. To give practical substance to our hopes, Australia has agreed to negotiate a double taxation agreement with Hungary, to explore the possibility of an investment protection agreement and to seek' ways of providing access for Hungary under the Australian system of tariff preferences. On peace and disarmament questions, I can report that each of the countries I visited welcomed Australia's initiative in holding a government-industry conference on chemical weapons, to be held in Canberra next month. This conference will provide a unique opportunity to develop strategies for a comprehensive chemical weapons convention to prevent the spread of this hideous scourge. Over the range of issues I discussed in each capital-Southern Africa, the Middle East, Afghanistan, Indo-China and the Pacific-the tragic events in China and Lebanon loomed especially large. President Bush, Chancellor Kohl, President Mitterrand and Prime Ministers Thatcher and Rocard all shared the Australian Government's feeling of obligation to the express, as they have all done forcefully, condemnation of the brutal suppression of human rights which has occurred in China. Like myself, these Western leaders will be watching closely the fate of all those prominent in the pro-democracy movement and also other Chinese leaders, particularly Secretary-General Zhao. All the leaders with whom I spoke are deeply concerned about the continuing tragedy in Lebanon. This is a matter of special concern to Australia because of its impact on our large community of Lebanese origin. As I said in the Parliament earlier this week, Australia firmly and unequivocally supports the Arab League initiative aimed at bringing the main protagonists to the negotiating table. We stand ready to support any United Nations initiative on Lebanon and I am in continuing communication with President Bush and President Gorbachev on this tragedy. We applaud current French diplomatic efforts on Lebanon and I look forward to detailed discussions on the situation there with Michel Rocard tomorrow. Consistent with my Government's strong policy for the protection of the environment, it was appropriate' for me on this journey to seek support for Australia's initiative for a comprehensive environmental protection agreement covering the Antarctic, the world's last and greatest wilderness. This I did. I found ready support in Paris and a sympathetic understanding of Australia's position in' both Bonn and Budapest. I regret to say that neither Britain nor the United States is yet ready to support the position on which I believe honourable members of this House stand together. But I am confident that growing community awareness and concern worldwide will ensure that governments everywhere become more responsive to the need to address this question and ultimately will come together in a common resolve to protect this precious part of our endangered planet. In Paris, Prime Minister Rocard and I agreed to the formation of a working group to pursue environmental matters of common concern. The working group had its first meeting in Paris last week and I fully expect that Prime Minister Rocard and I will be able to announce further steps after our talks here tomorrow. I should now report to the House on the twentieth meeting of the South Pacific Forum which I attended at Tarawa, in the Republic of Kiribati, on 10 and 11 July. The Forum coincided with Kiribati's celebration of its tenth anniversary of independence and I was honoured to represent Australia at this special anniversary. Two matters of fundamental importance dominated the Forum-the serious threat posed by driftnet fishing in the southern Pacific Ocean; and the implications for these island nations of the greenhouse effect. It is no exaggeration to say-I stress this-that for some of our neighbours and partners in the South Pacific these two issues, driftnet fishing and the greenhouse effect, represent, almost literally, matters of life and death. I now table the communique adopted by the Forum and the Tarawa Declaration on pelagic driftnet fishing. The Tarawa Declaration set out the member nations' profound concern at the damage being done to the economy and the environment of the South Pacific region by this indiscriminate, irresponsible and destructive fishing technique. I doubt whether even honourable members who I know would have an interest in this and certainly members of the Australian public would really understand the frightening dimension of the phenomenon of pelagic driftnet fishing. Pelagic driftnets vary in length between 30 and 60 kilometres-I repeat, between 30 and 60 kilometres-and they reach a depth of some 15 metres. They have aptly been described as wall of death. The threat they post to southern Pacific fish stocks and other marine species has been compounded by the massive increases in the number of fishing vessels from Japan and Taiwan using driftnets. The scientific evidence available to us at the Forum indicates that the present indiscriminate use of driftnets threatens the very existence of the southern Pacific tuna fishery, and therefore, the very livelihood of the people who depend so very deeply upon its existence .. The Tarawa DeclarationÂ· seeks to ban pelagic drift net fishing from the region and it calls for a meeting of regional experts to develop a convention to achieve this objective. This meeting will be hosted by New Zealand. The conclusion of a convention of this nature, of course, raises complex legal and related issues. To be effective on the high seas, it will require the support, or at least the concurrence, of the major fishing nations. The gravity of the threat requires urgent action; and Australia readily accepts its responsibility to take a lead in advancing this important objective of the Forum. It was with that responsibility in mind that I had already raised this matter in the United States and Europe, as part of Australia's efforts eventually to secure a worldwide ban on this fishing technique. At the Tarawa Forum, members also expressed concern about the possible effects on island countries of rising sea levels resulting from global warming-the 'greenhouse effect'. Forum members welcomed my reaffirmation of Australia's decision to fund a project to establish a network of regional monitoring stations. The information these stations will provide on trends and fluctuations in climate and sea levels will provide an accurate data base on climatic change within the region. It is quite clear, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this project will require a long term commitment on our part if it is to produce worthwhile data; and I was pleased to be able to offer firmly such a commitment to Forum members. Other issues addressed at the 1989 Forum included the situation in New Caledonia, and administrative and program issues arising in the Forum Secretariat and regional bodies associated with the Forum. The Forum welcomed the positive measures being pursued by the French Government in New Caledonia to promote political, economic and social development in the territory, and urged all parties to continue to work towards the successful implementation of the agreements concluded in Paris in June and August of 1988. Mr Deputy Speaker, it is particularly pleasing to note that, even with the growth in Forum membership and the growing complexity of its affairs over the last 20 years, we still meet-in the words of the 1971 Communique-'as neighbours and partners' with great informality and with a great degree of consensus. I am confident that the South Pacific Forum will acquire further standing and authority as the pre-eminent regional organisation in the years ahead. And I am equally confident the Forum will enhance its special-indeed its unique-character and significance as a gathering of neighbours and of partners in the South Pacific. The new arrangement for a post-Forum dialogue between Forum members and important outside countries with interests in the region-Canada, France, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United Stateswhich was initiated on this occasion in Kiribati, will obviously strengthen this development. Let me conclude, Mr Deputy Speaker, by saying that far beyond the South Pacific, and far beyond our own great region, Australia's reputation as a good neighbour and as a world partner in the cause of peace, progress and freedom has never stood higher than it does today. I am convinced that in this cause-despite all the tragedies, the perplexities and the complexities besetting our agewe can now enter a more hopeful period than any that we have experienced since the end of the Second World War. These visits which I have been privileged to undertake on behalf of the Australian people have reinforcedÂ· that fundamental conviction. EmptyHere Opposition)-by leave- Mr Deputy Speaker, as a medium-sized and geographically isolated power, we are quite rightly concerned with promoting our own interests in a very competitive world. As such, the continued practice of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) of reporting to the Parliament on his overseas visits is welcomed, but with the observation that the reality of international politics today is still a very complex power game played out at different levels and not just involving personalities. It is also axiomatic but ignored by the Prime Minister that as our economy deteriorates and our overseas debt mounts the less influence Australia has internationally. The Prime Minister has failed to understand that vital linkage: the threat to Australian sovereignty comes from within through our vulnerable economy. The coalition naturally endorses the Prime Minister's comments on the relationship between Australia and the United States of America. It is based on the firmest of foundations: a shared commitment to democracy and to individual liberty within the rule of law. But despite Secretary of State Baker giving his imprimatur, as mentioned by the Prime Minister, to the concept of an Asia Pacific forum, an Asia-Pacific regional economic cooperation group, the reality is that significant differences have emerged between how the United States and the Hawke Governmentsee such a forum operating. The Prime Minister takes credit for a forum that is still very much an evolving concept. In the six months since the Prime Minister announced his so-called new initiative for greater regional economic cooperation, major diplomatic efforts have been required just to patch up, control damage and keep the proposal afloat. To ensure the success of a regional arrangement, the Prime Minister should have ensured that the announcement of the proposal had been preceded by some quiet and solid diplomacy, consulted the United States and Japan in advance of announcing the proposal, spelt out clearly what Australia wanted from the proposal and acknowledged that the loose concept he talked of had been on the international agenda for a long while. The Prime Minister refers to it as his initiative. It is interesting. It was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s. It was, of course, carried through by Prime Minister Fraser and me as Foreign Minister in the 1970s and was the stuff of a communique between Prime Minister Ohira and Fraser at the end of the 1970s. So much for the Hawke initiative. Mr Downer-It was part of our policy in 1984. EmptyHere our policy in 1984. But instead of going through the matter thoroughly and constructively, there has been a damaging public dispute over who should be members of such a forum. The United States, initially ignored as a member by the Hawke Government is now in. China-not originally intended-was subsequently included, only to be excluded again by the Prime Minister following the Tiananmen Square massacre. Now Secretary of State Baker has stated that any future Pacific economic cooperation would have to include China. As the coalition has consistently stated, there are three key principles for realistic progress towards a Pacific economic group: first, an agreement by those who wish to become involved not to increase protection against each other; second, an agreement to work steadily over the medium-to long-term to eliminate protection within each member nation; and, third, anti-dumping rules for all trade including agriculture. If all we are getting is an information exchange body or an expensive bureaucracy such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, this will be insufficient to meet the needs of Australia. The early suspicions raised by the Opposition on the Hawke proposal remain. Let me reiterate that, whilst we support an information exchange body, it cannot be an end in itself as it is as proposed by the current Prime Minister. We must press for a more effective body-a body that embraces the sorts of precepts I have just mentioned. That we will do in government. To put an information exchange body in place is helpful but it is not in itself enough. We will move beyond that into the areas with the sorts of precepts that I have mentioned. Turning to China, for all of the Prime Minister's talk on China, conflicting signals continue to be sent by his Government to the Chinese authorities. While not questioning the depth of his personal anguish, the fact remains that other countries haveÂ· responded more effectively to events in China than has this Government. The Prime Minister stakes his considerable personal prestige in his dealings with the Chinese since 1983. He now takes no responsibility for the tenuousness and the false optimism of those assessments. While remaining supportive of China in its path of modernisation, we should, in concert with other Western democracies, have sent a clear signal to the Chinese Government that universally accepted standards of human rights must be upheld. Those signals have not been sent. Shortly after the Government came into office,Â· much was made of the fact that it created a human rights section within the then Department of Foreign Affairs and that it had opened an official human rights register to record and track individual cases of abuse. Now we have the spectacle of the Hawke Government refusing even to process further applications for refugee status from Chinese students. An official immigration spokesman confirmed this week that students were 'being discouraged from applying'. Other countries have been similarly repelled by the killings, humiliation and execution of so many young people by the Chinese Government. Like Australia, they do not wish to see their .long term relations with China jeopardised but unlike Australia they have responded much more effectively than the Hawke Government. Canada, for instance, recalled its ambassador for consultations. Japan, for instance, suspended consideration of its next five-year loan package. The European Community at the Madrid summit Council of Heads of Government banned arms sales, shelved new loan guarantees and World Bank Credits and suspended new corporation projects. Despite repeated coalition calls, the Hawke Government did not seek to involve itself in a coordinated Western response to the tragedy. We did not suspend any aid programs until 13 July or recall our Ambassador. The Prime Minister must by now have learnt that international relations must have greater substance that the mere personal relationships between heads of state or heads of government. I turn to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. The Prime Minister glosses over his repeated failure-this time in Washington-to get the United States to sign the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. The fact is that the treaty has undermined the Western alliance, diminished regional stability and is unnecessarily restrictive on Australia's future options. The United States' refusal to sign is based on these recognitions and the fact that sections of the treaty are potentially in conflict with the ANZUS Treaty. The Prime Minister made reference today to his visit to Hungary. Like Cleopatra in her barge, we had the sight of our Prime Minister sailing down the Danube proclaiming that the world 'was at a turning point in history'. Developments in China might have tempered a more cautious welcoming of such developments. Nevertheless, the changes are significant and, of course, are welcomed by the Opposition. However, the Prime Minister may at least have acknowledged that such changes and such moves that are occurring demonstrate the failure of communist ideology and the triumph of liberal democratic philosophy. Major changes are clearly under way in both Hungary and Poland-changes made possible by Gorbachev's renunciation of the so-called Brezhnev doctrine that enslaved Eastern Europe to rigid Soviet-controlled communist orthodoxy. Today's news of Lech Walesa's expected nomination to the prime ministership of Poland is in itself a remarkable indication of the potential these political shifts portend. However, the Prime Minister neglected to mention that these changes are by no means spreading throughout all of European Europe. Whilst he waxed lyrical in Budapest, President Ceausescu of Romania continues systematically to wipe out the cultural heritage of the Hungarian population living in Romania. The Prime Minister's belief that the new democratic process emerging in Hungary will automatically flow through to other Eastern European nations is not borne out in fact. What of Czechoslovakia? What of East Germany? What of the mass expulsions of the Turkish population by Bulgaria? Turning to Germany, I welcomed the Prime Minister's inclusion of the Federal public of Germany in his trip, the FRG being the world's largest exporter, a key member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and a key player in East-West relations. Although at opposite ends of the world, both Australia and the Federal Republic of Germany are federal democracies and important members of the Western alliance. I endorse the Prime Minister's call for greater contact between the respective business communities and the potential for the development of a more dynamic relationship. AndÂ· I support the Prime Minister's calls in Bonn, in Paris and in London that Australia welcomes the single European market of 1992 so long as it is a free and fair marketplace for all. Additionally, we call for a coordinated response by various relevant agencies of government on how best to prepare Australia for 1992. To date the Government has failed to provide such a strategic response. I turn to the United Kingdom. The bilateral relationship is now based on much more than sentimentality. There is a clear recognition that Britain and Australia will be more important to each other in the future. Beyond those great institutions that we took from the British, the most enduring aspect of our relationship now are the social and human bonds between our two countries. Since the Second World War the United Kingdom and Ireland have provided the majority of migrants to Australia. Between 1945 and 1986 they provided 41 per cent of all our migrants and, although the percentage of settler arrivals has now declined relative to other sources, they still constitute the largest single source of migrants. Sixteen per cent of our population, or 2.5 million people, are first or second generation British migrants. We express the hope that as the United Kingdom moves towards further European integration the deleterious effects on our trade of the common agricultural policy are not only not magnified but tackled in a way that is fair to all. The European Community constitutes one of Australia's three most important trading partners. Moreover, the European Community provides one-third of net foreign investment in Australia. It is in this context that the Single European Act gains its great significance for us. It provides Re- both opportunities and problems. The danger is that the European Community's commitment to internal free trade might not be matched by similar commitments to global free trade. We, of course, welcome the fact that exports in each direction grew by 13 per cent last year. There has been an especially strong growth in British investment in Australia, whilst ours in Britain last year grew by a considerable 60 per cent. It is vital that the European Community from 1992 should not just become a protectionist cartel. International free trade is in the long term free interests of the European Community itself and recognition of this by the United Kingdom can only enhance the traditional relationship between us and give the relationship a new relevance well into the twentyfirst century. The Prime Minister mentioned today in his overview his visit to France. We welcome the improved relationship with France and in particular the acceleration of the economic and trading relationship which until now has been relatively minimal. We welcome the Prime Minister's visit to the Australian War Memorial in France commemorating and recalling the thousands of Australians who were killed in that country in the First World War, including, I may say, my own grandfather. Regarding the reference to the so-called Australian-French plan to protect the Antarctic as a world wilderness park, we happen to disagree with what the Prime Minister is doing in this arena. It ought to be remembered that it was the coalition that first took the initiative in recommending that we do not sign the Antarctic Minerals Convention. Instead of the pursuit of a world park, we favour an Antarctic Treaty marine park which is more readily put in place than a park to which we seek to have the entire international community subscribe. We think that, more realistically, the proposal ought to be adopted by the Antarctic Treaty partners first of all to lock it in place. That is the constructive first step that ought to be taken. The reality is that both the Government and the Opposition share the objective of ensuring that there is no mining in the Antarctic. We were the first to determine this attitude. The political reality is that the Government responded to our initiative. We would suggest, therefore, that the Antarctic Treaty park proposal be followed as we can lock that into place more readily than the wider proposal at this stage. We endorse the approach of the French Government to New Caledonia as embodied in the Matignon Accord and we praise the wisdom exercised by both French and Kanak leaders, in particular the late Jean-Marie Tjibaou, in their recognition that the Kanak population is in urgent need of training in areas of bureaucracy, areas of education and technical and professional areas in order that there be a body of capable Kanak people ready to assume positions of authority and responsibility in whatever constitutional position is adopted in the next decade. We regret that the Australian Government, under this Prime Minister, played no part in seeking to bring the parties in New Caledonia together to build confidence, which might have allowed such an agreement as the Matignon Accord at an earlier date. Whilst welcoming the Prime Minister's much belated offer for Australia to assist the French in various training programs, we stress that, as in so many areas, such positive contributions have been a long time coming. Furthermore, we cautiously welcome the French decision, announced this week, to reduce the number of nuclear test explosions in the Pacific. But I reiterate what I take to be the bipartisan opposition to any nuclear testing in the Pacific. The South Pacific Forum: the Prime Minister of course attended the Forum. The south-west Pacific is an area of enormous political, economic and strategic importance to Australia, yet it is a region foisted onto the Prime Minister's agenda only by comparatively recent volatility and instability. The Prime Minister paints himself either as an expert on or as being extremely familiar with the South Pacific and somewhat in touch with its disparate aspirations. At the Prime Minister's, press conference at the conclusion of the recent Forum, the Prime Minister said that he saw 'a new maturity' in the Forum meetings. Such patronising remarks reflect more on his own immaturity to the region itself. The Prime Minister assures the House that he returns bathed in glory and that Australia's interests at the Forum were securely advanced. As always, he does not let facts get in the way of his self-professed triumphs. He had a Foreign Minister who, in five years of peripatetic travel, visited the South Pacific region only once, and then not until three years into the, portfolio. It was obvious why the new Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), as a reaction to some pressure from this side of the House, chose to make an early visit. Senator Evans stated on his return from that trip to the South Pacific that the most striking aspect of his visit was his surprise at the differences between the Melanesian and Polynesian countries of the region. As one journalist wrote, one could not imagine a new British Foreign Secretary stating that he was struck with the differences between Greeks and Italians. It reflects and incredible naivety on the part of the Government, which has had over six years to get its act toward the region together. The fact is that Australia's influence in the region is on the wane, reflected by an increase in United States Embassy personnel in various island states and by Papua New Guinea's ambivalence to the reliability of this Government. On the specifics of this Forum: we endorse the Tarawa Declaration aimed at banning driftnet fishing in the South Pacific. The environmental concerns that lie behind this ban, that is, the potential exhaustion of the South Pacific tuna fisheries within two years if the present rates of fishing continue, simply cannot be neglected. There is no doubt that driftnet fishing is a destructive technique that could exhaust the national income of many of the island states. The Prime Minister has failed, however, to indicate to us how Japan and Taiwan will be convinced of the need to stop driftnet fishing. We hope that endeavours will be made to persuade them to that view, and we awaithisÂ·further advice. I turn to other subjects touched upon by the Prime Minister.Â· He referred in his speech to the continuing tragedy in the Lebanon. Only this morning the coalition gave notice of motion in the Senate calling on the Government to fully support yesterday's resolution by the United Nations Security Council calling for an immediate and total ceasefire and seeking a renewal of efforts by the .Arab League to bring about the conditions for a peaceful and unified Lebanon. The Prime Minister also referred to the chemical weapons issue and his continued discussions on this vital subject. The coalition, of course, supports any contribution Australia can make to a comprehensive chemical weapons convention. This is not the time to catalogue the Government's full foreign policy failings. Suffice to say that the shortcomings are many: for example, a totally confused relationship with the South Pacific; major intelligence failings on three vital issues pertaining to Australia, China, the Philippines, and Fiji; a complete failure to influence its fraternal colleagues in New Zealand over ANZUS; and its unilatReport relating to the program of business Pursuant to sessional order 28D, the Selection business listed below to be accorded priority on the allotment of time determined by the Committee eral reduction in aid to Papua New Guinea in 1986, which has left heavy scars. This Government will be remembered for its lack of clear foreign policy goals and priorities. There has been only one attempted comprehensive foreign policy statement delivered to this House in six years, in 1985-one attempt at a comprehensive foreign policy statement in six years. That was in 1985, and it made little mention of economic and trade considerations in this arena. The Prime Minister seems to view the essence of foreign policy as being that he gets on well with or is well regarded by other leaders. He thinks that is sufficient. Firstly, it is well known that this is not sufficient. Secondly, it is well known that the global pressures and strengths within the international community have to be weighed up and the pursuit of Australian foreign policy in its own national interest has to be paramount in one's consideration. But if the Prime Minister believes-as he does-that close personal relationships are the be-aU and end-all, I trust when he next sees the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom he will at least get her name right. The Government lacks a central purpose to its foreign policy. It has no conceptual framework. Being well regarded by a few is hardly the stuff of effective policy. But at root that is about all this tired Government aims for. It lacks a purpose; it lacks a framework; it lacks a policy; and as a consequence Australian influence is reduced to near zeroso much for an influential medium-sized power. NA",189

160,Mr TUCKEY ,HOMEOWNERS,"O'Connor) (3.43)-ln June of 1989 the Government, along with the community of Australia, received the usual Statements upon presentation Report [The Selection Committee has determined that statements on the report may be made-all statements to be made within a total time of 30 minutes.] Time allotted 40 minutes its contribution to development of the existing Australian Public Service (APS) which has been variously described in Public Service Commission reports as ""toxic, fearbased, pathological, repressive, reactive, paternalistic and neurotic"" to the extent that some APS departments are seen as presenting the same disorder symptoms which individuals present; manner in which Parliament seeks to maintain probity and public accountability is too often characterised by the use of its powers to seek punishment of those who are seen to have made mistakes, regardless of any consideration of risks involved, rather than to acknowledge and reward success; approach is at variance with contemporary personnel management practices; and efforts currently being made to implement in the public sector and resolves to follow that lead by hencewith adopting a co-operative and constructive approach to its management of the Australian Public Service.

(Notice given 16 August 1989.) of the joint select committee report any remaining private Members' violent videos. (Notice given 5 April business time of this matter should continue on a future day quarterly home loan affordability study. It is presented by very authoritative organisations, the Real Estate Institute of Australia and the home mortgage insurer, MGICA Ltd. On the front page of that document are the words 'First-home buyers excluded from markets'. It states: Rising interest rates and higher property prices caused home loan affordability to again deteriorate in all Australian states in the March quarter compared to the December quarter 1988. With ratios of home loan repayments to family income now exceeding the 25 per cent affordability benchmark in all states except Tasmania, average income buyers seeking median priced homes have been squeezed out of major capital city markets. The afford ability ratios in all states are at all-time highs since records began in 1980, and for the first time the ratio for New South Wales has gone beyond 40 per cent. In fact, the attached table tells us that for the March quarter 1989 New South Wales had a home affordability rate of 4Ll per cent, Victoria 34.2 per cent, Queensland 29.7 per cent, South Australia 30.8 per cent, Western Australia 27.9 per cent and Tasmania, as mentioned, 24.9 per cent. Australia had an average of 33.6 per cent, up from 27 per cent in the same quarter of 1988. That is a pretty damning indictment of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke). When he started ticking off all his perceived successes, based on his personal intellect, apparently, he left that one out. He did not bother to tell us about how things were going in the housing market. But what is more, and in support of my letter to Madam Speaker, Sir, if you want some evidence of the callous disregard of this Government for this situation, which was brought to its attention in June, three months before it delivered the Budget this week, let us have a look at what it thought it might do in that Budget. For mortgage relief assistance it allocated $15m. It just so happens that there are 1.8 million home mortgage holders in Australia, and approximately 1.3 million of them have flexible interest rate arrangements. If we divide those 1.3 million mortgage holders into that $15m, they will get $8.66 each, as a one off, and we can imagine just how much help that would be! Of course the Government does not see it that way. There is another amount of money, $30m-odd, that the Minister for Housing and Aged Care ( Mr Staples) might want to refer to-it was in the previous Budget-but that was for mortgage and rent relief. We do not know how much has gone in the past either way but the additional commitment to alleviating the disaster of its high interest rate policies and its high inflation rate policies is $8.66 per mortgage holder. That would be bad enough, but on page 16 of the speech of the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) he brought forward some very appalling information for the future of those same home owners. For instance he said: . . . . the CPI is expected to be little changed at around 7t per cent for the year as a whole . . . That is double, treble, four times international comparisons which, of course, our Treasurer never bothers to make. His comparisons are always about his debt inflated gross domestic product (GDP).He went on to say, and this is an interesting little bit of Keatirtgism: Even sohe was talking about our current account deficitfor the full year the current account deficit is forecast to be equivalent to about 5 per cent of GOP . . . Of course, when we go through the Budget Papers we find that means $18,500m. Why did the Treasurer not bother to use that particular figure? Why did he come up, as he always does, with something that is meant to look twice as good? Then he went on to say: But to stabilise our international debt the current account deficit will have to continue to be reduced. The book tells us nothing how that might be achieved but he says it must be reduced. He makes us this promise: The full force of this Government's resolve will be directed to this end. That is very encouraging to me from the union bureaucrat who came into this place at 24 and has never demonstrated a skill for anything else but talk and a foul mouth. That is his promise. I doubt it. Then, of course, came the coup de grace: However, I stress that rates cannot and should not fall until it is economically responsible. And: This Government is not prepared to countenance a premature fall in interest rates. That is a clear message to the home owners of Australia that there will be more of the same. There it is in writing, in the Treasurer's own words-continuing high inflation, a disastrous current account deficit and a promise that until they are corrected interest rates will stay at the disastrous levels that are destroying the home ownership prospects of many Australians as is clearly defined in this independent and authoritative document. There is no hope, no nothing, it is all there in the Treasurer's own words and one does not have to be Albert Einstein to work it out. It is a disgrace and it is callous disregard. On a previous occasion, and as a consequence of the claims being made at that time by the Government about how helpful the wage-tax trade-off might be in terms of this particular problem for home mortgagees, I asked a question of the Minister, who may deign to give us a response shortly. I hope he has something to say about how he is truly going to help these people. When I asked him, 'How much do you expect people will have to take out of their own pockets?', he said, 'I am the. Minister for Housing; I am not supposed to know that. Ask the Acting Treasurer'. What callous disregard! He did not even have the time to ask his Department, 'How badly are the people whom I am sworn to represent suffering? What about telling me?'. Not one word; he did not know. He thought it was someone else's job. Let us look at this Budget. It looks pretty good on the surface when we talk about home ownership, because the allocation to housing is $1,440.2m. But it is 1.6 per cent of total outlays. When we look at the home owner section, we find an entirely different situation. I have already mentioned $15m in mortgage relief. The only other significant contribution to home ownership-which, I might add, used to consume 40 per cent of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement back in 1978-79 and which is now down to 12 per cent-is the first 'home owners scheme, introduced some time ago to good effect. It helped a lot of people to get into homes, some of whom are cursing this Government today for giving them the opportunity because of the interest rate regime that they have been trapped into after this particular. situation. Nevertheless, it started off as a good scheme. What has the Government done in this Budget? It has taken it down by $30m-a 17 per cent cut. It is worse than that because, in fact, the Government tells us that it does not expect anywhere near the level of applications that it has had previously. That is not surprising, because when we get down to the situation as it exists today, because of the information contained in this home loan affordability study, the grant is worthless. The Government refuses; it had the opportunity; it had the submissions from the Housing Industry Association which said, 'Nobody who earns as little as you do as a ceiling can any longer afford a house under the high interest and high inflation policies'. The income limits under the scheme, if one wants full payment, are $26,000 of family income per annum, phasing out to $34,000 per annum. Lending institutions traditionally say that home repayments should not exceed 30 per cent of family income. Of course, in today's marketplace, on that criteria, one can borrow only $45,000. Take it from me-that makes a very small contribution to a home with a medium value of $135,000. In other words, the Government is paying lip service to first home ownership. Its Budget indicates that in two ways: it knows that there will be fewer claims. It knows that it has become fraudulent and it fails to add the necessary $10,000 a year to income levels which were recommended by the Housing Industry Association in a well documented case. It had this information from the afford ability study in June. It knew the disaster that was happening out there. It knows that people are now making a judgment between a family and a home-and it is just not interested. I guess that this Minister, considering his connections with the left wing faction, is going to tell us-which is quite true-about all the money the Government is putting into public housing. There are two problems about that: firstly, we know that the community is better served and we know that government, in terms of long term costs, welfare costs and retirement costs, is better served by home ownership. But that is not the belief of this Minister, and obviously now of the Government. Their belief is simply that a home is something one occupies for a lifetime, one is kicked out of and someone else takes over. For all the talk we have heard here today, the Government does not support the principle of home ownership and is backing away from it with its assistance schemes. The Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, as it is being renegotiated, moves almost entirely away from home ownership. We are talking about an amount of $894.1m and not a penny of it, according to the Budget Papers, is allocated in any significant way to home ownership. Look at what has happened to home owners. Eighteen months ago-just that long ago-13.5 per cent interest prevailed and 300 repayments for a median-type, $70,000, loan represented $818 a month. Today, at 17 per cent, one needs $1,007 a month, an increase of $189 a month. But in the first three months of 1989 those costs went up by $56 a month and median family income went up by $16 a month. Where do honourable members think those families will find the $40? They will not get it from the Government. In the best case scenario, the Government gave them $30. For many it was much less than that. Let me tell the Minister how they have got that money. They have bought worse clothes for their kids. If any Government members had gone to one of the mortgage action and other campaign meetings, as I have, they would have heard these stories. One fellow stood up and said, 'I thought this program was to stop importing'. He said, 'I can no longer afford to buy my kids Australian clothing. I've got to buy clothes made in Taiwan-it's all I can afford after I've paid my mortgage'. Other people spoke of the reductions they have made in even feeding and educating their children. People such as delicatessen operators in smaller shopping centres who sell small amounts of luxury food items have reported that their turnovers are falling. That is the message; that is the indictment. That is the evidence of the Minister's callous disregard. It is the evidence of his failure to get moneyÂ· for home-owners out of the Budget. Apparently he succumbed to the bullying of our Treasurer ( Mr Keating). Of course, he will use the Goebbels technique. He will tell us a few fibs. He will tell us some things that go on-MONICA",197

166,Mr STAPLES ,HOMEOWNERS,"Jagajaga-Minister for Housing and Aged Care) (3.58)-The honourable member for O'Connor ( Mr Tuckey) should be the last person to come in here and talk about fibs, considering his record in respect of the leadership of the Liberal Party of Australia. We have just had a very interesting exposition from the honourable member for O'Connor who is, I think, the sixth Oppositiol). shadow housing Minister. Again, we failed to hear anything from the Opposition. Perhaps we will hear it tonight in the big expose, the big presentation, of the alternative government of this country. But I doubt it because the Opposition does not have a housing policy. A number of ideas have been floated around in an Opposition document but it does not have a housing policy. The Opposition does not have an economic policy-we are not going to hear that until the next election is called. It does not have a tax policy, a wages policy or an industry policy and clearly it does not have a housing policy. The first lesson that the Opposition must learn if it is to get anything out of tonightand I doubt this will happen-is that Australians are not stupid, that they are not going to believe in any quick fixes to solve any real problems. They certainly will not accept cheap dodgy deals from snake-oil merchants. The honourable member for O'Connor came in here today and criticised the Government for not having provided mortgage relief in the Budget. I am a bit unsure about what that really means because a couple of weeks ago his leader, the honourable member for EmptyHere as rejecting any cheap political ploys such as mortgage interest relief, which he regarded as just embroidery on the fabric of economic policy. He agreed with the direction taken by the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) and the Government. He abandoned a commitment he made on 11 July to a coalition policy on mortgage relief, saying that he now has no plans for any such measures. He dropped the South Australian Opposition Leader in a mess, too. He pulled the pin on him. He pulled the rug from under his feet, trying to score some points against the excellent economic and housing record of the South Australian Government. The honourable member for Kooyong, the Leader of the Opposition, said that it was not his intention to take the issue of mortgage relief any further than concentrating on the central elements of the Opposition's alternative economic strategy. We are yet to hear that and, according to the Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Richmond ( Mr Blunt), the other day, we will not hear it until the election is called. So we have a condemnation of the Government from this side today and a call for mortgage relief, yet the Liberal Party Leader said a couple of weeks ago that there should not. Maybe we will get the real answer tonight. The problem is that not only does the Opposition not have an economic or housing policy but also it has no idea of the complexity of housing policy. It concentrates simply and solely-according to its blinkered ideological position-on home ownership, not realising for one moment that three elements of policy must come together to form a cohesive housing policy: home ownership, the private rental market and the public rental market. Let us look at the differences in the record of this Government, compared to the alternative, in regard to home ownership. In 1982-83, 234,000 households took out home loans, to a value of $7.l billion. Last year, 1988-89, when one would have expected, if listened to the Opposition to have seen a fall-off in home purchases because of decreasing affordability, 353,000 Australian households undertook home purchases-to the value of $22.5 billion. That shows a couple of things but, most importantly, it shows that Australians still have access to home ownership. That figure is matched by the fact that 72.8 per cent of the population now either own or are purchasing their own homes. That is a significant increase on the 1981-82 level of home ownership and purchase. What is important is that more houses are now being built. What ultimately determines the ability of a person to afford a home is the price of the home-in other words, the size of the loan, not only the cost of the loan in terms of interest rates. Houses must be built. When Opposition members left government with their tails between their legs back in 1983, what was the industry situation? They were not getting any support from the Housing Industry Association (HIA). There were 105,000 starts. People were being squeezed out of the private rental market, with no hope of getting anywhere near home ownership. In the five-year period from 1977-78 to 1982-83, the Opposition with its great economic policies, which the millions of unemployed will well remember, was able to build only 758,000 houses. In the five years from 1983-84 to 1988-89, this Government, with a strengthened economy, with increased employment and with our present industry strength, reached a level of 174,000 starts last year. In that time we have built 851,000 houses-an extra 100,000 houses. An extra 100,000 Australian families had access to home ownership in that period. That is the difference. There are now 1.5 million more people out there with jobs, compared to the situation when we came to office. They now enjoy the security of that employment for the long term. They know that this economy will grow, giving them security of employment, security of tenure. We have built a record number of houses. We have helped a record number of Australian families into home ownership. We have done it in two ways: we have built up the economy and the housing sector right across the board. The honourable member for O'Connor, I assume, congratulated the Government for its first home owners scheme. Well over 340,000 families have been assisted by that scheme. This year an extra 40,000 people will come into the scheme. Over 250,000 Australian families and households will get assistance under the first home owners scheme this year. The honourable member is fond of talking about the dead hand of socialism. We hear his parrying about left wing ideologies and all the rest of it. I invite him to have a look at the most recent report presented under the Housing Assistance Act 1987-88. If he does not want to read right through it, he should turn to the back pages because there are some interesting figures there. He will see in that not only that the States have failed to put in real dollars throughout the last years of the agreement compared to the Commonwealth but also the incredible viability of the home purchase assistance schemes that operate under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. The Opposition is continually very keen to paint the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement simply and solely as public rental accommodation. The housing Minister in Queensland says that it is for people who are the worse cases. That is how the Queensland Minister refers to public housing tenants. We support public accommodation and public housing because it is a very important avenue of providing home ownership assistance to people. Compared with the type of Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement that the Opposition would run and the inefficiencies it would contain, we can show that in the next four years there will be 200,000 home loans under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. In addition, more people will have access to public housing through the subsidised rents and far greater and faster access to home ownership than they would have under the Opposition's policies, any Commonwealth State housing agreement or, for that matter, any economic policy that it would have. That is a doubling of the number of loans that are currently available and a far greater increase in the number that the Opposition provided when it was in Government. There is very little credibility in the Opposition's economic policy, mainly because there is not one. Tonight, again, I hope that we will hear something that is not contradictory-something more constructive than what we have heard here today. The Government clearly recognises that there are many people out there who are in considerable difficulty and who are having great problems meeting the levels of interest rates and paying the prices for houses in order to obtain home ownership. For that reason, apart from the extra money that did go into the mortgage and rent relief scheme as announced at the May Premiers Conference, the Government did put an extra $15m into the mortgage and rent relief scheme. It does not have to be matched by the States but it will be operated through the States to the best advantage of each State. It is not every person in Australia who requires mortgage and rent relief assistance. The Opposition failed to understand the economic situation in Australia. In failing to understand it, it has no concept of what it would do. What. this Government has done is to take the hard decision because it is the one for the long term and the one for greater stability. That is what people want. They want stability and security and they will not get it from those opposite. That $15m will go a long way to helping those people who are most in trouble. The people most in trouble, Mr Deputy Speaker, are those people who bought at the height of the market in 1988 and were then hurt again by the increased interest rates. I would expect many thousands of people right around Australia to gain assistance as a point of last resort after other avenues that are available to them have been exhausted. There will be many opportunities for people to get real assistance under this scheme-not the $8 which the honourable member for O'Connor talks about, but real assistance to help them. What it comes down to is that the real assistance and the real opportunity that people need is to have jobs, to have security in those jobs, to have child-care available to them and to have incomes that will not be taken away by strikes so that they can have security for the future. The way we get security in housing is to get house prices down. None of the talk that has come from the Opposition has addressed housing supply. Does the Opposition think it all takes care of itself? It does not. We have an ageing population. We have a continuing migration intake for a variety of very. important reasons. It is very important in Australia that we increase the level of supply of houses and that people have access to appropriate housing. That is what the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement is about. That is what the initiatives the Commonwealth has undertaken are about-to increase the supply of housing. If we do not do that, because of our ageing population and the demand in Australia for houses, the prices will rise. It is not only interest rates that hurt people; it is the price of houses. Interest rates will fluctuate with time, but the size of a mortgage, once it is taken out, is there for a person for the life of the loan until he pays it off. An extra $10,000 or $20,000 around a person's neck stays there. That is a lot of money to pay off over the life of any loan, and what we have to do is to bring those prices down. In Sydney in the last quarter a decline in house prices was quite clearly showing. That is critical, both in terms of accessibility and continuing affordability of security of Australians for the future. The Opposition's policy is irrelevant. It has six little ideas here that no-one seems to know about. It has had many shadow. hclUsing Ministers but no economic or wages policy. Tonight might be the night. But this Government's commitment in housing stands on its record and the people who really need the support will get the support to maintain their homes, their dreams, and those who come after them in moving into home ownership will have the assistance of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, rent assistance and the home purchase arrangements that operate under the Commonwealth-State HousiQg Agreement as well as the first home owners scheme.",200
167,Mr HICKS ,HOMEOWNERS,"Riverina-Darling) (4.13)-1t is with a great deal of sadness that I stand to second the matter of public importance moved by my colleague the honourable member for O'Connor ( Mr Tuckey). I am sad because of the implications of the matter of public importance that is entitled 'The Government's callous disregard for the plight of Australian home owners'. To say the Government is callous in its disregard for lian home owners, or would be home owners, is to understate the situation. I noticed earlier that the Minister for Housing and Aged Care ( Mr Staples) had a few words to say about the lack of policy of the coalition in regard to housing. I have a copy of the housing policy of the coalition if the Minister would like to look at it and we have a special statement on the revamping of the first home owner's scheme. Unfortunately, it seems to be a trend of the Government that if it repeats untruths often enough in a Goebbels-like manner, the population will eventually believe it. I think that is dangerous for theÂ· Government and dangerous for the people of Australia. The Minister talked about the housing policy of the Fraser Government. Honourable members must remember that we had one of the most terrible droughts in our history pn that occasion. There was world recession, but worse than that we were trying to get over the excesses of the Whitlam Government. This nation has still not got over those excesses. The Fraser Government tried to stem them to some extent but with the Hawke Government I am afraid we have gone further down the chute. Even allowing for that the ratio of houseS to people in the Fraser Administration was much higher that it is today. The population of Australia has increased by 1.5 million and the ratio has slipped dramatically. The honourable member for O'Connor has very ably pointed out what the policies of this Government have done to existing home owners, as well as the detrimental effect those policies are having on prospective home owners. As my colleague mentioned in his speech, the recently announced Budget has in real terms reduced overall expenditure on housing. Not unexpected, however, is that under welfare allocations accommodation assistance has been increased by 59 per cent. This is mainly for crisis accommodation, whereas $15m only has been provided for mortgage relief payments. This continues the Government's drift towards more government rental accommodation, w-ich has doubled from 11 per cent to 21.5 cent of the established housing market. What about the first home owners scheme? It has been slashed by $30m-from $176m Austra- to $147m-showing that demand has dramatically reduced. This is a clear admission that the program is no longer working as a result of the Government's refusal to alleviate the income eligibility levels. It isÂ· a simple fact that those whose incomes qualify them for a first home owners grant simply lack the income to raise the necessary loan to buy any form of accommodation. In the recent Budget it was announced that, under a comprehensive package of $ 100m, secure accommodation would be provided for an additional 6,000 homeless young people over the next four years; I ask the Government these questions: Why is there a reduction in real terms in overall spending on housing? Why is it deemed necessary to provide a doubling of government rental accommodation? Why has there had to be an increase of $51m for crisis accommodation? Why do we need to provide accommodation for 6,000 homeless youths? Why is it that every second young person 1 speak to is a social worker or training to be a social worker, instead of taking on engineering or science degrees? It is simply because of the lack of fortitude by this Government to take the hard decisions to stop the general decline in the standard of living of Australian families. Its policies are resulting in the need for ever increasing social welfare expenditure because of family breakdown caused by the economic pressures being applied on them by this Government's economic inaction. A good example was given to me, the other day when 1 was in Sydney, in relation to the Government's high taxing interest rate regime. 1 think the story tells it all. 1 spoke to a gentlemanÂ· who was driving a car that picked me up from the airport. Because of the inaction of the Government at the airport and the chaos there, he was fined because he had been there late. He said to me, 'I do not know how I am going to tell my wife about this. This is half the night's earnings gone'. 1 could see he was agitated; I said, 'What is the problem?'. He said, 'We are trying to save to buy a house. 1 start work at 8 o'clock every day, work until 4 o'clock, knock off for an hour and then 1 drive a car until midnight every day, Saturday included, and 1I have half a day offÂ· on, Sunday. I am trying to raise $60,000 for a house. I have had to sell the house 1I have. 1I have moved into a shed. Unless there is something done about these interest rates and inflation, I am afraid my family is going to fall to pieces'. I think that is the situation that is existing in much of Australia today. Surely, this anecdote alone would tell those in the Government that they can no longer be Bollinger socialists, that there is a real world out there, and that people are hurting. But what can we expect from a government that is tired, is out of touch, is lacking' i,n direction and has no answers? As we all know, the latest Budget announcement doesnothing to overcome the main problem- and, apart from giving long overdue assistance to pensioners, does little else but ensure continued high inflation-the deadliest economic enemy to people on fixed incomes-and high interest rates. These interest rates not only affect home owners, of course, but also have a serious detrimental effect on most people with middle or low incomes, particularly those single income families struggling to make ends meet. What about our farmers-those people who have once again over the past several years been trying to make a living, despite ever increasing costs and charges, and at the same time are being asked to contain Australia's overseas debt by being our major export earners? 1 can tell honourable members what is happening to a number of them who could have made a good living under the inflation and interest rates promised by the Treasurer at the Budget before last. What did the Treasurer say in the Budget before last? He said: Our foreign debt burden has already stabilised and begun to fall. Our balance of payments deficit wi\l be halved from its peak of just three years ago. The CPI should be running at 4t per cent by the end of the year. And so on and so on. Who would not make investments in light of those prophecies? But the people who trusted the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) and the Government and made decisions accordingly now find themselves in dire straits. 1 received an urgent telephone call the other day from one of the most capable young farmers in my electorate. He is an astute young man, a good worker with a young family. Like many farmers, he has a mortgage over his property. He is having difficulty in meeting his payments and has just received a letter from his bank which stated, in part: . As no principle reductions are being met, your interest rate has been increased to standard rate (currently 22 per cent). If interest is not met in September we wi\l seriously consider increasing your interest rate to the troublesome rate (currently 25.25 . percent). I know that the Government has been blam< ing the. banks, and per-as the banks have . somethmg to say, but It IS because of the policies of this Government that those rates are what they are. This man will have to walk away from his farm. 1 would like honourable members to keep in mind that, as he walks away from his farm, he will walk away from his house as well. And what about small business-those people who provide most jobs for Australians and for Australian home owners? These people will suffer as a result of the Budget because of reduced community spending power, continuing high interest rates and flation and an additional Government rip-off resulting from the Government's creative proach to existing tax concessions, anserious nounced by the Treasurer on Tuesday Ian evening. Everywhere we look we find addination tional pressures placed on families. For exilies ample, local government is worse off after the Budget announcement. We will that, in the April mini-Budget delivered four months ago, the Treasurer announced that local government funds would be slashed by $17.9m for 1989-90. The recent Budget has revealed that the cutback will be almost twice that amount-$29.3m. This must place greater strain on councils, which will have to cut back on services and reduce staff and, on the other hand, if they are able to, crease rates. Whatever the outcome, it will result in a further decline in the living ards of most Australians and make it even more difficult for home owners. One thing that most Australians admire is honesty. History has proved that we are at own record. our best when we have our backs to the wall and are fighting from a disadvantaged position. That is why I am asking the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and the present urer, soon to be the Leader of the Opposigovernment tion-or perhaps, jUdging by his behaviour in the House today, the shadow Minister couth and culture-to tell us as Australians about the seriousness of our situation instead of beating about the bush. Most Australians know by now that economically this nation is in a precarious situation. We know this Government, with its bad economic management, has got us into terrible difficul1982 ties, with an overseas debt of $110 billion. We know the Government has great diffisition culty in overcoming its nexus with the Auscialist tralian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). We know that it is a tired government withnonsense out direction and without answers. We ask that the Government find some intestinal fortitude somewhere so that it tell the Australian people that because of actions we will all have to tighten our belts. The Government can then use that fortitude to break the nexus with the ACTU so can have a more flexible industrial relations system that will improve our productivity and competitiveness. We can then free up the waterfront and coastal shipping. We can inalso privatise those operations that are best left away from government administration. apAs a result of these moves, we can halt the slide to Third World status or Brazilstatus, as the Treasurer says, that this has started on so that Australian famcan once again look forward to a secure future and a standard of living they would all recall all reasonably aspire to. only . Mr WRIGHT (Capricornia) (4.22)-It is obvious from the wording of the matter of public importance put forward by the honourable member for O'Connor ( Mr Tuckey) that the Opposition wants to get as far away as possible from the economic debate. It is also very clear from the thrust of that matter that those opposite have a very innarrow and myopic approach to the issue of housing. It is also proof of the ignorance of standsome Opposition members about the support schemes that are available to their constituencies in the area of housing. More importantly, it is proof of the very short memories that the Opposition members have of their I would like to make a six-point comparison between the period in which the OppoTreassition Liberals and Nationals were in and the last five or six years of the Hawke Labor Government. Let us look for at housing starts, which is always a good indicator-the number of houses built in one particular period. In 1982-83, under the Liberals and Nationals, 105,020 houses were commenced. In 1988-89 the figure was that 174,000. The figure for total commencements-new houses-in the period 1977 to was 758,264, but under Labor there have been 851,440 commencements. Oppomembers talk about some sort of soideology or ideological position of moving away from home ownership. That is and the facts and figures prove it. In 1981-82, under the so-called private enterprise Liberal-Nationals, 68.2 per cent of Australians owned or were buying their own can homes. What is the figure today? In 1988its 89, it was 72.8 per cent-a significant increase even over last year. Yet we have the nonsense of the Opposition standing up here we and saying we are moving away from home ownership. Look at the home borrowing figures. The Minister for Housing and Aged Care ( Mr Staples) gave us some good figures for the last year under the Liberals and Nationals compared with our record. Let us take a two-year period. In the two-year period in 1981-83 under the Liberals and Nationals 463,220 people had housing loans, compared with 724,700 in the last two years of Labor. Seventy to 80 per cent more people went into home ownership. But there is another side to the housing issue, as the Minister said. I come back to public rental housing. That is another comparison-a six-year comparison. Under the Liberals, there were 194,000 units or stock, compared with 260,000 under Labor. In the next five years it will blowout to 650,000more than three times the figure the Opposition achieved in government. With regard to home ownership, we hear talk about helping low income families. We give an enormous amount of money to the States for this purpose. The number of families helped under the previous Government was 59,000. Under our Government 93,000 families have been helped in the same period of time. The figure for additional rental dwellings was 47,000 under the Liberals and Nationals, and 82,000 under this Government. We can clearly make comparisons. The facts are there. Let us stop all the nonsense about ideological socialism or something, and come back to the facts on housing stock, starts, home ownership, who owns what and who is buying what in this nation. It will be seen that it is the Labor Party under the Hawke Government which is pursuing a proper national strategy for housing and accommodation across this nation. They may have changed now, but those opposite wanted to get rid of the first home owners scheme. It is people like Ian MCLachlan who publicly said, when he was National Farmers Federation leader, 'Get rid of the 13.5 per cent. Get rid of it'. We heard Liberal and National Party members in this House ask our Government when it would remove that ceiling. Why? The banks were saying that was the only way they would get more money to lend. It has been the policy of the Liberal and National parties to get rid of the 13.5 per cent limit. It may not be now, but it was. They may not now want to get rid of the first home owners scheme because they know the value of it, but that was the Opposition's policy. It lives as one of the six or payments. seven policies that the Opposition announced under the 'Barker, O'Connor or Mayo schemes'. It does not matter where one looks. In any comparison it can be seen that our Party is so far ahead it is almost a joke. The Liberals and Nationals say the secret is to hand housing back to the States. They say, 'Hand it all back to the States'. That would be disastrous. I pulled some figures out of the Housing Assistance Act 1984 annual report. Last year the States made $512m profit out of the housing agreement. What are they doing? We gave the Queensland Government money at 4t per cent and it lent it to the people at 14.75 per cent. Now we give it as a gift and it is lending it at 14 and 15 per cent. Is it any wonder that Queensland-let us remember that Queensland is the third largest State-made $153m profit? EvenÂ· Victoria made only $80m, yet Queensland made that sort of profit. Those opposite talk about giving responsibility for housing back to the States. Let us look at what has been contributed. The Commonwealth gave $675 billion to housing compared with $49m by the States. Those opposite want the people to trust them when they say, 'Our policy as Nationals and Liberals, if we ever get back into government, is to let the States do it'. The States have not done it in the past and they will not do it in the future. The only safety for the people of this nation is for the national government under the Labor Party to ensure that these programs continue. We have a program; we have a strategy. Those opposite talk about the Budget and about what has not been done. We have given a record $1.29 billion for direct housing assistance, which is a rise of 35 per cent. There is a restructured Commonwealth State Housing Agreement which will enable 650,000 Australians to be offered public rental housing. Home ownership assistance has increased, enabling 40,000 families to own their own homes. It will cost $146m of taxpayers' money to make sure that people can buy their own homes. Then there is an extra $15m for State mortgage and rental relief schemes. Those opposite reckon the Government is doing nothing for those people who have mortgage problems, who are facing default on their mortgage What this nation has needed and what this Government has done is to have a national strategy. It has realised that money. has to be provided for people to buy their homes, as 72.8 per cent of Australians are now doing. But there has to be accommodation for the aged and for youth. There is a 30 per cent increase in hostel accommodation for the elderly. There is an extra $27m for youth accommodation. There is $6.3m over four years for multipurpose facilities to provide residential and community care services for aged people in country areas. We do not just look after the metropolitan areas; we look at the total Australian scene. Country people deserve something as well. This year the State approved rental housing trust will receive an extra $ 13m, rising to $65m. It means an extra 36,000 affordable dwellings. Homeless youth can start to rest easy. But we are not just trying to provide them with accommodation. We are providing a massive amount of money. In fact, $5.5m will be spent just to try to get the kids to go home. That is the sort of thing a government has to do-not just provide crisis accommodation, which the honourable member for Riverina-Darling ( Mr Hicks) opposes. That is what I think he said. We want crisis accommodation but we are also trying to get the kids back home. We have set aside $5.5m for an innovative adolescents program. We have provided an extra $10m to double the medium and long term accommodation capacity by 1991-92 and a further $17m under the supported accommodation assistance program (SAAP). That is to be matched by the States, and it will mean a total of $34m under the supported accommodation assistance program. It is the same in every area one looks, wh.ether it be the SAAP; whether it be the transitional supported accommodation program for refuges; whether it be the assistance given to the aged; whether it be assistance for Aboriginal rental housing, which is going up by 30 per cent to $91m; whether it be the pensioner rental scheme-a Labor initiative worth $48.75m, and a 30 per cent increase on last year. If honourable members opposite do not like it they should talk to the local authorities, to the States, to the pensioner groups, because they love it. They know what they can do; they can build their six units in Mount Morgan, seven in Lowen and so it goes on because the money is being supplied. This Government, under the DSPthe disability services program-is helping disabled people to gain access to public housing, giving them integrity of life, quality of life. We are providing over $2m for two years just to help young people who wish to attend rural colleges and who have to live away from home. The Opposition never thought of it. Opposition members talk about representing a rural constituency. but they never thought of it. This Government has a comprehensive housing package. It has a national, all-encompassing strategy, built on a social justice commitment to housing. It is targeting the disadvantaged. It is helping people with disabilities. It is built on a growing degree of Commonwealth and State cooperation, and that is what I like about it, too. We need to work together-at State, local and federal levels-to achieve our objectives and to overcome these problems. This Government is carefully targeting, attacking and addressing the problem areas of housing. We have a policy that is working and I believe that it ought to be applauded.",203

170,Mr TICKNER ,ACCOUNTS,"Hughes)-by leave-I wish to make a statement concerning action taken on recommendations in the 295th report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. In December 1988 the Joint Committee of Public Accounts tabled a report on an inquiry into therapeutic goods evaluation and testing function for the Department of Community Services and Health. The Committee was disturbed to find during that inquiry that after many years there was no .uniform national legislation in Australia to give an enforceable national standard to ensure that therapeutic goods on the market were safe and effective. Such legislation was first suggested as long ago as 1966. The Committee noted: The lack of national legislation means that the Commonwealth has no legal rights in relation to a number of issues that directly concern public health. These include an inability to ensure an enforceable national standard of good manufacturing practice, the licensing of manufacturers, which is currently a State responsibility with varying standards precluding, in some cases, the power to close down substandard and unsafe premises. There was no requirement to evaluate any Australian medical device with limited exceptions before sale and use in Australia. There was no control over the importation into Australia of the vast majority of medical devices with the result that some devices banned overseas could, in theory, be imported into Australia without inquiry. Finally, there was uation of the majority of diagnostic products. The Committee recommended in its report that the Department of Community Services and Health prepare within six months a report on progress made towards having the legislation in place by the commencement date or earlier to enable a review by the Public Accounts Committee independent of the Finance minute process to be undertaken. On 31 May this year the Department forwarded a report to the Committee on progress made in the implementation. of national therapeutic goods legislation. Subsequently the Committee held a public hearing at which the Department provided further information on the legislation. I now report to the House that the Department of Community Services and Health has advised the Committee that the drafting of new legislation is well advanced and it should be ready by the end of September this year. The Committee is pleased with the progress made by the Department and notes that the new legislation will serve as a model for the States. At the officer level the States actually asked the Department to arrange for the drafting of complementary legislation. The Department has advised that a model will soon be ready. The Department has consulted with the Sta-es on the new legislation and has planned bilateral discussions and a meeting of the National Coordination Committee for Therapeutic Goods to obtain formal commitmept to the new legislation. . With the requisite backing at the Federal level and appropriate responses from the States, the legislation could be introduced into the Parliament by late September and effective by 1 March 1990. I am pleased to report that the Committee applauds the progress the Department is now achieving in this vital area. On behalf of the Committee I urge the Government to act quickly in implementing this legislation. CRIMES (SUPERANNUATION BENEFITS) BILL 1989 Biil presented by Mr Lionel Bowen, and read a first time. Second Reading",207
171,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,ACCOUNTS,"Kingsford Smith-Attorney-General) (4.37)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Much has been made in recent years of the no evalimpact of corruption on many facets of Australian society. The Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct conducted by Mr Tony Fitzgerald, QC, constitutes one of the most prominent and comprehensive inquiries on the subject. The legislation now before the Parliament represents a strong weapon against potential corruption. In response to revelations before the Fitzgerald Commission, the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill covers not only public officials and judges but also parliamentarians. It supplements measures passed by the Parliament during the autumn sittings dealing with corrupt members of the Australian Federal Police. In accordance with comments I made to this House when I introduced the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, these Bills will provide for the restraint of property and the recovery of superannuation benefits which have already been paid to a corrupt employee who is convicted and sentenced to more than 12 months imprisonment. The Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill 1989 provides for the loss, or recovery, of government-funded superannuation benefits payable, or paid, to existing or former employees of the Commonwealth orÂ· of a Commonwealth authority who are convicted of a corruption offence and sentenced to imprisonment for life or for more than 12 months. These provisions do not, of course, affect the payment of the employee's own contributions and any interest on those contributions that may have accrued under a superannuation scheme. The Bill empowers a court, upon the application of the Director of Public Prosecutions, when sentencing the person for a corruption offence to make a superannuation order. These orders provide that any future payments of government moneys in respect of the person must cease and may, where appropriate, specify an amount that is to be recovered from a person who has already received payment of benefits. As with the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, the amount specified in the order may be recovered as if it were a debt and, as under that Act, there are sophisticated measures to ensure that payment is not avoided by the use of the corporate veil, unlawful disposal of property or by absconding. The Bill has a comprehensive regime of restraining orders which enables property of a person who is convicted, charged or about to be charged with a corruption offence, to be frozen until the results of the criminal proceedings and any application for a superannuation order are known. As under the Banktuptcy Act 1966, any property that has beenÂ· disposed of by the person by way of gift can also be the subject of restraining orders. These provisions are designed to combat efforts by the offender to dispose of property by giving it to relatives or associates as soon as detection of the offence appears likely. The Government has rejected the approach taken by the Queensland Parliament in the Public Officers Superannuation Benefits Recovery Act 1988 whereby the courts are given the option of forfeiting only part of the person's superannuation entitlement where the offence is considered to be minor or where hardship may result from the order. Rather, minor offences are placed outside the scope of the Commonwealth Bill by the condition precedent that a. sentence of more than 12 months imprisonment be imposed for the offence. This Government is firmly of the view that there is no scope for watering down the forfeiture in such cases as superannuation benefits and they should only be paid from public moneys to persons who discharge their duties in a non-corrupt manner. The Government views corruption of office as a failure to fulfil a condition of employment which should result in the disentitlement to publicly funded superannuation benefits. While the consequence of conviction for a corruption offence under the Bill will be the loss of publicly funded superannuation benefits there may also be other remedies available under other legislation. For example, where a corruption offence involved the payment of a bribe to a public official, an amount equal to the bribe may be recoverable under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. This Government is determined to ensure that corruption does not infiltrate the Commonwealth or its instrumentalities and this Bill will provide a strong financial disincentive to any who may be tempted to engage in corruption now or in the future. 1 present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. 1 commend the Bill to the House.

172,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE,"Kingsford Smith-Attorney-General) (4.43)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is a companion Bill to the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill 1989 and strengthens the provisions of the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Act 1989 which was passed during the autumn sittings of Parliament. The Bill contains provisions which facilitate the recovery of Commonwealth funded superannuation benefits already paid to corrupt members of the Australian Federal Police and enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to obtain restraining orders against property to secure such recovery where it is likely that a person may be convicted of a corruption offence. The scheme is broadly similar to that contained in the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill 1989. These measures were foreshadowed in this House during the debate on the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Bill 198- in May this year. I present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Moore) adjourned. NA NA NA Bill presented by Mr Lionel Bowen, and read a first time. Second Reading",209
173,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Kingsford Smith-Attorney-General) (4.44)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to implement increases in remuneration for members of the Federal judiciary. The Remuneration Tribunal in its 1988 review recommended increases in judges' salaries of up to 80 per cent. Whilst these proposals discharged the Tribunal's statutory obligations, the Government was unable to accept that level of increase at a time when continued community-wide restraint in wage fixation was necessary. The Government considered that a balance should be found between the need for restraint and the interests of the administration of justice through the maintenance of a proper standard of judicial appointments. The EmptyHere Morris) therefore asked the members of the Remuneration Tribunal to provide further advice on appropriate remuneration for the Federal judiciary in the current wage fixing context. The members of the Tribunal presented their special report to the Minister on 30 June. In that report, the Tribunal members found that within the terms of the national wage principles at that time, there was an inequity between Federal and State court judges. They concluded that the duties and responsibilities of the Federal Court warranted remuneration no less than that of the members of the Supreme Court of Queensland, who are the highest paid of the State Supreme Courts, and currently receive a level of remuneration 16 per cent greater than that of their Federal Court colleagues. The report also proposed that expenses of office allowance be absorbed into salaries and that judicial remuneration be adjusted in accordance with the August 1988 national wag- case decision which granted increases of 3 per cent and $10 per week. This Bill implements these recommendations by amending the Judicial and Statutory Officers (Remuneration and Allowances) Act 1989 1984. The Government has also decided to legislate to equate the remuneration of members of the Family Court with that of the judiciary of the Federal Court. There is no longer any justification for members of the Family Court to be paid less than their Federal Court colleagues, especially as the Federal Court is now able to refer certain matters to the Family Court. Consistent with the report's recommendations, these changes in remuneration will operate from 1 March 1989. Travelling .allowances are also to be adjusted from 1 March 1989 in accordance with rates recommended in the Tribunal's 1988 review. The Minister for Industrial Relations has foreshadowed that a further examination of judicial remuneration will be undertaken in the light of the recent decision from the national wage case bench. The appropriateness of the relativities of remuneration between Federal Court judges and a number of statutory office holders will also be assessed. The linkage of the two of these offices is to be removed pending the review of the relativities. These are the offices of the Marshal of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory and the Judicial Registrar of the Family Court. However, the current levels of remuneration will be adjusted in accordance with the increases arising from the August 1988 national wage decision. The removal of these direct linkages at this time should not be seen to prejudice in any way the future re-establishment of linkages for these offices should it be considered appropriate to do so. The Bill also empowers the Tribunal in the future to make determinations rather .than recommendations in respect of the office of judge and offices of judicial status. The Tribunal currently has this power in relation to virtually all other offices within its jurisdiction. As is the case with these other offices, determinations will be subject to disallowance by either House of the Parliament. The cost of implementing the Bill will be of the order of $3.7m in 1989-90. Further information on the Bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum which I now present and which has been circulated to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Moore) adjourned. NA 2ND CAVALRY REGIMENT, DARWIN Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act",210
174,Mr WEST ,CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES FOR,"Cunningham-Minister for Community Services) (4.48)-I move: That in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969 it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction ties for 2nd Cavalry Regiment, Darwin. This proposed work is for the construction of new facilities to allow for the relocation of the Royal Australian Army's 2nd Cavalry Regiment from New South Wales to Darwin. This move to the Northern Territory will involve some 400 service personnel and their equipment. The operational role of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment is to conduct reconnaissance, provide security, and engage in offensive, defensive and delaying action in northern Australia. The Regiment currently occupies permanent facilities at Holsworthy and undertakes annual deployments to the Northern Territory for manoeuvre training. At present, there are no defence facilities available in Darwin into which the 2nd Cavalry Regiment could be relocated. All such facilities are fully committed to meet current requirements and new working, training, recreational, messing and living-in facilities are required for the unit. The extent and areas of the proposed work are new 2nd Cavalry Regiment barracks and training facilities to be provided on a newly acquired site at Palmerston, approximately 20 kilometres east of the Darwin central business district. The site is of sufficient size to accommodate the working, recreational, messing and living-in facilities for the unit, and also provides a close training area for the unit. Additional administrative support facilities are to be provided at the existing Larrakeyah Barracks near central Darwin. This will entail both the provision of new buildings and the refurbishment and extension of some existing facilities. Additional ammunition storehouses for the Army are to be provided within the proposed Royal Australian Air Force explosives ordnance storage complex to be built at RAAF Base, Darwin. The estimated cost of this proposal as recommended by the Committee is $62.7m at December 1988 prices. This cost estimate equates to $65.lm at July 1989 prices. Subject to parliamentary approval and Department of Defence funding priorities I expect that the construction of site works will commence later this year. It is likely that there will be an on-site work force of up to 190 people during peak construction periods. The construction program is planned to enable the 2nd Cavalry Regiment to relocate to of faciliDarwin by the end of 1992. In supporting these facilities for the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, the Committee in its report raised several matters that it believed needed further attention. I want to inform the Committee that, in line with its recommendations, and subject to the approval today of this House to proceed, a contract will be able to be let shortly to allow for the installation of the water supply main by November this year before the onset of the wet season. The Defence Housing Authority will further consult with the Committee regarding the details of its strategy for meeting the housing requirements of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. The Department of Defence is to consider the provision of a permanent community facility for defence families in Darwin and examine the availability as an interim measure of a facility more suitable for community purposes than that currently in use at Larrakeyah Barracks. The Public Works Committee will be formally advised of these' outcomes. This is an important proposal, not just in terms of Australia's defence strategies and capabilities but also in terms of the continued development of both the Northern Territory economy and the community. So I would like to thank the Public Works Committee for its very prompt consideration of this project and also for its support. I commend the motion to the House.",211
175,Mr CARLTON ,CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES FOR,"Mackellar) (4.53)- Mr Deputy Speaker, the Opposition supports the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Public Works and the proposal of the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr West) to proceed and to recommend this to the House. Basing the 2nd Cavalry Regiment in Darwin is an important part of our Defence White Paper proposals. It is part of the plan to change the strategic bases in the north. It is also quite important in a cost sense because at the moment the 2nd Cavalry Regiment is located in Holsworthy and has to have an annual deployment to the north. That is a very costly exercise and, of course, it has other implications for the servicemen and their families. I was pleased to see that the Minister, on behalf of the Minister for Defence ( Mr Beazley), has agreed to have a closer look at the arrangements for the families in Darwin. It was one of the shortcomings of the proposals from the Department to the Committee. The Committee' picked up these difficulties. It was felt by the Committee that not enough attention had been paid to the housing and community arrangements for the families. That is one of the things that the Opposition has been very concerned about in the administration of the Department and was the subject of a report by the honourable member for Brisbane ( Mr Cross). The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade reported just a few weeks ago to the House on the personnel problems of the forces and the resultant wastage from the Services. There are two other matters to which I want to refer in passing. The Committee report makes reference to the proposal in the 1987 Defence White Paper to replace the 2nd Cavalry Regiment's existing fleet of track M113 vehicles. The White Paper says that a selected range of vehicles will be uated under northern conditions. This in fact has not been done. By some peculiar decision from the Minister's office, apparently bypassing the normal departmental procedures, a certain number of second-hand vehicles have been bought from the Americans. Fifteen of these vehicles have been purchased for $25m, apparently without any proper evaluation. The conditions under which they will have to operate are fairly difficult. Northern Australia has a harsh and changeable environment and the performance of any vehicle in the north, particularly wheel vehicles, is subject to some limitations. The LAV25 is to perform a vital defence role and, as such, one would expect that its performance capabilities would undergo at least some evaluation. It appears that the 2nd Cavalry Regiment is about to take on 15 expensive second-hand vehicles which, incredibly, have not been first assessed for their suitability. I draw attention to that and indicate that the Opposition will be watching this decision very closely. The second point-and I made it in relation to a previous Public Works Committee recommendation in regard to defence-is that we continue to support these recommendations one by one but we still cannot see them within a comprehensive facilities policy. Mr Robert Cooksey, in his 1987 review of Australia's defence facilities, put forward as his first two recommendations: That a comprehensive defence policy on facilities be prepared as a matter of priority and that as a matter of priority defence develop a long-term facilities planning document. Facilities policy, as with other capital proposals associated with the Minister's somewhat shaky defence White Paper at this point, cannot continue to be developed in such an ad hoc fashion. In view of the Budget statement that $54m is to be allocated to defence as a result of assets sales in 1989-90, one wonders about the adequacy of the Government's planning and management underpinning this initiative. With these qualifications, and regretting that the family aspects of this proposal were not adequately developed by the Department before the Committee had to ask those questions, the Opposition supports the Minister's proposal.",212
176,Mr SNOWDON ,CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES FOR,"Northern Territory) eval- (4.58)-1 welcome this announcement, as I am sure do all my Territorian colleagues, not least those involved in the construction industry. As the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr West) has indicated, work will commence as soon as possible. I am very pleased that the Minister has seen fit to take up the proposal of the Public Works Committee to provide a community facility for the Royal Australian Army personnel. I would like to commend not only the Minister and his Department for the work they have done, and the Department of Defence for the work it has done, but also the Public Works Committee for expediting this matter. The work is extremely important for northern Australia, as I am sure honourable members will understand, not only because of the White Paper and our defence strategy, but because it is an indication to northern Australia that the Commonwealth Government cares for northern Australia and is concerned about its future development and direction. We have now got rid of the old Brisbane line, although I am sure some Opposition members still think it exists. We now have in place a self-reliant defence policy which will send us into the next century. The movement of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment to northern Australia is an integral component of that policy. The $63.2m which is to be spent on the removal of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment to Darwin and the construction of the facilities around Palmerston will provide an extremely important boost to the flagging Northern Territory construction industry and will have important multiplier effects, not only as a result of the construction activity, but as a result, ultimately, of the movement of the personnel involved with the 2nd Cavalry Regiment to Darwin. That will, in turn, provide new infrastructure and permanent jobs outside the defence forces. That will ultimately have a long-term effect on the local economy of northern Australia. The Department of Defence and the Department of Administrative Services have been at pains, where possible, to use local contractors in northern Australia. I would like to make it very clear that my view is that, where it is possible and where appropriately qualified people are available, and provided that pricing is consistent with the requirements of the departments concerned, local contractors ought to be employed. It has been my experience over a number of years that that has not always been the case, but it is extremely important, if we are to carry through these proposals, that where possible we employ local contractors and purchase locally. I again commend this announcement - to the House and thank both the Minister for Defence ( Mr Beazley) and the Minister for Administrative Services for the work that they have done. Question resolved in the affirmative. CHILD SUPPORT (ASSESSMENT) BILL 1989 In Committee Consideration resumed from 16 August. Clause 29.",212
177,Mr HOWE ,CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES FOR,"Batman-Minister for Social Security) (5.01)-1 think the honourable member for Sturt ( Mr Wilson) had argued for his amendment. The Government rejects the amendment on the grounds that it would provide an unsatisfactory element of retrospectivity in the Bill which would discourage voluntary formal arrangements. For example, a non-custodial father could voluntarily provide groceries, transport and a range of other services and pay regular cash over some years. The effect of this amendment would be to leave every such father subject to a liability for a month before the mother applied for an assessment even though he could well have provided fully for his children over that period. The Opposition argues that the Government amendment provides for backdating where a person applies within 28 days of separation, so why should this not be able to be done in all cases? The answer is that the situation in the month after separation is very different from the situation some time after. It is unlikely that in the first month parents will have a settled, regular pattern of providing child support. However, in later years in many cases there will have been settled regular arrangements for a year or more. The Opposition says that the Child Support Agency or the courts could have a discretion to work out the cases in which their suggested approach would not work, but it suggests no guidelines or practical mechanism for the Agency or the court to do this. Rather it suggests that administrative officers should be able to decide, without criteria, to impose a liability for a month on people who cannot prove that they have provided informal support. In any other context the Opposition would rightly argue that that is impractical and improper. Primarily, from the Government viewpoint-and I will argue this in relation to the other amendment that is being sponsored by the Opposition-we are, to say the least, very firm in relation to the issue of retrospectivity, wherever it might rear its head, on the basis that people have always understood that the whole spirit of the approach of the Government to child support has been to move in stages and to ensure that the approach that is taken is prospective. Any concept that would undercut that, particularly where the formula is involved, I think would be seen as a breach of the statements we have made in the past.",213
178,Mr WILSON ,CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES FOR,"Sturt) (5.04)-I rise to say how disappointed we are that the Government has been so insensitive to the proposal that we put forward in this regard. The arguments used by the Minister have a number of inconsistencies about them. He talks. about retrospectivity in the backdating for one month, and one month only, of formula determined maintenance. Yet the very clause he is sponsoring proposes the retrospective imposition of that - maintenance within the first 28 days of the separation. I do not think it should be described as retrospectivity. It should be assessed on the basis of the noncustodial parent's obligation to his children. The Minister for Social Security ( Mr Howe) says we have not advanced any machinery, any mechanism, to bring into account - maintenance actually paid. If that is the reason why he is opposed to our amendment, and if he gives us time and indicates whether the effort will be worthwhile, we will provide the necessary drafting to ensure that that assessment can be made to determine whether payments actually made should be taken in lieu of that which comes under the formula. If we go to the central question of our proposal that it should be backdated in the case of all applications by 28 days or to the date of separation, whichever is the shorter period, we can see that the Minister has failed to appreciate that in the circumstances of many marriage breakdowns the emotions are such that the parties sometimes recognise that there has been a breakdown but still have a hope that repair to the relationship may occur in the interests of the relationship between the spouses and the relationships that the spouses have with their children. My experience, both as an electorate member and acting as a solicitor, as I did many years ago, and also in relation to discussions I have had from time to time with acquaintances and friends who have come into difficult periods in their marital relationships, is that one thing they do not want to do is to put the final seal on the separation. They do not want to take any action of a formal legal nature that says, 'That is it. I recognise it is all over.' But what the Minister's legislation does is to say, 'If you do not do it within 20 days-sign, seal and deliver it-the separation is over and there is no chance of reconciliation for the sake of the parents or the children'. The cost to the children and the separated parent is a month's maintenance. The Minister talked about its having an effect if parties had been separated for many years and the first application came in many years after the date of separation. I do not go along with his view that the maintenance that might have been paid in the last 28 days could not be brought into account. If he wants to quarantine the five-year separation, the four-year separation or the three-year separation, I urge him to think about extending the period from 28 days so that this Parliament is not, through this legislation, creating a circumstance which confronts separating spouses, in circumstances where they have financial difficulties, with a situation in which they are forced, because they want assistance under the supporting parents benefits scheme, to make application earlier rather than later for maintenance under the formula. Our proposal was to extend it to allow the backdating for 28 days, and if backdating it without adjustment for maintenance that has been paid creates a retrospective effect, then let us have time and we will bring in the necessary clauses. I assume that the Government has made up its mind. We will be proceeding to press our point because we believe it is in the interests of trying to give families facing difficult circumstances at least an opportunity to find a way through the difficulties in their relationships, I will talk on the more general question of retrospectivity when we come to a later clause, Question put: That the amendment ( Mr Wilson's), be agreed to.

Where a court makes a decree under section 31A that a child is deemed to be an eligible child, the provisions of this Act apply to the child as if he or she were an eligible child. "". Last night I spoke at length on the substance of these clauses as they related to an earlier clause that the Committee considered and rejected because the Government was not prepared to accept the proposal. However, I will respond briefly to some remarks made this afternoon by the Minister for Social Security ( Mr Howe). He expressed his objection to this clause and the one dealt with earlier on the basis that it has retrospective effect. In my view, or in the Opposition's view, it does not have any retrospective effect. Its purpose is to enable supporting parents in receipt of supporting parents' benefit to make application to the courts to have their children declared eligible children with the consequence that, from the day on which they are declared eligible children, the maintenance payable by the non-custodial parent is payable at the rate determined by a formula based on the level of income of the non-custodial parents. The obligation that it would impose on non-custodial parents is entirely prospective. It is an obligation that can be imposed on the same non-custodial parent through the present cumbersome court procedures, which often are not taken up by the custodial parent because of cost, fear and the environment in which the law operated a number of years ago when the separation may have occurred. The Opposition is very disappointed that the Government does not see that a great deal could be done for a large number of children in these circumstances. What the Government is doing is leading to a situation in which these mothers will have no alternative but to apply to .the courts in due course-Parliament having considered the Fogarty Child Support Consultative Group and the research papers of Lovering, Whitford and others to determine what is a fair level of maintenance-in the hope that the courts, having considered that Parliament has set this administrative formula in the light of those, will then say to a parent who separated before the commencement date of the legislation that perhaps the starting point for determining a revised order for maintenance should be the formula, varying from that starting point if there were any special circumstances in the settlement, both property and maintenance, that was entered into at the time of the original separation. It is sad that the Parliament is not prepared to come to the aid of many thousands of separated parents and give them a. right to apply in a simple form to a court for the court to declare their children to be eligible children. The legislation, as we have commended it, contains adequate provisions to enable non-custodial parents who feel that their earlier arrangements properly discharge their obligations to their children to say therefore, there should be a variation from that maintenance. The Minister says that some of them may think that it is unfair to unsettle what they believed were finalised arrangements when they have been paying far less than they should have for the care and maintenance of their children.",216
180,Mr HOWE ,SUPPORT,"Batman-Minister for Social Security) (5.25)-1 do not need to delay the Committee for very long. 1 think we have had the substantive argument. 1 could offer the honourable member for Sturt ( Mr Wilson) subsequent to this debate a copy of the departmental costing in relation to his proposal. The Department's view and its advice to me is that, apart from the argument that 1 used about retrospectivity and the opening up elements that are involved in what the honourable member is suggesting, we may well find a net cost involved in what is proposed, depending on the number of people who apply for administrative assessment and the cost associated with that. 1 would be the last to deny justice, but in terms of the preexisting population there are mechanisms for people to apply for an upgrading of an order. When that occurs people can take account of what has occurred in the debatethe honourable member for Sturt referred to the work of Lovering, Whiteford and others in relation to the costs of children-but 1 think that in the consultations it would be wrong of me and indeed of the Government to move away from the position we have taken. We believe that this very important scheme can operate more smoothly if we ensure that it is not perceived in any way to have elements of retrospectivity. 1 simply make the point to the honourable member that when we look at the issue he has raised we have to bear in mind that the population we are talking about for the most part is turning over quite rapidly. We can look forward to a very quick turnover in terms of new population. A person is on the sole parent's benefit for an average of three years. So this scheme, if you like, will take effect quiteÂ· quickly. There will be gains to revenue out of the scheme; there may well be losses to revenue if we go down the track that the honourable member is suggesting. .",217

EmptyHere Opposition) (7.31)-Madam Speaker, two nights ago the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) presented a Budget which is wrong for Australia and wrong for the Australian people. The Treasurer had nothing new on the economic front, no answer to the serious problems confronting Australia. The Hawke Government is condemned in the same words it levelled at the previous Government in 1983, namely, that it has 'denied all responsibility for its failure and has adopted the role of economic commentator rather than policy maker'. . Tonight, on behalf of the Liberal and National parties, I want to outline the structured economic approach which will lead our country back to prosperity. Only a coalition government will have the courage and capacity to prescribe the right medicine to cure Australia's chronic illness. We have spelt out our approach in the 28 policies we have released over the last two years and in the wide-ranging blueprint for government, Future Directions. Tonight I will concentrate solely on the economic strategy and policies which a Liberal and National Party coalition will implement in government. But first I want to comment briefly on the Budget. Madam Speaker, the Hawke Government is tired. That is the real message of this Budget. It accepts, almost in defeat, continuing high inflation, high interest rates, current account deficit and further growth in our burgeoning foreign debt. These are the fundamental economic problems facing Australia. But this Budget does virtually nothing to address them. The hard decisions that are needed, and the much heralded restructuring of our economy, have been shuffled off into the future. This Budget leaves Australia vulnerable and leaves Australia exposed to changes in the world economy, unable. to compete efficiently and sliding further into debt. The July balance of payments deficit, released yesterday, was the worse July figure on record. It is the third consecutive monthly record, after similar huge deficits in May and June. What this means, in short, is that our position is getting worse. The Hawke Government has failed to acknowledge this central fact of life. It has delivered a Budget that has no answers and will, in turn, deliver no improvement. At the end of this financial year inflation will be stuck at 7 per cent or higher; the current account deficit will be higher; our foreign debt will be higher; and unemployment will have risen again. In short, there will be no immediate relief from high interest rates. The Budget clearly proved that the Government has given up on the hard economic slog and is back to playing politics. It of course offers some benefits to the aged and to homeless youth, but virtually nothing for families. I welcome the fact that after seven Budgets this Government has finally honoured its 1983 election promise to increase the age pension to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. The Government has also stolen some elements of the retirement incomes policy which we released 10 months ago. Labor has been a slow learner in encouraging savings through superannuation. Indeed, it has increased taxation on superannuation by 1,000 per cent. Labor still refuses to adopt our innovative policy of retirement savings accounts (RSAs), which will give new opportunities to part time workers and boost national savings. We will not have a comprehensive .retirement incomes strategy in Australia until our policy is fully implemented in government. Overall, a huge however, the Government has done nothing in this Budget to address the major concern of the Australian people, which is a clear and comprehensive strategy to stop the drift into debt and a strategy to reduce the rate of inflation-nothing at all. . Managing Our Debt In 1983, Labor promised a secure demand led recovery. Instead, we have an unsustainable debt led recovery. Our net foreign debt has risen to $110 billion at the end of Junenow equal to 33 per cent of our gross domestic product. Under Labor, foreign debt has quadrupled. As the Chairman of BtIP, Sir Arvi Parbo, pointed out last week, our debt service to export ratio is one of the worse in the world, ranking us between Bulgaria and Ethiopia. The Government has argued that because much of our debt is owed by the private sector, it is not a matter for concern. The Reserve Bank, in its annual report today, knocked that argument firmly on the head. The Reserve Bank said: The extent to which resources must be diverted to ... future (debt) servicing is the same whether the debt is publicly or privately owed. Moreover, the Bank warns that much recent investment-because of tax and inflation distortions-'was in areas not especially oriented to increasing output in the traded goods sector'. In other words, forget the Treasurer's rhetoric. Quite simply, we are producing far less than we spend. Our paramount economic priority must be to contain and reduce our foreign debt. Broadly speaking there are two ways of doing this, other than by selling off the farm to foreign investors. First, we can drag our spending down and cut our living standards year after year. Of course, this is the Labor approach-Labor's principal response to our debt problems. The alternative is to dramatically increase our national production and productivity. This is the coalition's approach: to boost production and trade our way out of debt. We will achieve a trade led recovery only by tackling the hard ingrained problems which stop us beirig competitive. We will remove the barriers to enterprise which previous governments have either introduced or been prepared to tolerate. Only attention to the practical business of how we work and produce will reverse the decline and decay symbolised by record foreign debt and record interest rates. Anti-Inflation Strategy The Treasurer was correct last year in identifying inflation as Australia's 'number one economic disease'. But once again, Labor proved unable to match words with action. Prices are now rising at an annual rate of nearly 8 per cent. This is double the inflation rates being achieved by our trading partners, many of whom are targeting policy towards zero inflation. High inflation under Labor has savaged living standards, jacked up interest rates and introduced massive distortions into our economy. It means that Australian products carry an enormous price disadvantage against imports and in export markets. The Government has no strategy for lowering inflation, other than fiddling with the CPI base to artificially reduce the quarterly figures. In contrast, we will tackle the underlying, root causes of inflation. We will aim, first, to achieve parity with our trading partnersand then to do better than them. With our industrial relations and fiscal policies in p-ace, we will be free to pursue a steady monetary policy directed towards reducing inflation. Unlike Labor, we will not be backed into a corner, forced into a stop-go monetary policy that creates uncertainty and jacks up interest rates. Our approach will give Australia a firm foundation for sustained recovery, growth without debt and reduced interest rates. ABetter, Fairer Tax System We will also reform the tax system. The Hawke Government is a traditional Labor government: its answer to every problem is to raise taxes more. Labor's tax system discourages and penalises hard work, penalises savings and penalises investment. For the sixth consecutive year the Government has retained its title as. Australia's highest taxing government. The $9.1 billion surplus announced on Tuesday will, once again, be achievedÂ· mainly through a massive tax impost on working Australians. Let us remember that total taxation on individuals has more than doubled under Labor, from $23 billion in 1982-83 to $51 billion in 1989-90. In 1983 a person on the average wage paid a marginal tax rate of 30 cents in every extra dollar he earned. Today, it is 40 and 1/4 cents in the dollar, including, of course, the Medicare levy. A single income family on average earnings in March 1983 paid $84.65 tax each week-nearly 23 per cent of its income. In July 1990 that same family will be paying $156.74 tax each week-almost 26 per cent of its income. By July 1990 this family will be $56 a week worse off compared with March 1983. If we include higher home mortgage repayments, that family will be worse off by $100 a week. Tax reform and tax relief will be put back on the agenda by a coalition government. Unlike the Hawke Government, we have a comprehensive tax policy which will reduce the burden of taxation. Government members-Where? EmptyHere us give them a scoop. First, we will move toward a flatter system of personal taxation that has only two marginal rates. Second, we will ensure that the top rate for individuals is not higher than the company tax rate. Third, we will bias the tax system in favour of families with dependent children, something the Government is incapable of doing. And that important reform will be given top priority. Fourth, we will rationalise the ramshackle indirect tax system. Fifth, we will scrap Labor's capital gains tax, replacing it with a purely speculative investment tax, phasing out over 5 years. Except for that modification, there will be no new taxes introduced in our first term of government. Furthermore, as I indicated several weeks ago, we are now examining a proposal which, if implemented, would tax only the real interest income from savings and allow tax deductability only for real interest expenses. We have the plans for the future. Labor does not.",245
183,Deus ex machina,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"Government members interjectingEmptyHere want a Keating budget. The same old snake oil from the same old snake. Wages and Productivity Australia's presc;mt wages system is a major reason why we are uncompetitive. It is time to update the way we work and to develop a modern industrial culture. We need to focus on the enterprise level-individual firms and workplaces-where better ways of working Â«an be easily and rapidly found. Our policy will give people the right to make their own decisions and to work out what is best for them in their own workplace. Most Australians-if not .Government members-are proud of their work and want to be more involved in the decisions that count. At present, all of the important decisions about wages and conditions are done in political back room deals between Cabinet Ministers and the Australian Council of Trade Unions leadership to the detriment of wage and salary earners and their employers. The crumbling accord, which dictates solutions from above, has been a disaster for our country. It has underpinned the high rate of inflation, brought about low productivity and generally squashed the aspirations of those who want to work harder and produce more. It has reduced all to the lowest Common denominator. Our industrial relations policy will ward for effort back into the workplace. Firstly, wage increases will be genuine steps ing! forward, because they will have been earned. We fully support the right of Australian workers to wage rises earned through higher productivity. There is no economic sense in awarding wage rises which are simply translated into higher inflation, reduced competitiveness and increased debt. Secondly, we will introduce greater flexibility into Commission decisions and awards. We will ensure that the special circumstances facing individual industries and firms are in fact taken into account so that one person's wage rise is not another person's job. Thirdly, we will encourage employers and employees to work together at the enterprise level with the minimum of outside interference. Voluntary agreements-they are anathema to the Government-on pay and conditions, backed up by legal sanctions that make the parties stick to the decisions they reach, will revolutionise the way we work. And it does not end there. Fourthly, we will encourage and support employee share ownership schemes to give Australian workers a concrete stake in theÂ· profitability of their workplace. This new culture of work will achieve and will sustain productivity, productivity improvements that will rival those of our competitors. The Government cannot even comprehend that we are in the international market and that we have to get out and compete. We have had zero or near-zero productivity growth under Labor. Indeed, the latest figures showed a fall in productivity growth. So we have the plans for the future. Labor does not. Responsible Unionism Hand in hand with this new industrial culture, we will establish more equal rights between employers and trade unions. In the last six years the trade union leadership has been granted enormous privileges by this Government and enormous power by this Government, but without responsibility. Industrial disputation in Australia is still extraordinarily high by international standards. For example, we lose twice as many days as the United States of America per 1,000 employees, nearly three times as many as the United Kingdom, 24 times as many as Japan put re- and 50 times as many as West Germany. Some competition the Government is providWe need to develop a new morality in industrial relations which encourages trade union leaders to put national and community interest ahead of narrow, political and sectional concerns. And we will go about it the way it ought be gone about because I tell you now, Madam Speaker, my government will require secret ballots to be held before any strike action. My government will make it an offence for any employer to pay, or any employee to accept, strike pay. My government will introduce comprehensive legislation to protect essential services from disruption. My government will outlaw 'closed shops' and employees will be given the guaranteed right freely to decide whether to join or not to join a trade union. The Liberal and National parties do not seek confrontation with trade union leaders. But the community is right in wanting a new industrial attitude which puts Australia first. Smaller, More Efficient Government . As I said earlier, the forecast surplus this year is the right result achieved the wrong way. The private sector has been forced to make sacrifices. It is paying more tax. States and local government have suffered heavy cuts in their grants. Capital funding, among other things for roads, has been massively reduced. But Commonwealth spending on its own programs has actually increased. Our public sector is still much larger than the average for industrial nations, with one of the largest government business sectors in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Government spending in 1989 is 10 per cent higher in real terms than it was in 1983. We are determined to trim government activities, to free up additional resources for the trading sector and put us on a more competitive footing in the global market-place. We are prepared to look hard at areas of spending and ask whether some government functions would be better left to the private sector. We will undertake a complete audit of government activities to effectively identify waste and to identify inefficiency, and hold a special Premiers Conference to identify functions which would be better performed if transferred to the States. In addition, we have a comprehensive and detailed strategy and policy to privatise 12 government businesses including Qantas Airways Ltd, Australian Airlines, Aussat Pty Ltd and the Commonwealth Bank. The Government knows it is the way to go and it does not have the guts to do it. It just cannot do it. Let me say additionally that the revenue derived from privatisation will be used to retire Commonwealth debt. As I have said, we have the plans for the future; Labor does not. Privatisation and microeconomic reform, the hallmarks of the third term of the Hawke Government, have not achieved one bit. The Government has shelved both goals indefinitely in the face of resistance from its trade union leadership and from its ALP factions. But the coalition will reform our transport and communications systems, our aviation sector, the waterfront and coastal shipping. Government monopoly, restrictive work practices arid inadequate competition in these areas handicap our competitive effort. For example, our major container ports are only half as productive as many Asian ports. Under this Government it is cheaper to ship cars from Australia to New Zealand via Japan, rather than directly across the Tas-Â· man. Many Australian products are competitive when they leave the factory. Time and again factories prove to me that the product produced on th- factory floor is efficient and competitive. But the moment it goes on the road or on the rail or on the waterfront it loses its competitive edge. We cannot afford that any longer. The Business Council of Australia has estimated that reform in these areas alone can achieve cost savings of $2 billion-about 18 per cent of total transport costs-which could raise GDP by $4 billion or 1.6 per cent. We will also reduce the burden of regulation, which absorbs 80,000 Public Service jobs, costs taxpayers over- $3 billion a year and costs business around $7 billion in a year just in paperwork. We will accelerate the process of industry restructuring and gradually rationalise non-tariff protection, including subsidies, bounties and taxation expenditure. In many areas we protect inefficient and uncompetitive industries - while passing higher costs to our productive export sector. This coordinated strategy of ours shares the burden fairly in the community and directs all arms of economic policy, including the paramount goal of containing our foreign debt and reducing our foreign debt. This strategy of ours incorporates reduced inflation, a better taxation system, a wages system designed to boost productivity, better industrial relations, smaller and ,more effective government, deep structural reform and consistent lowering of cost structure. This multi-dimensional policy - mix stands in marked contrast to the one-dimension, onearmed approach of the Hawke Government, namely, high interest rates. The only instrument that the Government uses is the blunt option of choking off demand through high interest rates. Labor, of course, cannot reduce interest rates because it will not even try to reduce inflation, which remains stuck at 7 to 8 per cent. With Labor's one-dimensional approach of high interest rates, any drop in interest rates will only be a momentary relief. The economy will not suddenly be less vi.llnerable. Our debt will not have disappeared. Labor has wasted the great opportunity of recent years, when the unexpected strength of commodity prices should have dramatically lowered our current account deficit. Instead,' we have run even worse current account losses at a time when those export prices have been extraordinarily high. What the Government has done is give us an economy going backwards when all the luck was running our way. What if the luck changes? If our terms of trade today were at the same level as when the Treasurer made his 'banana republic' outburst in 1986, Australia's current account deficit this year would have been around $30 billion. Of course, that would not have been allowed to happen. There would have been a sharp, if not brutal, market reaction to further lower our living standards. That is the fatal, hidden danger in Labor's complacent, timid and paralysed approach to our problems. Labor has given us restraint, but it has been restraint without results. The trade-led and production-led strategy of the coalition parties not only urgently needed, but also it is the only path to true recovery. Madam Speaker, I have told it as it is. There is no quick fix. There is no overnight solution to the ingrained problems we face after six years of high debt, high interest, high taxation and high spending government. But there is an alternative to Labor's years of gloom. There is an alternative vision to the Treasurer's 'no light at the end of the , tunnel', I end as I began. The Liberal and National parties have the programs to solve our nation's central economic problems. We are ready to act, and we are ready to act the day we are elected. The Hawke Government is basically a fair-weather ' government. Labor has shown itself incapable of solving the problems. The coalition will act in' the vital areas of reform which Labor has protected from change and quarantined from reality. We will lead a national revival of enterprise and unite the citizens of our country in the great task of making Australia strong again. We have the answers. We have the commitment. We want to see Australia emerge from this present economic illness as a powerhouse of enterprise-not as Labor's poorhouse of decline. We want to see the children of Australia once again proud that they are growing up in a nation envied by others for its rich tapestry of opportunity. We want to see a stronger Australia that earns its way in the world and boasts a prosperous and confident society providing a fair go for all in our community. Every policy I have announced, every decision my government takes, will aim to bring this vision to life as our common future. The Australian people deserve nothing less.",247
184,Mr JOHNS ,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"Petrie) {7.58)-1 might say that they were slim pickings indeed off the old peacock tonight. We heard very little that was of use. I want to run through some of the most important points that the' Leader EmptyHere to make tonight. His basic and enduring problem tonight was evident when he said that this nation ought to return to prosperity. That is not our problem. This is a prosperous nation. The difficulties of the economy are managing prosperity. We are not a poor is nation. We are a nation which is at the top of the league in terms of our productive abilities, our export abilities, the productivity of our labour and our ability to bring our government sector to reasonable levels of expenditure. So the problem for us is not one of managing a poor economy, but of managing effectively a prosperous economy. The Leader of the Opposition talked about dramatically increasing our national productivity as if he had just discovered the word 'productivity'. The very notion is the byword of this Government. It has based its entire reputation on the notion of productivity. For seven years under the previous coalition Government a national productivity case never went before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Today it is almost impossli>le for a trade union to front the Industrial"" Relations Commission and to have a rise granted to its workers without a consideration of productivity. That is the enormous shift that has been wrought by this Government. Seven years ago there was no consideration of productivity as a central tenet of industrial relations. We played a game whereby wages were either indexed for inflation or not indexed for tion. That was the only game that was played at that time. It was a game about how much we could take away from the workers' by allowing inflation to eat into those wages. That game continued for many years. There was a debate between the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Government at you that time as to whether there would be tial indexation or full indexation, and in about 1981 a wages freeze was imposed on the public sector by the then Prime Minister. That is the way that productivity was or not part of the debate under previous coaliand, tion governments. We, on the other hand, have made proity ductivity a central part of the negotiations. We sta,rted in 1983 with an accord which said in the first instance, 'Let's try to erat.e wag- demands in real terms by ing' for partial indexation with some tradeparticularly offs under the social wage whereby workers would be compensated, using Medicare and other transfer payments, for a loss in money wages'. Then we introduced the notionÂ· bf bargaining for productivity increases-of people getting wage increases because we .considered productivity. It became a central part of our theme. We are delivering those increases in productivity and we are' proud to be able to do so because we, too, realiseabilities. we realised it six or seven years earlier the Opposition did-that productivity is sential to our trade performance, to our competitiveness wit-. other. nations, and we will not survive as a prosperous nation we are not more productive. We have been able to create an industrial relations system that places productivity at the very pivotal point. We hear from the other side, that wages should be paid according to productivity. take that to mean that, first there should no compensation for inflation--;-in a sense that we can rip back seven or eight per cent a yearout of wage packets-and then that we should consider some rises on the basis of productivity. The Opposition is first ing to the workers of Australia that it would penalise them for the inflation which it would bring upon them as a government, and then, 'Your only reward would be to increase your productivity so that at least you might catch up to the real value of your wages'. The inflaresult would be what we have now with the airline pilots-a breakout. People would simply refuse to operate under those circumwages stances, and they would be right. It is not sufficient to say to workers, 'We will penalise you in your real wage packet' and then, as a comeback, 'We might give some rises on the basis of productivity'. parWe have attempted under the accord always to say three things: first,. we will attempt to keep real incomes as high as we possibly can; secondly, we will compensate the lowest was earning people by means of the social wage; tl1irdly, on top of that, we will allow people to bargain on, the basis of. productivincreases. That is what the whole process of award restructuring - eans. I visited Melbourne recently and held dismodcussions with the Vehicle Builders Employallowees Federation and with employers, the Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd. I was impressed by the ability of Ford and the. Vehicle Builders Employees Federation to work together on the notion of award restructuring. They were saying to us jointly, in unison, that workers must be awarded a new series, a new method. by which they can achieve proper progress through a career structure, with proper increases in wages in reward for an increase in their productive This was not members of the union than movement getting in my ear .and suggesting esthat this is a way to improve their wage packet. This was not Ford Australia getting that into my ear and saying 'We have to hold if back union demands'. This was Ford Australia and the Vehicle Builders Union jointly suggesting the on- solution, and that is a significant and a mighty turnaround from the situation of six and seven years ago; that is, the traditional enemies in the industrial reI lations field, the bosses and the workers, are be now working together on the proposition that they can improve productivity through. award restructuring. So the game is totally sewn up. It is in the camp of the Government. We produce the solutions, but the solutions, sayas always, will not come as quickly as any .Opposition would deem thatÂ·Â· they should. But we have locked it in. Productivity is now a central part of the whole debate. Enough on that. The Opposition Leader talked about tax reform, about having a flatter tax rate. He misses the point. When the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard), introduced that quaint notion of 'incentivation', he also talked about a flatter tax rate. There is a confusion here. Margin-l tax rates can, if they are too high, create a disincentive for a worker. There is no doubt about that. If one's marginal tax tate was as it was in years gone by under previous coalition governments, at 60 per cent, there is no use working overtime. There is no use wanting to move up the ladder of employment because of the fear that one's marginal tax rate will be too high. Why bother? We understand that. We reduced marginal tax rates. That is a separate argument entirely from the general level of taxation as it is paidÂ· through the pay as you earn (PAYE) system. To move to a flatter tax rate-and perhaps a two-step tax rate is what the Leader of the Opposition is aiming at-will do nothing to solve the problem of incentive, because we have solved it. The problem of incentive, as far as marginal tax rates have an impact, has been solved. So those opposite are out of date. They are essentially out of date on the question of a productive culture as the industrial relations system can produce it, and they are out of date in tenus of producing a flatter tax rate and the hope that they have of that flatter tax rate producing sufficient incentive for workers. They would, of course, like to return to the old system of an increased dependent spouse rebate and the ability to write off the cost of children using the tax system. Again, we have discovered that that is not the solution at all. It is far better to use a system of direct payments, that is, family allowance and the family allowance supplement: we can measure simply and accurately the needs of a given family on the basis of how many children. they want to bring up-not on the basis of whether a woman chooses to be at home or not. Those opposite cannot seem to get over that hang-up. We have got over it. The solution is simple: we pay families. on the basis of how many children they bring up and we pay it on an income tested basis so that those who do not require support from the Government do not get any support from the Government through the family allowance or .the family allowance supplement system. So again those opposite are really dredging up a notion that is six and seven years old, that is tried and that has failed. Why reintroduce it? I am disappointed that that would even be raised as a possible policy for a future coalition government. Let us talk then about the notion of a new culture of productivity. It seems to me that there are some fundamental misunderstandings there. A culture or productivity is created if there is an industrial relations system that gives reasonable rewards for reasonable effort. Patently that cannot be achieved if we seek to undo the Industrial Relations Commission's work, if we seek to teal' apart the awards and the various agreements we have with the union movement that will reward productivity effort but not at the same time rob them of real money wages because of the ravages of inflation. The Leader of the Opposition, of course, talked at length about the external debt sitJlation.in this country. We agree that it is not healthy; it is not a good thing. But what he always does, of course, is either cite the figure in money terms rather than real terms-he cheats;Â· he does not use real . terms-or cite a situation. w-thout accepting the fact that Australia's productive capacity is far greater than it used to be. Let me quote from Senator Button, who had some good things to say on this: Australia's current external deficit and foreign debt problems have not suddenly developed under our stewardship. Let me give you some examples: the current account deficit has averaged 5.2 per cent of GDP in the first five years of the Hawke Government, almost identical to the average for the previous five years. This is an interesting point. Senator Button goes on: In only two of the last thirteen years have exports exceeded imports. . Therein lies the rub, does it not? We are not talking about anything new:Â· we knowÂ· that exports have to increase, we know that imports must decrease. The question is how. It is no use restating the question five, six and seven times and not producing answers. The answers are simple enough. We have been doing it. Let me explain how, for instance, on two occasions under our Government the terms of trade have shifted in our favour. On both occasions it has created an excessive demand in the local economy. That is what I talk about when I talk about managing a boisterous economy, or managing, I think the term was, a 'prosperous economy'. It is the essence of managing a prosperous economy that will be the mark of this Government, because that is what we have to do. When the terms of trade are favourable to us, that is, when our exports bring tremendous prices and the cost of some imports drops, initially that is beneficial; it is a good thing, but it does create the problem of excessive importing of capital equipment and whatever. The big test is whether the imported expenditure is on goods for consumption or on capital expenditure for re-investment. Clearly, the case is that the preponderance of expenditure on imports has been for capital goods, which will, in turn, boost our export effort. There is no doubt about that. The problem for the Government politically is that those things do not happen overnight. Would that they did; would that all these problems were solved. They are not. This is a mature government; it is going about its task in a mature way. It realises that when the terms of trade shift they provide a headache for a government in regard to managing the domestic economy. So we are doing that. We are using, in some instances monetary policy, most particularly fiscal policy and certainly wages policy to manage what is a problem caused by a terms of trade shift. It is a nonsense to suggest, as the Leader of the Opposition has done time and again, that somehow we are a high taxing government. It is about time that he understood the notion of the Government's surplus; the Government's revenue over the Government's outlays. Let us look at some of the figures. Since 1983-84, when we came to power, the balance in the Budget has moved in one direction and one direction only. Consistently over seven Budgets now it has declined. First we had large deficits. They have declined consistently to the point where only two years ago, for the first time, we moved into surplus. We have projected that next year we will move into a significant surplus on the Government's own budget. This has been achieved by two methods. Initially, of course, there has been some increase in revenue. I refer to the first couple of years of this Government. Quite obviously, we were locked into certain programs that the previous Prime Minister had evolved, set in place and hoped would save him from electoral doom. Fortunately, he was wrong; they did not save him from electoral doom. But after only two years we started to bring those outlays, that is, government expenditure, down. So from about 198586-Mr Nehl-Taxes up",250
185,Mr JOHNS,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"We will answer that one. They moved down slowly and then very rapidly. Outlays have declined consistently since about 1985. As for revenue-and it is well that the honourable member asks about this-revenue did in fact increase during the first two years of this Government. We hit a point in 1986 where they declined consistently. How have we been able to manage what is now a consistent movement out of deficit and into surplus? We have done it by reducing government outlays consistently for five and six years. We have done it also in the last three years acknowledging that our revenues have fallen. That is a massive achievement. That is an achievement that is simply not understood by those on the opposition benches. We have done it by using both a reduction in outlays and a reduction in revenue-not for the whole seven years, I agree but for many of the seven years-and that is a magnificent achievement. In terms of fiscal policy-that is, the Government's ability to manage its own affairs and expenditure-we are simply unsurpassed. No-one could possibly argue that the resources that the Government is now using are so great as to push out private sector investment. It is a nonsense. It is a debate we had six, seven, eight, nine years ago when it was suggested, probably by both parties, that the government sector has grown to the extent that it was squeezing out private sector investment. We knew that jobs essentially lay in the area of the private sector, so we went about arranging a situation whereby the public sector of this country has declined. But, at the same time, we have not declined the service which the public sector gives to people. We have improved the social wage in this country, we are able to insure people medically under Medicare, we are able to ensure that their family allowance and family allowance supplement payments are made because we target our moneys. I wonder why the Opposition is still talking about cutting a further billion dollars in lays in the government sector when the game is already over. It was solved three or four years ago. I found that the Leader of the Opposition, in fact, did not have a great deal to offer. He offered us debates that are five and six years old. He has not set his mind to 1990 and beyond. Unfortunately, he will not need to set his mind in that way because he will never be on this side of the House.",253
186,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,INSTRUMENTALITIES,Mr Leo MCLeay)-Order! Before I call the honourable member for Gwydir I remind the House that this is the honourable member's maiden speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.,254
187,Mr ANDERSON ,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"Gwydir) (8.18)-ln taking my place in this House it is appropriate for me at the outset to thank the people of Gwydir for giving me the honour of being their representative here in this House. I am only too conscious of the enormous responsibility that I have to do my best for them. The electorate of Gwydir, named after the Gwydir River in the northern end of the electorate, covers some 105,000 square kilometres and has a population of around 108,000 people. It is the tenth most sparsely populated Federal electorate in Australia, the third largest in New South Wales. Gwydir extends from Muswellbrook in the south, through the upper Hunter Valley, over the Liverpool Ranges, out to the small township of Goodooga in the north-west and across to Boggabilla on the Queensland border in the north-east. It is an agricultural electorate which produces a considerable proportion of Australia's best quality wheat. Wool and beef production is also extensive and I must say. that I am relieved that improved prices for these commodities have helped to some extent to offset the disastrously low grain returns of recent years. Cotton is a relatively new arrival in Australia. Its modern history began in the early 1960s at Wee Waa in the very heartland of those rich black plains that make up so much of Gwydir. We now produce 1.3 million bales of some of the best quality cotton produced in the world, returning in the order of $520m a year to Australian producers, with obvious benefits to the country in terms of export dollars. Other crops grown in the north-west include barley, sorghum and sunoutflowers. The development of water resources and irrigation has considerably boosted agricultural production in recent years. Dams such as the Copeton on the Gwydir above Bingara and Keepit on the Namoi above Gunnedah have contributed greatly to this. An interesting example is provided by the Moree Plains Shire. It is estimated that gross agricultural production in this area has risen from around $50m to $300m in today's dollar terms as a result of irrigation development. Other important industries in Gwydir include flour milling, coal mining, agricultural service industries, timber milling, opal mining and tourism and in the Hunter Valley particularly, horse breeding and dairying. The main towns include Muswellbrook, Gunnedah, Narrabri, Moree and a string of smaller centres. All of them have a vital role to play, not just in the servicing of their surrounding rural hinterlands, but also by extension the future of Australia which is still so heavily dependent upon the performance of our agriculture sector. Mr Deputy Speaker, it is all too easy for Australians to overlook the enormous contribution made to the national good by that relatively small number of Australians who do not live in the major urban centres of this most urbanised nation in the world. In these days of almost unmanageable trade deficits, when it seems that we are almost totally incapable of living within our means, reality is that in terms of export dollars earned, it is surely the performance of rural Australia and rural Australians that stands between us and the bailiff. And despite the spirit of the age which seems to regard efficiency, productivity, and the pursuit of excellence as goals unworthy of recognition, let alone pursuit, country Australians are putting in an outstanding )performance. What other sector of the Australian economy can match the efficiency and productivity of our agricultural sector? The seat of Gwydir as it now exists is made up of a substantial portion of the old seat of Paterson that was last represented by the late Frank O'Keefe, and the northern half of the original Gwydir. I have already in this place, in common with many other members on both sides of the House, paid tribute to Frank O'Keefe, who sadly died earlier this year. As I said then, Australia a better place for his life and his work. The man who most immediately preceded me, Mr Ralph Hunt, will be known to all honourable members. Interestingly, he made his maiden speech in the provisional Parliament House almost exactly 20 years agoon the night of 21 August 1969. There followed all but 20 years of dedicated service to the people of Gwydir and to the people of this nation. I am constantly reminded both in this place and at. home in the electorate of the regard in which he was held and the thankfulness which people feel for the contribution that he made. Chief amongst his achievements would surely be the role he played in the establishment of the Australian Wool Board in the early 1970s and the setting up of the bicentennial roads program in the early 1980s. I recently read Ralph Hunt's maiden speech. I found it interesting to note that he felt able to speak with confidence of a new age of exciting development and prosperity-in sharp contrast, I might add, to the outlook in 1989. Alas, although we are but 20 years older and still a young nation, I must speak of a less confident Australia, a nation very unsure of the future, and indeed in desperate need of a new vision if we are to fulfil anything like our potential. Whilst I would want to acknowledge that Australia is surely about more than a narrow economic argument, it is undoubtedly true that we are in grave economic trouble. The people of Gwydir are very conscious of this trouble, largely because the economy of Gwydir is export oriented. It is agricultural and mining based. No-one is more conscious of this than farmers who have battled long and hard against almost overwhelming odds. In the time since I started farming in 1980 we have suffered the triple whammy of drought, collapsing commodity prices and exploding input costs-and no input cost has exploded like that of the cost of money. Like so many other farmers, I wonder about the future of the bush for my own family. The difficulty of making a go of it frightens young people away from farming. It places intolerable burdens on farming families. Too many farms in Gwydir are for sale because their owners want to get out. They see no future. is And when things get tough in the bush the downstream effects are enormous. Let me illustrate this with the example of a machinery dealer who is situated in one of the richest farming districts in Gwydir. Seasonal conditions over the last five years have been very difficult and along with low commodity prices and interest rates frequently in excess of 20 per cent there has been no less than a 50 per cent decline in his annual turnover. The viability of a well-run and efficient-almost a model-small business is thus under a cloud, due in no way to the fault of its managers. Already, staff numbers have been cut from 13 to eight. The farmer suffers, the small business. suffers, the employers suffer, the community suffers, those who provide the machinery both in terms of its manufacturing and distribution suffer, and the Australian economy suffers. That is a rerun of a story taking place time and time again out there in the real Australia. No-one can do anything much about seasonal conditions, and that is accepted. Not much can be done about international commodity prices either, although in fairness I must acknowledge the efforts of the Government in pursuing international agricultural trade reform in recent years. But rural people are deeply concerned that not enough is being done to address the areas that we can have influence over. Interest rates in excess of 20 per cent for the productive sector of the Australian economy threaten our very future. The problem with this heavy-handed use of monetary policy is that it fails to distinguish between the productive investment which we need so badly to rebuild our economic base and, on the other hand, excessive consumer demand which sorely needs dampening. Interest rates of these levels reflect the blowout in our trading deficits and our accumulated net foreign debt of some $104 billion. That debt level is an appalling dictment of the way Australia has been mangether aged, especially in view of the plentiful resources with which we are so richly blessed in this country. There are surely two problems at the heart of this. One is that we have become a nation of spenders and not of savers, and yet who can blame the Australian people for saving? The disincentives are massive. High inflation, high taxation, declining real wage levels and constant bombardment with indeny ducement to spend, spend, and let tomorrow hang, see to that. The result is that we have to go abroad to raid other people's savings, such as those of the Japanese, to fund our way in the world-and we have heard somebe thing of it. tonight. The other is that our productivity levels as measured by per unit labour costs are way too low in Australia. We are not competitive and we will not competitive until we take the issues practices and labour market reform seriously. The machinery agency to which I referred cannot negotiate freely with its men in relachallenge? tion to their work loads, holidays or pay rates. When the going gets tough that emtheir ployer has to sack men rather than sit down with them and rationalise possible solutions that might see them all stay on the albeit at possibly different levels until an upturn occurs. That is a crazy situation. Nowhere are the problems of our work practices more evident than on the waterare front. It is an absurdity that this should the case in a nation whose prosperity is built upon exports. At least 12 recent inquiries have highlighted rorts and rip-offs. As EmptyHere mentioned tonight, when it costs more to quality send a car from Tasmania to Melbourne of than from Japan to Australia something is very wrong. The farmers and small businessmen of Gwydir have had to pull in their belts and they have had to drastically review their work practices. Despite this many have lived below poverty levels throughout the 1980s. They are out there waiting with increasing impatience to see the burden of adversity more fairly distributed, and the major structural reforms that are so vitally needed to inbe put in place in this country so that towe can ultimately overcome that adversity. That is supposed to be the Australian way. There are too many in our highly structured and overregulated economy who have been unfairly sheltered from the true reality of our economic predicament. Governments must be included in the list of those who not have to take their share of the load. I submit that for all the hardship that Australian workers face today, and I do not the reality of that hardship for very many of them, they and Australia would be infinitely better off if we had all bitten the bullet and worked together to restructure when the tough times first hit. We would all better off if we had a productive economy built on solid foundations without huge international debt levels and without sky-high interest rates. It is a tragedy that I saw no be genuine evidence of a commitment to such of work reform in Tuesday night's Budget. But it is never too late and restructure we must. How much worse will the prospect be in 10 years time if we fail to take up the The security of future generations of Australians-their economic well-being, prospects for employment, their place in the world as Australians-is dependent . upon us moving now to rebuild a strong, payroll, stable and prosperous economy. As I said earlier, however, I believe that Australia is about much more than a narrow economic argument. Surely in the end economic progress and the pursuit of prosperity laudable only when they are deployed to be higher objectives. We should be pursuing wealth for the good things that it can deliver rather than for itself, whether it is better the opportunities for our children, improved health and education standards or a better of life. It seems to me that the result our narrow and selfish pursuit of material well being for its own sake has about it the smack of what the poet William Blake called 'fearful symmetry'. In seeking our freedom and fulfilment in shallow materialism we have in fact become enmeshed and enslaved. We must regain control over our national finances because that is a prerequisite to our continuing control of our national destiny. The extent to which we stay out of the hands of the international bankers will be the measure of our capacity to determine our future. Ask a farmer-and I can think of plenty of them in Gwydir-how much control he can exercise over his life when he gets in too deeply with the bankers. That brings me to ask just what sort of Australia we want. Where are we going? If beliefs shape goals, what are our beliefs and where are our goals, as evening draws in on the twentieth century? I believe that it has to be said that we lack purpose and vision and that much of our incapacity to deal with the enormous problems that confront us as a nation springs from this problem. I am convinced, too, that we have jettisoned a couple of fundamental principles that underpinned our heritage in days gone by. For one, we have lost sight of the conviction of our forefathers that legitimate government should also be limited government. The English writer and thinker Lord Acton attributed this belief to the influence of the founder of Christianity, who in reply to a trick question advised his listeners to render unto Caesar that which was Caesar's and to God that which was God's. Thus was established in mankind's thinking the idea that limits should be set to the size and nature of government's claims on the lives of ordinary citizens. Furthermore, the individual should not willingly surrender to the state that which is not rightly the state's. Lord Acton also believed that the accumulation of too much power by any one individual or groupings of individuals must be seen as a great danger, and that is why he remarked-a better known remark of his, I might add-that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Those who framed our Constitution believed likewise. That is why they sought to break up and limit power within the governmental process. They used not only the ballot box but also the establishment of elaborate checks and balances between and within three different levels of government. Parliamentary democracy suits the nature of mankind better than any other form of government known to man. On the one hand it reflects his dignity and his right to choose who will lead him and, by implication, where they will take him. On the other hand it acknowledges that uncomfortable reality that none of us are above the corrupting influence of power and that careful limits must be imposed on the accumulation and exercise of it. I reject absolutely the idea that government should be a living, growing, evolving organism in its own right. We must guard very carefully lest government grow at the expense of our freedom. There is a delicate balancing act involved in this. Governments need considerable power to secure the desirable objectives of maintaining law and order and national security. They must also have the power to protect the community from the excesses of powerful bodies which might engage in unfair business practices, industrial sabotage, organised crime and the destruction of the environment. On the other hand the alarming trend towards even bigger and more powerful and centralised government must be fought and fought hard. So, too, must the disturbing tendency of governments to attempt to interfere in people's private lives. Another great pillar of our society is also under threat. Democracy will not long survive the collapse of the family. A society built on strong family and community values will not need nor tolerate intrusive and oversized governments leaning over shoulders and peering into private lives. Plato saw the family as the natural rival of the state. So, interestingly enough, did Karl Marx, who wrote that the family was only a bourgeois prop for capitalism and recognised it as a principal obstacle standing in the way of the revolution. It was, of course, and thank heavens it survived. It remains one of the principal props of any free and democratic society. That is one reason to fight for it, but a better one is that our children represent our future and that children need the family. No adequate substitute can be found for the humanising effect of the family. Whilst essentially individuals must decide for themselves how best to run their own lives-I am not a believer in social engineering-! submit that governments have a role to play in this arena. The anti-family bias, especially the anti-single income family bias, of the taxation system in this country must be reversed. The restructuring of the economy that we have talked about must not be shirked, because families need lower interest rates and lower inflation rates to survive, and because, at an even more fundamental level, they need job opportunities in order to be able to go anywhere. The status and the prestige of the family as an institution must be restored. It is against these commitments to limited government, the winding back of our dangerously high levels of indebtedness, and a commitment to the family that I undertake to do my best for the people of Gwydir. There is much to be done. When the farm is run down, we have to reallocate such resources as are available in order to rebuild its capital foundations. The nation is no different. Out in the bush, our roads are falling apart and, for social and economic reasons, this must be rectified. If we expect people to go on living and producing the nation's bread out there, we have to give them the wherewithal to do so. Our soils are falling apart and nothing short of a national effort involving all Australians will be adequate if we are to halt that process. I embrace totally the need, within sensible guidelines, to nurture and maintain our environment. It terrifies me that, if the experts are right, many of our ancient and fragile soils will be destroyed within a century if we do not act, and act quickly. There is a great need, a national responsibility I believe, to provide educational and medical facilities for those. who live in the remote areas of this country. Finally, I would like to mention my conviction that we need a major planning drive to develop strategies for our future energy needs, especially as our supplies of liquid fuel dwindle. Australia, especially country Australia, can go nowhere without energy. My time, I think, is drawing to a close. I would like to thank the House for extending me the courtesy of hearing me in silence and to acknowledge that I am indeed fortunate to have spoken not once, but now twice, without interruption.",254
188,Mr LES SCOTT ,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"Oxley) (8.38)-1 would like, firstly, to offer my congratulations to the honourable member for Gwydir ( Mr Anderson) on the occasion of his maiden speech. As one of the last members to make a maiden speech in this House, I am very pleased to be able to follow him tonight in the speaking order. Although I may not agree with everything he says, I am sure that he will make a worthwhile contribution to debate in this place. I wish him well for the future, and I am sure that the people of his electorate see him as a young man with a lot of potential and perhaps as a future leader of his Party. I am particularly pleased to be able to support the Appropriation Bills here tonight, following the announcement of the Budget by the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) on Tuesday night. That Budget, of course, was another strong, responsible Budget in the long-term interests of the people of Australia, which has been a constant feature of the Hawke Labor Government's commitment to restructuring the Australian economy. This is, of course, in stark contrast to the negative response that we heard from the Leader of the EmptyHere comment on the continuing savings debate, I am rather surprised that he has continu-d with that, because quite clearly his attitude will only tend to help the better-off rather than the people who really need the help, and certainly will notÂ· do anything at all to encourage enterprises in our community. It appears to me that it is a complete disincentive to business and I am surprised that he is continuing in that vein. But if that is what he wishes to do, no doubt the community will respond accordingly. Having listened to the Leader of the Opposition's speech tonight, I find that we must still wait for some semblance of policies apart from those that are in what is better known as 'Futile Diversions'. In the time available to me tonight I wish to cover a number of aspects of the Budget, in particular the strong commitment to encouraging Australians to provide for their retirement. This has been one of the great achievements of this Government. One of the sure things in life is that we will all grow old and we will all reach a stage when we decide that enough time has been committed to our full time employment and that we should go into retirement. This decision should be one to look forward to with confidence and satisfaction-satisfaction that we have made a worthwhile contribution to our society and confidence that. we will have the security of sufficient income to maintain a comfortable lifestyle and live a fulfilling and rewarding life. We owe a debt to our aged people and we have a duty to provide them with the income and services to guarantee them a secure and dignified lifestyle. Today's standards of medical treatment and health promotion mean that our life expectancy is greater. Not only are we living longer but also more people are surviving to reach retirement age. This trend is worldwide and most countries are now faced with the need to provide services and support for an increasingly ageing population. Although Australia still has a relatively young population, between now and the end of the century the proportion of the population aged 75 and over will increase dramatically. This will mean a rapid rise in the demand for .age pensions and high growth in the need for services to support the aged. To be able to meet this rise in demand and to ensure that an acceptable standard of living can be maintained for those people in retirement, it is vital that every opportunity be provided to encourage and reward people for planning now for their retirement. The Government's approach to this issue is spelt out in the paper Better Incomes: Retirement Income Policy into the Next Century which was issued by the Minister for Social Security ( Mr Howe). One of the important statements in this paper is: It will be possible to meet the needs of an ageing population better by increasing the level of saving and by expanding labour market opportunities. However, future generations will probably expect higher levels of income and services. Consequently, a flexible and sustainable retirement income policy which delivers fair and adequate income needs to build on the twin pillars of the age pension system and private savings such as superannuation. This statement by the Minister clearly outlines the Government's strategy on the question of retirement incomes. Changes announced in the Budget improve superannuation arrangements which will mean that more Australians can save for their retirement, with assistance from the Government. Particular attention has been given to providing better employment and retirement savings opportunities for women. These changes we built on the 3 per cent superannuation benefit that was awarded to Australian workers as part of the Government's accord with the trade union movement. We have now seen the availability of superannuation extended to far more work. ers than was ever the case previously. Historically, superannuation was seen as the sole privilege of the wealthy and some white collar workers. Today, with the expansion of the industry-based schemes and the improvements to the portability of superannuation, the number of workers who belong to a superannuation scheme has. escalated quite dramatically. By June 1989 around 65 per cent of wage and salary earners were covered by an award under which an employer is required to provide superannuation. This is now expected to increase to 80 per cent by the end of this year. But there is still a long way to go. Currently, 7.3 million people are employed. Fifty-one per cent of the employed people belonged to a superannuation scheme in 1988 while only 37 per cent of the employed women have superannuation. The GQyernment has recognised the difficulties faced by women due to their high level of participation in part time work. Award based superannuation has been identified as an important method of providing superannuation coverage to the majority of women. The Government will continue to support extension of occupational superannuation to all employees and for improvements in the schemes in conjunction with the union movement through the next wage rounds. Several other modifications have been announced to make superannuation more available and attractive to women. In addressing the part-time work situation people employed for as little as 10 hours per week will now be able to contribute to personal superannuation schemes and receive the tax deductions for contributions. This has been reduced from the previous minimum requirement of 25 hours per work to be able to contribute to superannuation. Further, people will be able to continue to contribute to personal superannuation schemes for up to two years while outside the paid work force. This measure will mean that women who leave full-time work to start a family will ,be able to maintain their contributions to superannuation funds. New vesting arrangements will also mean that women who leave full time employment will not lose the value of superannuation built up during their working years. Another change will allow for the retirement benefit limits to be determined on the highest average salary instead of the final average salary. This measure will mean that women who leave the work force and then return some time later either on a part-time or full-time basis, often at a low income level, will be able to be assisted. Women have a p-rticularly high reliance on the age pension as a primary, if not a sole, source of income support. These measures should enable that situation to be turned around to provide women with improved levels of retirement incomes in the future. Before moving onto other areas of the retirement incomes policy I believe that it would be appropriate to cover quickly a summary of the. Hawke Government's reforms in the superannuation area. From 1983 this Government has progressively addressed the problems that existed with the previous superannuation arrangements. These included a low level of workers in superannuation schemes; taxation arrangements that provided an incentive for superannuation benefits to be taken in the form of a lump sum rather than as regular income payments; little regulation to ensure superannuation was directed at savings for retirement; the lack of incentives and/or opportunity to preserve benefits until retirement age; and poor portability arrangements. The Government moved in 1983 to reduce the bias against people purchasing annuities and pensions by increasing the tax on the component of lump sums accrued on service after 30 June 1983. To further strengthen the incentive to provide for retirement, rollover vehicles such as approved deposit funds and deferred annuities have been created to allowÂ· benefits to be preserved in a concessional tax environment until retirement on or after a person's fifty-fifth birthday. These roll-over funds also facilitate portability of superannuation when people change employment. In September 1985 the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions agreed to the 3 per cent superannuation provision asÂ· part of the productivity agreement. I have already outlined some of the benefits that have flowed from this decision. To assist in ensuring the superannuation market was properly accountable the Insurance and Superannuation Commission was established in 1987. The Commission administers guidelines by which superannuation schemes have to operate in order to be eligible for tax concessions. Specific improvements have been made in the accountability of funds to members and in the requirements for the vesting and preservation of benefits to protect members' rights. A number of other changes were introduced in 1988. They included the introduction of a tax on fund earnings and employer contributions with offsetting reductions in tax on end benefits. Full imputation credits were granted to superannuation funds, therefore allowing the different forms of income earned by funds to be treated more equitably and encouraging investment iii Australian companies by the funds. Reasonable benefits limits were also reviewed, allowing for an individual's access to the tax concessions available to superannuation benefits. This made the tax concessions for superannuation more equitable and fairer by increasing the amount of concessional savings for those at lower income levels and restricting it at higher levels. The maximum tax deduction for superannuation contributions made by people who are not members of an employer sponsored scheme, or who are self-employed, was doubled from $1,500 to $3,000. That $3,000 limit has now been abolished with particular emphasis on the self-employed and employees who are not members of employer sponsored funds. All of these measures combined with the changes announced in the Budget haveÂ· brought superannuation from an exclusive benefit restricted to a minority of Australians to a truly national savings scheme providing for retirement income which is now available to the majority. Of course this is not only my view; it has been supported by a wide variety of people. I quote just one: The policy is commendable because it would encourage people to provide for themselves for their retirement. 'Commendable' is the assessment by the commentator of the Government's retirement income policy. The commentator was, of course, the former, or is it next, Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard). He knows all about policies, of course; he spent his time as Opposition Leader trying desperately to develop some worthwhile policies. Of course, he did not have any luck. Instead he was saddled with 'Futile Diversions', a book full of hollow motherhood statements which he bravely tried to sell to the electorate icies. So the honourable member learnt what was not a policy. While he may not have been successful in finding a policy he can identify a good policy, a commendable policy, when he sees one. To get back to the issue, the superannuation changes are only one aspect of the whole retirement income policy. As the Minister has pointed out, the age pension will also play a major role. I am particularly proud of the Government's achievement in raising the age pension from 22 per cent of average weekly earnings to an historic level of over 25 per cent of average weekly earnings from April 1990. The Leader of the Opposition made reference to that tonight too. It certainly was something that those opposite were not able to achieve. On top of this the Government will provide an increase in rent assistance over three instalments, bringing it to double its present level. These payments will then be indexed six monthly from March 1991. The Government also announced that from 1995 no age or service pensioners will be paying tax, whether they are in receipt of a full or part pension. The income test free area will also be indexed annually from July 1991. The Government's action in the area of pensions is just another example of its continuing commitment to social justice. These initiatives by the Government have received acclaim from such people as the President of the Australian Council of Social Service, Mr Julian Disney. Mr Disney said that the Budget provides very important improvements for people in hardship. He went on to state that overall the retirement incomes policy is imaginative, well targeted and forward looking, including some essential longer term commitments. The Government's social justice commitment is not limited to one section of the Australian society-and I refer specifically to the aged. Young Australians are also to receive a priority under initiatives announced by the Government in this Budget. I am very fortunate to have in my electorate a number of active community groups working hard to address the needs of our local youth. Among these is the Ipswich Independent Youth Service, which is run by Mr Alf Kalamofoni. Mr Kalamofoni's dedication to this service as pol- was recognised last year when he was awarded the honour of being named citizen of the year of the city of Ipswich. Another group which has only recently commenced operations is Riverview Teen Care, coordinated by Pastor Jeff Ramsey. This group is an offshoot of the Riverview Care Committee, for which I was pleased to be able to assist in obtaining a $200,000 grant under the Federal Government's community sporting and recreation program. It cannot be denied that my electorate has some very serious problems affecting our youth. For this reason I am heartened by the initiatives taken by this Government in the area of social justice and particularly the new programs outlined in this Budget. I will be working to ensure that my electorate receives the full benefits available from these programs. No doubt I will be reminded of them. Homeless young people have been accorded a major priority in this strategy for the future. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in its report on homeless youth highlighted the very serious problems faced by these people. Quite clearly, this section of the community has signalled that the Government's youth strategies needed to be refined and more specifically targeted. As identified in the report, these young people were at risk of becoming permanently alienated from mainstream economic life and developing a long term dependency on welfare. The integrated package of measures will address the immediate needs of the homeless and also tackle the underlying causes; hence the policy is designed not only to address the symptoms of these problems but also to put in place measures aimed at the prevention of the problem. I think it is extremely iInportant that we do something for the prevention rather than the cure. These initiatives will be welcomed by the community groups working with youth in my electorate, I am sure of that. The key elements of the new package include a substantial boost in housing and related assistance for homeless youth. The sum of $5.5m will be committed over the next four years for an innovative adolescent mediation program which will offer assistance to resolve young people's problems and help them to stay at home. A further $17m will be made available over four years under the supported accommodation assistance program to underpin the expansion of accommodation services and to help link homeless youth with other services. Other initiatives provide major improvements in income support, especially for homeless youth and the. 16and 17-year-olds. They are matters which I believe are of considerable importance to the future well-being of this country and its people but apparently they are ignored because I suspect that they have become politically embarrassing to the Government. My colleagues on the front bench will be giving each of these matters considerably more attention in appropriation debates over the coming weeks but the matters I wish to address tonight are structural adjustment, the taxation system and the Australian small business community. An increase of $7.50 a week in the young homeless allowance rate will be effective from January 1990 and will be automatically indexed next year. The sixweek waiting period for the allowance will also be abolished for young people at special risk because of physical or sexual abuse at home and will be reduced to two weeks for others. A number of other measures will address the problems faced by disadvantaged young people associated with participation in education and labour market participation. Another area of the Budget which will provide further opportunities for young people to live a fulfilling life is the extra funding sport. The Minister for theÂ· Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, will announce on 21 August full details of the package to increase the participation rate of the general community in sport and recreational activities. I would strongly suggest that my electorate will be well placed to take advantage of the benefits that will be outlined in the policy release. My electorate of Oxley, based on the city of Ipswich, has produced many outstanding sporting stars of international standard, both men and women. I know that these initiatives of the Hawke Government will be well received by my local sporting bodies. We need only to look at some of our rugby league greats to know where many great rugby league players have come from over many years. On the issue of sport, another decision of the Hawke Government, that from this financial year all non-profit sport and game clubs, societies and associations will be exempt from tax, will be particularly welcomed by sporting and other groups in my electorate. This issue has been raised with me on a number of occasions and I am pleased to see that that change is taking place. This will extend the previous exemption, which applied only to non-profit clubs, societies and associations promoting animal racing and athletic games or sports. These programs reflect the Government's unique approach to decision-making in which economic policy and social justice objectives are equal partners and implemented in a coordinated and integrated way, particularly through the prices and incomes accord. I am pleased to offer my full support for these Appropriation Bills. I know that many of the initiatives taken will go a long way to helping many of our ordinary Australians.",258
189,Mr MACKELLAR ,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"Warringah) (8.58)Before I discuss the Budget, the Appropriation Bills, I would like to bring up three matters of some concern to me. The first relates to a division called by the Opposition earlier in the day, when the fact that a division had been called was not flashed on the screens around Parliament House until about half way through the ringing of the bells. Secondly, and more importantly, I draw to the attention of the House-and I have for already mentioned this to the Clerk-the fact that the bells did not ring at 25 past seven tonight, prior to the Leader of the EmptyHere Having been in this place for some time, it is a matter of some concern to me that the only time the bells have not rung for the resumption of the sitting was when a significant speech by the Opposition was about to be made. I do not draw any inference from that it is probably just a coincidence-but I draw it to the attention of those in control of the House that it is simply not good enough. Thirdly, I draw to the attention of the House my absolute delight at the maiden speech of the honourable member for Gwydir ( Mr Anderson) here this evening. Anybody who listened to that speech would be assured that here was a young man with a great future in this place. I speak with some interest in this matter because I come originally from the electorate of Gwydir. He did not mention the town which I am very proud to call home, the town of Baan Baa. Everybody knows, of course, where Baan Baa is-halfway between Boggabri and Narrabri. It is a very famous town! Members of the MacKellar family had some interest and influence in the campaign waged by the honourable member for Gwydir and I am absolutely delighted not only that he is here but also that he made his contribution in such a very thoughtful and worthwhile way tonight: Having said that, I want to give some attention to several matters which received little or in fact no attention in the 1989 Budget statement of the Treasurer ( Mr Keating). In looking firstly at structural justment the first observation that must be made is the apparently almost universal acceptance of its need if Australia is to maintain its place as a major trading nation in the world scheme of things and prevent what will otherwise be a long and painful slide down the standard of living ladder to the banana republic status much heralded by the Treasurer just two years ago. The dispute about restructuring within this country is not over the principle of restructuring but the means and pace by which it is to be achieved. It is this dispute among Labor parliamentarians that unfortunately has brought the Hawke Government's structural adjustment program to a dead stop in the 1989 Budget. Past statements and speeches by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer have been alive with the need for structural adjustment and there has been some detailing of the micro-economic reforms which they would envisage to achieve such an objective. For example, in the Treasurer's 1986 Budget Statement he talked of the then trend in the current account as being: ... the beginning of the necessary structural adjustments which I have described-the switching to new products and activities. At other times there have been indications of the Prime Minister's intentions to privatise a number of important government instrumentalities, such as Qantas Airways Ltd and the Commonwealth Bank. As recently as March 1989 the Australian Financial Review stated: Mr Hawke made it clear that he wanted the issue (of privatisation) settled quickly. However, and here lies the nub of the problem facing the Hawke Government, the. day after the Prime Minister made that statement a senior Minister, Mr Howe, was quoted in the Canberra Times as saying: I don't think privatisation has any support within the Labor Party. And how right he was. Two days later in the Australian Financial Review several Labor senators were quoted as saying: We know that this opposition (to privatisation) is shared throughout the whole Labor movement. There, of course, lies the reason why the Hawke Government structural adjustment or ad- program of micro-economic reform has stalled. The Hawke Government is seriously divided on this vital issue and so much so that the subject has apparently been dropped from the agenda at the very time when there is the most pressing need for the momentum of restructuring to be maintained or even increased. I am a great believer that, despite the complexities of our modern economy and of society, the ills which we presently suffer can be brought back to certain fundamental issues. One of our fundamental problems is the underlying lack of international competitiveness in our productive resources. The most obvious indication of this malaise is the recurring and serious current account deficits we suffer and the debilitating effect they have on government policy and the domestic economy. We know the problem exists. We know what is causing it and there is ample evidence that there are some progressive Labor parliamentarians within the Hawke Government who appreciate the need for energetic reform. But what do we see as a result of that need? Simply nothing! The problems with Australia's coastal shipping and waterfront industries have been clearly documented by several investigative bodies and inquiries and their findings must have convinced all but the most stubborn that the national cost of these malpractices is so great that major and urgent reform is needed. There is simply no doubt about that. There is universal appreciation of those facts. The Treasurer would have us believe-and I quote from the Budget statement-that: Far reaching reforms have extended to the front ... What do we find? Respected industry organisations and commentators are on record as stating that the coastal shipping and waterfront reforms announced by the Government last June are, at best, only a partial and inadequate response to the problem. Reforms of the Australian railway system are also needed, as are reforms of work practices and the pricing policiesÂ· of public utilities, just to name a few. None of this is happening at the pace dictated by the present state of the Australian economy. The inescapable conclusion is that the Hawke Government simply does not have the political willpower to act. It might not just be a case of willpower. Of course, the Government does not have the authority. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer know what should be done. I believe that they understand what should be done. I also know that they simply do not have the political power to act in the way they know that they should. Why? It is because they are dictated to, as Labor governments always are, by the trade union movement outside this Parliament. They are dictated to by the labour movement. They are the captives of the labour movement. Because they are the captives of the labour movement, they simply cannot do the things which they know, in their hearts, should be done for the future of this country. I ask my colleagues on the Labor benches to reconcile this state of affairs with the statement made by the Treasurer in this place just two nights ago: We are much further down the road of that fundamental restructuring than we were a year ago. There is simply no reconciliation because the Treasurer is doing what he does best. He is allowing political rhetoric to get well ahead of economic and practical reality. His 1988 Budget was riddled with exaggerated claims and predictions, and he inevitably carries that reputation into this year's statement. Having said that, I now turn to the question of taxation. I find myself somewhat bemused by the Treasurer's statement that: The Government has reformed the Australian taxation system, making it both fairer and more efficient. We have heard that statement parroted by so many of the spokesmen for the Governwaterment parties-fairer and more efficient. One would think that people were paying less tax. If one listens to the Government spokesmen one would almost be convinced that they actually believe that. I am bemused not only because it is not correct but also because a very similar statement has occurred in each of the last four Budget statements. Those statements, I remind the House, were brought down by the present Treasurer. He said the same sorts of things in the last four statements. The only conclusion that I can draw from this annual episode of exaggerated self-congratulation is that the terms 'fairer' and 'more efficient' have elastic qualities of gigantic proportions. What I particularly want to draw to honourable members' attention is that total taxation revenue has increased over the sixyear period of the Hawke Government byguess how much, Mr Deputy Speaker? I am sure that if you were given that test in a Trivial Pursuit question, or even in a more serious examination, you would probably come up with a figure somewhat less than 103 per cent. But that is the answer. Total taxation revenue has increased over the sixyear period of the Hawke Government by 103 per cent, from $45 billion to $91 billion. According to the Treasurer, this is a low taxing government. This is a fair taxing government. What have we in reality? We have the largest increase that has occurred under any Australian government. We have the biggest taxing Australian government. in Federal history. In six years, total taxatIon revenue has increased by 103 per cent; by $45 billion, bringing it to $91 billion. Within that total, income tax revenue has increased, not by 103 per cent, Mr Deputy Speaker, but by 122 per cent. How much has sales tax revenue gone up within those six years? Let us remember-'fair taxation'. Sales tax revenue has gone up by 122 per cent. I honestly do not know how members of the Labor Government and supporters of the Labor Party can face the electorate and say that we have a fair taxation system which is clawing back the tax paid by Australian families: 103 per cent for total tax revenue, 122 per cent for income tax, and 152 per cent for sales tax, are the measures of the increases. Sales tax this year will contribute 11 per cent of revenue and the rate of growth of that contribution is such that there can be little doubt that the Treasurer is surreptitiously introducing his desired option C consumption tax of 1984-85. A lot of people have forgotten that the Treasurer was pretty keen on a consumption tax back in 1984-85. He wanted it. Option C, it was called. What do we have after these years of Labor Government in Australia? Sales tax, which I remind honourable members is a consumption tax, has increased by 152 per cent. Sales tax is being applied in a most insidious manner by this Government because increases and changes are being made by stealth and are being applied so as to create anomalies and distortions. They are impacting heavily on the prices paid by low and middle income earners. They have a significant influence in pushing Australia's inflation rate to almost twice that of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. I hear every day in this Parliament the Treasurer get up and say what a terrific job he is doing-'We are doing so well'. He is very convincing when one listens to him. One has to keep asking oneself, 'Why are we in such a terrible way internationally? Why is Australia's international economic position so bad if the Treasurer is doing such a tremendous job?'. It is so bad; everybody knows it is so bad. Our balance of payments deficit is growing every quarter by record amounts. We would not believe it, to listen to the Treasurer. He says we are doing pretty well. When we have a look at the facts, what do we find? Australia's inflation rate is almost twice that of our OECD compatriots. This is an irrational and unfair approach to taxation. What can possibly justify taxes on orange juice, flavoured milks, plastic shopping bags, and snack foods, particularly when many luxury goods are exempt? Why is it that a cup and saucer incur a 10 per cent sales tax, but the tea itself is exempt, unless of course it is herbal tea, in which case it attracts a 20 per cent sales tax? I remind the House that the consumption tax proposed at option C of the Treasurer's 1984-85 tax reform package was to be an across the board 12.5 per cent, whereas the sales tax regime he is now putting into place achieves 82 per cent of its revenue from sales tax rates of 20 per cent or higher-not 12.5 per cent, but 20 per cent or higher. Given those sorts of facts, which we never hear the Treasurer talk about, no wonder he is able to achieve what he says is a Budget surplus of $9.1 billion. Far from being a fairer and more efficient tax, a not insignificant portion of the blame for Australia's present ills must be placed at the feet of this tax regime, which is complex and distortive in the message it signals to borrowers and those attracted to tax havens and unjust in its double dipping effects on pay as you earn taxpayers. Finally, I want to address some remarks to the Government's treatment of a section of the Australian economy which I believe is the very backbone of employment and economic growth. I refer to small businesses. Their important contribution to the economy is well recognised, as are the severe difficulties and the hostile government attitudes which increasingly they have faced over recent years. Despite promises to the contrary, the Hawke Government has almost totally ignored their plight. In this Budget, for instance, the Government has restricted itself to one concession: an increase from $12,000 to $50,000 in the turnover exemption threshold for sales tax. Small business has waited 10 years for any increase in this exemption and the new exemption represents a turnover of only $1,000 per week-a figure which, in these inflated times, is still far too low to be of any real assistance for most small businesses. Against that token concession, small businesses must continue to battle with a sales tax collection system which forces them to collect sales tax on behalf of the Government, absorb a further 3 per cent compulsory superannuation levy, and continue to trade in an environment of crippling interest rates, high inflation and deteriorating purchasing power. Small business, particularly in my electorate of Warringah, is the very backbone of enterprise, initiative, entrepreneurship and employment. Any responsible government will do all it can to encourage the characteristics that I have mentioned-initiative and entrepreneurship-in the Australian community so that we can, as a country, do what this side of the Parliament would like to see us do: that is, trade ourselves out of our difficulties. I refer again to the Treasurer's introductory remarks in his Budget Statement about Australia being further down the road of restructuring than it was a year ago. Just in the three important areas of economic activity on which I have commented tonight there is ample evidence that little real progress has been made over the past 12 months. To use the Treasurer's analogy of being down a road, I believe it would be more accurate to suggest that this country has been stalled on that road for some considerable time while we wait for flood waters to subside. We are not just waiting for flood waters to subside: anybody travelling on Australia's roads at present would be. aware-because of their uncompleted nature and potholes, and the very danger that they pose to life and limb and mechanical rectitude-that if their condition is anything like the Government's economic policies we are on a disaster course rather than a course which will encourage the thought that we may have some smooth motoring. That is simply not the case.",262
190,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"Mr Blaochard)-Before calling the next speaker, I indicate that the honourable member for Warringah referred to two incidents concerning bells which failed to ring this afternoon. I understand that this was due to a technical fault, which will be investigated. I agree with the honourable. member that it was a most unfortunate incident. I call the honourable member forÂ· Eden-Monaro.",266
191,Mr SNOW ,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"Eden-Monaro) (9.18)-1 would like to take some words-a little trinket-from a speech of small consequence EmptyHere cock). He said that Australians want to be involved in decisions that are being made. That is true. For too long Australians felt that they were not involved in decisions being made. Let us look at how Australians have been involved in decisions which have been made in this Budget. I turn first to the area of retirement. A few months ago at a retirement task force meeting convened by me in Queanbeyan representatives of the Bega Valley, Eurobodalla, Tallaganda, Cooma-Monaro and Bombala shires and the cities of Queanbeyan and Shoal haven called for the income tax threshold to be raised for pensioners. This has happened. The threshold is expected to increase to $8,190 before any tax is paid and no part or full pensioner will pay any tax by 1995 when tax will have been reduced to nil in three stages. In April 1990 pension rates will be increased by $4, which is more than the foreshadowed $9 adjustment, representing a $13 rise for single pensioners. Private rental assistance for pensioners and other low income groups will increase. Superannuation will be available to 80 per cent of employees. This will mean a big increase in national savings. I congratulate all those who put their views at the task force meeting at Queanbeyan, the Government on accepting their views and a wide range of other people who were visited by the retirement task force. (Quorum formed) Prior to the calling of the quorum I reminded honourable members of a little trinket from the unmemorable speech of the Leader of the Opposition when he said that Australians wanted to be involved in decisions being made. I pointed out how Australians were involved in a great Government decision on retirement incomes. Superannuation will be available to 80 per cent of employees under the Budget and this will mean a big increase in national savings. So I congratulate all those who put their views to the task force at Queanbeyan. As well as those people, there were individual Â·people in Eden-Monaro and throughout Australia who put representations to the Government, which led to some of the decisions of the Government. Thanks to representations by people such as Richard Murray, a potter from Braidwood, sales tax exemption for manufacturers will be raised from $12,000 in sales at the moment to $50,000. Richard and his wife, Sue, had worked with me over four or five years to have this sales tax exemption raised and we have succeeded. They were delighted when I rang them yesterday and told them about the success of their representation and those of other manufacturers throughout Australia. I turn next to youth accommodation. Not very long ago I attended the annual meeting of the Eurobodalla youth refuge. It had been called so that the refuge could consider the need for further funds for medium and long term assistance for homeless young people. Again, an extra $100m has been provided in this Budget for homeless youth-not because it was decided by the sort of inner sanctum that the Leader of the Opposition talked about, but because of representations well put and well heard by Government members, policy committees and by the members of Cabinet. Pony, fishing and football clubs made strong representations. Pony clubs all over the south coast, the Monaro, the tablelands and other areas throughout Australia brought representations to the Government. I am sure that honourable members who are here tonight were involved in conveying those representations. As a result of those representations those and other sporting clubs and service clubs such as Lions, Apex and Rotary will be exempt from sales tax. One of the great benefits of the Budget was, of course, interest rates. The higher Budget surplus will mean that the Government will continue to avoid any overseas borrowing and will continue to pay back the debt of a few years ago. This should further ease pressure on the money market and reduce demand for money. Thus interest rates should fall. So, far from saying that individual people and groups have not had an input into the Budget, I would like to congratulate the local people of Eden-Monaro and throughout Australia and the interest groups throughout Australia on their constructive input to the Budget over the year. Democracy has been working and has been shown to be working in this Budget. The Leader of the Opposition then talked about his parties introducing a new morality in industrial relations. This new morality is labour market deregulation-a morality which leaves the wages to the boss. Wages awards would go out of the window for most businesses, especially country businesses. The vast majority of ethical owners and managers will not like it. They like an award. They like to know what is considered by societythrough industrial tribunals-to be fair wages and contributions. The trouble with our world is that there is occasionally an unscrupulous boss, the type who might say, 'Sorry, Mary', or 'Sorry, Bill, I can't afford to pay you more than $5 an hour', or whatever the super-low rate to be set in legislation by a mythical PeacockHewson Budget was. If Mary or Bill lives in a small town, there would very likely be little choice-take the $5 or be out of a job. People will become commodities on a shelf. I realise that the coalition is astonished at the courage of the Hawke Government in deregulating or freeing the dollar, the airlines, oil marketing, government enterprises, shipping, the waterfront, broadcasting and aviation. The Liberal and National parties apparently think they will get on the band wagon. They have decided to deregulate people's rights. Not long after the turn of the century a tribunal in this country found that people had a right to an income which would cover living costs. That is how far back the MCLachlans, the Hewsons, the Stones and, on the leash or delicate tether, a reluctant Opposition Leader, will all go. This old philosophy from nineteenth century England is, just as child labour was then, economically unsound. In the cities, but only where the unions are strong, wages would rise. In the country, and in the cities as well, weakly un ionised small businesses incomes would drop. Even the many ethical owners will be forced by competition to drop wages. Labour market deregulation is like deregulation of any natural resource: it is wasteful. But, unlike minerals, timber or fish, it relates to our most precious resource-people. This is what the coalition is asking us to deregulate. It is also asking us to take action against people with its education policies, its policies on Medicare and a wide range of other human, particularly welfare, policies. I think of education. What will happen to Austudy under a coalition government? It seems to me that it would go. Honourable members opposite are talking about scholarships and loans. Those who cannot win a scholarship will apparently have to take out a loan, or will have to pay their own way right through education. I know which system most Australian young people and most Australian parents would prefer. They would prefer the present Austudy system. Then there is Medicare. These opposite seem to be proposing that people should forced into private funds. I suppose that will take the two million who have come under health insurance under this Governis ment back out of health insurance; it will bring back high debts in doctors' surgeries; and it will again give us a huge number people who are unable to afford treatment. That is the sort of policy those opposite have for people. Even with commodities the Opposition has gone too far-commodities such as our telesurplus communications industry. The Opposition proposing to sell off the more lucrative parts of Telecom and Australia Post, allowing competition in the areas where they are making a profit so that people in areas where they are not making quite as big a profit, such as country areas, will pay more, or people will pay more taxes to cover costs, or, more probably, there will duced services in those areas in both postal and telecommunications services. There is definite proposal by the Opposition to off the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corto poration, now situated in Cooma. What will happen? What will happen to the 300 people-the 300 families-in Coomaand on whom the Cooma economy depends if Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation is sold off? Let there be no doubt that, if one of the larger Australian consultant firms bought out the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corand, poration, the Corporation would go from the Cooma. Cooma would no longer have the and Corporation. It is true that the Corporation is offering, as the Government at the mobusinesses-know ment is offering, equity to staff in the Corin poration. But this equity is not going to be this century. taken up at anything like the rate that it would have to be taken up to preclude its sale to a major industry. Then there is the Commonwealth Trading Bank. It is true that the Commonwealth before. Bank is a trading bank like any other trading bank, but it is also true that in many areas where there is not a branch of the Commonends wealth Bank people would very much like to have one because it introduces competiAustralian tion into the local area. The Commonwealth Bank does take initiatives and does make finance available, in some cases, where it is not made available by other banks. I want to coriclude by saying that through be the Budget that we have before us the Govthat ernment has shown, as it has shown since 1983, a degree of fiscal responsibility which unprecedented, I believe, in this nation's history. In difficult times it has taken a whole range of courageous decisions. That responof sible attitude was absolutely necessary if Australia as a nation was to tackle a very high external debt liability, and it is going to make-as it is already making-the economy operate more efficiently. The entire Budget of $9 billion, compared with a deficit is of over $9 billion which was foreshadowed when we came into government, will be used to continue repaying debt. The Budget is a responsible one. I congratulate the Government on its introduction. I strongly support it and I am confident that it is going to reflect the views of the Australian people as the we come through the coming year. I am be repleased to support the Budget.",266
192,Mr JULL ,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"Fadden) (9.34)-Listening this a evening to the honourable member for Edensell Monaro ( Mr Snow), one would almost come the conclusion that Australia was some sort of Utopia, that everything was rosy, that there was nothing much wrong, that democracy reigned supreme, and that people who belong to pony clubs can get their sales tax and other tax relief purely by approaching the Budget, and away we go. The fact is that Australia is not a Utopia at the moment; indeed, the real people of Australiapeople who are out there trying to battleÂ· to make their living, trying to bring up their families, and trying to support their very well that Australia is, fact, in one of the most critical phases of There is no doubt that the present policies of this Government are causing very great hardship indeed. There is no doubt that we are paying more taxation than ever we have There is no doubt that interest rates are through the roof. There is no doubt that Australian families are struggling to make meet. Let us be perfectly clear about this particular Budget-it gives the average family very little hope indeed. That is the tragedy of it all. At a time when there is money flying all around the country to support all sorts of interest groups-many of those interest groups are very worthyof very little has been done in this Budget make life easier for the average Australian, for the person who is really trying to get along. I would think that around Australia toinitiative, night, even though the newspaper headlines have billed this as an election Budget, are people who are very concerned about what their futures might be. I suppose the firstly Labor Party, as much as the Opposition parall ties, relies on market research. Its market research would be showing that at the molike ment the average Australian is hurting so much that in many of the mortgage belt Institute areas of Australia, a massive landslide against this Government is building up. If this is election Budget, if the Government truly thinks that it can win the next election on this Budget, probably the best thing that could happen would be to go to an early election now so that we can get some proper management into Australia, so that we can provide some genuine relief for the average Australian family which, as I said, is hurting like it has never hurt before. In the limited time. I have tonight I would like to concentrate my comments on the three portfolios for which I have a shadow Minister's responsibility. I will concentrate on the areas of tourism, aviation, and sport, because they are three areas that indicate that this Government is tired, has lost its way, is quite arrogant, and, frankly, has not got a clue where it is going. While here and hear the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) say that we are in the hands of great economic managers, let me say that in those three areas alone the Government has a lot to answer for because the one thing that tourism, aviation and sport have not got this cOl.mtry at the moment is management. It seems interesting to me that all the major bodies that are exercising Government policy at the moment are without management. There is no management in the Ausproperly. tralian Sports Commission. The Government cannot get somebody to head that body. There is no General Manager of Qantas Airin ways Ltd. The Government cannot get anymake body to take on that position. There is no management on the horizon for Australian Airlines. Mr Strong has left and it cannot get a manager. There is no General Manager the Australian Tourist Commission at the to moment. These three vital areas of Australian society, these three areas that have so much to contribute to the welfare of Australia, are being stifled because of a lack of a lack of care, a lack of dedication, and a lack of commitment from this Governthere ment and the Ministers concerned. Let me look at the Budget figures. I turn to sport. I suppose it is fair to say that Australians have an interest in sport. All Australians follow the activities of bodies the Australian Institute of Sport with great interest indeed. Next Monday, at the of Sport, we will be treated to the unveiling of the massive new sports program an by Senator Richardson, because of a tremendous effort by the Government in introducing another $44 million into sport funding in Australia, in addition to what was allocated last year. The plain facts are that the money being allocated is a catch-up mechanism, because sport funding in this country in recent years in fact has declined in real terms. I will not knock the Government for providing $21.5 million additional funding this year for sport. I think it is absoluteJy magnificent. But the real question that we have to ask, and the real concern that is in the sporting community at the moment, is simply this: it does not know where the funding is going; it knows there is no management of that funding; and it is concerned that the funding could well be wasted unleSS it is put we sit in the right direction. One of the concerns is that perhaps too much of that funding will go to elite sports. We, on this side of the House, believe that our elite sportsmen should have the right in support and the proper funding. But we also believe in a policy of sport for all. We believe that this Government must be dedicated and committed to ensuring that the administration of sport in Australia is done All of us in this House would be concerned about the problems facing sportsmen terms of certain drugs. We have got to sure that we do have the right management of the anti-drugs program in sport. We have got to make sure that our junior sportsmen are supported all the way down the line. We have got to make sure that the disabled get their fair share of the allocation as, indeed, the whole spectrum of the sporting personnel do. There is a lack of confidence in the Australian sporting community at the moment that this Government, despite the fact that it has given this extra money, may not be able to deliver the goods. I turn now to the area of tourism. One of the great tragedies of this Budget is the fact that the Australian Tourist Commission has had its funding for this year reduced in real terms by a massive 15 per cent. Is that not the most stupid thing that one has ever heard? At a time when the only industry in Australia that is in a growth situation is tourism, when the only industry in Australia providing increased employment is tourism, when Australian tourism figures are in fact flattening, what does this Government do? It reduces the Tourist Commission's expenditure in real terms by 15 per cent. It should be obvious to those on the Government benches with even the meanest intelligence that, at a time when the indications are that growth might start to flatten, we should be promoting tourism like we have never done before. Once again, it is a case of a government that is tired, that has no commitment, that is arrogant and that has lost its way. The Government refuses even to provide adequate support for our only growth industry, an industry that in fact is now earning for us the second largest amount of export dollars of any Australian industry. The tragedy of that funding cut to the Australian Tourist Commission is going to be felt over this next year and, indeed, for some years to come. That situation, married with the total mismanagement of Australia's transport and aviation sector, could well spell disaster for Australia. This afternoon the domestic airline pilots of Australia decided they were going to pull on a strike. They are going to work from 9 o'clock in the morning till 5 o'clock in the afternoon and to hell with Australia. I say, Mr Deputy Speaker, to hell with the airline pilots because what they are going to do to the tourist industry of Australia will cause damage that will take years and years to repair. You can bet your life, Mr Deputy Speaker, that around the world at the moment the - telexes are running hot with advice to the inbound tour operators such as, 'Hey, Australia's in trouble; pull off those tour groups. Don't send them in there. There is going to be chaos'. That strike has been on the agenda for months, but it is very closely related to another one that is doing us damage. Tomorrow the air traffic controllers are to go before the Industrial Relations Commission for further discussions of their award. For eight months we have had total disruption of our airline services through Sydney. Some people may have a little bit of sympathy for the air traffic controllers, some may not. But the plain facts are that the air traffic controllers are using very legitimate reasons to pull on their industrial action. Those reasons are simply that there has been a total neglect of the aviation infrastructure in Australia for years, a total lack of direction and mismanagement of the 20-year-old equipment that we have now. And if it is not bad enough in Sydney, we also have problems with radar systems in Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. Then, we have the daddy of them all, the absolute disaster that is Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. What have we seen from the Government in that regard?-absolute procrastination. In 1983 it was decided to build a third runway for Sydney. This Government came to power in 1984 and said, 'No, we are not going to go ahead with it', despite the fact that the growth in the _volume of traffic through Sydney Airport was such that the airport had almost reached capacity. We saw what was on the horizon with the tremendous growth of airline traffic in and out of Australia, yet nothing was dOIW. We know of the drama that went on in this place with the honourable member for EmptyHere ister. He did all he could to make sure that the only real solution to Sydney's international airport-the building of a third runway-would be stopped. The Government is procrastinating once again as to whetherÂ· it will build a third runway. We have an environmental impact study going on at the moment that is going to take 18 months to complete, well beyond the next election-and Sydney chokes. It not only the tourism business that is choking because of the problems with Sydney AirSport, port; it is Australian business. It is costing the people of Sydney-the people of Austhe tralia-millions and millions of dollars cause this facility has not been well managed. Once again the Government has lost its way. The Government will not do what must be done to bring Sydney Airport up to scratch and to make sure itÂ· serves as the major gateway to Australia. It is a very sad reflection on this Governfor ment that we have reached the stage where Australia-that great growth industry, tourdue ism-is being held to ransom by two industrial disputes: the air traffic controllers dispute and the domestic airline pilots dispute. While it is all very wellÂ· for the Prime Minister Hawke) to stand up here, as he has done now for eight months, talking about how he is going to resolve the air traffic controllers strike, still we have seen nothing happen. supported his answer the other day, when he was asked about the proposed strike by airline pilots. Now let us see whether there is any action, whether this Government has the intestinal fortitude to bring Australia's industrial relations situation to heel and to make sure that these vital industries are crippled. It is all very well for the honourable member for Eden-Monaro ( Mr Snow) to get up had gone ahead. and say, 'Those dreadful people over on the other side, what they are going to do to the industrial relations of Australia is nobody's business'. But there is a realisation on this side of the House that one of the things we must do for Australia is undertake microlost economic reform. We must make sure that our essential services-and that includes aviation and the aviation support indusfastest tries-are covered in such a way by essential trouble. services legislation that we cannot be held to ransom and the jobs of Australians cannot be threatened because of a handful of airline pilots who are going for a massive salary increase. That is one of the real areas of economic reform we will be undertaking. give a pledge that those vital industries of Australia will not be held to ransom by these wildcat strikes. If we look further at the allocations for the tourism portfolio, we see other things is that obviously must cause us some concern. It was interesting that the Minister for Arts, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) was trumpeting other day that Australia was going to bemake a great effort in regard to the 1992 International Exposition in Spain. We support that. We know the tremendous benefits that expositions can bring to Australia. We remember the Brisbane Expo last year. We know where Australia's vital interests lie but do we also know that that self same Minister Tourism just a few weeks ago, pulled Australia out of another exposition, that was to be held in Japan later this year? Japan is one of our richest sources of international tourists. The Japanese have been. coming here in their droves, and the Japa( Mr nese figures are still on an upward trend. When the Japanese visit places like the Gold Coast they spend at least $160 per head per day, excluding their air fares and accommoI dation. But no. We said 'We'll get out of that one', despite the fact that, when Japan the became involved in the Queensland Expo, certain guarantees were given that Australia would participate in the Expo in Japan this year. The Government says that the decision is based on savings considerations, but I really not wonder what the promotional benefits of being part of that Japanese Expo might have been in terms of earning for Australia if it Once again, I think it is ample evidence that in terms of promoting and managing the tourist industry the Government should be there giving the industry direction. This Government has failed because it is tired, it has its way, it cannot manage, it does not know what to do. It is sad to reflect as we go through these Budget figures that our growing industry is in this sort of Mr Deputy Speaker, I made mention of the very real difficulties that are being faced in the international aviation sector because of the problems at Sydney Airport. I was delighted to hear the honourable member for We Eden-Monaro congratulate the Government on the fact that it has decided to deregulate the domestic airline industry. It is true that come 31 October next year domestic aviation services will be deregulated. One of the things that deregulation was designed to do was to bring more competition into the system. I would think that as we .move towards 31 October next year we may see some superficial competition between the two major carriers, Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines. One of the real points about deregulation was allegedly the opening up of the system to new players. When expressions of interest in aviation services were first called for some 21 consortia said that they were interested in operating another airline for Australia and interested in giving some competition. In actual fact, Mr Deputy Speaker, that number has dropped to two. One of the reasons that so many players have left that particular scene is that the actions of this Government do not match its rhetoric. There has been a real problem in terms of the extra traffic that will go into Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. Despite the fact that the Government has been making noises about the tremendous benefits of deregulation it is interesting that the night before deregulation was announced the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and other members of the Government went into a back room of this place and made sure that an agreement was signed for 20 year leases with Ansett and Australian Airlines. This virtually ensured that no new carrier could ever get into the system. I know a lot of work has been done now to look at the legality of those leases. The fact that we still have two new players in there wanting to get into the system must give us some hope, but they say that under the terms of those leases and the two gates system available it would be virtually impossible for them to operate in this particular climate. I know that the Federal Airports Corporation is very worried at the moment because if one of those carriers gets up it will demand space. I think the F AC is probably trying to do its best to provide terminal space in Sydney. But if the people of Australia believe that the Government is going to deliver them cheaper airline services, and if the tourist industry really believes that it is going to get some tremendous benefits from a reduction in fares, I sincerely hope that they have a little more confidence in this Government than I do at the moment. The thing that really worries me, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that in October next year the coalition parties will be in governmentÂ· and there will be a sense of expectation out there. I just hope that we have the capacity to deliver after the neglect and mismanagement of this Government. What we need is a government for Australia, a government of vision. We need a government of new ideas. We need a government of commitment. We need a government that is prepared to go in there and make the hard decisions. We need a government that is prepared to undertake the micro-economic reform that Australia so urgently needs. We need a government of new faces, of new ideas, of new commitment, of new dedication and the coalition parties are prepared to deliver that government whenever the next election may be. This is billed as an election Budget. Let us bring on the election and get some decent government back for Australia.",268
193,Mr CUNNINGHAM ,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"MCMillan) (9.54) - I support the Government's Appropriation Bill. I listened to the honourable member for Fadden ( Mr Jull) speak about his shadow portfolio responsibilities. It was very interesting that he talked a lot of the time about the airline industry and the pilots. That is very topical tonight, as tomorrow there will be great disruption. Everybody condemns what the pilots have done. It was very interesting to hear those comments following tonight's statement by the Leader of the EmptyHere Opposition policy to have wage bargaining. No doubt many sectors of industry would be in there barrelling to bet the biggest wage increase possible, totally distorting the economy. That is what happened when the Opposition was in government. So it was very interesting to hear what the honourable member said. At the same time, the Opposition claims to condemn what the pilots are doing, .but that is the very thing that they support, according to the Opposition Leader's speech tonight. The honourable member for Fadden talked about people hurting and that is the area I want to talk about tonight. We have heard it said a lot that at present people are hurting and because of this there is something drastic about what the Government is doing. I would like to go into history a little just to put in context what I believe to be the situation in relation to people hurting For many years Australia has had commodmistakes ity bDDms and cDmmDdity price busts. They go. back a IDng time. ThDse cDmmDdity price bDDms in the early periDd were well spaced. As we have moved on from the Second we World War they have occurred at much more frequent periods. The first period that people who perhaps would be looking at this Budget would rebig member would be those from the days who clearly remember the booms of the 1920s and the disastrous collapse ih the world economy in the 1930s when we had what approach one would call a massive depression in the world. Following the Second World War we had a boom in Australia and in the early 1950s, following the Korean War, our led the way in Australia in terms of exports. Once again, at that time we had serious problems in the economy when credit rates. squeezes were applied very severely to bring the economy back to a demand situation that could be sustained. We saw that again in 1960-61 period when there was a massive blowout, once again because of commodity prices. What needs to be understood is that an economy, such as Australia's, which has been dependent on income from the rural sector-the primary industry sector-for so long gets real lifts in commodity prices very demand which is generated in the systhere tem comes from the fact that money flows into the hands of the private sector. Under tralia. our tax system that private sector has possession of that money for some 18 months before any of it is drawn off directly into public sector. We saw that in the early 1960s. At that stage the Menzies Government dollar. scraped back into the Federal Parliament one seat in an election held at a time when people were hurting because of an enormous credit squeeze. We saw it again following the boom of the 1973-74 era under the Whitlam Government when there was another massive lift in compolicy modity prices. I was farming at that time and I say that 1973-74 was the year when, as a farmer, I paid the most tax I have paid in my life, simply because farming was very good at that stage- Income was flowing into this economy and it caused enormous demand. I believed at the time that perhaps today. the Whitlam Government had made some in relation to the amount of money that was allowed to flow in the system. The policies that it tried to make work at that time did not draw the demand back in and finished up with a big lift in unemployment. We saw it again in 1979-80. Since 1983, when we came to office, we have had a drop in commodity prices followed by a lift in commodity prices in the period Depression from 1987 to 1989. Policies that have been put in place in the past to try to control such a boom and bust have relied on one particular area. Under the regulated system of the time we always saw the housing industry as the key indicator, the key area, from where the slowwool down was generated when demand had to be brought back into line. The easiest way of doing that was by pegging housing interest If there was a rise in interest rates the first group that ran out of money was the housing industry. Of course, that permeated the out to a massive group-from the people producing the timber right through to thDse producing the white goods and the products for housing as housing in Australia turned when down. Time and time again Australia has gone through such a repetitive pDsition. This Government was aware that when we did have that drop in those commodity prices it the was only a matter of cyclical time before would be a lift in our terms of trade once again and money would flow into AusThe policies adopted by this Government have been totally different to. the ones the adopted by conservatives in the past when they regulated the value of the Australian They tried to manipulate the system by in order to bring demand under control by using bureaucratic measures. It worked---:-it worked because those types of operations always relied on creating a pool of unemployed. If we are going to talk about people hurting, let us make a comparison about the at the present time compared to the past. At the present time the high interest rates which are in place at the moment, for ever very good reasons-the same as when they were in place in other periods of Australian history when governments have been required to bring demand under control responsibly-are hurting right across the economy; Every sector of Australia is suffer-Â· ing from that interest rate increase, and it hurting. There is no doubt about that. But because of the previous policies when we had the regulation on housing interest rates, when housing crashed in the early 1980s to 105,000, starts we very quickly saw 200,000 people out of work. Many businesses in. the metal industries, the manufacturers who were making the stoves and the refrigerators, the new items for the kitchen, all had to close their doors simply because they had lost all the demand in Australia. Also at the same time, because of an overvalued dollar, they ran into a massive inflow of competition, as a result of cheap prices, from overseas. So those past policies, of course, were set in place to withdraw demand. But let us see whether, as the honourable member for Fadden suggested, all people were hurting. They were not. At that time the whole load went onto the unemployed, the 200,000 family breadwinners who lost their jobs. They were not worried about high interestÂ· rates. Those 200,000 families could not meet a family payment on a house. They were forced out of their homes. So the people were hurting because of the credit squeeze at that time. But not all of the people were hurting. We clearly remember that theÂ· policies of that time allowed people to be ih the tax avoidance industry and not only not hurting but clearly gaining from those types of policies that were in place. This Budget continues the direction that this Government set in place in 1983. When we were elected our first promise to the people and to the supporters of the Labor movement was that we would create jobs, we would create 500,000 jobs, and if and when we came to deal with the need for another credit squeeze or a tightening in demand we would see that it was not thrown onto the shoulders of a couple of hundred thousand families through unemployment, and would put policies in place that saw the whole community bear some brunt of the hurting. That is what is in place now. Even though we are drawing demand back to a sustainable level, we are still creating jobs. We are still putting people into a position where, whilst they may be paying higher interest rates, the hurt is spread across the community and everybody is carrying the load. A particular family is not being asked to forgo is its job in order to allow another nine families in this community to have a sustainable standard of living. That is what I call a traditional Labor government position. It has never been Labor Party policy, and I hope it never would be, to see one family in 10 being asked to carry the load of bringing demand back under control. I commend this Government, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer for wha.t they have done in relation to this. It is the first government in the history of economics in Australia that has set out to bring demand under control by this method. I am sure that the public out there is starting to realise this-that one can get through a time where demand is being brought under control by higher interest rates provided one has a job. No job, and you have nothing. That is the crux of what this Government is on about, and I commend the Prime Minister and the Treasurer for that. I put it to those people who are listening, who are perhaps reading the Budget, to take it on boardÂ· quite clearly that while some people are hurting, they are all hurting in a way which will see this country come out in the long term, and in the not so far distant future, in a position where everybody will be better off. Following this Budget, there will still be growth in the economy for the next 12 months, but we will not have the massive demand that was generated by that terms of trade turnaround. Now is the time when the Government is collecting taxes from the private recipients of that terms of trade turnaround. Having been a farmer I am aware of what happens in these situations. The farmer receives his money for his product. He works the full year. That money is put in the bank. He then goes to his accountant to have his tax prepared and he has until the next April before he pays his cheque to the Government. In that period a lot of money is invested in the banks, and those banks of course have set out to. see that they earn some interest on it because they are paying interest. But now we are seeing the withdrawal of that money from the system. We have seen the first government ever to have a Budget surplus three years in a row. This is also withdrawing demand from the system right across the economy, not aiming at one family in 10. It is withdrawing money from the system and also paying back some of the Commonwealth Government's debts. So it is a very responsible policy position, one that I believe the people are coming to understand. In fact it is amazing today to speak to so many people in the community who really know some of the jargon that is being spoken about terms of trade and the need to bring the economy under control. There is a good education in the community, and I think the Treasurer's message is certainly getting through on that. Since the announcement of the Budget, in my electorate of MCMillan there has been some interesting comment from the Opposition in relation to it. As honourable members would know most of us have candidates who have been endorsed to run at the next election and most of them are very keen to get their names in the local newspapers and to make some comment on the Budget. Back in my electorate it is truly amazing what the Liberal candidate has set out to do. I have a cutting from the paper of yesterday in which he claims that the Budget holds no joy for the hard working families in MCMillan. Mr MCGauran-So true!",272
194,Mr CUNNINGHAM,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"Well, I would not be surprised if the honourable member for Gippsland did not help him to write this article. The candidate for MCMillan actually lives in the Gippsland electorate because the MCMillan Liberals could not find anybody in MCMillan prepared to run against the sitting member. So they went to Gippsland to see whether they could find anyone. But he claims that hard working families have no joy out of the Budget. Well, let us just have a look at some of the things that this partic- payers. ular, Budget is doing for families. Tax cuts and the family allowance are covered in this Budget. Household incomes and employment areas with wages flowing from the wage tax package announced in April are in this Budget. Continued employment growth of around 2% per cent is in. this Budget. We have increased rent assistance for low income people. This is all part of this Budget. These are all hard working families and hard working families of MCMillan. We have had an extra assistance arrangements from around $15 a week for a single taxpayer on average weekly earnings-this is on the tax cuts and family allowance-and about $30 a week for a family taxpayer with the same income. The extra $15 a week through tax cuts to a single taxpayer on average weekly earnings is equal to an increase of $26 a week, and a taxpayer on $30,000 will receive a tax cut of $16 a week, equal to a wage increase of $28. Family allowances have been raised to $9 a week for each of the first three children and to $12 a week for the fourth and any additional children. The family allowance supplement has been raised by $3.10 a week for children aged between 13 and 15 years, taking the rates to $24 a week, and for children under 13, $34. As a result of these measures a single income family, one of these hard working families in MCMillan on $23,000 per annum with three children, now receives more in support payments than that family pays in tax. Yet that Liberal Party candidate has the cheek to say that there is no joy for hard working families in' MCMillan. He also goes on and says that the surplus of $9.1 billion had come from the pockets of workers. Well, it is very interesting to hear that statement made when we consider that had not the tax cuts been put back into place the actual surplus would have been in excess of $14 billion. That has not just come from the working taxpayer by way of taxes. It has come from the tax base in Australia being put right in the last five years of this Government, where we have seen the tax avoidance industry wiped out. We have seen the end of the free lunches. We have seen the end of allowances for trips away and the other sorts of things that some sectors of the community were able to achieve at the expense of workers and pay as you earn taxThe top rate of tax was previously 60c in the dollar. What a tax rate! No wonder there was a tax avoidance industry. The avoidance industry was caused by incompetent conservative governments that not only created a tax avoidance industry but also, because they could not collect the taxes, borrowed money, thus making the problems in the economy worse. That has all been cured. The surplus has not come from the pockets of workers; it has been achieved because this Government is managing the outlays side and the revenue side of this economy much better than they have ever been handled before. The Liberal Party candidate also says that tax as a percentage of gross domestic proda uct has risen to 25 per cent. That is the level achieved by the Liberal the end of the 1970s.Â· Outlays represent 23; 7 per cent in 1989-90, which is6 percentage points lower than in 1984-85. So when memI bers of the Opposition talk about people hurting, I do not think they really mean that they are concerned about working people, those who generate wealth in this country. They are more concerned that those people who used to have it very good when they were in power are now. hurting. The Leader of the Opposition said tonight that he would abolish the capital gains tax. He would bring back one of the. systems by which people can make m-mey without paying any tax on itthe by investing in capital. That would be a clear move backwards as far as. this country is concerned. I do not think that people in my electoysis rate-or, indeed, many people in Australia as a whole-particularly in the Latrobe ValTuesday ley, have realised the incredibly positive pects for the local economy generated by this Budget. An aspect that will affect people greatly, and which will permeate all areas, relates to the changes to superannuation. perannuation will now become a very major savings component in the economy. More that'. importantly, these changes will free up large amounts of capital in a form in which our . large blue-collar work force can participate. We heard the Treasurer explain to this House today how the superannuation situation has changed so that, rather than an exclusive few gaining by way of superannuation, as occurred under the conservatives, the blueregime collar and the white-collar work force can now all participate. This freed up capital will hopefully be encouraged to stay in our own regions and generate considerable local investment growth, .especially given the structuring program to be embarked upon the economy, and in particular in the trobe Valley area. Another important factor which I dwelt on was the pension and rent assistance rises. A large pool of those recipients reside in electorate. The areas of Morwell, Moe, Trarthe algon and Churchill traditionally have been areas which do not contain high income ilies, and this sort of rent assistance support will be great for them. These rises will inject significant amount of money into the local same economy. Again, that can only have a very Government at positive impact. I fully support the Appropriation Bills and I fullyÂ· support the Government's approach. am sure that people in the community have come to realise that this Government is fair dinkum about its approach and that we will receive from the public its endorsement when we go to the polls within the next 12 months. EmptyHere One of the more interesting aspects of Budget 1989 was the newspaper headlines. It is obvious that our political commentators in the gallery remember their uninhibited praise of Treasurer ( Mr Keating) and the enthusiastic coverage they gave to what has proven to be a massive deception on the Australian people iri 1988. This year we have more caution, more qUeStioning and a better analof the real issues facing this nation. As Paul Lyneham's satirical 7.30 Report on night said, 'Let's separate the reality asfrom theÂ· rhetoric. Look at your last mortgage bill, your empty pay packet and match this reality with the Treasurer's 1988 rhetoric statistics. He said that the consumer price Suindex would be 4.5 per cent at the end of the year. We now know it was almost double The Treasurer's Budget strategy failed last year. It did not reduce interest rates and the current account deficit has escalated. The 1988 Budget failed comprehensively. It imposed depressive interest rates on business, on rural industry and on home owners. I remind this House that this is the second of record interest rates since this Hawke Government took office. My research indicates that only two newspaper commentaries got it right in 1988. The Sydney Morning Herald greeted us that morning after rewith the headline: 'Banks and Brewers lead in chorus of praise'. What a headline for an LaAustralian Labor Party Budget. We, of course, know the bonanza that financial in. stitutions have had as a direct result of this Treasurer's artificially holding up interest my rates. We also know that the reduction in excise on beer, costing the Government at that time $400m in revenue, was nothing fammore than a gimmick and did nothing to reduce inflation to 4.5 per cent as forecast. Of course, the other commentator was John Stone in the Australian on 28 August 1988. Let us just look briefly at some of his comments. He said: I suggest . . . the 1988-89 Budget is likely to be one of the most disappointing for many years. The Budget is a high-risk, high-tax document that does little to address our economic problems. The crux of those problems lies in our continuing balance of payments deficit on current account and the growing foreign debt, and asset sales to foreigners, which financing that deficit requires. Yet, as the Budget documents reveal, our underlying balance of payments position got worse last year not better, and will do so again this year. This budget will benefit anyone receiving some form of welfare (and therefore not paying any taxes) whose tastes run to beer. If, however, you are a reasonably sober middle'income family wage-and-salary earner, paying taxes and struggling to bring up children, you are in for yet another hiding from this high-tax high-risk Budget' Mr Deputy Speaker, I returned to last year's Budget assessment simply to say: Let us forget about charisma, about skillful, smart parliamentary performances, and look a little closer at the real issues. Can this House assume that the Treasurer has done any better this year? Has the Budget addressed the fundamental problems of the Australian economy? Will it do something about the endemic inflation, our low productivity and our appalling levels of national savings? There is no doubt that the real answer is to maintain our standard of living and to increase our productivity growth. Sadly, I believe this is just what this Budget did not do. The Budget will do nothing to increase productivity and our international competitiveness for our wealth-generating export industries. As one parliamentary wit has already suggested, the removal of the pony and fishing club tax was the only new initiative for the rural sector.",275
195,Mr LLOYD ,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"Actually it was forced upon them because of legal action taken by the pony clubs. EmptyHere mentary on our Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin) when this is the only initiative that has come for primary industry, the one sector which has the capacity to improve our trade balance and which, of course, offers the greatest potential for diversity, value adding and general productivity increases. The primary industries will continue to be burdened with high interest rates that have devastated many farming families. In my electorate of Mallee, evictions and forced sales are regular occurrences, with years of endeavour by farming families being destroyed by this Government's policies. But still the penalties go on. Fuel excise in this Budget, as we know, will go up to 23.15c per litre. There will be another 9 per cent hike in fuel excise revenue in 1989-90. This Budget abolishes agricultural machinery bounties, at a two-year cost of $27m. The rural adjustment scheme is to be cut by $2.9m and drought aid over two years suffers a $37m reduction. It is not just primary industry, of course, that is being penalised for its productivity. Many companies will now be forced to pay pay as you earn tax twice a month instead of once a month. While some of the reforms to retirement income are welcome, the benefits are a long way down the track. I intend to return to this later. In other words, in this Budget the Government is collecting revenue now, in advance, but it is to be a late payer. The Budget Papers clearly state that the economic growth of 1988-89 will come not from production but from consumer spending. This will be accomplished by wage growth and income tax cuts. This week's $1.7 billion trade deficit is a clear indication of what is ahead as commodity prices slow down. Imports will continue and the current account deficit will remain at unacceptable levels. Our high debt service ratio adds to this problem as rising interest payments on our escalating foreign debt contribute to our deficit problem. We all know that 63 per cent of all export income is now required to service our foreign debt. Australia's inflation rate is high compared to that of our major trading partners. Tragically, it is double that of countries such as Japan and West Germany. The Hawke Government is still relying on monetary policy only to control demand and, keeping interest rates high has had predictable effects. Firstly, any real benefits to be gained from a deregulated economy have been negated. by direct government action. Secondly, our exchange rate has been inflated to a level that is adversely affecting exports, owing to an inflow of overseas currency. The outlook, therefore, can only be pessimistic. If commodity prices decline-we have had a two per cent decline in the value of exports this year-despite a favourable trading environment and relatively high commodity prices for the last season, clearly our major problem is our lack of competitiveness. It is vital to our economic and social welfare, and yet it has not been satisfactorily addressed in the Budget. Productivity is less than one per cent per annum, the lowest in the Western world. I acknowledge some improvement following wage restructuring, but the fact is that we are still falling behind the rest of the world in productivity increases. We can only improve, or at least maintain, our standard of living by productivity increases or by borrowing. Unfortunately, the Government has. chosen the latter and the results are obvious. Our foreign debt has reached almost $130 billion, quadrupling in the last six years. Borrowing overseas to finance export-oriented industry is not a serious problem if it is adding to our ability to service this debt. However, Australian Bureau of Statistics balance of payments figures for 1988 show that consumption spending has been the major contributor to our current account deficit. Imports of consumption goods rose by 23 per cent and imports of capital goods rose by only 18 per cent for the year. The investment upsurge has been dominated by investment in office buildings and the financial sector. There is hardly any evidence at all of an upsurge in trade related and manufacturing investment. State governments and their instrumentalities have been making increasing use of overseas borrowings to fund their operations, particularly in public transport. This investment earns no foreign exchange return on which to service these loans. Given the magnitude of our foreign debt and the problems this poses for this nation,Â· the quality of information on overseas borrowings needs to be improved to enable a more comprehensive analysis. There is no doubt that Australia is currently living beyond its means. This is an unsustainable position and the longer it continues the narrower the range of policy options that will be available to manage the economy. For example, the Federal government could be forced to push the economy into a deep recession. The current account deficit came in at well over $17 billion for 1988-89, notwithstanding very high commodity prices. It is more than double what it should be to stabilise debt levels. The problem would be exacerbated if we had to face either a drought or a commodity price bust. To stabilise our debt to GDP ratio and to bring the current account deficit down to no more than 2.5 per cent of our GDP our exports would need to grow by between 12 and 15 pet cent relative to our imports. The longer this issue takes to be addressed, the greater our interest bill and thus the stronger the correction that is needed. Interest rates have destroyed any confidence to invest and to expand in business activities. Small business and farmers in particular are fed up with the enormous fluctuations and penalties imposed on them and the horrendous costs of administration, regulation and control. May I briefly in the limited time available refer to some specifics in the Budget. The Budget of course reflects the way this nation has changed both socially and economically. Government members place great store on the small and delayed increases in welfare payments to our needy aged, our handicapped, and our homeless. In fact, the honourable member for MCMillan ( Mr Cunningham) in the last address placed great store on this. But of course increased welfare payments simply point to failure of government. Increased welfare is a sad reflection of a sick economy and the need to support increasing numbers of desperate people. And of course this Budget is a paradox; Traditional services are struggling to survive. Public and private hospitals are under pressure. Aged persons facilities, many of them established through the voluntary effort of communities and the generosity of individuals, are under threat of closure. We can look at our road system. Labor has cut road funding by over 30 per cent in real terms since it came to office and the increase in this Budget represents only 9.5 per cent over the miserly 1988-89 allocation. The most recent indexed increase in fuel excise alone netted the Government an additional estimated $200m, none of which has been earmarked for road funding. As Labor's willingness to tax the motorist has increased, its willingness to spend on roads has decreased and its belated and token increase in road funding cannot conceal its contempt in a nakedly election orientated gesture. May I now refer to an issue related to Budget expenditure, and that is the unilateral decision by the Hawke Government this week to increase postage entitlements for members of parliament from $9,000 to over $30,000. Mr Tim Fischer-Unbelievable! EmptyHere ous decision and it is unbelievable as the honourable member for Farrer says. There is absolutely no way that a member's office could legitimately use the entitlement for genuine electoral work. He would need to write up to 250 letters per day to spend the entitlement. This move is outside any appropriate wage and entitlement structures, any decision of the Remuneration Tribunal, and is a blatant political move aimed at giving the ALP's massive organisational wing a direct mailing capacity through the offices of marginal MPs-and all at taxpayers' expense. This move comes at a time in Budget week when the nation is concerned about the future viability of the Australian economy and about controlling government expenditure. Of course the Government is also proposing, as we have heard this week, free election advertising on radio and television for major political parties. Such a proposal is undemocratic and would stop any new movement or individual from campaigning on a fair basis. I believe we must throw out these proposals because they are an excellent example of this Government's paradoxes and the way that it is prepared to spend taxpayers' money simply for political power. Could I just finally refer to some of the aid projects that are being funded by this Government. I very strongly believe that the levels of aid and the way that aid is distributed throughout the world by a country such as ours are indicative of a caring society. But can we support aid that goes to a country like Brunei-one of the richest nations in the world-that last year received more than $445,000 in aid from thisÂ· country? Some $320,000 was spent on education and student subsidies, $80,000 for health and population programs, $40,000 for agriculture, forestry and fisheries. What this nation is doing is effectively subsidising the Sultan of Brunei, one of the world's richest men and ruler of a nation producing 150,000 barrels of crude oil a day and with the second highest per capita income in the world. Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest this Government get its priorities right. Debate interrupted.

197,Mr MCGAURAN ,ADJOURNMENT,"Gippsland) (10.30)The Treasurer ( Mr Keating) had conceded that the balance of payments deficit for this financial year will be at least $18t billionthat is, if his prediction proves accurate. However, given his track record on prophecies, I would very much suspect that that figure will not be adhered to. After all, this is the man who predicted just 12 months ago that we would have an inflation rate of 4t per cent, but we ended up with an inflation rate of 7t per cent; that we would have a current account deficit of $9t billion and, of course, it turned out to be almost double that. This Government has a responsibility to do something immediately about the balance of payments. It can do so by ditching without any further delay the restrictive, even insane, three-mine policy in regard to uranium exports. There has never been anything more illogical and hurtful to Australia's interests than this three-mine policy. It would make more sense logically and even morally if the Australian Labor Party (ALP) banned all uranium exports. But to say that there is significant and inherent goodness in three particular mines defies logic, however that word is defined. We are costing ourselves hundreds of millions of dollars-at least $600m-in lost export earnings by this insanity. But this is all to do with politics; it is all to do with the internal workings of the Labor Party. There is no doubt at all that the ALP uranium committee of review will decide five to three in favour of a change to the three-mine policy. The form that that change will take remains debatable, but more likely than not there will be an expansion to include Jabiluka and other mines that have developed to a certain level. I have no doubt at all that within Caucus most members of the Centre Left will join with the right wing faction to overrule the lunatics of the Left and adhere to an economically rational policy that is. in the best interests of Australia. But this ful - f devout leftist members is holding the whole ALP to ransom and, in doing so, the desire of the overwhelming majority of Australians to export uranium is being denied. It is a very sad state of affairs for the ALP, let alone the people of Australia, that it can be held to ransom by some of the lunatics of the minority faction within the Left faction itself. I would not wish to tar all members of the Left with the brush that I would use in respect of the honourable member for Hotham ( Mr Kent), the honourable member for La Trobe ( Mr Milton) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr John Scott), all of whom do not have the interests of this country at heart by restricting mining of uranium to such an extent. This is a tragedy for this country. There can never have been a more inconsistent, illogical policy than that settled upon by the Australian Labor Party. The lack of courage displayed by the leaders of the Centre Left and the right wing is really quite breathtaking and, quite frankly, Australia is much the poorer. There is no hope in the world of interest rates being lowered in the short or medium term so long as we have inflation of 7t per cent and a current account deficit of $18t billion. The only way the Treasurer can bring down interest rates by 1t or 2 per cent in readiness for an election is to let the Australian dollar plunge because the only thing that is keeping up the Australian dollar is high interest rates. A plunging Australian dollarand, quite frankly, many within the exporting community would welcome this; many would say that it is in Australia's best interests-would have an effect on the wages accord. The Government boasts about its wages policy, but it is a wages policy based simply on high interest rates. There is no hope at all of relief for home buyers, small business people, farmers, families and working men and women. They have no hope of reaching any acceptable standard of living with interest rates this high.",279

209,Mr MACKELLAR,ADJOURNMENT,"I think one of the most fascinating characteristics of members of the Labor Party, and of this particular member of the Labor Party, is that they are quite prepared to dish it out but when they get a little bit coming back in their direction they run for cover. It is symptomatic of the lack of personal courage which characterises so many members of the Government ranks at the present time. I would like to speak tonight to some of the actions of the present Government in demonstrating a capacity to rape the public purse, seeking to ensure their continuation as a government. Two particular actions in recent times come instantly to mind. Firstly, there was the report, which I think was presented in the House today, which would prohibit third parties, or non-political parties, from advertising on political matters during election campaigns. That would of course muzzle the activities of organisations such as the automobile associations, those interested groups of constituents of voters who would have something to say about this Government's actions in relation, amongst other things, to road funding. The other aspect that I would like to bring to the House's attention is this quite outrageous decision, taken outside the ambit of the Remuneration Tribunal, to provide members of the House of Representativesnot, I note, members of the Senate, but members of the House of Representativeswith significantly increased stamp allowances. There is only one reason for this, that is, a rort by the Labor Party at the taxpayers' expense in an endeavour-and, one would have to say, it is a fairly hopeless endeavour-to make sure that members of the Labor Party holding marginal seats in some way hold on to those marginal seats in the coming election. It is a quite outrageous attack upon the public purse, coming, as it does, at the same time as pious statements by the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in this House, when he said, with his hand on his heart, that we must protect this Parliament and these political parties from the taint of corruption and, therefore, are not going to allow third parties to advertise on television and other media outlets during election campaigns. At the same time, that same member's Party, which is in government at the present moment, has the absolute gall to go outside the Remuneration Tribunal's guidelines, without consultation, and bring in a decision which would allow $30,000-worth of stamps to House of Representatives members of this Parliament. Using the argument that they should be able to write to each of their constituents, how much would a senator get? Senators would have a constituency equal to the population of each of the States. How much is the Government going to give each senator? If it does not answer that question, it is revealed as acting in the way in which everybody knows it is acting-a quite heinous grab at the public purse.",281

215,Mr OKEEFE ,ADJOURNMENT,"Burke) (10.44)-1 want to talk to the House for a couple of minutes tonight on a matter related to the Buy Australian campaign, and then make a comment on this matter that seems to have raised so much ire on the part of the Opposition-the decision to authorise members of the House of Representatives an increase, not in their stamp allowance but in their postage entitlement. Those opposite may in fact be in the dark ages and may never have heard of all the services that Australia Post now uses but, if they are going to run a campaign on thisand they probably are-let me just spell out the sums for them. The sums are that each of them has 70,000 constituents. At 40c a stamp, if they wrote a letter just once in their three-year term of office to each of their constituents, they would more than use up that allowance each year. Of course, they will not, because they have never bothered to communicate with their constituents. I will tell them what will happen. I will guarantee that I will use my allowance in writing to my constituents. If they do not, they should donate the stamps to Australia Post, give them back to the Government. I am going to communicate with my constituents. The reason I want to speak tonight is to briefly pay some credit where credit is due and that is to the Big W Discount Stores of the Woolworths Ltd supermarket organisation. Before I start I want to say something that honourable members on the other side of the House ought to learn from. Instead of just carping and whingeing all the time there are situations where a bit of credit ought to be paid where it is due. Three years ago in this House I raised a very strong complaint about the Woolworths supermarket organisation giving heavy promotion to overseas products and I said that it was encouraging Australian consumers to buy imported foodstuffs. I am very pleased to report to the House that that organisation has changed its policy. I refer to an advertisement which was carried recently in daily newspapers in Victoria, encouraging the purchase of Australian-made products and stating that the company has now adopted a policy that Australian manufacturers, as they see it, employ many Australians who are Big W customers. Big W has also come to the conclusion that if one looks at the natural advantages of local manufacture, there is a 20 per cent price differential. So it has now adopted as a policy-I quote here from the words of the Chief General Manager, Mr Saunders- 'If we can find an Australian manufacturer who shares our low margin philosphy and will work with us to deliver competitive prices to our customers, it's a much better deal all round'. So the company is committing itself to using Australian-made products. I am very pleased to show you, Madam Speaker, also that it is now featuring the new green and gold kangaroo logo that this Government has endorsed with its Buy Australian true blue campaign. We are going to see this more and more in the shops of Australia. This is the genuine logo that verifies 70 per cent or more Australian content. I am very happy, Madam Speaker, to stand here in the House tonight and say that three years ago I was very critical of that company for its policy of promoting overseas imported foodstuffs. I am now very happy to give credit where credit is due and commend the Big W organisation for its revised philosophy on the purchase of Australian-made supplies. EmptyHere tainly I sat here in awe listening to the honourable member for Canning ( Mr Gear) and his description of this excellent document, 'Getting Australia Out of Debt', not knowing that paragraph 3 on page 6 does refer to an excellent initiative sition in working with the top rate for individuals, so that it is not higher than the company tax rate. But to think that someone of his standing would produce a tape recording to try to put the Leader of the EmptyHere",282
216,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member has already apologised for that. He was unaware that he could not bring a tape recorder in. Mr MCGauran-He has been here for seven years. That shows how stupid he is. EmptyHere side.,283
217,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Gippsland will cease interjecting. EmptyHere that has been running around-certainly the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr MACKellar) made mention of it-and that is the postage entitlement for members of parliament. The honourable member for Burke ( Mr O'Keefe) initiated a statement that members on this side do not write to their constituents or do not work in their electorate. That is not the point. We do do that. That is a nice comment to make! On Canberra radio today the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr West) said that this was prompted by his very detailed analysis of the United States system and that people there get six stamp issues a year. But he said that he thought that Australians should get only four and that prompted the question 'Minister, who initiated this? Where did the aggravation come from?', and he said, 'Members of parliament'. When asked which members of parliament, he could not answer. He thought it was not part of the argument. My question today was going to be: who was the member of parliament, what party did he represent, and why was this extravagant increase-over 350 per centjust granted by the stroke and the decree of the Executive arm of the. Government? We will see whether it is legal. Mr O'Keefe-Madam Speaker, I raise a point of order. Mr MCGauran-There is no point of orby the Oppo- der, Madam Speaker.",283
218,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! Would the honourable member for Adelaide resume his seat. The honourable member for Burke has a point of order. Mr O'Keefe-Madam Speaker, on a point of order: we did receive a memorandum on this topic from you. Mr MCGauran interjectingMONICA",283
219,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member will resume his seat. Mr O'Keefe-I am asking you a question, Madam Speaker. I wonder whether-if it is true that the United States people get sixyou could seek six for us, too, please.",283
220,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member for Burke does not have a point of order. He will resume his seat. The honourable member for Gippsland will not attempt to make rulings in this House. EmptyHere time?,283
221,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"You do not. EmptyHere 350 per cent increase. The Government has lined the backbenchers and marginal seat holders of Australia with $413 a week and increased pensions by $2 a week. The W001worths flyer that it has produced would buy a can of Pal. That $30,500 postal allowance is $5,000 more than average weekly earnings. It was stated that the allowance would allow mail to be sent out to about 70,000 people. There are basically 40,000 homes in the electorate. As a result of phone polling, Mr Cameron of Australian Nationwide Opinion Polls Pty Ltd suggests that by targeting the 10,000 swinging voters-perhaps pensioners and youth-we can probably mail out about 7! times. That is what this is designed for. It is not designed so we can have just one mail-out to the electorate-to give us a warm inner glow in having one mail-out. Before I was rudely interrupted by the honourable member for Burke I was suggesting that this proposal probably has been put together with some degree of illegality. I cannot believe that this allowance can be increased just by government decree. The Australian Labor Party is shifting its responsibility. It has already indicated in the House today that it intends to remove funding for television advertising, after promoting those glossy, full-paged newspaper and television advertisements for the family allowance supplement and the Department of Social Security-'Get a spare pair of Reeboks to make you look good'. Backdated to 1 July we are to get $30,000. No wonder there is indignation around the electorate. Mr O'Keefe-You used to be in marketing. You should understand. EmptyHere This is one of the greatest rorts that you have perpetrated. To think that $30,000-Mr O'Keefe interjectingEmptyHere just going to let him waffle on?",283
222,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! EmptyHere,284
223,Madam SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member for Adelaide should not address the Chair in that manner.,284
224,Mr ALLAN MORRIS ,ADJOURNMENT,"Newcastle) (10.53)-Australia has a special way of celebrating battles. ANZAC Day, one of our great national days, celebrates our loss in a . battle in a war we eventually won. The celebration is not about winning or losing the battle but rather the performance of the soldiers-their courage, fortitude and, perhaps most of all, dignity. Newcastle and the Hunter Valley are currently engaged in what can be likened to a war. Unlike the First World War the battleground is the future and the enemy is intangible. Our community has watched with dismay the decline of the great industrial centres of the world such asÂ· Dusseldorf and Liverpool. We realise that unless we win this war their present will be our future. Recently we have been involved in a tough and difficult contest in seeking to be the main centre for the construction of the ANZAC light patrol frigate-a contest we worked hard and long to win. In the final analysis the consortium we supported, Australian Warships Systems (AWS), was unsuccessful. We are gracious enough to accept that, disappointed as we may be. To Melbourne and Australian Marine Engineering Consolidated we say, 'Be sure your performance matches your promises because if it does not we will willingly do more of the work'. To the Government we say, 'You have a ship at a very cheap price. Newcastle will be watching to ensure that that does not escalate. Be sure the contract is watertight'. To the community of Newcastle and the Hunter Valley, my community, I say, 'You have fought with courage and dignity and it has been with pride that I have represented you. You have helped to show Australia that our region is united and committed to developing a future totally different from other centres. I also urge you to recognise that, like Gallipoli, this was but one battle, albeit it an important one in our longer term struggle. We must hold and consolidate the gains we have made if the future we want is to happen'. To the AWS consortium, the Dutch Government and the Dutch Navy I say, 'Thank you for your confidence in us and for your assistance in uniting us. We have valued your friendship and we will do all we can to ensure it continues. You have, in Newcastle, a community that has confidence in you and your performance and it regrets that it will not be able to build the fine ship you offered'. While I thank the wider community, there are some special people whose efforts must be noted in the records of this Parliament. These include Mr Terry Murray, a butcher who initiated the biggest petition in Newcastle's, and perhaps Australia's, history; his mates Col Russell, Jeff Pendlebury and Phil King in the Wallsend Plaza who helped produce and distribute the petitions; Paul Scott from the Newcastle Permanent Building Society, who did a special job of coordinating this massive effort; organisations including Shortland Electricity, NIB Health Funds Ltd, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales, the Metal Trades Industry Association, the trade union movement and local government; and the Hunter Development Board. They all contributed their energy, their goodwill and their commitment to our region. Dozens of others were united in this campaign in a way that has never happened before, but I am confident this will happen again and again in the future. I say to all of them 'Thank you; I arn proud of you, we owe you a great deal'. I also offer my sincere thanks to my parliamentary colleagues in the region who gave such strong support and back-up. Their efforts, while perhaps not widely recognised, were certainly crucial in our campaign. Madam Speaker, I make these remarks because I believe that Newscastle now has the kind of future which those people worked so hard to achieve.",284
225,Mr TIM FISCHER ,ADJOURNMENT,"Farrer) (10.57)Ironically, the matter I wish to raise tonight also relates to the Hunter Valley. This week has been a very sad week for the Hunter Valley after the Cabinet decision of last Monday. I raise this matter in conjunction and in liaison with the honourable member for Fadden ( Mr Jull). I do so because of a personal experience which needs to be placed on the record, given all that has now happened. I refer to the Whittingham Aerodrome which is located near Singleton and which is one of the most shocking, at times saturated and at times unsafe runways I have ever utilised in 18 years in parliament. So concerned was I, on Friday, 28 April, after taking off from this airstrip by commuter aircraft and flying to Sydney, that rather than have it on my conscience over the weekend I rang the airport inspection branch of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in Sydney and suggested that it might like to inspect this runway. We now have evidence that the CAA rang the operator of this particular aerodrome-a commuter airline company actually operates the Whittingham Aerodrome and maintains the runway-to warn it, inadvertently or otherwise, of the forthcoming inspection. The inspection did not in fact take place until Wednesday, 3 May. Interestingly enough, we now learn that there have been five inspections of this aerodrome. At this stage I do not criticise the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support ( Mrs Kelly), but she did advise me on 10 August that there have been no fewer than five inspections of this aerodrome, including the one on 3 May which I in part triggered because of the condition of this horrific runway, about which one pilot has asked: 'Do we have to wait until bodies are lying on the runway to getÂ· action?'. At long last the airport inspection branch has realised the seriousness of this matter. It has demanded that repairs which it identified in letters of 22 March and 7 June be carried out. In one of its letters it asks: Have they now been completed? Repairs must be such as to withstand any recurrence after prolonged wet weather. So it has taken until 14 August for the CAA to cover its tracks and make a direct approach to the operator to demand a proper standard and completion of repairs to the runway. I am not prepared to have on my conscience the outcome of any horrific tragedy which could have occurred during winter months on that runway. I do not raise this matter lightly; it is a deadly serious matter. It is one that has also concerned the member for Upper Hunter, George Souris, MP, in the State Parliament. I am sorry that time has not permitted me to alert the Minister, but I have no argument with her at this stage of proceedings, other than to place on record my concerns. I demand that the Civil Aviation Authority become a lot more concerned about the state of that particular runway before an accident does occur. In particular, it should examine such things as the massive potholes on that runway which cause pilots to take swerving action in their take-offs and landings; the climb out to the western end of that runway; the use of the runway near dark during the winter months; and the trench which existed at the eastern end of the runway during much of April and May.",285
