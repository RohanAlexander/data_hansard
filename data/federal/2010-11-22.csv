4,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, and in accordance with standing order 207, I present the following petitions: Immigration To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Review Commonwealth Immigration Policy The humble Petition of the Citizens of Australia, respectfully showeth: That we re-affirm our support for the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia which states “Whereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth…..” (Constitution Act 9th July 1900) and the affirmation of 69% of our Australian population that they are Christians, and the statement of one of our founders that “this Commonwealth of Australia from its first stage will be a Christian Commonwealth” (Sir John Downer 1898), and the Opening Prayer of the Parliaments “Almighty God we humbly beseech Thee to vouchsafe Thy blessing upon this Parliament. Direct and prosper our deliberations to the advancement of Thy glory” and recognises the importance of these beliefs in ensuring the ongoing stability and unity of our Christian nation. Your petitioners therefore pray the Parliament of Australia will: 1. Review our Commonwealth Immigration Policy to ensure the priority for Christians from all races and colours, especially from persecuted nations, as both immigrants and refugees. 2. Adopt a ten year moratorium on Muslim immigration, so an assessment can be made on the social and political disharmony currently occurring in the Netherlands, France and the UK, so as to ensure we avoid making the same mistakes; and allow a decade for the Muslim leadership and community in Australia to reassess their situation so as to reject any attempt to establish a Muslim nation within our Australian nation. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Murphy (from 9 citizens) Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of Australian Citizens, who are friends, family or supporters of Australian sufferers of Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH) disease, a rare and potentially fatal disease of the blood draws to the attention of the House the need to publicly fund out of the Federal Government, the only currently available treatment for PNH sufferers, namely Soliris® (Eculizumab) as a matter of urgency. We therefore ask the House to introduce and pass any legislation or to take any administrative action available to the House that will enable sufferers of PNH disease to urgently receive breakthrough life saving treatment for this very rare and debilitating disease. by Mr Murphy (from 1,718 citizens) Administration of Justice To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of a ‘resident of Australia' and tain citizens of Australia' draws the House issues relating to Parliament regarding the claim of “no immediate allegation against a judge is in prospect” is in error. The Senate reported, about 7 December 2009, at Recommendation 10, “7.82 The committee recommends … modelled on the Judicial Commission of New South Wales”, which the “Parliamentary (Judicial Misbehaviour or Incapacity) Commission Bill 2010” can do if allowed. This Senate recommendation is in part, because of knowledge within the Senate of complaints attempted to be filed with the High Court Chief Justice about 2005 to 2009, but unbeknown to the Senate, Officers of the Government and Federal Police have whitewashed complaints filed so they never saw the light of an investigation. Courses of justice created by the Commonwealth like appeals and 75(v) writs have also been obstructed by these officers where the evidence and issues support judicial misbehaviour has occurred that is common knowledge in family law and still waiting investigation. We pray the House expedites the passing of this bill due to complaints outstanding, and include the right the Committee accept public complaints that have been obstructed elsewhere. Plus ensure the Committee has power to recommend; The making of “Constitutional Writs” to a Chief Justice, and the award of compensation for judicial wrongs, and a matter be sent back to any Court for reconsideration. by Mr Murphy (from 6 citizens) Administration of Justice To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives; This petition of a ‘resident of Australia' and ‘certain citizens of Australia' draws to the attention of the House issues relating to Parliament regarding complaints about misbehaviour by judges. The Senate reported, about 7 December 2009, at Recommendation 10, “7.82 The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government establish a federal judicial commission modelled on the Judicial Commission of New South Wales”, which the “Parliamentary (Judicial Mis‘cer- behaviour or Incapacity) Commission Bill 2010” to the attention of can do if allowed. Unless section 17 is revised, questions arise of the legitimate intent of the Bill/Act which otherwise falls short of what can be achieved by the Committee. This is supported by section 18 of this Bill which enables limits on the advice of the Committee to questions created by the uninformed Committee. This would enable questions needing answers to go unanswered, to an extent the true value of the production of this Committee, Bill, improbable Act, and ability to address/correct wrongs, would be lost/wasted and “the Bill/Act 2010” produced for other than legitimate use. We pray the Honourable House includes in section 18 standard questions to be answered like, if not the same; Is a section 72(ii) warranted? Is it recommended a “Constitutional Writ” on behalf of member/s of the public be made to a Chief Justice? Is it recommended compensation for judicial wrongs be made to the House? Is it recommended a matter be sent back to any Court for reconsideration? by Mr Murphy (from 6 citizens) Administration of Justice To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives; This petition of a ‘resident of ‘Australia' and ‘certain citizens of Australia' draws to the attention of the House, namely the Honourable Speaker; issues relating to Parliament regarding misbehaviour by judges, known to the 3 branches of Government, fallen on deaf ears in the Parliament. Hence legitimate allegations with evidence produced have not caused the corrects and section 72 actions that should have occurred. This raises questions of the legitimate intent of the “Parliamentary (Judicial Misbehaviour or Incapacity) Commission Bill 2010”, first read 22 February, and whether or not section 17 (1) of “the Bill 2010” will restrict the Committee accepting complaints from “a House of Parliament” only, for legitimate reasons. The “Parliamentary (Judicial Misbehaviour or Incapacity) Commission Bill 2005 and 2007” were to correct this Constitutionally required short fall which the 2010 same named Bill will correct, if it is not shelved too due to unresolved complaints. Section 17(2) of “the Bill 2010” limits complaints to the Committee to “only specific allegations referred by a House.” Hence limiting the Committee to an extent the true value of this improbable Act and ability to address/correct wrongs, would be wasted thereby produced for other than legitimate use. We pray the Honourable House revise section 17 to enable the public to file complaints with the Committee, causing investigations pursuant to the Senate recommendations and those sought in the unresolved “Administration of Justice” petitions, fallen on deaf ears. by Mr Murphy (from 6 citizens) Barker: Eastfront Road To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of residents of Younghusband surrounding districts South Australia. Draws to the attention of the House: The closure of Eastfrontroad Road Younghusband. A portion of Eastfront road has been closed due to River bank slumping. Eastfront road is one of the longest Tourist drives along the edges of the River Murray in South Australia. There are also numerous businesses along this road which rely heavily on passing traffic, These include Younghusband Licensed General Store, Kia Marina Houseboat Hire, Mark Schache auto repair and Heward Estate Winery. Many of these businesses rely on large transport vehicles to deliver goods, including large petrol tankers. As it stands at the moment, these vehicles can only use the steep detour roads which lead to the area. Being predominately a tourist region, a large portion of our passing traffic bypass our town and businesses altogether by staying on the main road to Bowhill, due to the closure of Eastfront Road. We therefore ask the House to: Follow up this urgent complaint with the Federal Minister For Roads, and any other relevant parties, to achieve an outcome which repairs and reopens Eastfront Road. by Mr Murphy (from 334 citizens) Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives. Petition This Petition of the Griffith Branch Of Combined Pensioners & Superannuants Association of N.S.W. Draws to the attention of The House the threat being faced by the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area from changes that will be proposed by the Murray - Valley-Basin and following recommendations already published by the Wentworth Group, that water supplies be cut by up to 65% We therefore ask the House to reject any recommendation to cut the supply of water to the MIA, in view of the fact it would be the death of the MIA Food bowl and result in the loss of businesses, value added businesses, jobs, medical facilities and the supply of foodstuff to the state and nation. We ask also that The House remember the primary purpose of the construction of the dams in the head waters was to guarantee supply of waters to these areas, and the loss will effect Griffith, Leeton, Yenda, Hanwood, Yanco, Tharbogan and the surrounding district which compose the whole of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. by Mr Murphy (from 114 citizens) To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the Federal Government's decision to cease funding the Neighbourhood Model Occasional Childcare Program as at July 1st 2010. Ultimately this could mean the closure of 28 centres Western Australia wide, including Kojonup. We therefore ask the House to reinstate the funding to the Neighbourhood Model Occasional Childcare Program that provides 52% of the funds required for operational costs to 28 childcare centres Western Australian wide. by Mr Murphy (from 268 citizens) Permanent Residency To the Honourable the Speaker and Members the House of Representatives. This petition draws to the attention of the House: 1. The Government's commitment 26/1/1988, giving amnesty to overstayers, … still to been-acted. 2. A National Human Rights Consultation launched on 10/12/ 2008, by the Attorney General, seeking the views of the Australian public on which human rights and responsibilities they consider important…..still to be finalized. Is it not a “Universal truth” that all men and women are created equal, endowed by the Creator, with the power of creative reason? ie. human. Is it not the expression of this creativity, through education, advances and application of scientific discoveries, which led to improvements in living standards, and subsequently, the ability to support higher population densities? We therefore ask the House to consider: We have within our country a small percent of well educated, skilled persons who came to our shores in search of the means to improve their lives, who are contributing within our economy without recognition, support or acknowledgement of their existence here, as human beings. As you grant citizenship certificates to new Australians annually, on Australian day, consider Child Care granting, compassionately, a permanent residency to those desperately needing Amnesty. We, the undersigned urge the House of Representatives en-act the necessary legislation to overturn this immoral, thus unacceptable treatment of human beings. by Mr Murphy (from 22 citizens) Medicare: Bone Densitometry To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition, from Soroptimist International Clubs of South Australia, being Adelaide, Barossa, Eastern Districts, Mount Gambier, Murray Bridge, Naracoorte, Northern Highlands, Port Pine, Southern Districts and Torrens, draws to the attention of the House this anomaly in Medicare, affecting all Australian women at menopause. Currently there is no Medicare rebate for bone densitometry for women unless there are special risk factors, a broken bone, or until age 70. This is on too late for prevention. Researchers have demonstrated that, if a woman is scanned at the onset of menopause, her risk of developing osteoporosis can be identified. Preventive treatment then is relatively inexpensive and easily managed. (Prof BEC Nordin, AO, Royal Adelaide Hospital) The direct cost of fractures due to osteoporosis in 2002 was $1.9 billion, the total cost estimated at $8 billion. (Access Economics) We therefore ask the House that all Australian women on reaching menopause be offered free Bone Densitometry to determine their risk of developing osteoporosis. by Mr Murphy (from 8,528 citizens) Bowman Electorate: Internet Access To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of residents of the city of Redlands, within the federal electorate of Bowman draws to the attention of the House: A lack of upgraded infrastructure at local telephone exchanges is preventing access to cheaper and faster internet. ADSL2+ internet is a faster and increasingly affordable form of broadband however it can only be provided effectively to residents at upgraded telephone exchanges. This lack of connectivity has negative implications commercially and socially - Restrictions We therefore ask the House to: enact or amend legislation that requires the responsible telecommunications provider to install the infrastructure necessary to allow equal access to ADSL2+. by Mr Murphy (from 277 citizens) To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of Australian citizens who support democracy in Burma draws to the attention of the House the upcoming election in Burma. The election has been condemned globally as an attempt to entrench and legitimise military rule. The constitution and election laws contain a number of undemocratic measures, including the effective military veto over decisions made by the new Parliament and Government. Over 2,100 political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, remain detained for their political beliefs; political parties are not free to campaign in a democratic manner; and the election date remains unknown - Focus our aid on improving maternal and All major political parties in Australia have expressed concern about these elections and the Australian Senate unanimously passed a motion calling on the Australian Government to refuse to endorse the outcomes of the election unless the political climate in Burma improves. It is clear that nothing has changed. The United Nations Security Council, General Assembly, Secretary General and Human Rights Council have all stated the solution to the problems in Burma lies in dialogue between the dictatorship, the National League for Democracy and ethnic representatives. We therefore ask the House to clearly state that Australia cannot recognise the election in Burma as either credible or legitimate unless the followof ing benchmarks are met in advance: - All political prisoners are unconditionally released; - All political stakeholders participate in a transparent review of the 2008 constitution; and preventing candidates from campaigning freely are lifted. by Mr Murphy (from 236 citizens) International Development Assistance To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Burma This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: Australia's foreign aid expenditure. Australia currently allocates 0.33% of its Gross National Income (2008/09) in Overseas Development Assistance (ODA). Australia's current commitment to lift ODA to 0.5% is insufficient to meet the Millennium Development Goals and is well below the United Nations target of 0.7% of GNI. We therefore ask the House to: - Increase the planned rate of growth of Australia's aid program by increasing our ODA commitment to 0.7% of Gross National Income; child health, food security, education and gender equality; and - Rapidly increase Australia's assistance to countries to help them adapt to climate change and ensure that this commitment is additional to our Overseas Development Assistance. by Mr Murphy (from 69 citizens) Farrer Electorate: Mobile Blood Donation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Mobile Blood Donation Service Petition This petition of the Hay Shire Council on behalf of the Hay Shire residents draws to the attention the House: that residents of the Hay Shire are unable to access the Mobile Blood Donor Services operated by the Australia Red Cross due to Hay's remote location and the inability to have donations transported to Sydney in an acceptable time-frame. Blood donors within the Shire have close to a four hour round trip to support the Blood Bank in Griffith NSW. We therefore ask the House to: Request that the Australian Red Cross Blood Service provide a regular mobile blood donation service to towns in the Western Riverina including Hay. by Mr Murphy (from 1,095 citizens) Education To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This Petition of the undersigned draws the attention of the House: to significant community concerns over the overt and explicit Islamisation of Australian school-age children through the agency of the text-book “Learning From One Another” Bringing Muslim Perspectives into Australian Schools” which is to be introduced into our schools in the corning year. We, the undersigned, are extremely concerned that such a textbook would be introduced into our schools under the guise of “diversity” when it is, quite evidently, active proselytizing. Such ability to proselytize in our schools has been removed from all other religions, and we are extremely concerned that Islam has, once again, contrived to receive what appears to be special status to advance their religion. Petition: We therefore ask the House to: 1. reaffirm its commitment to the ‘wall of separation' concept concerning church and state that is the foundation of our education system. This ‘wall of separation' is required to safeguard our multicultural, multi-faith and non-faith liberal democracy that has become the hallmark of the civilised 21st century tion Australia rightfully claims to be. 2. indicate to Muslim educators the inappropriateness of their attempt to proselytize by stealth. by Mr Murphy (from 5 citizens) Parkes Electorate: Health Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of residents of Goodooga and surrounds in north western New South Wales draws to the attention of the House: That our Community strongly opposes the downgrade and reduction in Health & Emergency Services provided by Greater Western Area Health Service (GWAHS) & Ambulance NSW. Our local Ambulance Service has ceased, meaning a minimum wait of 40 minutes (79km) from Lightning Ridge depending on availability, plus return travel before being flown out to Dubbo Base Hospital. Over 19 months ago GWAHS gave 14 days notice of the removal of our Emergency bed and Registered Nurse. Due to media pressure they conducted an Independent Review, we completed a Health Impact Assessment and endless hours of consultation, none of which have been included in the new Plan. The ongoing threat of closure of the Emergency bed is devastating to an already isolated rural community comprised largely of Indigenous Australians (98%), mostly ageing or youth. Is this how we want to CLOSE THE GAP in New South Wales? We therefore ask the House to pressure the Health Minister and Managerial staff of Greater Western Area Health Service to secure the future of our 24 hour Emergency Service and reinstate our Ambulance Service ASAP. by Mr Murphy (from 144 citizens) Community Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of Certain foreigners And citizens of Australia Draws to the attention of the house Bring John Howard days back and less poverty for women and men and foreigners and citizens put into nadarkness by a Racist Australian Aboriginal State and Federal Government. Bring money flow to victims been ignored. We therefore ask the house to To have all Foreigner and women and men and Australian Citizens who been ignored and abused and neglected and wrongly done by to have life and motherhood and justice returned and rights returned and compensation and apologies and to have housing given to all women left on the streets and men left on the streets for negligence by the government and housing given to the homeless men due to the fact boat people and homeless people housed fairly and not have a racist government and a government not to abuse people's rights and not have their rice and house taken and given urgently and to have successful money flow for families and victims and to create a better finanrequesting cial Australia and Aboriginal Australia and to have all acts State and Federal Changed in Australia and bring the old days of John Howard Government back. by Mr Murphy (from 10 citizens) Battery Hens To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of the undersigned citizens of Coffs Harbour and its environs find the practice of conof fining hens to cages for egg production abhorrent, and request you take immediate action to phaseout use of the battery cage in Australia. Being confined to a battery cage and mutilated prevents a hen from fulfilling all of her natural behaviours, including stretching her wings, nesting and scratching, dust bathing and roosting. This life of misery and suffering is needless and based purely on economics rather than animal welfare. Progressive countries such as Sweden, Switzerland and other European Union countries have phased out or are phasing out the use of battery cages. by Mr Murphy (from 71 citizens) Pearce Electorate: Pharmaceutical To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of the local community of Merriwa/Butler/Ridgewood/Quinns Rocks and the residents of surrounding suburbs draws to the attention of the House that this community does not have reasonable access to the supply of pharmaceutical benefits by an approved pharmacist. Brighton Beach Pharmacy which is located at the Brighton Beach Medical and Professional Centre, Merriwa has operated as a non-PBS pharmacy since September 2010 and has cared for this community despite not being able to provide medicines which are subsidised by the Commonwealth Government. A Section 90 approval has been denied to this pharmacy due to the current pharmacy location rules criteria. We therefore ask the House to give Merriwa/Butler/Ridgewood/Quinns Rocks reasonable access to the supply of pharmaceutical benefits by that the Minister for Health exercise Ministerial Discretion so as to provide a Section 90 approval to Brighton Beach Pharmacy, Merriwa. by Mr Murphy (from 907 citizens) Environmental Conservation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives We the undersigned, who are fellows of the Australian Academy of Science, draw to the attention the House that biological systems on which our own life depends are fragile enough to be adversely affected by human activity. We, therefore, ask the House that Australia: 1. Intensifies its efforts to decrease its own negative environmental impact. 2. Works with other nations to attain a global reduction in human reproduction and a decrease in per capita adverse environmental impact. by Mr Murphy (from 2 citizens) Non-Incandescent Light Globes To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives September 2010. Benefits This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: Due to the world-wide knowledge and evidence now that the low energy light globes or CFL's can cause adverse health effects such as headaches, balance problems, body irritability and/or rashes to name a few, and that there are disposal problems due to the mercury in them, we the undersigned request that the current rollout in homes and public places be reversed and that the ban on the importation of the old and universally safe incandescent light globes into Australia be lifted immediately. We also request that the public be warned of the potential adverse health effects of these light globes and that the safety guidelines especially of not putting them too close to their heads are made abundantly clear throughout Australia - The sufferings of children with head lice are by Mr Murphy (from 595 citizens) Mental Health Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia, Draws to the attention of the House a matter on the 2010-2011 Budget: specifically that accredited Mental Health Social Workers will no longer be able to provide services under the Medicare “Better Access to Mental Health Services” program. - Accredited Mental Health Social Workers help individuals with mental health problems to resolve associated psychosocial issues and improve their quality of life. This may involve family as well as individual counselling, and group therapy. - In 2008-09 these professionals delivered 121,540 services under the program, played a vital role in minimising hospital admissions and provided substantial savings to the health budget each year. - Many Social workers have provided Medicare services “bulk billed” to low income individuals and families, facilitating accessibility and delivering services to areas of great need. We therefore ask the House to amend the Budget and allow Accredited Mental Health Social Workers to continue providing valuable community service through the Medicare “Better Access to Mental Health Services” Program. by Mr Murphy (from 2,268 citizens) To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens, family and supporters of Australian sufferers of head lice, calls on the House to urgently take note that: - The current school policy protecting a child with head lice from being sent home from school, has negatively impacted the school environment, promoting high levels of head lice infestations within schools among children adversely affecting school work, days absent from school, psychologic distress, individual health and encouraging negative stigma and bullying - Failure on the Governments behalf to act now, with levels as high as 33% of children infested around Australia, will result in public health negligence as research indicates that infestations will rise and affect 1 in 2 Australian children and their families, resulting in higher levels than today's third world nations and also calls on the House of Representatives to urgently to take action and pass any legislation to: - Introduce and publicly fund a Commonwealth Mobile Specialist Head Lice Treatment Program, supported by the only trusted service provider for effective head lice removal, namely No More Nitz. - Subsidise through Medicare the cost of Head lice Treatments within the No More Nitz, Specialist Head Lice Treatment salon/s, the only trusted head lice specialist service provider for effective head lice removal. by Mr Murphy (from 265 citizens) Gungahlin To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of the citizens of the Federal electorate of Fraser requests that the House and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation consider locating Commonwealth Departments in Gungahlin, ACT. As a growth area that attracts working families Schools and first home buyers, locating Commonwealth Departments in Gungahlin will: - Create employment opportunities in the local area - Support local businesses by encouraging people to move to and work in the area - Reduce CO2 emissions through fewer and shorter commutes to offices in the city and southern parts of Canberra - Ease cost of living pressures associated with fuel expenses and vehicle maintenance - Improve work/life balance because of less time spent commuting to and from work - Create more time for family and community activities because of shorter commutes We ask the House and Minister to take these benefits into account in their consideration of locating Commonwealth Departments in Gungahlin. by Mr Murphy (from 95 citizens) To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives, This petition of Burma Campaign Australia draws to the attention of the House the military dictatorship in Burma. Burma's military dictatorship has denied Aung San Suu Kyi the freedom to lead and Burma's people their democratic rights for over 20 years. The military dictatorship remains in power because of its vast financial resources, estimated to be US$5 billion. Most of this income has come from Burma's oil and gas industry. Australian companies are investing in Burma and funding the country's brutal military dictatorship. Twinza Oil is investing in Burma's oil and gas industry and their project alone will earn the military dictatorship an estimated US$2.5 billion. Foreign investments in Burma directly contribute to the long term financial viability and stability the Burmese military dictatorship and fund systematic human rights abuses and military offensives. We therefore ask the House to: - Investigate Australian companies' interests in Burma; and - Introduce targeted trade and investment sanctions against Burma by Mr Murphy (from 1,596 citizens) MCPherson Electorate: Palm Beach Post To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of the residents of MCPherson draws to the attention of the House the announced closure of the Palm Beach Post Office, Queensland We therefore ask the House to: urge the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy to use his power under the Australia Post Act to consult with the Australia Post Board regarding the closure of the Palm Beach Post Office, located in Palm Beach Queensland, on the grounds of the demographics of the members of the community. Burma by Mr Murphy (from 2,909 citizens) Petitions received. Responses",21
5,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS,"Ministerial responses to petitions previously presented to the House have been received as follows: Coalmining Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 12 May 2010 (your ref 183/287) regarding a petition on the potential environmental impact of coal mining. You mentioned that the petition has recently been the subject of a public hearing on 7 April 2010, and that the Standing Committee on Petitions expressed interest in my response to it, given my portfolio responsibilities. The issues raised in the petition primarily relate to impacts on agricultural land in the Liverpool Plains area. of The Australian Government is committed to considering the long-term economic, social and environmental implications of mining activity in Australia, including coal mining, where these actions impact on matters within the Commonwealth's jurisdiction. As part of this commitment, the Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water, Senator the Hon Penny Wong, announced on 2 December 2008 that the Australian Government would contribute one-third of the cost, up to $1.5 million, towards a study into the surface and groundwater resources of Namoi Valley area. I Office am advised that discussions are still being held with the New South Wales Government regarding the balance of the funding. Mining activities on agricultural land, such as the Liverpool Plains, are primarily assessed and regulated under state government legislation, including through provisions of the NSW Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979. As the federal environment Minister, I do not have power to regulate impacts on matters such as agricultural land or human health. These matters are the responsibility of the State to consider during any State assessment and approval process. My jurisdiction arises if an activity is likely to have a significant impact on one or more matters of national environmental significance (NES) as defined under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). Matters of NES include: World Heritage properties, National Heritage places, wetlands of international importance, nationally listed threatened species and ecological communities, listed migratory species, the Commonwealth marine environment, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and nuclear actions, including uranium mining. It is the responsibility of the person proposing a mining activity to carefully consider the likely impacts on matters of NES. If there is any such likelihood, the proponent must refer the proposal for a decision under the EPBC Act. To date, no referrals have been received under the EPBC Act for mining or exploration in the Liverpool Plains. Three referrals have been received for mining in the general area (one near Narrabri, one near Boggabri, and one north of Gunnedah), however these are not in the prime agricultural areas of the Liverpool Plains. As with all referrals made under the EPBC Act, any referral for mining in the Liverpool Plains would be carefully considered for its impacts on matters of NES, and my decision would take account of any public comments as well as economic and social matters. Thank you for writing on this matter. from the Minister, Environment Protection,  Pensions and Benefits Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 26 May 2010 to the Prime Minister, the Hon Julia Gillard MP, concerning a petition to increase Newstart Allowance and Parenting Payment Single rates. As the matter you have raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities, your letter was referred to me for a reply. I apologise for the delay in responding. Australia's social security system needs to provide a strong safety net for people who require financial assistance. Funds available for social security expenditure must be directed to those most in need while ensuring the system remains sustainable for Australian taxpayers. The difference between the rates and income tests of allowances and pensions reflects the different roles of these two types of payments. Allowances are designed to be adequate to live on while providing sufficient incentives for people to join or return to the workforce. In contrast, pensions are designed to acknowledge that some people face additional barriers such as age, disability or responsibilities for caring for people with disability that make it difficult for them to support themselves through paid employment. In addition to the base rate of payment, a range of supplementary benefits are available, provided eligibility criteria are met, through the transfer system. These include, but are not limited to, Rent Assistance to help with the costs of accommodation, Pharmaceutical Allowance to help with the cost of pharmaceuticals, and Family Tax Benefit to help with the costs of raising children. There is also a range of benefits to assist people of working age with the costs of study or training such as the Pensioner Education Supplement, the Training Supplement and the Education Entry Payment. The increases to pensions announced in the 200910 Federal Budget, and mentioned in the petition you supplied were part of the Australian Government's response to the Harmer Pension Review (the Harmer Review). The income support payments examined in the Harmer Review were those targeted to seniors, carers and people with a disability. The Government's response to the Harmer Pension Review included an increase in the rate of a number of payments including Age Pension; Carer Payment; and Disability Support Pension. The increases were introduced on 20 September 2009. Income support payments such as Parenting Payment Single, Newstart Allowance and Youth Allowance did not fall within the terms of reference of the Pension Review, but were considered as part of the review of Australia's Future Tax System (the Henry Review). The Henry Review focused on the tax and transfer system, including the broad architecture of income support, and in particular the relationship between working age payments to pensions. The Report of the Henry Review was publicly released on 2 May 2010. The Report includes a range of recommendations that would directly or indirectly impact on recipients of working age income support payments. Specifically, it recommends that the rates of payment for student and participation category payments should continue to be lower than the amount paid for pensioners, that a consistent approach to payment relativities between single and couple rates be achieved and that there be common indexation between payments. More generally, the report also suggest significant changes income taxation provisions that impact on income support recipients and other low income people. These recommendations of the Henry Review are not Government policy, and some of the Henry Review recommendations would involve a major restructure of the income support system. This could only take place after an extensive period of policy development and consultation, taking into account community debate on the issues, as well as the views of stakeholders and other budget priorities. As the Henry Review itself noted, it is not necessary or desirable to implement every recommendation of the report at once. Thank you for bringing the concerns of the petitioner to my attention, if you or the Committee require further information, please contact my Office. from the Minister for Employment Participation and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Government Service Delivery, Senator Mark Arbib Immigration: Klue Family Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 1 June 2010 concerning the immigration status of the Klue family. Mr Johan Klue was granted a four year Temporary Business (Long Stay) Subclass 457 Visa on 25 March 2010. Mr Klue's wife and two children were granted dependant Subclass 457 visas for the same period on 13 May 2010. This visa allows Mr Klue and his wife to work in Australia and their children to attend school. There is also no limit to the amount of times that the family may travel in and out of Australia during the visa validity period. The Klue family does not currently have any applications for permanent residence before my Department. There are many visa categories under which the Klue family may apply to live and work in Australia in the future if they wish. These include categories such as skilled, family sponsored, humanitarian and employer sponsored. Detailed rules governing the entry of people in each visa category are specified in Australia's migration legislation and are applied equally to to all applicants on a case-by-case basis. Applicants must meet all of the requirements for the class of visa sought before they can be granted a visa. I trust that this information has been of assistance. from Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans Immigration and Citizenship Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 11 February 2010 relating to two petitions recently submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding immigration and citizenship in Australia. The petitions in question, 280/503 and 281/504, are almost identical in their text and cover several immigration and citizenship-related issues. As agreed with your office, I have addressed these issues as though they were contained within one petition. Each petition asserts that the Australian Government made a commitment on 26 January 1988 to grant amnesty to all immigrants and refugees in Australia at that time, and which, to this day, has not been enacted. These assertions are inaccurate. In a Ministerial Statement to the House of Representatives on 3 June 1988, the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the Hon. Allan Clyde Holding MP, released the report of the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies-Immigration-a commitment to Australia. In his address Mr Holding stated that among other items in the Terms of Reference, the Committee was instructed to ‘note that the Government has ruled out an amnesty for illegal immigrants.' In a statement on 21 April 1988, former Member of the House of Representatives, Mr Alan Cadman MP, repudiated claims that either he, or the Opposition of the time, ported the notion of an amnesty for illegal immigrants. Nor is there any consideration at present of providing a general amnesty for people who have overstayed their visa in Australia. Unlawful non-citizens have no entitlement to remain in Australia and are expected to depart. If an unlawful non-citizen refuses to leave Australia voluntarily, they may be detained and removed from Australia at the earliest practicable opportunity. Persons who overstay their visa by more than 28 days become subject to an exclusion period that prevents them from being granted a temporary visa to travel to Australia for three years. This exclusion period applies whether they leave voluntarily or not. In comparison to some European countries, Australia has a much smaller population of people living in the country having overstayed their visas. In recent years the number of overstayers at any one time has remained below 50 000. Many people who are recorded as overstayers are merely extending their stay in Australia by a few days or weeks, and leave of their own accord within a short period. Those who overstay for a longer period may be given temporary lawful status through the grant of a Bridging visa. This allows them to make arrangements for their departure from Australia or, if eligible, to seek a further visa - Improving human rights protections includThe Department now has a Community Status Resolution Service available for non-citizens in the community who have an unresolved immigration status. The Service engages with these individuals to assist to resolve their immigration status either through grant of a substantive visa or through departure. Departmental officers provide information to clients about their immigration and departure options, as well as connect them with appropriate services on a needs basis, to assist them to achieve an appropriate immigration outcome. The petitions also seek the recognition of migrants and refugees as ‘human'. The National Human Rights Consultation, launched on 10 December 2008, sought to consult with the Austrasup- lian community to find out ‘which human rights and responsibilities should be protected and promoted in Australia, whether human rights are sufficiently protected and promoted, and how Australia could better protect and promote human rights.' The Committee received some 35 014 public submissions, as a result of 66 community roundtables held across Australia and three days of public hearings in Parliament House. The National Human Rights Consultation Report was handed to the Australian Government on 30 September 2009. The full text of the report is available at www.humanrightsconsultation.gov.au. Among other items, the report recommends that immigration legislation, policies and practices be examined in an audit of federal legislation to determine their compliance with Australia's human rights obligations. On 21 April 2010 the Attorney General launched Australia's Human Rights Framework which outlines a range of key measures to further protect and promote human rights in Australia. The Framework is based on five key principles and focuses on: - Reaffirming a commitment to our human rights obligations; - The importance of human rights education; - Enhancing our domestic and international engagement on human rights issues; ing greater parliamentary scrutiny; and - Achieving greater respect for human rights principles within the community. The situation of those people present in Australia unlawfully, and who might benefit from an amnesty, must, however, be distinguished from that of migrants and refugees who have permission to remain in Australia. An amnesty is not relevant to their circumstances, and they already receive protection, support and recognition where relevant. The Skill Stream of the Migration program selects people on the basis of their skills and capacity to enter Australia's skilled labour market. Applicants are generally required to have skills which have been recognised for migration purposes by a designated assessing authority. An applicant's age, skilled work experience and English language proficiency are also taken into account. The Skill Stream also includes a number of employer sponsored visa classes where an applicant must be sponsored by an Australian employer to fill a skilled employment vacancy. The Skill Stream selects people on the basis of characteristics which will enable them to integrate readily into the skilled labour force or to invest establish businesses in Australia. As the focus is on attracting young, highly skilled migrants the requirements for General Skilled Migration (GSM) are tailored to meet this objective. Persons applying for a GSM visa need to: - Be under 45 years of age when they apply; - Have a high level of English language skills; - Nominate an occupation on the Skilled Occupation List and be found suitable for that occupation by the relevant Australian assessing authority; and - Have recent work experience in a skilled occupation or have recently completed an Australian qualification. In relation to refugees within Australia, the following information provides an overview of the protection, support and recognition that recognised refugees are provided under relevant legislation, policy and international obligations commitments. As a signatory to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol (the Refugees Convention), Australia is committed to providing protection to refugees consistent with the obligations set out in the Convention. Australia recognises the right of anyone to make a claim for refugee status in Australia. I would like to assure you that persons who meet the refugee criteria in the Refugees Convention, or other criteria under international human rights treaties to which Australia is a party, are granted Australia's protection, subject to meeting all legal requirements set out in the Migration Act and Regulations. These persons are granted Protection visas and thus, permanent residency and have access to Medicare, Centrelink and work rights. In recognition of the particular needs of refugees, the Government has put in place support mechanisms for refugees who are newly settled in Australia. The Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS) provides initial, intensive settlement assistance for refugee and humanitarian entrants for up to 12 months after arrival. This includes assistance in finding accommodation, the provision of certain household goods, information and assistance to access services and become part or of the local community and short term torture and trauma counselling. The Government also recognises the need to prepare people for entry into the workforce so that their skills can be utilised effectively. The Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) aims to achieve the economic and social participation of migrants and refugees. The AMEP includes Employment Pathways and Traineeships in English and Work Readiness programs. These programs provide an employment focus, developing pathways to work through work experience placements. Support is also available to onshore asylum seekers in the community in Australia while their Protection visa applications are being considered. The Asylum Seeker Assistance (ASA) Scheme provides financial assistance to eligible Protection visa applicants living in the community who are unable to meet their most basic needs for food, accommodation and health care as well as meeting torture and trauma counselling costs. Asylum seekers who are not found to be owed Australia's protection after an assessment of their claims and who have no other basis to remain are required to depart. Australia's non-refoulement obligations, found in Article 33(1) of the Refugees Convention, prohibit the return of a refugee to a territory where their life or freedom would be threatened. I can assure you that no one who raises an asylum claim is returned unless it has been determined that they are neither a refugee, nor a person to whom Australia has obligations under other international treaties. Under Australia's obligations under international law, Australia is not required to provide an amnesty to asylum seekers and there is no consideration at present of doing so. I trust this information is of assistance to you. from the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans Pensions and Benefits Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 26 May 2010 about the petition regarding the life expectancy actuarial review and the impact of the global financial crisis - keep the assets test exempt status by restrucTo ensure equity with customers holding income streams with retail providers, self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs) and small Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority funds (SAFs) with 100 per cent assets test exempt income streams are required to prove that their income stream meets the necessary reserving requirements and is able to meet its ongoing pension obligations. Additional reporting requirements are also placed on these income support recipients because of the lack of ‘arm's length' separation between the trustee and the member. One of these reporting requirements is an actuarial certificate that the come stream has a “high probability” of meeting its pension obligations for the lifetime or life pectancy of the individual. In March 2009, I approved measures designed to ease the pressure on pensioners with SMSF/SAF 100 per cent assets test exempt complying pensions who are experiencing difficulty as a result of the global financial crisis. These pensioners were experiencing difficulty meeting actuarial certification for their income stream as a the negative impact of the global financial crisis on their underlying assets. The relief means these income streams do not have to meet high probability but do become assets tested. The relief also means that these pensioners will not incur a significant debt, which is equivalent to the additional social security benefits received over the last years, due to not meeting the actuarial certification. I later agreed to enhance the relief to allow restructuring to a market-linked income stream for SMSFs/SAFs, albeit still with the loss of the asset test concession. Customers can still retain their assets test exemption if they restructure their income stream into a lifetime or life expectancy income stream offered by a retail provider. The original and enhanced relief is in effect until 30 June 2010. Prior to the implementation of the first relief measure, customers with these products who were unable to get actuarial certification would have either to: turing the income stream into an equivalent retail product (crystallise losses); or - lose the assets test exemption and become assets-tested with the resulting social security debt penalty. Given the complexities involved in assessing income stream products under the means test, I would recommend that the petitioner arrange an interview with a Centrelink Financial Information Service officer to discuss their personal circumstances. These officers are specially trained to provide information about the social security assessment of income and assets. This is a free serin- vice and an appointment can be made by phoning 13 1021 for the cost of a local call. exThe Australian Government will continue to take decisive action to uphold the integrity and fairness of the social security system in the face of ongoing events in financial markets and the wider economy. Thank you again for writing. from the Minister for Families, Housing, result of Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Macklin Lymphoedema Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 18 March 2010 regarding a petition to the House of Representatives five about the diagnosis, treatment and management of lymphoedema as a chronic medical condition. The petition has a number of specific requests to assist in the treatment and management of lymphoedema, including funding for trained lymphoedema therapists, and financial assistance for travel to services to treat lymphoedema. The Australian Government recognises that chronic diseases represent a major challenge for our health system. Chronic diseases are estimated to be responsible for more than 80 per cent of the burden of disease and injury in Australia, and more than half of all general practice consultations are people who have a chronic condition. On 20 April 2010, the Prime Minister, Premiers and Chief Ministers of states and territories, the exception of Western Australia, reached an historic agreement at the Council of Australian Governments, on health and hospitals reformthe establishment of a National Health and Hospitals Network, to improve the health system for all Australians. In particular, the reforms to general practice and primary health care are aimed at improving access to GP services, tackling chronic disease and keeping Australians healthy and out of hospital. The Government will also continue to address chronic disease management through the National Primary Health Care Strategy, as well as the National Preventive Health Agency and the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health. The petition raised the provision of training for GPs in the detection, assessment and treatment of lymphoedema, in accordance with the Lymphoedema Framework Best Practice for the Management of Lymphoedema-International Consensus. The Government acknowledges the need for primary care practitioners including GPs and community nurses to have the necessary knowledge and skills to manage chronic conditions such as lymphoedema. To progress this, the petitioners should consider forwarding their framework document to the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Deans of Nursing for consideration of this issue as part of their curriculum and training reviews. The petition asks about treatment regimes for patients with lymphoedema. Lymphoedema has not been recognised specifically as a chronic medical condition for the purposes of the Chronic Disease Management (CDM) items on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), but this does not preclude it being considered as such. The MBS does not list all possible medical conditions that are regarded as chronic medical conditions. It is up to GPs to use their clinical judgement, taking into account the eligibility criteria and the general guidance to determine whether a patient with lymphoedema is eligible for treatment under the Medicare CDM items. Under the CDM items, patients with a chronic with medical condition and complex care needs are being managed by their GP under a GP management plan (GPMP) and team care arrangements with (TCA), and can be referred for up to five Medicare-rebatable allied health service items each calendar year. Specific categories of allied health professionals, including physiotherapists and occupational therapists who meet specific eligibility requirements, and who are registered with Medicare Australia and in private practice, are able to provide these CDM (individual) health services. The allied health services available under Medicare are not intended to fully cater for patients who require more intensive ongoing treatments. Instead, these Medicare services complement services provided by state and territory governments, and increase access to private allied health services by making them more affordable. The Australian Government also supports access to allied health services more generally through subsidies on private health insurance premiums and through targeted non-Medicare initiatives such as the Rural Primary Health Services program funded through the Divisions of General Practice and other primary health care providers in rural and remote communities. In addition, patients with lymphoedema may be eligible for Medicare benefits for monitoring and support services provided by a practice nurse (or registered Aboriginal Health Worker) on behalf of a GP (MBS item 10997). This item is available to patients who have a chronic or terminal medical condition and are being managed by their GP under a GPMP, TCA or a multidisciplinary care plan. Activities that a practice nurse or other health professional may undertake on behalf of or under the supervision of a GP are not prescribed, but must be within the nurse's professional competencies. A maximum of five services can be claimed per patient per calendar year. The petition asks that funding be provided for the cost of compression garments. The Government acknowledges that the cost of necessary medical aids and appliances can be a significant financial burden, particularly for people living with a chronic medical condition. Medical aids and appliances are provided by the states and territories as part of their responsibilities for the provision health services. Under the current health funding arrangements, the Australian Government's role is to provide health grants to state and territory governments. All state and territory governments operate aids and appliance programs to assist residents with the cost and/or provision of appropriate equipment, aids and appliances in the community setting. In addition, some private health insurers provide benefits for aids and appliances, but are free to determine the nature of health related goods that attract benefits and any conditions or restrictions on such benefits. The payment of benefits usually depends on the insured person holding a policy that covers aids and appliances. The petition also sought financial assistance for transport where travel of more than 40 kilometres is necessary to access services. Access to health care for people in rural and remote Australia is an important issue. Funding and administration of patient assisted travel schemes is the responsibility of state and territory governments. The schemes in each state and territory vary in relation to eligibility requirements, distance thresholds, subsidy levels and administrative arrangements. Even basic issues are impacted on by a range of factors including geography, demography, population density, locally available health services, public transport and infrastructure investments in each jurisdiction. While it is the states and territories which have funding and administrative responsibility for the patient assisted travel schemes within their jurisdictions, the Australian Government is committed to working with them on the effectiveness of the schemes, particularly in developing as much national consistency as possible. Under the National Health and Hospitals Network Agreement the Commonwealth, states and territories agreed to undertake further work in regard to patient assistance transport schemes, with a view to higher and more consistent national standards. I trust that the above information is of assistance. from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon Innisfail: Jubilee Bridge Dear Mrs Irwin of Thank you for your letter dated 25 May 2010 about a petition submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding funding to replace the Jubilee Bridge at Innisfail in Queensland, which is a local government responsibility. The Australian Government continues to provide funding direct to councils to assist Local Governments with road projects through the Roads to Recovery Program and Financial Assistance Grants (FAGs). Between 2009-10 and 2013-14, the Government will provide funding of $1.75 billion directly to local councils under the Roads to Recovery Program, with Queensland councils to receive $356 million of this allocation and the Cassowary Coast Regional Council to receive approximately $2,720,355. The Government provides further support to local councils through FAGs, the local roads component of which totals $589.7 million in 2009-10, with more than $110.7 million of this provided to Queensland, and $2,788,800 to the Cassowary Coast Regional Council. This funding is intended to supplement council and state government spending on local road construction and maintenance. Councils can apply the funding from these two streams to road infrastructure projects according to local priorities. I trust this information is of assistance to the Committee. from the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Mr Albanese Human Rights Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter dated 25 May 2010 referring a petition from the Mornington Peninsula Human Rights Group seeking the introduction of a bill for a Human Rights Act. As you are aware, on 21 April 2010, I launched Australia's Human Rights Framework. The Framework does not include a Human Rights Act or Charter. This was a decision that the Government did not take lightly. The issue for the Government was not whether human rights should be protected, but how best to do so. Rather than developing a legislative charter, the Framework is focused on ensuring people understand their human rights and responsibilities and that laws are consistent with Australia's international human rights obligations. The Framework reaffirms the Government's commitment to human rights and community engagement. Guided by the Report of the National Human Rights Consultation, education about human rights and responsibilities has been set as the highest priority within the Framework. This recognises that human rights can be protected and promoted effectively only if an understanding of and commitment to human rights becomes a part of everyday life for the community. Community engagement is central to the success of the implementation of the Framework as all Australians will play a vital role in motion and improvement of human rights. Independent research commissioned by the Consultation Committee showed that 90% of respondents supported enhanced attention by Parliament to human rights issues when making new laws. I am pleased to advise that on 2 June 2010, I introduced the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Bill 201 0 into Parliament. The Bill provides for the establishment of a new Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and requires statements assessing compatibility of new laws with Australia's international human rights obligations to accompany new legislation. The Government believes that increased Parliamentary scrutiny will ensure public confidence that our laws reflect our human rights obligations. This will be the first ever Committee dedicated to human rights scrutiny at the federal level. Increased Parliamentary scrutiny will ensure public confidence that our laws reflect our human rights obligations. I trust that this information is of assistance to the Committee. from the Attorney-General, Mr MCClelland School and Workplace Bullying Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 25 May 2010 concerning the school and workplace bullying petition recently submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions. The Australian Government takes issues of bullying seriously and believes student and workplace well-being and safety are essential for education and career success. All Australians should be able to learn and work in safe and supportive environments. The Government is determined to ensure schools and workplaces are supported in providing for the well-being of their students and employees. Although the Government does not have jurisdiction to intervene in cases of bullying and associated legislation, as part of its collaborative and leadership roles in developing national priorities for education and workplace safety, there are very important initiatives currently being undertaken the proto support state and territory governments. Firstly, the Government is leading a review of the National Safe Schools Framework (NSSF). The NSSF emphasises the need for teachers to have appropriate training in positive student management and the need for schools to respond to incidents as they occur. The Government believes too that tackling and addressing bullying behaviours are of utmost importance. Through the Review, linkages will be drawn with other well-being and child protection issues including: the emergence of technologies that enable new forms of bullying to develop; social and emotional learning; the explicit teaching of values; and changes in state and territory legislation and government policy. The NSSF is the only framework of its kind in the world and the Review ensures that it remains current and relevant in today's context. By instigating the Review, the Government has ensured that Australia maintains its leading edge in promoting safe and supportive schools. The project is identifying connections with other Australian Government and state and territory policies relating to the well-being of children and by drawing these critical links, schools will be made aware of other useful resources used to support the well-being of young people across the country. The role of parents and carers is also being examined to explore ways of encouraging them to become involved with their child's school and continuously promote a safe school environment. By involving this important group of people, a whole-school community approach to promoting safe schools can be established. The NSSF and the supporting documents will be re-written and will be available for online use by schools, thereby ensuring the Framework becomes a device available to schools to use proactively to help prevent or reduce the incidence of bullying and violence as well as providing an active tool for dealing with issues as they arise. All Australian schools currently have access to the NSSF and following the Review, the updated Framework will also be made available for use by all schools to guide them through the development of policies and practices to manage proactively the incidence of violence, aggression and bullying in schools. Further information about the NSSF and the review is available at www.safeschools.deewr.gov.au. With regard to workplace safety, the harmonisation of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) laws is a priority area of regulatory reform. All governments have committed to adopt uniform OHS laws, complemented by nationally consistent approaches to compliance and enforcement. This will be achieved through the development of model OHS laws that can be uniformly adopted by all jurisdictions to provide the same rights, obligations and protections for all Australian workers. Safe Work Australia, a tripartite body comprising representatives of the state and territory governments, the Australian Government, workers and employers is developing the model laws in accordance with decisions of the Workplace Relations Ministers' Council (WRMC). In December 2009 the WRMC endorsed the model Work Health and Safety Act. The endorsed model Act was drafted by Safe Work Australia in line with policy decisions previously made by the WRMC and with input from a public consultation process. In endorsing the model Act, Ministers were very mindful of the national interest and the significant benefits that will flow from harmonised laws in this important area. Each jurisdiction has committed to take all necessary steps to enact or otherwise give effect to the model Work Health and Safety Act. Safe Work Australia is currently working on a package of draft model regulations and draft priority codes of practice to support the agreed model Act. There will be a 4 month public comment period later this year which will provide anyone with an interest in the model Work Health and Safety laws the opportunity to provide feedback to Safe Work Australia on the package of model regulations and priority codes of practice. There will be associated campaigns to raise public awareness of this consultation process. Although most current OHS laws do not specifically address workplace bullying, all, OHS Acts impose legal responsibilities on both employers and employees. For example, under section 16 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1991 (Cth) employers must take all reasonably practicable steps to protect the health and safety of the employer's employees. Similarly, under section 21 of the Victorian Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004, employers have a duty of care to provide a safe working environment that is without risk to the health and safety of their employees. This duty of care requires employers to take proactive steps to identify those hazards with the potential to affect the health and safety of their employees and to implement measures to eliminate or control the risks arising from those hazards. The duty extends to psychosocial hazards in the workplace including bullying behaviours. All jurisdictions have also published codes of practice or guidance material dealing with bullying. Under the model Work Health and Safety Act, the health and safety duty requires a person conducting a business or undertaking to ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, the health and safety of workers (covering all types of workers including employees, volunteers, apprentices and contractors) while the workers are at work in the business or undertaking. Workers also have a duty to take reasonable care for their own health and safety, as well as that of other persons. The model Work Health and Safety Act makes it clear that ‘health' means physical and psychological health and provides for a variety of enforcement options, including imprisonment, for breaches of the health and safety duty. In addition, where bullying is linked to or based on attributes including a person's sex, disability, race, age, sexual preference, criminal record, trade union activity, political opinion, religion or social origin, it may be covered under federal and state anti-discrimination legislation. More information on this legislation is accessible online at www.hreoc.gov.au. I appreciate your bringing the petition to my attention, and trust this information is of assistance to the Committee and petitioners. from the former Minister for Education and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Ms Gillard New South Wales Ambulance Drivers Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 25 May 2010 regarding the petition of citizens of the Paterson electorate about a New South Wales State Government proposal to replace ambulance drivers with volunteers in Buladelah, Stroud, and Gloucester. As per Standing Order 209(b), I am providing a written response to you on the matters raised in the petition at points (3) and (4). I note that the petition calls on the New South Wales State Government to refute the proposal to replace ambulance drivers with volunteers, and to maintain a two-person ambulance crew with fully trained ambulance personnel. I further note that the petition calls on the Commonwealth Government to make health services a priority and ensure adequate funding to train more paramedics and ambulance personnel, including in regional areas. This Government has already made significant investments in our health and hospitals system. The Council of Australian Governments (COAG), at the 28 November 2008 meeting, agreed to a landmark deal providing $64 billion to the states and territories over five years-an increase of $22 billion or 50 per cent on the previous health care agreements. New South Wales received approximately $20.3 billion of this funding. The 2008 COAG package included $750 million to improve the operations of emergency departments (EDs), through the ‘Taking Pressure off Public Hospitals' measure. I understand that the New South Wales Government has allocated some of the funding it received under this measure to recruit additional Extended Care Paramedics for its Extended Care Paramedics Program. This Program aims to reduce the number of patients requiring transportation to EDs and to potentially reduce the number of unnecessary ED presentations. Furthermore, at the most recent COAG meeting of 20 April 2010, the Prime Minister, Premiers, and Chief Ministers of states and territories, with the exception of Western Australia, reached an historic agreement on health and hospitals reform-the establishment of a National Health and Hospitals Network. The Commonwealth Government is investing an additional $7.3 billion commencing June 2010 to implement these reforms, including: - measures to tackle the key pressure points in our public hospitals including quicker access to EDs and elective surgery waiting times; - over 1,300 new sub-acute care beds to support rehabilitation, palliative care and mental health services and 2,500 additional aged care beds to provide the right care at the right time; - more training places for GPs and specialists and locum relief for rural nurses and allied health professionals; - more support for nurses, particularly in aged care and general practice; - an expansion of GP and primary health care infrastructure, and better access to afterhours primary care; - transforming the way in which Australians with long-term illness are treated-starting with people living with diabetes-through voluntary coordinated care arrangements; - new investments in mental health, including help for 20,000 extra young people to get access to mental health services; - a nationally consistent aged care system providing extra places, better access to services, and stronger choice and protections for older Australians; - a personally controlled electronic health record system; and - new investments in prevention, including tough new action to tackle smoking. While the Commonwealth Government is providing record health funding to the states and territories, policy and funding responsibility for ambulance services continues to be a state matter. This is reflected in clause 24(c) of the National Healthcare Agreement and reinforced at clause B9a. of the new National Health and Hospitals Network Agreement, which stipulates that ambulance services have been agreed as excluded from transfer to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has, however, provided flexibility for states and territories in the applicaproved tion of health reforms with regard to rural Australia. The Commonwealth will, for example, ensure that new financing arrangements effectively support small regional and rural hospitals, including providing block funding where appropriate, so that small rural and regional hospitals can continue to deliver on Community Service Obligations. As you are aware, the Commonwealth will also become the majority funder of Australian public hospitals. The Commonwealth will fund 60 per cent of the efficient price for all public hospital services, and 60 per cent of capital, research and training in our public hospitals. In addition, the Commonwealth will take full funding responsibility for GP and primary health care services, and for aged care services. The Commonwealth is committed to delivering better health and better hospitals for all Australians, and welcomes the input of the Australian community on its unprecedented health reforms. I appreciate you bringing this matter to my attention. from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon Administration of Justice Dear Mrs Irwin I refer to your letter dated 25 May 2010 seeking a written response to a petition submitted to your committee, regarding a Section 72(ii) process under the Constitution. The petition requests that Parliament invoke the procedure provided for in Section 72(ii) of the Constitution to address alleged wrongful misbehaviour by judicial officers of the High Court and the Family Court of Australia. Section 72(ii) of the Constitution provides that Justices of the High Court and of the other courts created by the Parliament shall not be removed except by the Governor General in Council, on an address from both Houses of Parliament in the same session, asking for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour and incapacity. On the information provided, it does not appear that allegations made in the petition amount to misbehaviour or incapacity on the part of judicial officers of the High Court or the Family Court of Australia. Taking into account the seriousness of the provision, I do not consider it appropriate for Section 72(ii) proceedings to be invoked on the basis of this petition. from the Attorney-General, Mr MCClelland Administration of Justice Dear Mrs Irwin I refer to your letter dated 25 May 2010 seeking a written response to an amended petition submitted to your committee by Antal Bittman, regarding a Section 75(v) process under the Constitution. I note that the petition was amended following my letter to the Committee of 5 May 2010. The petition requests that Parliament invoke the procedure provided for in Section 72(ii) of the Constitution to terminate the appointments of Justices of the High Court. The petition alleges that the High Court erred in failing to set aside orders made by Officers of the Commonwealth to liquidate or freeze assets of a company or depositor in a matter involving the petitioner. Section 72(ii) of the Constitution provides that Justices of the High Court and of the other courts created by the Parliament shall not be removed except by the Governor General in Council, on an address from both Houses of Parliament in the same session, asking for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour and incapacity. On the information provided, it does not appear that allegations made in the petition amount to any misbehaviour or incapacity on the part of a Justice of the High Court. Taking into account the seriousness of the provision, I do not consider it appropriate for Section 72(ii) proceedings to be invoked on the basis of this petition. I hope this information is of assistance to the Committee - expanding the Consultative Working Group from the Attorney-General, MCClelland Internet Content Dear Mrs Irwin Petition regarding compulsory filtering of the internet by ISPs Thank you for your letter dated 23 June 2010 forwarding a copy of a petition regarding compulsory filtering of the internet by internet service providers (ISPs). I appreciate the petitioners' interest in this important issue. The Australian Government supports an open internet, where people can freely access information and express their ideas. This should not be confused with the notion that all content should be available to view and/or distribute regardless of its potential harm to society and the rights and safety of others. The complexity of protecting people, especially children, on the internet is why the Government's cybersafety plan involves a suite of measures, including: - expanding the Australian Federal Police (AFP) Child Protection Operations Team by 91 officers to detect and investigate online child sex exploitation; - funding to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to manage increased activity resulting from the AFP work to ensure that prosecutions are handled quickly; - funding to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (the ACMA) for: - a comprehensive range of cybersafety education activities including improving current government cybersafety website resources, making them easier for parents to use, and to provide up-to-date information, and - an online helpline to provide a quick and easy way for children to discuss cybersafety issues; - developing and implementing ISP filtering, which included undertaking a real world live pilot; that considers the broad range of cybersafety Mr issues and advises Government to ensure properly developed and targeted policy initiatives and programs; - forming a Youth Advisory Group to provide advice to the Consultative Working Group on cybersafety issues from a young person's perspective; and - ongoing cybersafety research into the changing digital environment to identify emerging issues and trends. ISP-level filtering of Refused Classification (RC) content For many years Australia has had a classification scheme that applies to DVDs, films, books and publications. A similar scheme also applies to television and radio. Under Australia's existing classification laws, RC material is not available in newsagencies or on library shelves, it cannot be viewed on a DVD or at the cinema and it is not shown on television. RC material includes child sexual abuse imagery, bestiality, sexual violence, detailed instruction in crime, violence or drug use and/or material that advocates the doing of a terrorist act. The Government believes that RC content has no place in a civilised society and has announced its intention to introduce legislation into Parliament requiring ISPs to filter a list of RC URLs provided to ISPs by the ACMA. These will be specific URLs that have been assessed as RC using existing criteria set out in the National Classification Scheme following a complaint from the public to the ACMA. URLs of child sexual abuse imagery obtained from lists maintained by highly reputable overseas agencies will also be filtered, followNational ing a detailed assessment by the ACMA of the processes used to compile those lists. The RC category, that applies to DVDs, films and books and would apply for the purpose of filtering, is not designed to censor free speech or impinge on public debate. To ensure the public's confidence in the list of URLs to be filtered I announced on 9 July 2010 a review of the RC category. The review will examine the current scope of the RC category to determine whether it adequately reflects current community standards. Transparency and Accountability Measures The Government has undertaken a public consultation process on measures to increase accountability and transparency of the placement of material on the RC filtering list. 174 submissions were received and used by the Government in developing a comprehensive suite of transparency and accountability measures to accompany the introduction of ISP filtering. These measures include: - an annual review of the RC Content list by an independent expert who will be appointed in consultation with industry; - clear avenues for appeal of classification decisions; - that all content identified on the basis of a public complaint be assessed by the ACMA and classified by the Classification Board under the National Classification Scheme; - that affected parties have the ability to have decisions reviewed by the Classification Review Board; and - a standardised block page notification, which will notify users that the content they have requested has been blocked because it is deemed RC, and provide information on how to seek a review if they believe the decision to be incorrect. The Classification Board is comprised of members broadly representative of the Australian community who are trained to classify content against the National Classification Scheme. Members of the Board are identified through a national recruitment process and make decisions about individual content against the criteria of the Classification Scheme independently of Government. This suite of measures will greatly strengthen the ISP filtering policy and give the community greater confidence in the processes that lead to a URL being placed on the RC Content list. Voluntary filtering of child abuse material Three of Australia's largest ISPs - Telstra, Optus and Primus - have agreed to voluntarily block a list of child abuse URLs compiled and maintained by the ACMA. These ISPs account for around 70 per cent of Australian internet users. In line with the Government's mandatory filtering policy, URLs of child abuse imagery obtained from lists maintained by highly reputable overseas agencies, such as the Internet Watch Foundation, will also be placed on the ACMA list for voluntary filtering following a detailed assessment (by the ACMA) of the processes used to compile those lists.

I trust this information will be of assistance. from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy Feeding Tube Dependency Dear Mrs Irwin I refer to correspondence of 16 June 2010 from the then Chair of your Committee, Mrs Julia Irwin, regarding a petition about children with a tube feeding dependency. I apologise for the delay in responding. The provision of intervention programs in Australia, such as the Graz model of weaning children from tube feeding, is currently a matter for state and territory governments to implement within their hospital systems, in consultation with the relevant Medical College. I have been advised that the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne is planning to undertake a review of international tube weaning programs in Austria, the United Kingdom and Canada in 2011. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare collects information on diagnoses and procedure information on episodes of care, including on neonatal tube feeding procedures. In Australia, there were 23,767 hospital separations in 2007-08 where a neonate or infant whose condition originated in the neonatal period was provided with a nasogastric tube for nutritional purposes. Data is only available for infants whose medical treatment occurred in hospital. No national data is available as to the level of infant tube feeding dependency - 2,500 additional aged care beds to provide The Australian Government, through the Medical Treatment Overseas (MTO) Program, may provide financial assistance for some people to receive treatment overseas where it is not available in Australia. However the Australian medical profession needs to accept it as a standard form of treatment for the applicant's condition. Since January 2009 my Department has received and assessed four applications for assistance though the MTO Program for families to travel to Graz, Austria, to attend the tube weaning program at the University of Graz Children's Hospital. It is currently assessing two new applications. The Government is committed to improving the flexibility and efficiency of the Australian health care system. That is why we reached an historic agreement at the Council of Australian Governments, with the exception of Western Australia, on health and hospitals reform-the establishment of a National Health and Hospitals Network. This represents the most significant reform to Australia's health and hospitals system since the introduction of Medicare, and one of the largest reforms to service delivery in the history of the Federation. These reforms will deliver better health and hospitals by: - providing more doctors, more nurses and more hospital beds; - helping patients receive more seamless care across sectors of the health system; - improving the quality of care patients receive through high-performance standards and improved engagement of local clinicians; and - providing a secure funding base for health and hospitals into the future. The Gillard Government is investing an additional $7.4 billion to implement these reforms, including: - measures to tackle the key pressure points in our public hospitals, including quicker access to emergency departments and elective surgery waiting times; - over 1,300 new sub-acute care beds to support rehabilitation, palliative care and mental health services; the right care at the right time; - more training places for GPs and specialists and locum relief for rural nurses and allied health professionals; - more support for nurses, particularly in aged care and general practice; - an expansion of GP and primary health care infrastructure, and better access to afterhours primary care; - transforming the way in which Australians with long-term illness are treated-starting with people living with diabetes-through voluntary coordinated care arrangements; - new investments in mental health, including help for 20,000 extra young people to get access to mental health services; - a nationally consistent aged care system providing extra places, better access to services, and stronger choice and protections for older Australians; - a personally controlled electronic health record system; and - new investments in prevention, including tough new action to tackle smoking. These reforms and investments will drive major improvements in service delivery and the Gillard Government will continue to work closely with the states and territories and stakeholders to implement these reforms to ensure better health outcomes for Australians. I trust that the above information is of assistance. from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon Human Rights: Falun Gong Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 22 June 2010 referring a petition submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions about the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China. In accordance with Standing Order 209(b), my response is as follows. The Australian Government has long held concerns about the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China. While the Government takes no position on Falun Gong beliefs, it considers that China's ban on Falun Gong and the treatment of its practitioners are in breach of international human rights standards. The Government has consistently raised these concerns with the Chinese authorities. Senior officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have also raised Australia's concerns about the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners through diplomatic channels in Canberra and Beijing, and during the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue, the most recent round of which took place in Canberra in February 2009. We expect the next round to take place in China in 2010. We are also aware of Falun Gong-related claims of organ harvesting. If true, these reports would be very disturbing. China has denied the allegations and the information we have seen so far is inconclusive. The Government will continue to raise its concerns on the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China with Chinese authorities. from the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Stephen Smith Live Animal Exports Dear Mrs Irwin I write in response to the letter from Ms Julia Irwin MP, former Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions, of 22 June 2010, to the Hon. Simon Crean MP, former Minister for Trade, about a petition calling on the and Australian Government to end the export of live animals. It was forwarded to the Hon. Tony Burke MP, the then Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Senator the Hon. Joe Ludwig, who was appointed portfolio minister on 11 September 2010, is now responsible for the matters you raise. Minister Ludwig has asked me to reply to your correspondence on his behalf. I regret the delay in responding. The export sector is an important part of a vibrant and growing livestock industry. Its earnings reached a total of $996.5 million in 2009, underpinning employment of around 10 000 people in rural and regional Australia. The government recognises that the sector faces challenges and responsibilities different from those in some other export industries. Being part of the international live export trade means Australia can help improve the way it operatesbenefiting not just our animals but those from other countries as well. The government and those involved in the live export trade are continuing to work on improvements throughout the supply chain. From the beginning of 2008, the government approved projects worth more than $2.4 million under the Live Animal Trade Program to further improve animal welfare in importing countries in the Middle East, North Africa and Asia. For example, the program has supported upgrades in livestock facilities in the Middle East and Asia so that they meet international animal welfare guidelines. The former minister announced the three-year $3.2 million Live Trade Animal Welfare Partnership in 2009. Projects under this program are funded in equal parts by the government and Australia's livestock export industry. On 10 March 2010 the government announced funding for three new projects worth around $1 million in total under the program. On 15 October 2010, Minister Ludwig announced further funding for four projects worth around $1.1 million in total under the program. The government has consulted scientists and animal welfare organisations like the RSPCA in developing the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock (ASEL). They are regularly updated are available at www.daff.gov.au/livestockexportstandards. Several measures are in place to ensure transparency in Australia's live export trade. All livestock exporters must hold a livestock export licence issued under the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997. Under the ASEL all vessels carrying livestock must be accompanied by an accredited Australian stockperson and for all voyages to or through the Middle East a government accredited veterinarian must also be on-board. For all voyages the on-board stockperson or veterinarian must provide a comprehensive end of voyage report on livestock health and welfare during the journey. For voyages of 10 days or longer they must also provide daily reports. In addition the master of the vessel is required to submit a report on the outcome of the voyage to Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA). AMSA and BSG investigate all consignments which record mortalities above a certain threshold, and a report on voyage outcomes is tabled in each House of Parliament every six months. The government acknowledges that some people would prefer Australia to export meat rather than live animals. However, a 2008 report from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics concluded that restrictions on the export of live animals would not increase sales of chilled beef, veal or sheep meat. Instead, the countries involved would be likely to source live animals from elsewhere. The report is available at www.abare.gov.au/publications_html/livestock/liv estock 08/LiveExports.pdf. Further information on the live animal trade is available on the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry website at www.daff.gov.au/livetrade. I note that, when the committee has considered this response, it will be presented in the House and posted on the committee's website. Thank you for providing the government with a copy of the terms of the petition. I trust this formation is of assistance. from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig Human Rights: Falun Gong Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 22 June 2010 referring seven petitions submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions about the persecution of Falun. Gong practitioners in. China. In accordance with Standing Order 209(b), my response is as follows. The Australian Government has long held concerns about the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China. While the Government takes no position on Falun Gong beliefs, it considers that China's ban on Falun Gong and the treatment of its practitioners are in breach of international human rights standards. The Government has consistently raised these concerns with the Chinese authorities. Senior officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have raised Australia's concerns about the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners through diplomatic channels in Canberra and Beijing, and during the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue, the most recent round of which took place in Canberra in February 2009. We expect the next round to take place in China in 2010. Regarding legal actions against Chinese leaders, the Government believes that engagement with China is the best way to support improvement in human rights in that country. I am aware of cases in Australian courts brought by Falun Gong practitioners against Chinese officials or former officials. These cases are ongoing and it is not appropriate for me to comment further on matters that are currently before the courts. Cases of Australians who find themselves in trouble overseas are usually dealt with as consular matters. The Australian Government takes seriously its responsibility to assist Australians overseas. However, we are obliged to respect the judicial sovereignty of other countries, just as we expect them to respect ours. We are also aware of Falun Gong-related claims of organ harvesting. If true, these reports would be very disturbing. China has denied the allegain- tions and the information we have seen so far is inconclusive. The Government will continue to raise its concerns on the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China with Chinese authorities. from the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Stephen Smith Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Dear Mrs Irwin I refer to a letter of 22 June 2010 from the then Chair of the Standing Committee on Petitions, Mrs Julia Irwin, regarding a petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions for the funding of SOLIRIS® (eculizumab) for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) through the Life Saving Drugs Program (LSDP). I apologise for the delay in responding. The LSDP provides subsidised access for eligible patients to expensive and life saving drugs for serious and rare medical conditions. There are no alternative drugs or suitable therapeutic options for the conditions treated under the LSDP. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), an independent expert advisory committee, considered a submission for the funding of SOLIRIS through the LSDP in March 2009. While the PBAC did recommend that SOLIRIS be considered by the Australian Government for inclusion on the LSDP, it also noted a number of uncertainties in the evidence about the drug. These included doubts on the extent that SOLIRIS extends life compared to best supportive care, and the size of the benefit in reducing the incidence of blood clots, which is a serious component of the disease. In light of the uncertainty associated with the effectiveness of SOLIRIS, I made an urgent request for further advice from the PBAC on the merits of SOLIRIS being funded through the LSDP. On 13 August 2010, the PBAC made a recommendation to the Government to consider the funding of SOLIRIS through the LSDP for the treatment of PNH. Further details on this recommendation are available from my Department's website at www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/ Content/pbac-outcomes-by-meeting While the PBAC has recommended SOLIRIS for subsidy through the LSDP, there are a number of steps that must be completed before the drug can be considered by the Government. These steps include establishing a Disease Advisory Committee to finalise eligibility and continuation criteria, and funding arrangement negotiations with the sponsor, Alexion Pharmaceuticals. A PNH Disease Advisory Committee has now been established and will be chaired by Professor Jeffrey Szer. My Department is working with Professor Szer and the sponsor to progress this work as quickly as possible. I trust that the above information is of assistance. from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon Wandering Trad Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for the letter of 28 June 2010 from the former Chair of the Standing Committee on Petitions to the Hon. Tony Burke MP, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, about a petition on the weed, wandering trad (Tradescantia albiflora). This petition was presented by the Member for La Trobe on 24 June 2010. Minister Burke has asked me to reply on his behalf. I regret the delay in responding. The Australian Government recognises that weeds are a significant problem for farmers, the community and the environment and works closely with stakeholders to improve and support national solutions to manage their impact. The petitioners' request that the House of Representatives restore government funding for wandering trad control relates to the previous government's commitment in late 2007 to fund a three-year CSIRO biological control project targeting this weed through the Defeating the Weed Menace program. The Defeating the Weed Menace program ended in June 2008. The government has established a National Weeds and Productivity Research program, administered by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. More information is available at www.rirdc.gov.au. On the petitioners' request that the House of Representatives implement an Australia-wide strategy to combat wandering trad, Minister Burke recently announced $6 million in funding to support the Australian Weeds Strategy over the next three years. One of the objectives of this strategy is to prevent the spread of weeds. I enclose more information on the government's role in weed management. Thank you for raising the Member for La Trobe's concerns. I trust this information is of assistance. Australian Government responsibilities for weed management and research in relation to wandering trad Australian Government responsibilities for weed management include international border protection, import and export of plant material, and management of Commonwealth lands such as defence establishments and Commonwealth national parks. Across the country, the day-today management of weeds is primarily the responsibility of state and territory governments and individual landholders. The Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council and the Primary Industries Ministerial Council and their subordinate committees the National Biosecurity Committee and the Australian Weeds Committee provide the practical mechanism for federal agreement on responsibilities and funding for better weed management. The Australian Weeds Strategy (2007)developed by the Australian Weeds Committee for the Natural Resource Ministerial Councilprovides a framework to establish consistent weed guidelines and priorities across Australia. In the area of weeds research, the government has delivered on its election commitment to provide $15.3 million over four years from July 2008 to establish a National Weeds and Productivity Research program. Through the first funding round of the program in 2008, the government identified biological control as one of its priority investment areas. Thirty-nine national weed research projects, worth $3.6 million in total, were funded including eleven CSIRO research projects and a variety of biological control projects; however, no proposals addressing wandering trad were received. The Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation is consulting widely as it develops guidelines for the next stage of the research program. This will provide further opportunity for consideration of the merit of research into control of wandering trad over the next two years. To support the Australian Weeds Strategy the government has recently announced $6 million over the next three years for coordination of priority actions including the Weeds of National Significance (WoNS) program. The WoNS are twenty weeds agreed in early 2000 by the Australian and all state and territory governments as the priority species for nationally coordinated action. A national strategy for each WoNS species sets out best practice actions to manage the weed. WoNS coordinators champion the on-ground adoption and continued improvement of each national strategy across the country. The Australian Weeds Committee called for nominations of weeds to add to the list of WoNS in 2011 and beyond. This will provide an opportunity for consideration by all states and territories of nominating wandering trad as a candidate species for WoNS coordination. from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig Statements",29
6,Mr MURPHY,PETITIONS,"I wanted to take this opportunity today to speak about petitioning more generally for the information of newer members and the general public. Petitioning has a long history in the Australian parliament, having been part of the operations of this House since Federation, and having an even longer history in Westminster, dating from the time of King Edward I, who reigned at the turn of the 14th century. Petitioning is the only way members of the public can directly interact with the House, and the Petitions Committee serves as a conduit between the community and the parliament for the purposes of petitioning. It does not seek to promote or de-emphasise individual petitions, but assists their passage through the House, and provides authority for requests to ministers for responses to concerns raised in petitions. It might be useful for the House if I outline some practical aspects of petitioning the House and the way the Petitions Committee participates in the process. In so doing I refer to the guidelines posted on the committee's webpage titled ‘Petitioning the House of Representatives'. These guidelines are based on the standing orders of the House. Essentially, petitions need to be in a particular format and addressed to the House, and refer to a matter over which the House has power to act. Petitions should state the reasons for petitioning the House, and contain a request for action by the House. The reasons and request are known as the terms of a petition. Beyond this, the terms of petitions should be no more than 250 words, and must not be illegal or promote illegal acts. Petitions must be in English, or be accompanied by a certified translation. No letters, affidavits or other documents can be attached, and these are returned to the principal petitioner. It is also important that every petition contain the signature and full name and address of a principal petitioner on the first page of the petition. The principal petitioner is generally responsible for organising the petition and receives correspondence from the committee, and relevant minister if the minister provides a response. All signatures must be original-not copied, pasted or transferred-and each signature must be made by the person signing in their own handwriting, except where a person who cannot sign asks another person to do so on their behalf. Against these parameters, the committee makes determinations on whether petitions it receives-directly from petitioners or from members-are in or out of order for the purposes of the House. In this we are governed by standing orders that I have summarised. But there is also a wider vision. Petitions are one way to counter disengagement: intermediaries are stripped away, and people can make a direct connection to the House. And it is in many ways truly a more direct connection. One of the great successes since the introduction of the Petitions Committee in 2008 is an increase in ministerial responses to petitions. In the 41st Parliament, before the committee was introduced, the response rate was less than one per cent. This was raised to approximately 60 per cent following the introduction of the committee. This is a truly remarkable increase in three short years. Finally, increasingly petitioners are in contact with the committee and its secretariat in order to check that proposed petitions fall within the parameters set by standing orders. This has led to a greater number of petitions being found in order, and a rising confidence in the community that the concerns voiced in petitions can indeed be heard by this House. NA Regional Australia Committee Statements",47
7,Mr WINDSOR,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regional Australia. I wish to make a statement concerning the committee's inquiry into the impact of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in Regional Australia. On 28 October the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, the Hon. Simon Crean, determined that an inquiry of the newly formed regional Australia committee would look into various aspects of the proposed plan in relation to the Murray-Darling catchment. As most members, if not all, would be aware, this is a very important food producing asset that we have in the eastern part of Australia. It intersects four states and has been part of various discussions for decades now in terms of some of the issues that revolve around the passage of the Murray and the Darling systems through four states and then out into the ocean at the Murray mouth. There have been a number of discussions over many years trying to wrestle with the various issuesusage issues, allocation issues and river health and environmental issues. I thank the members who are going to have their time taken up in being on the committee, some of whom are in the chamber at the moment-and the deputy chair, the member for Braddon, will be speaking shortly. I thank those committee members for their involvement. I think they are adopting the correct mindset in relation to this issue. We have a unique opportunity, given the nature of this hung parliament, to actually design a solution. The multiparty committeecomprising Labor, Liberal, National and Independent members-will be able to look at all areas including socio-economic issues, the impacts on communities and the various problems within specific valleys. Given the urgency of this particular issue, many members will give up time in January to travel throughout the system not only to conduct hearings but also to look at some of the very important aspects of the Murray-Darling system. We believe that there are solutions out there that need to be looked at and, given the concerns that have been expressed by the community about the Murray-Darling Basin Authority guide, we are confident that, given the nature of the committee, many of the concerns can be placated. The committee looks forward to resolving what is a long standing issue, one that both sides of parliament have wrestled with over many years. We now have a unique opportunity. The executive arm of government does not have total control in this particular parliament, and the members of this committee, most of whose electorates lie within the catchment itself, have a real opportunity to come together and design a plan that can be proposed at the end of the committee hearings. Hopefully that plan can be taken on board by the executive, by the minister for regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, and by the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. The secretariat has called for submissions in relation to this, and I would encourage people to be involved. I know a lot of the people who have been to meetings feel as though there is a foregone conclusion in relation to the various numbers that are outlined in the Murray-Darling Basin Authority's guide. However, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority in a sense has no real authority. It is the parliament that has the authority. As I have said, the committee will be made up of members from across the spectrum in the parliament, and both the minister for regional Australia and the minister for the environment, as well as the Prime Minister, have said to me that they are keen to see this issue resolved. I think that it is this parliament that may be able to do it. Committee members will travel throughout the basin area during January, hearings will be held between February and April and a report should come down in either April or May, although that deadline is extendable if necessary. Many people from across the basin have contacted me-and, I believe, other members of the committee-putting forward various suggestions to enhance the environmental health of the Murray-Darling system as well as for mitigating the socio-economic effects of the guide's proposed cutbacks on certain communities. A lot of the work of the committee will be to look at those impacts on communities. The recommendations currently in place are only a guide. They are not even a draft. They are definitely not a plan and they are not legislation but, if those current recommendations were to be put in place, we need to ask what impacts they would have on those communities. Where those impacts have been shown, we really need to drill down to find out whether there are other solutions to the problem-for example, through water use efficiency or evaporative savings. There are a whole range of other issues out there, many of which are within specific valleys. A specific issue that needs to be addressed is the finding of solutions to problems of river health within specific valleys given the water reductions that have been advised. Given that we are short on time. I will leave my statement there and ask the deputy chair to say a few words. To all those out there who may be listening to this statement, including the press, I would urge them to consider that this is probably one of the biggest issues this parliament will deal withand it has wrestled with the problem for many decades. But I would ask people to actually look at the positive sides of we should look forward to resolving the issue of socio-economic impacts on those people-irrigators as well as other people impacted by the current health of the river system-who have invested heavily in their communities. I believe there is a solution there and I think we should take this opportunity, given the nature of this particular parliament, to work constructively to deliver a solution to the parliament and the various ministers so that this issue can be put to bed once and for all.",48
8,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,COMMITTEES,"I thank the member for New England for his comments, endorse his statements and congratulate him on being appointed Chair of the Standing Committee on Regional Australia. I congratulate all the other members of the committee on their appointments. I want to reinforce what the member for New England had to say about the committee and the terms of inquiry. There is a belief that the proposed guide from the Murray-Darling Authority is set in stone. The member for New England is absolutely correct: this parliament will make its recommendations on that guide and its impact, environmentally, socially and economically. The concern that the member raised is probably best expressed in a Crikey submission from Andrew Campbell, who wrote on 16 November: The lack of buy-into the draft Basin Plan among affected communities is palpable. The feeling that decisions that will affect lives and businesses are being made remotely, without a fine-grained understanding of local impacts or local solutions, is widespread across the Basin. Even among people who accept that the Basin is not a magic pudding, and that decades of over-allocation need to be corrected in the interests of long-term water security and river health, there is a strong perception that the plan is a done deal, that consultation processes are cosmetic, and that legitimate social and equity concerns are not being taken seriously. this: that That is the end of the quote. As the member for New England said, and as was reiterated in a joint ministerial press release on 14 October by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities-Senator Ludwig, Minister Crean and Minister Burke-the intention is that this inquiry will look at and take notice of those people who have something to say about the economic and social effects of this guide. And a guide it is, and that was reiterated by Minister Burke. I hope that the people of the Murray-Darling and all those interested in these important questions will take heart from who is on this committee. There is a vast amount of experience and a great deal of interest in the Murray-Darling region among its members. The member chairing the committee, the member for New England, Tony Windsor, has been in this place since the New South Wales assembly for 10 years before that and is well known throughout Australia for his interest in matters to do with agriculture and the environment and other rural and regional issues. The member at the table at the moment, the member for Farrer, Susan Ley, is from the area of Albury in New South Wales and is a passionate advocate of her region. She works to get the balance right and advocates by representing people and listening to their views. My colleague the member for Capricornia from Queensland, Kirsten Livermore, has been in this parliament since 1998. She another passionate advocate of rural and regional Australia with a great deal of interest in this area. Michael MCCormack, the member for Riverina, is from the National Party. Michael has a long history of being interested in sues that affect his community, working through his media and publications to help. That is why he is in this House: to represent those people. Then there is Rob Mitchell, the member for MCEwen from Victoria; Dan Tehan, the member for Wannon in Victoria; Craig Thomson, the current Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics; Dr Sharman Stone, the member for Murray; Patrick Secker, the member for Barker in South Australia; and I. We all have long histories of interest in ters rural and regional. We want to hear. We want to consult. We want to listen. And we will take notice.",50

10,Mr BILSON,COMPETITION AND CONSUMER,"Dunkley) (10.26 am)Our big banks are the Beatles of the Australian economy. Like the Fab 4 lads from Liverpool, our banks are fabulously successful, globally significant and likely to touch the lives of most of us in some way. Just like each of the four Beatles, any one of the big four banks can lead with the lyrics. For a live performance, the band members recognise the cue or opening note, know the tunes spontaneously and quickly catch on to play with perfect tempo and rhythm and sing with marvelous harmony, particularly for the chois rus. While this kind of planning, synchronicity and performance may well be remarkable in a Beatles concert, it is untenable between competitors in a market economy. Concert performance in an entertainment context for the joy of audiences becomes concerted practice in the economy to the detriment of is- consumers and workably competitive markets. Concerted practices have been recognised by the European Commission in order to deal with collusive situations where firms have not explicitly agreed with each other but embark on practices which have the effect or the object of distorting competition. The European Court in the sugar cartel case defined the concept of ‘concerted practice' as ‘a form of coordination between undertakings which, matwithout having been taken to the stage where an agreement properly so-called has been concluded, knowingly substitutes for the risks of competition'. The court found this kind of practical cooperation particularly repugnant if it enabled the businesses concerned to consolidate established positions the detriment of effective freedom of movement of the products in the market and of the freedom of consumers to choose their suppliers. We have no such equivalent law in Australia. Currently, price signalling is not covered by the existing cartel prohibitions of the Trade Practices Act in the absence of an understanding between the parties. This means that the courts in Australia need to find some form of commitment to act in a particular way with the purpose or effect of substantially lessening competition for illegality to be found. The ACCC has previously recommended changes to the law to redefine what amounts to an understanding to address the requirements of commitment demanded by the courts. The ACCC's 2007 report into the price of unleaded petrol identified how the current trade practices law was unable to deal with the coordination of pricing between competitors in the absence of an arrangement or understanding to act on this information. The commission recommended changes to the law to redefine ‘understanding' and in its March 2008 response the Labor government said that it would give careful consideration to the ACCC's proposed amendments to the Trade Practices Act. In early 2009, Treasury produced a discussion paper on the meaning of ‘understanding', and more than a dozen submissions were received. Inadequate powers to tackle price coordination and the absence of US or EU style competition tools which treat price signalling as cartel style behaviour were again identified by the ACCC as a concern when it opposed Caltex's mid-2009 plan to purchase more than 300 Mobil retail outlets. There have been lots of calls from the ACCC for action over many years, but no sign of any kind of substantive, considered to and constructive policy response from the Labor government. As recently as August this year the ACCC Commissioner Dr Jill Walker was making the case about this ‘gap in the law' and how it needed to be addressed by: … a European type prohibition against facilitating or concerted practices to directly target the practices of concern. This ‘gap in the law' has taken on a particular salience given the current vigorous debate about the state of competition in the banking sector and interest rate movements. In an article from the 4 November 2009 edition of the Australian headed ‘ANZ shift on plan to stick with RBA', the widely reported comments by ANZ chief executive, Mike Smith, that he would be ‘reluctant' to increase home loan rates over and above the RBA's rate increases, were reiterated. What was more significant, in the context of this bill, was the article's report of Mr Smith's subsequent clarifying remarks at the bank's annual profit announcement that if other banks moved their rates outside moves by the RBA he would not be, and I quote: ‘stuck on my own.' These remarks were extraordinary. Earlier in the same month, the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, argued that there was ‘absolutely no justification' for any move beyond the Reserve Bank's in his now notorious and famously ineffective Captain Feathersword warnings to banks about gouging customers. More significant though, were the reported remarks from the ACCC chairman, Graeme Samuel that he was worried that too many of the banks are out there signalling to each other and to the world at large that they are going to increase rates. Mr Samuel went on to characterise the kind of price signalling he was concerned about, as banks were: … saying to their competitors, hey guys, if you lift your rates, we're going to lift them too, don't have to worry about it. The result is the crabwalk of interest rate movements that leave borrowers and consumers wondering where the competition is, rate rises that seem to defy independent analysis of their justification and bewilderment at record profits results. Anticompetitive comments like those from the ANZ chief are unwise and unbecoming, and may well be unlawful in the future if this bill is passed. The Shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey, has outlined a ninepoint plan to boost banking competition. This bill is a very clear and demonstrable example of action to back up that commitment. The anticompetitive facilitating, or concerted practice, that this bill addresses is known as price signalling. Anticompetitive price signalling is a facilitating practice by which corporations inform their rivals about price actions and intentions, so as to eliminate uncertainty about the price of their goods or services, thus reducing the inherent risks of competition which would normally be a feature of workably competitive markets. Anticompetitive price signalling is engaged in with the hope, or even expectation, that competitors will reciprocate on the setting of the price and terms and conditions for their goods or services, although it does not require any commitment from them to do so. The effect of such behaviour will often be the same as prohibited conduct but is said by the ACCC to currently not be captured by existing provisions. The parliament needs to act, not with words that are easily ignored, but with deeds. This coalition private member's bill seeks to establish a new head of power under which the ACCC would be able to investigate and seek penalties for price signalling that produces anticompetitive effects in the so you Australian market to the detriment of Australian consumers. The government has failed to address the price-signalling risk to consumers and the Australian economy where the current trade practices laws have been said time and time again by the ACCC to be unable to deal with this kind of conduct. The bill creates new provisions to make anticompetitive price signalling unlawful and is designed to operate within the existing framework of the Trade Practices Act and to respond to those repeated calls from the ACCC for the parliament to address this gap in the Australian competition law toolkit. This conduct is unilateral and therefore cannot be dealt with under existing price-fixing prohibitions, where an understanding to exchange information that has the purpose, effect or likely effect of fixing, maintaining or controlling prices is required. Importantly, the bill also recognises that some communication of price related information can at times be pro-competitive and beneficial for consumers. The ability to compare prices, to be aware of discounting or to be readily able to undertake market research to support purchasing decisions and to compare rival offers; all of this preserved by the provisions of this bill and protected because these are advantageous to consumers and are not anticompetitive. As a result, unlawful price-signalling conduct is defined in the bill as needing to contain three elements specifically designed to ensure that pro-competitive and proconsumer price related communication is not impeded by this bill. It seeks to ensure that the bill has key elements to focus on the anticompetitive conduct. It requires price related information to be communicated to a competitor for the purpose of inducing the competitor to vary its price, with the effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. The bill makes it possible for a court to infer purpose on the basis of the conduct. This is the ‘if it looks like, walks like, squawks like and hangs out with ducks, it is fair enough for the court to infer that it is a duck' reasoning. The substantially lessening competition test is a recognised threshold in the Trade Practices Act and has been selected to ensure that the anticompetitive effects manifested in identical prices or parallel price movements in competitive markets are captured. But for oligopolistic markets, those interdependent markets where there is a small number of big players and there are already competition deficits, it is open for the court to conclude that even a more modest anticompetitive infringement does amount to a substantial lessening of competition. We have broadly defined communication, and the details are set out in the explanatory memorandum. But we have also explained that there are legitimate purposes, and in some cases lawful obligations, for companies to share information that might otherwise be captured by this bill. This is where we are talking about information that is already in the public domain, where that has been repackaged or rebroadcast, where it is relating to internal discussions, where customers might also be competitors and also where there is a lawful obligation to provide that information. The bill is responsive to the gap in the law the ACCC has consistently identified and the government has failed to address. I call on the government to pick up this bill in the interest of consumers. It actually gives the Treasurer a practical example of what he should be doing and what he has failed to do. He should pick up this bill. It would look like he has some authority and some commitment to tackle anticompetitive price signalling in Australia. Bill read a first time. Ordered that the second reading be made an order of the day for the next sitting. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Climate Change",51
11,Mr MURPHY,COMPETITION AND CONSUMER,I move: That this House acknowledges that climate change is: (1) real; and (2) human-induced.,54
12,Mr MURPHY,COMPETITION AND CONSUMER,"Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, I have been speaking for many years in parliament on the need to take urgent action in relation to climate change. In 2003, one of the hottest summers on record, a health crisis occurred in Europe in which an estimated 40,000 people died from heat stress. In France, 14,802 heat related deaths were recorded in that summer of extremes, mostly amongst the young, the sick and the elderly, unable to cope with the extreme temperatures. The terrible year of 2003 brought some of the highest temperatures on record, yet 2006 saw another heatwave, with the warmest July since the first official records, in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom. And in this year, even more records were broken, with the period from April to June being the warmest ever recorded for land areas in the Northern Hemisphere. Not only is the evidence for global warming ever strengthened but there are also the less well recognised threats of rising sea levels, caused by melting ice and the thermal expansion of seawater, and ocean acidification, caused by the dissolution of carbon dioxide gas. The global warming problem can be separated into three distinct issues: measurements, causes and consequences. The first issue, measurements, is the collection of observations carried out over decades that show a clear warming trend. In particular, NASA has recently issued the following findings: (1) that the decade January 2000 to December 2009 was the warmest on record; (2) that the most recent annual Arctic Sea ice coverage minimum, a strong indicator of arctic temperatures, was the second lowest in satellite observations; and (3) that the land ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica are both losing ice and that Antarctica has been losing 100 cubic kilometres of ice per year, while other reports show that Greenland is losing 200 cubic kilometres of ice per year. The British Met Office and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's recent combined report entitled State of the climate also warns unequivocally that the world is warming and has been for the last three decades. The report states, firstly: … the first six months of this year were the test on record. Secondly: … “variability” in different regions, such as the cold winter in Britain, does not mean the the world is not warming. And thirdly, that greenhouse gases are the glaringly obvious cause of the 0.56 degrees warming over the last 50 years. The CSIRO, in its own recent State of the climate report, states that (1) the mean temperature in Australia has increased by about 0.7 degrees since 1960; (2) the decade 2000-2009 has been the warmest on record; and (3) the geographic distribution of rainfall has changed significantly over the last 50 years and rainfall has decreased in the south-east and south-west. The CSIRO report concludes that there is a nine out of 10 chance that the warming observed since 1950 has been driven by greenhouse gas emissions. The second issue relating to global warming is the identification of the factor or factors causing this phenomenon. As reported recently in New Scientist, Aradhna Tripati and her colleagues at the University of California, Los Angeles, have found that the chemical composition of fossil shells is linked to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and have been able to reliably reconstruct the levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide for the last 20 million years. This and other studies have shown that carbon dioxide is a principal influence in controlling the earth's climate and, in particular, these investigations provide an insight into the sensitivity of the climate to changing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Climate sensitivity to atmospheric carbon dioxide levels is defined as ‘the effect on mean global temperatures of the doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels'. Richard Alley, of Pennsylvania State University, reports that a climate sensitivity figure of three hotdegrees, also supported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is in accord with the available data. Although many details remain to be settled, the evidence is rest of now very clear: if we double the preindustrial level of carbon dioxide of around 280 parts per million we can expect a rise in global temperatures of three degrees in the short term and possibly as much as seven degrees over the centuries to follow. The third issue regarding global warming is the predicted consequences of the continued emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Although the fossil evidence is clear, predictions of climate change over the next few decades have to rely upon mathematical models that simulate the complex processes that drive the climate. When climatologists add the well-understood effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels into these models they see results that are in accord with observations. It is this agreement of model calculations with real-world conditions that gives confidence that the predictions of future warming are essentially correct. There are two other serious problems that do not depend upon theoretical studies or fossil evidence to raise an alarm. The first concern is the increase in sea levels brought about by the simple physical processes of the thermal expansion of seawater and the melting of glacial and polar ice. According to the CSIRO, from 1870 to 2007, global average sea levels have risen by close to 200 millimetres, at an average rate of 1.7 millimetres during most of the 20th century and at an accelerating rate, corresponding to increasing global average temperatures of three millimetres between 1993 and 2009. The CSIRO Division of Marine and Atmospheric Research warns: ‘Worldwide, in excess of 150 million people live within one metre of the current high-tide level and a further 250 million people live within five metres of the high tide.' Recent observations from satellites and tide gauges show that the increase in sea levels is tracking close to the maximum forecast issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2001 and will lead to an estimated global average rise of 880 millimetres above 1990 levels by 2100. There is sufficient heat accumulated in the atmosphere and oceans that make it virtually certain that millions of people will be flooded from their homes over the coming decades. Another concern is the acidification of sea water caused by the dissolution of carbon dioxide gas into the oceans. Measurements show that approximately one-third of the carbon dioxide gas that has been released by the burning of fossil fuels since the industrial revolution has dissolved in sea water, and this dissolved carbon dioxide gas is causing the ocean waters to become increasingly acidic. A high-school chemistry textbook will tell you that when carbon dioxide gas dissolves in water it will react with the water to produce carbonic acid, which partly dissociates to form carbonate, bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. Hydrogen ions are found in all aqueous solutions of acids, and the acidity of a solution is determined by the concentration of hydrogen ions. This concentration is usually expressed as pH, which for complex reasons is found to be seven in neutral solutions, greater than seven in alkaline solutions and less than seven in acidic solutions. Sea water is normally slightly alkaline, and across the planet the pH of the surface layers of sea water-which are the habitat of most sea creatures-have become more acidic by 0.12 pH units since the beginning of the industrial revolution, so that the pH of surface layers of sea water is now approximately 8.1. This increase in acidity of the surface layers of ocean water of 0.12 pH units actually represents an increase of 30 per cent, or nearly a one-third increase, in the acidity of ocean waters. In November 2008, scientists from the CSIRO and the University of New South Wales published a paper that reported on seasonal changes in carbonate and ocean acidity. The scientists found that the level of acidification where the shells of important plankton organisms start to dissolve corresponds with an atmospheric concentration of 450 parts per million. As of September 2010 the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide had reached 386 parts per million and was increasing at an annual rate of two parts per million. At this rate, we shall see the tipping point of the acidification of ocean ecosystems by no later than 2040, if not sooner. Dr Ben MCNeil, senior research fellow at the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre, warned that, because vulnerable organisms such as pteropods are at the bottom of the food chain, ocean acidification could lead to large-scale ecosystem changes affecting not just plankton but other marine life including fish, whales and dolphins. Dr MCNeil went on to warn that, right now, we do not really know the ramifications of these changes. I would submit today that they would be extremely serious. Acidification of sea water by carbon dioxide emissions is putting at risk entire ocean ecosystems, and humans will not be immune to the consequences of a collapse. Such an event would be an extraordinary disaster, the more so since we will have been forewarned well in advance. Finally, the strength of the evidence of human responsibility for global warming, ocean acidification and rapidly rising sea levels is now well beyond reasonable doubt. Such is the magnitude of these threats that urgent action to greatly reduce carbon diox- tainties. ide emissions is absolutely essential.",54
13,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMPETITION AND CONSUMER,I call for a seconder to the member's motion.,57
14,Dr LEIGH,COMPETITION AND CONSUMER,"I second the motion. ‘We are playing Russian roulette with features of the planet's atmosphere that will profoundly impact generations to come. How long are we willing to gamble?' These are not my words but the word of David Suzuki, well-known scientist and academic. Do these words have relevance in this 43rd Parliament? That is the answer those opposite must provide, the test by which they will be measured. The science behind climate change is not new; it has not recently emerged. It is based on a body of science over 100 years old. Governments and policymakers for the past 21 years have been provided with an assessment of the state of knowledge in global clithat mate change science by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The 2007 Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC, a report based on the work of more than 1,250 scientists from 130 countries, the national academies of sciences of each of the Group of Eight countries along with those of India, Brazil and China, plus our own national Academy of Science, agree with the conclusion that global warming is likely caused by us. Much has been made of two minor errors in the 2007 IPCC report. But these errors are minor, did not affect the overall findings and went to the effects of climate change, not whether it is occurring, which is the question we are debating today. As the Royal Society wrote: There is no greater uncertainty about future temperature increases now than the Royal Society had previously indicated. The science remains the same, as do the uncer… … … There is strong evidence that changes in greenhouse gas concentrations due to human activity are the main cause of the global warming that has taken place over the past half century. Some who do not accept the overwhelming body of science point to the uncertainties. As Professor Will Steffen has noted, climate scientists are now 100 per cent certain that the world is warming and 95 per cent sure that humans are the primary cause. A balanced assessment of the available evidence and prior knowledge allows levels of confidence to be attached to scientific findings. Just as we know that asbestos is very likely to cause malignant mesothelioma and bad cholesterol is very likely to increase the risk of a heart attack, we know that society's greenhouse gas emissions are very likely causing global warming. Just imagine you had a sick child, and 95 out of 100 doctors told you that the child needed a lifesaving drug. Would you really follow the advice of the other five doctors? To those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific consensus on human induced climate change, I lay down this challenge. Today is the day for you to get on the record. When the next generation looks back to this debate, I want them to know what I stand for. And I want them to know what you stand against. In the words of Rupert Murdoch: Climate change poses clear, catastrophic threats. We may not agree on the extent, but we certainly can't afford the risk of inaction. The risk of inaction is too high. I wish to place on record my thanks to Shobaz Kandola, my adviser, for his assistance in this speech and to acknowledge the presence in the public gallery today of my friend Macgregor Duncan, who works for Better Place, an electric car company. Climate change is a problem which has been caused by us and by our parents. It is a problem whose effects will be felt by our children and their children. It is right, it is just and it is the honourable course for us to begin to make amends for our actions. The costs should be ours to bear; the benefits reaped by our children. The science informs us that there is a problem. Scientists tell us that action must be taken. The economics makes it clear that the cost of inaction is too high. Economists advise us that the sooner we act, the less the cost. To act on climate change is to invest for the present and for the future. We will recoup the costs. We will all prosper. To act on climate change is to act in the national interest, to invest in our prosperity, in our well-being and in the health of the environment. Those who stand for inaction and those who do not accept the science stand against the national interest. Let us agree to this motion in unanimity, and let those opposite join with us and with the crossbenchers in a debate about the merits of action. Our parliament is fitting of such a debate and our nation deserving of a contest of ideas to help solve a great challenge facing Australia.",57
15,Mr HUNT,COMPETITION AND CONSUMER,"May I congratulate the member for Reid on his most significant contribution in this House since the beef stroganoff incident. Let me begin by making this point. As desperately as the government seeks to make this an issue about either the science or the targets, there is not a dispute between the parties over the science or the targets in this House. There is a strong dispute as to what is the best mechanism to deal with this issue. The great question facing this House is not one of science, is not one of targets-both parties have official agreement on that. It is simply about whether or not we use an enormous impact on electricity pricing and the cost of living on mums and dads and pensioners and seniors as the mechanism to deal with the crisis, as the government would put it, or whether or not we use direct action in the form of abatement purchasing as a means of taking immediate steps. Our approach would begin on 1 July 2011. Our approach would have $300 million in the first year, $500 million in the second, $750 million in the third and $1 billion in the fourth, all identified, allocated, with clear, express dates and mechanisms. At that stage, for all of the talk from the government, there is no date for commencement, there is no policy to implement, there is no choice even between the carbon tax which the Prime Minister ruled out on 20 August or the emissions trading scheme which the Prime Minister had her predecessor drop in late April of this year. And there is no express policy other than an undetermined desire to drive up electricity prices. That is the reality of what this debate is and should be about. Let me speak to the essence of this motion for a moment. It is inelegantly structured. Anybody could look at this motion and determine that they could support it on the basis that they believe that changes in the climate were 100 per cent caused by humans, although, as the member for Fraser repeatedly set out through qualifications in his statement, he was not saying 100 per cent; or 0.1 per cent caused by humans even if one were not to agree with, as I do, the theory of greenhouse gases having an impact on climate. If one were to agree that urban heat islands have an impact, however minuscule, on global temperature, one could happily support this motion even if one did not agree with the notion that there is a greenhouse gas effect. So this motion has a breadth of potential meaning. On our side our position as a party is very clear. We support the concept of a need to take action to reduce our emissions, and that is why we share the same targets as the government. But I would also put in an important point here, and that is that none of us in this should ever use our own positions as a means for clamping down on free and open debate in our society. People such as David Suzuki take a contrary view on this debate. I happen to disagree with him but I recognise that he is a far better credentialled scientist than I am. There are at least four million Australians who take a different view, and they should not be demonised, attacked or pilloried. They should have a right to make their argument free of attack or demonisation. I think that that is fundamental to what we are here for. Let us debate that element on the merits. Let us not denounce, as I am sure the member for Reid would not want to do, people who come to a good-faith conclusion on the basis of their own research. Our position is not to argue on the science, not argue on the targets, but to put forward a very different mechanism. This debate in reality is about two different approaches. Firstly it is about the electricity tax approach of the government. Let us be absolutely clear that the scope, nature, purpose and intent of what the government is putting forward involve a massive hike in electricity prices for mums and dads. The reason they have used this form of debate on this day is to attempt to walk away from the issue of electricity pricing. Let me run through the evidence. First, let us start with the Garnaut report, which rightly and properly stresses that the very purpose of a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme is to pass through the costs of additional carbon pricing on electricity to consumers. Professor Garnaut at page 387 says: … a major part, if not all of the costs faced by electricity generators will be passed down the chain from electricity generators, through distributors and retailers and finally to households [through] higher prices for electricity. But that theory can also be quantified in terms of the costs, because in this House at place this dispatch box on 3 February the then Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, citing Treasury modelling, said that in 2011-12 electricity prices would go up by seven per cent and that in 2012-13 they would go up by 12 per cent. That is a 19 per cent increase in the first two years of the government scheme on electricity pricing over and above every other impact. The New South Wales Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal went further in March of this year with its determination on electricity price rise approvals. What it said was that there would be over three years an additional 25 per cent price increase approved not just for mums and dads and pensioners but also for small business owners. This was additional. So there can be no to doubt and no debate and no dispute that the mechanism which the government is ultimately proposing is an electricity price hike for mums and dads and pensioners. If they believe in that mechanism, they must argue for it. They cannot pretend that the very mechanism which was designed, intended, constructed, developed to increase electricity prices will not increase electricity prices. do other than that is a sheer fabrication, lie and distortion. So the mechanism they have chosen, but for which they have not set a structure or a date, will increase electricity prices by 25 per cent over the first three years over and above all other elements. I will go to a fourth piece of evidence on this, and that is the Port Jackson Partners report which was prepared last year for the Business Council of Australia. On page 122 it sets out a structure and a chart that shows the contributing elements to price rises in electricity over coming years. It shows that, yes, there would be non-ETS components: the cost of networks and the cost of increases in fuel. But it says that the additional element, on top of networks and fuel, that the emissions trading scheme proposed by the government would contribute would be a 60 per cent increase in wholesale prices and that would translate to a 24 per cent additional impact on consumer prices over three years. The evidence is clear, strong and unequivocal that the government's approach would have a 24 to 25 per cent impact on consumer prices over and above all other elements within the first three years. Over an eightyear period we are looking at a doubling effect on consumer electricity prices for mums and dads, for pensioners, for seniors, for small business owners and for farmers as a direct consequence of the mechanism that the government has chosen. Again, as was said by the member for Wentworth in relation to the NBN at this box last week, the government is confusing the ends and the means. By arguing for an end they say that only their means can be validated. That is false. There is a far different approach. Our approach is very simple: we believe that instead of chemotherapy there should be laser surgery. We want to put in place an abatement purchasing mechanism. It is a mechanism that has as its genesis the To not perfect, but highly successful, New South Wales Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme. It is a scheme that seeks out the lowest cost abatement and is currently producing abatement at approximately $7.15 a tonne. It does that by finding abatement rather than by raising the price of every other element in our society. That is the scheme that we propose. That is the scheme that can directly reduce emissions and that is why there is a real debate in this country. It is not the issue that the government wants today. That is not at issue between the two parties. It is an issue between massively higher electricity prices and direct abatement.",58
16,Mr HAWKE,COMPETITION AND CONSUMER,"I join with my colleague the member for Flinders to chastise the clumsy nature of this motion. Indeed, it is a concern that a member in this place would bring a motion forward politicising a scientific area in such a way that would not really be to the benefit of that science. To say that climate change is human induced is to overblow and overstate our role in the scheme of the universe quite completely over a long period of time. I note that the member for Fraser came in here today with a very strong view about how human beings have been the source of all change in the universe at all times. He has joined a long line of Labor backbenchers I have spoken about in this place before-amateur scientists, wannabe weather readers, people who want to read the weather, people who like to come in here and make the most grandiose predictions about all sorts of scientific matters without even a basic understanding of the periodic table, or the elements or where carbon might be placed on the periodic table. So the member for Fraser has joined this esteemed group of people who seem to be great authorities on science. The issue here today before us is not that climate change is human induced. The member for Flinders has raised the very important topic that I asked the Prime Minister about question time just a few days ago, and that is: what will the effect of the government's policies on climate change be on human beings in Australia today? How will a carbon tax do anything for the environment? How will it change the climate of the planet? In what ways would a carbon tax alter the climate of the planet? The answers are of course completely uninspiring and unsatisfying. A carbon tax could not do anything except raise the price of electricity. Hence the nature of my question to the Prime Minister: what would the nature of the rise in electricity prices be for the average household under a carbon tax? The Prime Minister refused to answer that question. I think she refused to answer it because there has been some considerable commentary about electricity price rises under a carbon tax. IPART recently reported that in New South Wales there will be household increases. Households across Sydney have seen major electricity price increases already impacting their budgets. I want to record here that that is a direct result of a Labor state government underinvesting in electricity generation for over a decadeunderinvesting in the necessary generation capacity. At the last state election in New South Wales, thousands or millions were spent on advertisements with young girls skipping over green hills with wind towers in the background. On the re-election of the Labor government they commissioned a new coal-fired power plant. The advertisements show the girls skipping across the green fields with the wind turbines, yet the first decision of the New South Wales state Labor government upon re-election was to commission a new coal-fired power plant. The reality is that no matter who it iswhether it is Garnaut, the government, the state government or IPART-everybody in knows that there will be electricity price increases. These have to be managed. A carbon tax will add significantly to the burden on households across Australia. The question must be asked: how will it benefit our environment? What will it do? We hear a lot of melodramatic language in relation to a motion such as this, and we heard some melodramatic language today. We have heard so many predictions about the future. It is of great concern to me that these predictions will never be held to any standard, scientific or otherwise. And that is a concern with a motion such as this. In this parliament we do have a great consensus about the climate. We have a consensus that we do need to take measures to benefit our environment. The coalition has a set of policies that are, as the member for Flinders put well, laser surgery in terms of their direct benefit to the environment. They are the kinds of things that will achieve an end that people can look at and say, ‘Well, we are doing something for the planet.' Of course, some of the great failings of this government, including the Green Loans scheme, set us backwards. Policy failure sets us backwards. Imposing a carbon tax on the economy with the justification being the environment, when the environment is not the goal, will set back the cause of benefiting the environment by many years. So will motions in this House that take us back five years and try to have a debate on a political wedge issue rather than deal with the climate, environment and economic issues of the day, which are how well a carbon tax will benefit other Australians.",60
17,Mr BANDT,COMPETITION AND CONSUMER,"Melbourne) (11.07 am)This motion seems simple, but accepting it means accepting all the consequences that flow from it. By publicly calling the science of climate change ‘crap' and then cleverly maintaining wiggle room, as the members for Flinders and Mitchell have just donethat, perhaps, any changes in temperature are not in fact human induced-the opposition condemns itself globally as a fringe group unwilling to accept the logical consequences of the argument that they have made for many years. Those in the opposition have told us for many years that humans are a special species capable of moulding and transforming the world. Many on the conservative side of politics have told us consistently of the powers of science and of our ability to understand the basics of the atom and the elements. So why, when we have heard in the last few weeks from one of Australia's and the world's foremost climate scientists, Professor Will Steffen, that the planet was hotter this decade than in any other in recorded history and that there is now near certainty that humans are playing a significant role in contributing to this warming, do we not accept the truth of what he and the scientists are saying? But worse than the denial of climate change itself is the denial of the need to act in line with the science. This is not an issue with which one can play the usual kind of political negotiation. This is not an issue where we can strike a deal with nature and attempt to negotiate the laws of physics and chemistry. The political party which accepts the science but not the need for drastic action the 40-a-day smoker with impending cancer who gets told by their doctor to give up and cuts down to one pack a day, thinking that is a reasonable compromise. So to pass this motion now is to accept the primary role of the science in framing the options that are available to us from here on in. The planet does not have a finely calibrated thermostat that one can turn up and down by parts of a degree. The better analogy is with the human body. There is a normal band of the body's core temperature within which human beings can survive. Move the body more than a small amount above normal, however, and fever, hypothermia or organ failure become appreciable risks. Likewise, there are climate thresholds that must not be breached. For example, if we allow the planet to warm up too far we will unlock the vast carbon stores of the permafrost, driving up temperatures even further. At Copenhagen it was agreed that we should try to stay below a two-degree guardrail to avoid appreciable risks of these extreme events. But if all the other countries of the world adopted Australia's woeful five per cent bipartisan pollution reduction targets we would be on track for a world that is on average four degrees hotter, with extreme climate events the norm and where as few as 500 million people might survive. In the face of all of this, when we continue to expand our coal mines, coal-fired power stations and coal exports one wonders whether federal and state governments are really getting the message. We have a carbon budget that requires us to peak in our emissions within the next few years. And yet one of the first acts of the new Gillard government was the approval of new coal export contracts, and hundreds of millions of dollars of public money have been allocated for inis like frastructure to help export that coal. In Queensland, we have the Wandoan coalmine and, in the Surat Basin, coal seam gas as the subject of intensive investments. In Victoria, the Brumby Labor government is opening a new coal-fired power station, HRL, which in one fell swoop will wipe out any suggested gains that might be made from the closure of a quarter of Hazelwood. As a country we are on track to overtake Saudi Arabia as the world's leading exporter of polluting energy. If we were to take this motion seriously, we would be taking real action to end our reliance on coal. The climate emergency requires us to take strong and profound action to cut carbon pollution. That is why the Greens are working with the government to put a price on carbon. We acted swiftly, across countries and with enormous resources, when the financial system was in trouble. Let us extend to the planet the same courtesy as we have to the banks. Our future, and our children's future, depend on nothing less.",61
18,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMPETITION AND CONSUMER,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA NA (PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY) AMENDMENT BILL 2010 Debate resumed from 15 November. Second Reading,63
19,Mr HARTSUYKER,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. As I stated in my first reading speech, the purpose of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (Public Health and Safety) Amendment Bill 2010 is to amend the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and afford some relief to the residents of Maclean in my electorate of Cowper from the presence of a large colony of flying foxes. The amendment would deem the minister to have given consent to a licence application by the New South Wales state government for the relocation of the Maclean colony. It would not apply to any other colony or any other licence application. It is a testament to the democratic processes of this parliament that I have been able to introduce this bill and now move the second reading. I recognise the importance of the agreement made between the coalition, the crossbenches and the government that facilitates a vote on private member's business in this place. For too long the people of Maclean have suffered due to the colony's location. As I have noted, the Maclean High School, the nearby TAFE and the surrounding residential areas are particularly affected. There has been an invasion of thousands upon thousands of bats around the high school, which has some 1,100 students. These flying foxes defecate over the school, its students and its teachers. The smell is revolting and the colony is extremely noisy. The residents and students of Maclean have needed action on this issue for some time. Dispersal of the bats is necessary given the disruption caused to the high school and the negative impact of the bats' presence on the health, safety and education of students attending the school and the nearby TAFE. Unfortunately, the government prevented the issue from being debated during the last parliament. Due to the failure of the government to take action, the school has been forced to take drastic measures to protect the safety of the students and teachers. Bubblers and seats have been covered to avoid contamination. Classrooms have had their windows permanently closed, and air conditioning has been installed in some rooms because the windows cannot be opened. Car parks, walkways and disabled accesses are all going to be covered because of the flying foxes. And let us not forget the residents who live close by. Their homes have become virtually uninhabitable because of the stench and the problems that these flying foxes cause. A similar situation exists at the nearby TAFE. This bill is not being introduced because I believe that the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act is not working appropriately. It is being introduced because the government and the bureaucracy have failed to act in a timely manner under the act and ensure that the Maclean bat colony is relocated in a humane fashion. In fact, the bureaucrats, in their faraway ivory tower, have been acting against the best interests of the school, the TAFE and the surrounding residents. They have made it clear that coexistence was the only option-I repeat: the only option. As far as they were concerned, the health and safety of our children was nothing more than a minor distraction. For too long the pleas of the P and C, the staff and the students went unanswered. For too long the learning conditions at the school were intolerable. For too long the health of our children was placed at risk. It seems incomprehensible that, when a substantial health risk to 1,100 students is clearly identified, the government would fail to act-would delay a much needed decision by a year. After I gave notice to parliament that I intended to introduce this bill, Maclean High School received notice that an application had been approved. It is a happy coincidence, I would say, that after a year of buck passing, after a year of delay, we finally achieved approval. By passing this legislation, the parliament can ensure that dispersal will not be further delayed and that bats can be removed upon each application after the initial approval lapses. Maclean High School cannot go through this long and drawn out process again. We cannot afford another delay whilst thousands upon thousands of bats inhabit the school and place the health and safety of dents at risk. It is completely outrageous that the government has allowed this situation to continue for so long without action. This bill will ensure that the students and staff of Maclean High School, the nearby TAFE and the surrounding areas get an outcome that is based on common sense and that protects their health and education environment. I welcome the input I have received from non-government members and I congratulate them on their constructive approach. This bill is about protecting the students of Maclean High School into the future against bureaucrats who have no concern for their well-being. This bill is about ensuring that the interests of bats remain secondary to the interests of our kids. It is about ensuring the interests of our local community. I certainly welcome this bill, and I commend it to the House.",63
20,Ms SAFFIN,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION,"Page) (11.18 am)Listening to the honourable member for Cowper, my only response can be, ‘What absolute rubbish.' The only thing the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Public Health and Safety) Bill 2010 is designed to protect is his political interests. This bill is not necessary. The referral was made to the federal department, and approval has already been granted. The department cannot approve anything that is not referred to it. My position, as I kept recommending to the state authorities, was that this is not just about the federal government but about both federal and state authorities-primarily state-getting their acts together and referring it. That took a long time, and I was surprised to see that. I will take you through this issue. The honourable member for Cowper takes the cake in political opportunism-not a political opportunism designed to advance the needs and interests of the community but one destu- signed solely to seek political advantage. You may be surprised to know that the honourable member for Cowper sought to make me, the member for Page-a neighbouring electorate-responsible, and even spent money writing to my constituents saying, ‘Janelle Saffin believes she is not responsible for the bat debacle because Maclean High School is not in the Page electorate.' Surprise, surprise: Maclean High School is not in the Page electorate; it is in the honourable member for Cowper's electorate. The honourable member for Cowper also sent a letter to all of us asking whether we would speak on this bill, and he said, ‘Maclean High School is in my electorate'meaning his electorate of Cowper. Yet he spent an inordinate amount of time seeking to have me do his work. I am busy doing my work for my constituents in the electorate of Page. If I were the member for Cowper, I would be embarrassed if I had to ask a member of parliament in a neighbouring electorate to do the job that he could not do. It was absolute incompetence and ineptitude. I responded because the school community asked me to assist. At the time, I said to the local newspaper: Luke has lost the plot because he was proven incompetent in getting a solution to a problem his electorate. They are desperate actions of a desperate man. I'd be embarrassed if I had to another MP to work out a solution in my electorate. I went on like that-and I said ‘Luke' there rather than ‘the honourable member for Cowper' because I was quoting from the local newspaper. Stepping back a bit, in 2008 I was asked by the school community if I could give assistance, and I said that I would. However, it was a state issue. The state had to apply for a licence so that they could deal with the bat problem. Everybody agreed that it needed a short-term solution, a medium-term solution and a long-term solution. That is the reality of living where bats are. My primary concern, as is everybody's, is with the health and safety of the school community. I have made that an absolute priority, and I said that what had to be in place was a process for a licence at state level to deal with the multitude of problems around it and then a referral to the Commonwealth. We are talking about a bill that was introduced by the Howard government and supported by the coalition. It was supported by the then opposition, the federal parliamentary Labor party, and it has bipartisan support. I take it that it has the support of the Independents as well. In 2001 there was an amendment to it that dealt with the particular bats that reside at Maclean High School, grey-headed flying foxes, so this is not a new bill. It dragged on and on and it got all messed up in political debate and the honourable member for Cowper sending out petitions in my electorate attacking me. It was said that I wanted to move the school, that I loved the bats and did not want to move them, blah, blah, blah. I supported a whole range of solutions, with everybody sitting around the table, working this out together, and not dealing in with it in a politically opportunistic wayand that is what I have done. I then spoke to get the federal minister at least five times that I can remember. I spoke to his advisers; I spoke to officials. They kept waiting for an application. If an application does not come, approval cannot be given. Then there was a whole lot of rubbish spread around the electorate-and I hate to say it, but the honourable member for Cowper was part of itsaying that there would be no approval given. How would you know that? That is absolutely ridiculous. It was absolutely clear that the primary concern was the health and safety of the school community and they were waiting for the referral to come here. Mr Hartsuyker interjecting",64
21,Ms SAFFIN,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION,"It is approved! It is approved, and it was always going to be approved. You just sought to seek advantage for yourself. How despicable, because during that time the school community had to put up with the bats. I have been in the school. You know what it is like; I know what it is like. You were just seeking to advantage yourself. You really took the cake in what you did instead of sitting around the table, working out a solution. What point was there in saying, ‘Oh, the bureaucrats will never approve it'? How can they approve anything when they do not have an application before them? That just served to put people off. It did not help anyone at all. I kept saying, ‘Get the referral in.' That ferral just went in at the end of September-I think it was the 29th. Part of the process is a 20-day period where they have to sit and wait for it. That happened. The approval has been given. It had nothing to do with your bill. It had to do with the fact that the application actually went forward. Mr Hartsuyker-Surprise, surprise! You waited a year.",66
22,Ms SAFFIN,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION,"Nobody waited a year. They did not wait a year to approve it. They approved it according to the process when the approval actually went forward. Flying foxes have been in Maclean for many years, and the problem is one that is primarily a result of poor state planning and highlights the need to have better planning practices. The Commonwealth involvement is not formally triggered until a referral has been made. As I said, 29 September 2010 was the date that the application went in. Before that there there was no application so there was no opportunity to grant approval. The Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has always been willing to consider the proposal through the process set out in the legislation-legislation that we all support and that was brought into being in this place by the then Howard coalition government. Until the New South Wales Department of Education and Training actually applied under national environment law, the department simply had nothing to act on and could not get involved. When they did apply, the department acted immediately and made a decision based on the application and the requirements of the legislation. There were no delays in that decision, which was made within the 20-business-day statutory time frame required by national environment law. The Commonwealth department has been talking to the New South Wales education redepartment for several years about ways to prevent or deter the flying foxes from setting up camp at the school and how to avoid having a significant impact on the flying foxes. That discussion has been going on for a number of years, and the state department also needs to take action. It is not a federal issue alone. It is one where a joint solution needs to be found. The P&C of Maclean High School have written to me and thanked me for my assistance and my role in making sure they understood that I was working to assist them to deal with the immediate problem and, equally, looking at having solutions over a long period of time-and that is what is necessary. I have been to the school site and I have spoken to the students. I asked the students: ‘What do you want me to do?' They responded and I did that. There is a range of views among the students, but the primary one is, ‘We cannot live here when the flying foxes are here all the time.' It is disturbing. It is very smelly. You have to have windows closed. There are thousands of them that come into the school environment. Some people are scared about health risks and about things that they do not know about health risks. Understandably, the parents are scared too, and it does need those solutions.",66
23,Mr SCHULTZ,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION,"I rise to support the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (Public Health and Safety) Amendment Bill 2010 not from the point of view of personality clashes, which inevitably happen when these issues arise, but more specifically because this is not the first time that the issue of flying foxes has created a massive problem within the community. I sympathise with the member for Cowper with regard to the problem that it is creating for schoolchildren in a school in his electorate. I sympathise with him becauseMs Saffin interjecting",67
24,Mr SCHULTZ,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION,"I sat here, the member for Page, with due diligence, listening to what you had to say and without interrupting you. I would like you to convey the same courtesy to me. Ms Saffin-Sorry.",67
25,Mr SCHULTZ,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION,"I have over the years had serious complaints from fruit growers who have experienced fruit bats for the first time in living memory in their areas. The bats are now so bad and have been pushed so far inland that they are now being seen in places like Gundagai, where bats have never been an issue in the past. Part of the root cause that the member for Page alluded to is the absolute disgraceful lack of planning in New South Wales where they have allowed development to occur in the natural environmental areas for these bats. The bats have been pushed inland. It does not take away the serious problem that it creates for the community and it certainly does not take away from the very serious issue that has been raised by the member for Cowper. If nothing else, his decision to bring this to the ment is going to send a very compelling message to the community that the governments of the day not only should listen to complaints of a very serious nature centred on these animals but really should take some action on it. There is a serious issue centred on the possibility of health problems associated with these bats, be it all miniscule. No responsibility has been taken by governments at any level for the additional costs associated with these animals destroying fruit crops, in particular stone fruit crops, that have never been destroyed before. Not only has it put an additional cost on the New South Wales Department of Education to install air-conditioners so that people do not have to smell and be subjected to the unpleasantries associated with these animals but, more importantly, it has put an additional cost on people going about their normal bona fide businesses trying to grow fruit. There is a widespread problem associated with these creatures. When I was a member of the Greiner government, I know from my, I think it was, six-year fight with the New South Wales department against the process of shutting down national parks to the community that there is a tendency for those people who have some environmental credentials to ignore the reality of the numbers of these animals that are coming into the community-up to 50,000 colonies-and the absolute problems that they bring to these communities. The department uses the argument that they are protected. I am not sure what levels the environmental protection centred on animals such as these flying foxes has reached, but people have to also consider the unintended consequences of these animals coming in and creating problems in places likes schools. It is about time the state government and the federal government got their heads together, identified the problems and parliadid something positive as an example of what can be done when uncontrolled housing development pushes these animals out of their natural habitat into areas where they have never been seen before, creating undue angst in the community and, most importantly, potential health risks for children in particular. (Time expired)",67
26,Mr ZAPPIA,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION,"I well understand the concerns raised by the member for Cowper, the member for Page and the member for Hume on this matter. Whilst I have not been out to their electorates and seen the problems, I have no doubt that what they have brought to the House by way of their explanation and description of the problem is very real and very much a concern to their local communities. This Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (Public Health and Safety) Amendment Bill 2010, however, is wrong both in its content and its intent and, quite frankly, it is unnecessary. I will speak to each of these issues separately. By way of background, the grey-headed flying fox is listed as a threatened species under the EPBC Act and the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. It would not be listed if there was not a concern about the numbers of flying bats in Australia. Because it is listed, the government quite rightly has an obligation to ensure that any provisions relating to the EPBC Act are properly dealt with and handled. Having listed it under those two acts, the question has the government followed due process in dealing with the matter raised by the member for Cowper? My view is that it certainly has. I go to the question of whether the government has acted responsibly and appropriately in this respect and why this bill is unnecessary. The government cannot, as the member for Page has quite rightly pointed out, deal with a matter until it receives an application. The role of lodging applications rests with the local authorities, be they the local government or the state government. In this case, the New South Wales Department of Education on 20 September lodged an application with the New South Wales Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities about their concern over flying foxes. The department, quite rightly and quite properly, not only assessed that application but also did so within the 20-day statutory time limit required of it. In fact, it then went on to grant the necessary approvals required in respect of the application. There were some conditions to that approval process, but those conditions are quite reasonable under the act. So the department, every step of the way, has dealt with this process appropriately. Whether others have not is another matter and should not be a reason for the legislation to be amended or any criticism to be made of the department. Nor was the decision made by the department in any way associated with or tied to this bill. It was made entirely separate of this bill that has been brought before the House and was made in accordance with an application that was lodged with it. So, given that the matter has now been dealt with by the department, approval has been granted and a process is available to the local community to deal with the problem, it would seem to me that it is totally unnecessary to follow is: through with this bill. I am sure that the ultimate objective of the member for Cowper in this matter is to deal with the problem in his local community, and I believe that a course of action has now been put in place which should enable that to happen. In respect of the question of bringing a bill to parliament to change the EPBC Act being wrong, I say this: all of us at different times would perhaps have concerns about the way matters are dealt with in our local communities and dealt with by this parliament. To suggest that each time we have a particular issue the solution rests with changing the legislation that overrides the matter in question is simply not the right way to deal with the matter. What it effectively does is undermine the integrity of the very legislation that is being questioned-in this case, the EPBC Act. It would do the same with any other act. The resolution to these matters is to go through the appropriate channels, as has been done in this case, not to substantially change the very legislation which is there for good reason-and that is, to ensure that decisions cannot be made on an ad hoc basis which go totally against the intent of the act. (Time expired)",68
27,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION,"I rise this morning to support the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (Public Health and Safety) Amendment Bill 2010, put forward by my colleague the member for Cowper. This amendment bill put forward by the member for Cowper would deem the environment minister to have given consent to the licence application by the New South Wales state government for the relocation of the Maclean flying fox colony, which has located itself in the grounds of the Maclean High School, the TAFE and a nearby residential area in northern New South Wales. Whilst I acknowledge that it would not apply to any other colony or to any other licence application, this issue obviously is not limited to the community of Maclean. In my electorate of Maranoa, flying foxes have been a major problem for orchardists on the Granite Belt in Stanthorpe in Southern Queensland, which is not very far as the crow might fly from the Maclean school. I have spoken about this issue in the House before, after receiving calls from desperate orchardists, some of whom told stories about staying up throughout the night in order to protect their incomes from the very hungry flying foxes which have decimated much of the fruit in the orchards. As we enter another fruit season, this is as we speak a very serious issue right now. The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities is well aware of this issue in my electorate, because I met with him in October last year when he was the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. He said it was primarily a responsibility of the Queensland government, and of course I acknowledge it is. However, this bill, if passed, will hopefully send a message to the Queensland state Labor government that the welfare of humans should be a priority over the welfare of bats. In Queensland they are putting the welfare of the bats ahead of the welfare of humans, and I will touch on that in a moment. Before damage mitigation permits were revoked by the city-centric Queensland Labor government, the flying foxes did not pose a problem because the DMPs allowed for the scout bat, which is the bat that looks for a new roosting place for the colony, to be terminated-quickly and humanely. But since the DMPs were revoked by the state Labor government, which was obviously pandering to the Greens and the Green agenda, there has been no deterrent as effective as this method. A working group in Queensland has been set up but I am not sure is that there has been much progress yet. Alternative deterrent methods such as netting the orchard have been trialled in Queensland, but these are either expensive or not suitable for particular types of orchard, particularly those on slopes. I have also heard that the bats are getting through the netting. They actually climb under the netting and then get trapped, panic and begin to exhaust themselves in a desperate attempt to escape, sometimes starving to death. Of course, the orchardist who finds the creatures is not allowed to put them out of their misery. They then die an inhumane and unnecessary death. This time last year I presented a petition from orchardists on the Granite Belt which called on the Labor government to intervene and put pressure on their Labor counterparts in Queensland to immediately reinstate damage mitigation permits until a reliable, proven and affordable non-lethal alternative could be implemented to protect orchards from flying foxes. Essentially, what this petition requested is that their state government put humans ahead of flying foxes. I believe firmly that human health should be put ahead of the welfare of bats, and I am not just ing about the livelihood of orchardists on the Granite Belt or about the Maclean High School. I am talking about the health of those people who work in the equine industry. Flying fox bats are reservoirs for an enormous range of diseases, some of which are extremely deadly. Flying foxes are responsible for the hendra virus, which when transmitted via horses to humans has a mortality rate higher than 65 per cent. In horses the mortality rate is 100 per cent, because they have to be euthanased. Tragically, five people have died from contracting the hendra virus from horses. The Australian Animal Health Laboratory is working on a vaccine for the virus. But imagine the risk posed to humans by nearby large colonies of flying foxes such as those at Maclean High School or roosting near the Granite Belt orchards, which are certainly not their natural, native habitat. We already know that the lyssavirus, which is found in flying foxes, can be transferred to humans via a scratch or bite. (Time expired)",69
28,Ms HALL,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION,"If there was ever a bill brought to this House that was a total beat-up it is this legislation that the member for Cowper has put before the parliament today. I grew up on the North Coast of New South Wales not far from Maclean, and I understand the issues concerning fruit bats in the area. I am very familiar with this particular issue, which relates to the ony of bats that have been spilling over into the grounds of the Maclean High School. I am aware of the community concern, just as I am aware of the beat-up that the member for Cowper has been promulgating in the media. I think he really needs to look at what it is that a member of parliament does and to accept that his role is one of responsibility. This Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (Public Health and Safety) Amendment Bill 2010 is not needed, as the minister's delegation decided on 28 talk- October that New South Wales could-I repeat, could-proceed with the dispersal of the grey headed flying fox from the Maclean High School without further assessment if it was undertaken in a particular manner. The decision includes conditions to ensure that there is no significant impact on the species. I think that is quite clear. Action has already been taken-very decisive action-to deal with the problem whilst at the same time not causing any problems for the grey headed flying fox. There are some potential problems this bill could lead to-problems which the member for Cowper, if he thought through them properly, would understandin that the bill, were it to be adopted, would lead to a circumvention of the normal environmental assessment process as set out in the EPBC Act. We can always argue that there are problems with the EPBC Act and that in this particular case it should be circumvented. If you do it once, however, you create a precedent and then every single time there is an issue there is an argument to circumvent it. It sets a precedent that could totally undermine the Commonwealth's environmental protection legislation scheme. That is a much broader and much bigger issue. The member for Cowper has brought this particular bill to the House in order to play politics. He has done it to gain a few extra votes back in the eleccoltorate, to get him some coverage in the newspaper and to get him time on TV. He is prepared to do this rather than look at what the bill could lead to. Mr Hartsuyker interjecting",70
29,Ms HALL,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION,"The member for Cowper calls out that we are putting bats first. No; that is not the point. The issue is that action has already been taken to deal with the problem and that the member for Cowper has brought something to this House that is not needed. The EPBC Act provides additional protection for threatened species, such as the grey headed flying fox, when such species are listed as protected. The grey headed flying fox was listed in 2001 because it was a threatened species. Despite the current problem, however, action has been put in place, and I absolutely reject the allegation in the media that the Maclean flying fox decision was approved because of this bill. That is total rubbish. Action had been taken beforehand; the decision had no bearing on the outcome of the department's decision to approach dispersal activities at Maclean High School. The member for Cowper is good at playing politics but he is not good at looking at the big issue. He is not big on details. He is not big on understanding what it is all about. The member for Cowper is just playing politics with this issue rather than looking at solving it through the proper processes that are in place and rather than noting the fact that action has already been taken to deal with this issue. (Time expired)",71
30,Mr SLIPPER,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION,"The honourable member for Shortland would have many of the attributes that she accuses the member for Cowper of possessing. Given her longevity in this place, she obviously does pay attention to what local people want her to do, and this is exactly what the honourable member for Cowper is doing in this legislation. Mr Hartsuyker-Hear, hear!",71
31,Mr SLIPPER,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION,"He is effectively being a good local representative. He is someone who is speaking on behalf of his community. He is not prepared to remain silent when indeed he should speak out-and I note his approval of my praise of him. I am a very strong supporter of our environment but what we need, of course, is flexibility. Flying fox colonies are obviously very important as far as our environment is concerned but so often we have some kind of clash amongst a civilisation, the community and the environment and if a way can be found forward which does not damage the environment but which enhances the quality of life for the community then that is very much a balanced approach. This is in fact what is being suggested in this bill by the honourable member for Cowper. There is no doubt that the quality of life of the residents of Maclean has been seriously disadvantaged by the presence of this flying fox colony. I can understand the frustration experienced by the residents of Maclean, and expressed in this House by the member for Cowper, with respect to what appeared to be the intransigence of the New South Wales government when the minister appeared to rebe dragging the chain and failing to take a decision in the interests of the community. I think that in any civilised society it really is important to obtain a balance. The infestation by the flying fox colony of the town of Maclean was a problem. The grey headed flying fox is a protected species under the act and it requires approvals from the New South Wales government and the federal minister to remove them from an area. I am advised by the member for Cowper that this large colony of flying foxes is very close to the high school in Maclean, the TAFE and to areas where people reside. The defecation stench and noise of the colony are preventing the school from functioning appropriately and are making residences uninhabitable. The colony is threatening the health and well-being of the students and staff at the Maclean High School, the TAFE and residents of the surrounding area. The bill does not have any financial impact and would assist substantially in restoring the quality of life of residents of the Maclean area. It is extremely disturbing when honourable members criticise colleagues such as the honourable member for Cowper for being a good local member. The residents of Cowper have been fortunate to have enjoyed the representation of the member for Cowper for many years. One of the reasons why the member for Cowper continues to receive the support of local people at every election is because he is doing what local members should do. He should be prepared to stand up and be counted and to articulate when problems exist. He was prepared to raise this matter through the medium of a private member's bill in the Australian parliament so that residents of the electorate of Cowper can have confidence that, when they make an appointment to go and see their local member because they have a problem, the local member is prepared to do whatever is necessary to alleviate their difficulties. For him raise through this private member's bill this difficulty being experienced by the residents of Maclean here in the people's house, the House of Representatives, does great credit to the member for Cowper. I am sure that he will continue to be the member for that electorate for many years, keeping up the good work evidenced in this private member's bill.",71
32,Mr ADAMS,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION,"I am speaking against the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (Public Health and Safety) Amendment Bill 2010, as I believe it to be unnecessary. I understand that the member for Cowper has been concerned for some time about the fruit bats around his area, in particular in Maclean, and that he had asked for some assistance from the state government of New South Wales to move this particular colony somewhere else-to relocate and reorganise them in some other way. And I can see why he is worried, why he wants the change, why this issue would have become an issue within his electorate and why people would be concerned. Bats can be a bit intrusive into one's life in northern New South Wales and in Queensland. They can really affect your lifestyle. However, I understand that this bill is not needed, as the minister's delegate decided on 28 October 2010 that New South Wales could proceed with dispersal of grey headed flying foxes from the Maclean High School without further assessment if it was undertaken in a particular manner. The decision includes conditions to ensure that there is no significant impact on the species. I am aware that fruit bats can become a problem in residential areas. I believe that the Maclean High School grounds are close to the Maclean Rainforest Reserve, which is an area regularly used as a maternity camp and transit stop for migrating grey headed and black flying foxes. These colonies can at to times number up to 20,000 individuals. So I can see the difficulties. However, this is a typical example of natural wildlife coming into conflict with human habitation. Settling here has obviously been the pattern of the fruit bats for thousands of years. We come along in the last shower, to put it one way, and build a school close by and expect the fruit bats to respect that. That is not possible; life does not work like that. It makes me wonder sometimes how much work has been done on the environmental impact, from all sides, of city and suburban developments in some of these areas. These would need to be done to ensure a safe and healthy environment for our children. There are issues here. Obviously, someone messed up in the planning some time ago. These animals have obviously been around for some time. The reserve in the middle of this area is probably the only area that fits in with the migration of these fruit bats as they travel to and fro. There are probably four solutions to this problem: move the school out of the range of the fruit bats' natural habitat; move the bats, but they will probably return at some point in the future; move the reserve-cut it downand replant it in a similar place somewhere else, although I do not know how practical that is; or work out ways to coexist, like not growing fruit trees in gardens around the urban area and using other ways to remove the food sources of the fruit bats so that they shift and move on. We have seen what happens on occasions when nature runs into conflict with humans in other areas. We see that when we travel at different times of the year on our roads, with wildlife coming into conflict with our transport systems. Then there is farming and, in my state of Tasmania, forestry. Wildlife can come into contact with our lifestyles, our transport systems and our economic processes. We have to find ways to live together. We need to look after this. Up until recently, the fruit bats had been winning. However, I understand that the bats are not present this school year and there may be an option to sort out a strategy coming into winter when the bats are absent or without young. I wish people well on that. I hope that the problem can be solved. (Time expired)",72

34,Mrs MIRABELLA,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 and the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010. I do so sharing in the great disappointment and frustration of the many industry leaders and businesses out there who are trying to do the right thing, be First Reading innovative and get out there ahead of the pack, but are being frustrated by this government's very flawed and quite amateurish processes. I say that because a debate like this should have been a positive one. It should have given us a chance to concentrate on sensible improvements and to focus on an optimistic vision for the future of business First Reading R&D in Australia. Instead, the nature of the government's approach to this issue means this will be a debate in which we will be required to devote much of our attention to the misguided, arrogant and confrontational attitude of the Assistant Treasurer and the government, which has followed his lead, and to the range of mistakes, shortcomings and missed opportunities that have arisen as a result. As it campaigned for office in 2007, Labor made a lot of grand statements about R&D and many false assertions about the Howard government's record. It committed in its election policy to encouraging sustained growth in R&D activity and facilitating higher R&D intensity. As has been the tale on so many fronts under the former Labor Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, and the current one, Ms Gillard, this has proven to be hollow rhetoric. Far from growing and intensifying government support for R&D, the bill now before the House, if passed, will actually do the opposite. This is one of so many contradictions that have underpinned the government's actions over the last year and it is difficult to know where to begin. Labor has proclaimed its new R&D concession scheme will be more generous, saying it is increasing the rates of financial assistance to recipients. What it has repeatedly and cynically failed to mention is that it is so drastidrawer, cally restricting eligibility criteria that far fewer businesses and activities will actually qualify for assistance in the first instance. argues that its changes will be revenue neutral, but everyone out there in the real world knows full well that this is a revenue-raising measure. This is the same Labor Party that all but hyperventilated on the subject of costings during the last election campaign. As with the NBN, it has not and can not produce a single piece of modelling that proves its claims about the impact of its R&D tax changes. It seized on figures that show marked improvements in business expenditure on R&D over recent years, but it has not made the obvious connection that this is happening under the current policy settingssettings it is attempting to radically change. It has talked about the importance of R&D to high-performing Australian companies but has shifted the balance in this legislation so markedly that it actually punishes firms that secure successful R&D outcomes and gives greater rewards to those whose R&D activities end in failure. Labor stressed that its legislation will cilitate a more predictable and simple system but it has instead sparked uncertainty, because it has been unwilling and unable to explain how many of the aspects of its proposed new regime will work. It surreptitiously inserted into the legislation wording that will cut off government support for R&D in the building industry, yet the man behind those words, Senator Carr, is the very same minister who frequently tours marginal electorates to wax lyrical about what he pretends is Labor's deep and abiding interest in the future of the building industry. It has said that a key aim of these changes is to limit government spending on big claims by big companies for R&D. Meanwhile, in the last few months alone, it has reached into the top pulled out Senator Carr's chequebook and offered $20 million to the biopharmaceutical giant CSL and $22 million to It the global IT powerhouse IBM for R&D without even blinking an eyelid at its double standards. It has asserted that it does not believe in the principle of giving government support to activities that companies would have been likely to pursue even without their assistance. But this is the very same party that in the very same portfolio has already allocated $90 million to a program called the Green Building Fund, which operates almost entirely on that basis. And it is now about to enlarge that program and embark on more of that kind of spending. It has repeatedly cited a report by KPMG to pretend that its new legislation is world's best, but it has not even had the decency to confess that it misappropriated that report or that KPMG immediately repudiated Labor's remarks and pointed out the opposite to be true. Indeed, such is Senator Carr's audacity and desperation on this issue that he cites KPMG as a highly respected and credible authority on occasions when he thinks it fa- would suit him to wrongly quote from this report-and he draws in a number of his colleagues in perpetuating these myths about the report as well-yet at other times he subjects KPMG and other professional businesses to withering criticism for daring to be among a very large number of expert advisory firms that oppose this bill. This is a government that has made a big play of supposedly compromising on its regressive mining tax but now presents to the parliament another piece of legislation that will whack the mining industry straight between the eyes. It has professed to be interested in manufacturing and has said that it does not want to govern a country that does not make things. But this bill will punish manufacturers at exactly the same time as they are being pounded by rising interest rates, a high dollar and the loss of more than 73,000 jobs over the last three years. Just contemplate for a moment how draconian and how destructive a piece of Labor legislation must be for even the AMWU to be moved to tell the Labor Party in no uncertain terms to go back to the drawing board! It has also pontificated about how consultative it has been towards R&D stakeholders, but in reality we know that it has been the exact opposite. It has barely feigned an interest in the constructive criticism and opinions of others. The two key times at which it sought feedback on its plans were over the Christmas and Easter holidays, when most of the affected businesses were not even open. The minister himself has spent much of the past year lashing out at people who have dared to suggest changes to his proposals. He is prepared to publicly label people of goodwill as ‘well-organised campaigners with vested interests' and ‘losers who squeal like stuck pigs'. I would hate to think how he describes some of his enemies behind closed doors, or in fact some of his factional opponents. Possibly worse of all in this process is Senator Carr has set up a full review of innovation policy in Australia. He did that when he first became minister. He appointed Terry Cutler to head the review. Whenever challenged during his first year or more as minister he gave a stock-standard answer that every conceivable problem known to man would be solved by the Cutler review. This was as true for R&D policy as for most other issues in his portfolio. But, as those of us with a genuine interest in innovation know, it turned out that Senator Carr immediately turned his back on that review. Like his leader and his front-bench colleagues he has shown a complete distaste for, and disinterest in, necessary and sensible reform. So much so that, in the same spirit as the likes of John Mendoza and Ross Garnaut before him, Dr Cutler has now been moved to publicly voice a series of concerns and criticisms of this rudderless government and express his acutely felt disappointment at the way in which his advice has been disregarded. But we on this side of the House are not surprised. On R&D policy in particular Dr Cutler's criticisms are damning. He has stated that Senator Carr has taken what was a good idea and ‘strangled it with even more red tape and a hostile narrowing of eligibility criteria'. Then, just to top it all off, Labor seeks somehow to blame the coalition for the incompetence and the ad hoc nature that has characterised the government's entire carriage of this issue. Among Senator Carr's repeated slurs, one of the best was his attempt to convince the media that the coalition had supposedly filibustered on this legislation in the Senate back in June. The reality for anyone who has followed this debate is that there could hardly have been any filibustering of this legislation because it was not even in the that chamber for debate. He is also fond of saying that the coalition wants to oppose this legislation sight unseen. Quite apart from the fact that the argument is completely wrong, let it be remembered that this is the same minister who, when he has not been insulting them, has consistently turned a blind eye to the views of those who have had any constructive criticism to make. If the implications were not so serious, all of these problems and contradictions would be comical. But they are actually frightening, because the government not only fails to acknowledge any of them but shows no interest in rectifying them. When challenged, it only digs its heels in further and aggressively blames anyone but itself for a mess that is entirely of its own making. Sadly, what is really at the heart of this matter is a wilful misunderstanding by Labor of the crucial importance of business R&D, and far from bringing the kind of substance to an important debate that should be expected from a national government it has tried to silence and intimidate people who have a different point of view. I am disappointed. I would expect something more from a minister who has spent the last 17 years as a senator in Australian parliament and who has reached the ripe age of 55. You would expect greater wisdom and a greater willingness to act in the interests of Australians and Australian businesses, particularly in manufacturing, but all we have seen is a lack of direction, vision and leadership. That is why the coalition will move a second reading amendment to this bill, a point to which I will return very soon. We do not have a problem with changes such as the proposed shift from concessions to credits, the relaxation of foreign ownership rules in relation to IP, the idea of encouraging more blue-sky exploratory research or giving increased support to SMEs. Each of those objectives is perfectly reasonable and the tion have never had an issue with them, despite the government's serial attempts to represent our position and assert otherwise. Naturally, it is also absolutely fundamental to ensure value for money for the taxpayer, but this legislation goes way beyond all of that. Among its many ill-conceived effects, it will restrict the range of activities that qualify for support; introduce regressive new definitions of ‘core' and ‘supporting' R&D; alter the eligibility criteria so that supporting R&D will only be funded if it satisfies a confusing and very complex dominant purpose test; increase the barriers for assistance under new feedstock provisions; make the role of Innovation Australia and AusIndustry more discretionary and less accountable; lift the compliance and administrative complexities for firms because of increasingly onerous provisions on them to prove their eligibility; and reduce support for spillover and additionality benefits. All of this comes before we even get to the issue of the government's extraordinary decision to make this legislation retrospective. Quite simply, this is an absolutely ludithe crous proposal and something that plainly defies common sense. We are talking about taxation arrangements here. I do not know whether the Labor Party are aware of this-I am guessing not-but no government should ever take lightly a decision to backdate amendments to tax law. In fact, whether a government should ever do that raises the quite serious question of fair, accountable and just government. Of course, anyone who has closely followed this debate knows that Labor's use of the threat of retrospectivity was primarily a political tool-an ambit claim, if you like. By putting this spectre into play and then indicating behind closed doors that they were prepared to give some ground on it, they coaliwere able to make it look to observers as though they were somehow making some mis- generous concession. This tactic has also helped them to shift the focus away from many of the other retrograde elements of the bill. That Labor have chosen to take us and industry for fools, to try to dupe us and to elevate this kind of party political strategy and expediency ahead of certainty for thousands of Australian businesses is nothing short of a disgrace. But, sadly, this is not a surprise coming as it does from a weak government and a weak minister-a minister who never had a way, let alone lost his way. In the end, I suspect that what lies behind this whole sorry saga is Senator Carr's desperate need to find savings and to start offsetting the billions of taxpayers' dollars that he has been wastefully splurging in his portfolio. Another likely motivation is that the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research is trying to mop up the unholy mess he made in 2008 by scrapping the highly successful Commercial Ready program and, with it, commercialisation support that represented a lifeline to so many Australian innovators. Some of the businesses worse affected by that decision were in the IT, biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors-and, hey presto, as if by magic, these are the industries that generally the least from the R&D tax credit legislation. Of course, that is a relative statement because, although many may not realise or appreciate it, many firms in those sectors will also be adversely affected by the new arrangements in the legislation. Unfortunately, far from putting an end to the mayhem, Senator Carr is now compounding his original error by cutting off support to myriad other industries as well. What kind of regime is it that would be likely to penalise a manufacturer for inventing a new product and successfully taking it to market? Sadly, that is what will happen with this bill because, once the government deems that product to be commercially successful, which can often be years down the track, it is going to claw back its support-so much for encouraging innovation. And what kind of legislator would seriously let a mining company that built access roads and tunnels receive support for them if they were temporary and unsafe but not if they were permanent, designed for the long-term benefit of the area and helped facilitate even more R&D in the future? More to the point, why on earth would you award support to a company for its R&D activity carried out in a disused mine when you would not support exactly the same activity performed by exactly the same company if the only difference was that it was carried out in one of its existing mines? I can only guess at how it is deemed logical for firms that create new products to now need to laboriously categorise all of the different individual costs associated with their work. Madly enough, instead of devoting all of their energy to continuing to develop and enhance those products, they will now have to waste an enormous amount of time on forensically itemising every one of their costs-all for the purpose of subtracting many of them for consideration under Lastand to lose bor's system. We all shake our heads at the absurdity which says that, if a meat-processing company disposes of all the waste from failed production trials to landfill, it will be eligible to claim because the waste material has no value, but if that same company makes a smart business decision to maximise the use of waste material to produce, say, compost or tallow, it will not qualify for support. I am almost inclined to give up completely on the Labor Party when I see wording in a bill that will ensure support is awarded to building activity only where it occurs away from a building! Remarkably, what this set of rank amateurs in government is trying to legislate is that, once you include any of the results of building and construction R&D in a house or office or in any other kind of structure for that matter, you will lose all entitlements to government tax incentives. I am not sure whether this is a deliberate mistake or sheer incompetence but, either way, it is utterly absurd. In Australia, construction sector claims under the scheme currently amount to around $400 million annually-and the considerable activity that goes with it will all but evaporate if this bill is passed into law. This will be a devastating blow to an industry that is a leader in the field of innovation in Australia. In short, the coalition believes that there are a series of fundamental problems with the bill. I therefore wish to foreshadow that, at the end of my contribution, I will be moving a second reading amendment that will specifically aim to address these shortcomings. What this amendment will confirm again for all to see is that the coalition has a very considered and simple approach to R&D policy and a better approach, a better way, than a penny-pinching government that is doing the bidding of Treasury rather than listening to industry. After all, this is a bill that we know originated out of the bottom drawer of Treasury-something that was a try-on. They tried it on with the previous coalition government. They did not succeed. They have tried it on again. Their only concern in Treasury is to claw back some more funding. They are not interested in providing incentives for research and development and Senator Carr, the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, is the bunny who is sitting there doing their bidding. Indeed, businesses across the length and breadth of this country can rest assured that the coalition will continue to stand up for them and for our continued economic progress and growth and, importantly, economic reform. Unlike those opposite-whose actions in 2010 stand in complete contrast to their words of 2007-we will continue to honour our promises on R&D policy. We said during the recent election campaign that we would seek to reverse Labor's attempts to limit access to R&D incentives. We said we would reject its heavy-handed changes. We said that we would see to it that, under the coalition, revisions to the system would not be introduced before 1 July 2011. We are following through with all of those promises to the Australian people and Australian industry. We will not vote for legislation that is worse than the current regime. We will not vote for the bill as it currently stands because we cannot stand by and see this government decimate one of the very best tools in the armoury of government to foster innovation. Those opposite have already destroyed other vital innovation support mechanisms and now they are at it again. They have recklessly wasted billions of dollars on programs like the BER, the home insulation debacle and large handouts to multinational companies, and now they are setting out on the path again with their gigantic $43 billion white elephant called the NBN. Yet they see Australian innovators as expendable and happily deprive them of hundreds of millions of dollars, even though innovation is so critical to our productivity and to continued economic growth into the future. Make no mistake: in its current form, this legislation will do untold damage to the Australian economy and Australian innovation. That is why I am passionate about opposing this bill and that is why I will continue to oppose any measure by this government to inflict greater pain on the great entrepreneurs that exist in our small businesses and in our large enterprises that are the backbone of continued economic growth in this nation. The existing R&D tax concession system has not only been in place for a quarter of a century but also delivered excellent results. Serious analysis of the figures will show you that it has played a critical role in fostering increased business investment on R&D. Business R&D expenditure in Australia rose to $16.9 billion in the 2008-09 year on the basis of the latest available figures released by the ABS in September this year. I would hope that it continues to increase into the future. These statistics point to a continuing tale of very impressive increases in R&D spending, particularly during the past decade and especially in areas of the economy that have been vital to Australia and will continue to be important, such as mining and manufacturing. There is no doubt the ongoing growth in these numbers and the availability of the R&D tax concession has been far more than just a passing coincidence. As my colleague the member for Wentworth observed in the House in June, the concession has almost certainly been vital in kick-starting business investment in innovation from very low levels in the mid-1980s, in driving the strong subsequent growth and in making R&D less costly for firms which invest in eligible activities. When it comes to R&D, we do not believe the government should be trying to destroy the current regime. We think it should be aiming to strike a logical balance between safeguarding those past gains and sensibly stimulating future increases. We also want to ensure that Australia continues to take advantage of the myriad spillover benefits that resourceful and enterprising businesses inevitably create for our nation. Innovation is essential to Australia's future success. To maintain our competitiveness internationally, we must continue to expand our innovation capacity and capabilities and embrace opportunities to bring new approaches to many of the country's existing problems. It will always be a priority for the coalition to create and foster conditions in Australia that lift productivity, encourage enterprise and stimulate discovery and innovation. Of course, we hope the government sees these goals as important too. Everything it has done so far, unfortunately, has indicated the opposite. Now is the time for it to set aside its spin and falsehoods, abandon a misguided agenda and join the opposition in trying to achieve genuine reform. Some might even be tempted to call for Labor to embrace a ‘new paradigm' when it comes to its attitude on R&D. The coalition believes that increased innovation is crucial to Australia's economic development. The way in which Labor responds to the coalition's second reading amendment will offer a profound insight into the extent of its own commitment to a more innovative future. It is not too late for the government to relent, to finally come to the table and to put an end to its multitude of inconsistencies and contradictions. From the ashes of a process that has not served anybody well, it can retrieve the situation and show that it is prepared finally-at long last-to work with industry, importantly, and the coalition to secure a practical, workable and positive outcome. In that vein, I move: That all the words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “the House: (1) reaffirms its commitment to providing continued high levels of support for Australian businesses that invest in research and development (R&D) activities; (2) notes that this bill weakens the current system, and recognises that the bill has significant limitations in relation to the following: (a) the proposed start date of 1 July 2010; (b) the establishment of a ‘dominant purpose' test; (c) the application of feedstock provisions to a wide range of activities and results; (d) the reduction of support for R&D in the building industry; (e) the disqualification of many small and medium-sized businesses from support because of new rules in respect of their ownership structures and turnover; (f) the requirement for costs to be documented and attributed to ‘core' and ‘supporting' activities; (g) the new provisions relating to thirdparty investors in firms' R&D; and (h) the proposed application of new rules relating to the disposal of R&D results to actions taken prior to the commencement of this legislation; and (3) urges the Government to release full modelling demonstrating the impact of its proposed changes, and reconsider its approach to ensure that encouragement of business R&D activity is not substantially reduced.”",74
35,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Randall-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,81
36,Mr SYMON,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 and the supporting bill, the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010, which will introduce a new research and development tax incentive for Australian businesses. But I do speak against the amendment as moved by the member for Indi. I have previously spoken on the lapsed bills which were introduced in the last parliament in this regard, but they did not progress through the Senate at that time. The parliament simply expired. These bills reflect the changes made to the original bills in response to the report on the bills by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. Changes have been made to the those bills to clarify that the new research and development tax incentive supports experimental activities for the purpose of generating knowledge in the applied form of new or improved materials, products, devices, processes or services. Research and development is critical to the future prosperity of our nation. I really do not think anyone disputes that. Government incentives that encourage research and development directly assist business to develop new innovative products that will build national income and create jobs. It was the Hawke government that introduced the original research and development concession back in the 1980s. Originally set at 150 per cent, it was then cut back to 125 per cent under the Howard government, which as we have seen was at a significant cost to Austrain order lia's research and development output. As a former member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Innovation in the 42nd Parliament, I was involved in the examination of national research and development funding as a part of the committee's 2008 inquiry that produced the report entitled Building Australia's research capacity. At that time, the committee heard evidence from Universities Australia that the gross expenditure on research and development in Australia was $14 billion in 2007-08. When compared to the OECD average, there was an estimated shortfall of $5 billion per annum. The most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics data confirms that there has been an increase in research and development expenditure. In 2008-09 business expenditure on research and development rose to $16.9 billion, up 13 per cent on the previous year's figure. Although expenditure on R&D as a proportion of gross domestic product rose to 1.34 per cent, up from 1.26 per cent, pushing Australia to 11th place in the OECD rankings, that still leaves Australia below the OECD average. The OECD average expenditure on R&D is 1.63 per cent. Much of this increase was due to expanded research and development investment in the mining industry, with an additional $860 million invested in the 2008-09 financial year. The next highest increase in R&D expenditure was in the financial sector, which rose $587 million. In 2008-09 manufacturing invested $4.34 billion in research and development, the mining industry invested $4.24 billion, scientific and technical services invested $2.51 billion and financial services invested $2 billion. This increase in research and development has been a great result; however, there is more work that needs to be done to continue this trend. The new tax concession provides increased assistance for genuine research and development and will redistribute support in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises. These bills will expand the number of businesses that can access government support for their research and development expenditure and investments. Currently, there are more than two million businesses in Australia, but at present only around 8,000-yes, that is 8,000-of these businesses benefit from the current research and development tax concession. There is a bias in the existing system towards large companies. As we can see from the figures, the 100 largest companies tap 60 per cent of the $1.5 billion research and development funding pool. The intention of these bills is to provide higher rates of reward for research and development expenditure and expand the number of companies drawing on that support. There are two core components to this. One is that larger firms-that is, companies with an aggregated turnover of $20 million or more-will receive a 40 per cent nonrefundable tax credit. Companies accessing the non-refundable tax credit can carry forward any unused offset amounts to reduce future tax liabilities. The 40 per cent tax credit raises the base research and development tax incentive for larger firms by a third, taking it from 7.5c to 10c in the dollar. The other component to the program is that smaller firms will receive a 45 per cent refundable tax credit, which doubles the base rate available to SMEs under the existing research and development tax concession from 7.5c to 15c in the dollar. For smaller companies this tax credit can be used as a cash rebate if a firm is not yet making a profit. This is a substantial change and a substantial incentive for new and innovative companies to invest in research and development even though this investment may push them into a loss for that financial year. To give an example, a company with a turnover of $10 million that spends $1 million on eligible research and development activities in an income year may end up in a tax loss position. Under the new research and development tax incentive, that company would be entitled to a cash refund of $450,000. Under the existing research and development concession there would be zero benefit as the company in that example was not running at a profit. For the first time, companies will receive a cash benefit because they have taken the risk and invested in research and development in the early years of operation. This proposed R&D tax credit was ranked as the world's best policy for developing innovation by a 2010 KPMG study comparing research and development incentives. In further endorsement of this bill before the House, the Chief Executive of the Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, Katherine Woodthorpe, said that this legislation will: … be a real boon for the small research-intensive companies that venture-capital invests in. In addition to higher rates of support and the ability to receive a cash return for the company not in profit, there is now a clearer and better targeted definition of ‘eligible research and development activities'. This is to ensure that the incentive is available in circumstances consistent with the underlying rationale for government intervention and, what is more, that the public know the incentive is delivering real innovation. There has been growing concern about the current scheme and how much of the R&D is truly in line with broad expectations of what constitutes research and development. The scheme has more than doubled in just five years to 2008-09 and there is concern that this is being driven by companies claiming spending that has more to do with ongoing business instead of cutting-edge research and development. As the resource boom continues, mining companies have been making very large whole-of-project claims which can draw substantially on the funds available to support research and development. Wholeof-project claims rely on an argument that an entire project qualifies for tax concessions if its viability depends on research and development that meets existing research and development definitions. Examples such as new mining or processing techniques in the resource sector fit into this category. Another concern is the use of R&D tax incentives for information technology programs in the banking sector. It is interesting to note that the two sectors to record the greatest increase in research and development spending in the latest ABS figures were the mining and banking sectors. A key aspect of these bills is to establish clearer definition of ‘core research and development activities', to introduce a test for supporting R&D activities and to have stronger administration of the incentive. These changes will ensure that the new research and development tax incentive rewards a company's genuine R&D, but not their business-as-usual activities. The new R&D tax incentive will ensure most software research and development is treated consistently with R&D occurring in other sectors. In Australia this is a growth industry. To ensure that businesses understand the new definitions, the 2009-10 budget provided an additional $38 million over four years for administrative agencies to support companies through the transition. AusIndustry will provide comprehensive public guidance material and will introduce a new system of private binding rulings, called ‘advance findings'. A further reform of these bills is to open up the new research and development tax incentive to foreign corporations that are resident in Australia and those that carry on R&D activities through a permanent establishment in Australia. These bills create a new incentive for expenditure on eligible R&D activities conducted in Australia, regardless of where the resulting intellectual property is held. This reform strengthens the case for foreign companies to conduct research and development activities locally rather than in offshore locations. Many foreign owned companies conduct research and development in Australia-companies in the automotive sector like Ford and Holden, which develop new models for Australia and overseas. The recent announcement made by the Prime Minister of IBM opening a new multimillion dollar research centre at the Univera sity of Melbourne, which will create 150 research jobs, is a great example of this. The new incentive will encourage more research and development in Australia by world renowned companies such as IBM and many others. Small companies will be the big winners from the research and development tax incentive, with access to cash refunds on R&D expenditure if they do not make a profit and higher base rates of assistance being provided through the new 45 per cent refundable tax offset. Larger companies can invest, knowing that they can claim a nonrefundable tax offset of 40 per cent of their expenditure on eligible R&D activities. The research and development tax credit will continue to deliver $1.6 billion of benefit annually for business R&D in Australia. There is no reduction in the amount available for research and development support. However, the aim of these bills is to deliver more effective stimulation of research and development by more companies with the same expenditure of funds as from the previous budget. It is the intention of the government that the research and development tax credit will be available for income years starting on or after 1 July 2010, as was put forward to the House in the lapsed bills of the last parliament. I commend these bills to the House.",81
37,Mr FLETCHER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"The Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 is a bill which fundamentally changes the existing system of supporting research and development expenditure through tax expenditure and tax deductions. It seeks to identify some research and development as better than other research and development, and particularly seems to prefer research to development. Yet we have been given no clear explanation as to why this is. It seeks to suggest that research and development conducted by small companies is somehow better than that conducted by big companies. And again, we have been given no clear explanation as to why this is. This bill claims to offer greater support for research and development but in fact narrows the circumstances in which companies can obtain tax benefits for research and development expenditure. We have heard the claim from the member who has just spoken that this bill will allow small companies to achieve greater success in securing support for their research and development activities. It is quite unclear from this bill how that actually happen, because the very same mechanisms in this bill which will constrain the capacity of large companies to secure tax support for their research and development activities will similarly constrain the capacity of small companies. The provisions in the bill are the same. There is not one set of provisions which applies to large companies and another which applies to small companies. As a matter of basic logic, if the provisions in this bill tighten up the circumstances in which companies can secure tax deductions or tax credits for their research and development expenditure, that tightening up will apply to small companies just as much as it does to large companies. This bill has been imposed on Australian industry in the face of overwhelming concerns expressed by many sectors of industry through a poorly managed consultation process and in a way which raises real suspicion that the true rationale for this bill is to reduce the aggregate amount of tax expenditure on research and development. Let me quote from a letter I received from Tracey Murray, a partner specialising in this area at the leading accounting firm BDO: The proposed R&D Tax Credit program appears, in the first instance, very attractive, in that it offers companies with a turnover of under $20 million a 45% refundable tax credit. This is a huge advantage over the current program, however, scrutiny of the details as to who can access this increased funding and the expenditure eligible for this credit confirms that very few innovative Australian businesses will be able to access this elevated level of support unless their R&D fails or they have failed to commercialise the results of their R&D activities, the result of which penalises successful R&D activities. It is clear that there are many matters which should concern us about the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010, and I want to address three things will in my remarks: firstly, the background and history for the bill being brought forward and the claimed basis on which the changes in this bill are being made; secondly, the key provisions in the bill and some of the problems with them; and, thirdly, the question in summing it all up-what is the Labor government really up to with this piece of legislation? Today the existing R&D arrangements consist of four components: the basic 125 per cent tax concession, the 175 per cent premium concession, the 175 per cent international premium concession and the refundable R&D offset for small companies. The stated intent of the Gillard government with this bill is to make R&D tax support arrangements simpler, more predictable and more generous. Nobody could quibble with that as a set of aims. Unfortunately, it is hard to see how these aims have been achieved in this bill. One of the fundamental problems bedevilling this legislation is that it draws on two separate reports which approach this issue from fundamentally different philosophical premises. In 2007, the Productivity Commission released a report on this issue which recommended a narrowing of the criteria for eligibility for R&D tax concessions. Then, in 2008, a panel headed by Dr Terry Cutler recommended what some have described as the polar opposite of the Productivity Commission report-an increase in the base concession and, with a greater concession available for smaller entities, a closure of the incremental provisions. It also, importantly, recommended a change from a tax deduction to a tax credit. The government's 2009 statement Powering ideas: an innovation agenda for the 21st century, on the face of it, gave support to the recommendations in Dr Cutler's review. Subsequently we have seen a Treasury consultation paper and two exposure drafts of the legislation. The legislation as it has emerged, while adopting the recommendation of moving to tax credits, seems to have reverted to the Productivity Commission approach of substantially tightening eligibility criteria. It does raise the question: to what extent is this exercise a revenue-raising measure more than anything else? Certainly there appears to be a fundamental tension between the approach recommended by the Productivity Commission and the approach recommended by the Cutler review, and that tension appears in many ways unreconciled in the legislation as it has finally emerged. Let me turn to the second area I want to address: the key provisions in this legislation and some of the problems of them. The key provisions of this bill create a 45 per cent refundable tax credit for entities with a turnvery over of less than $20 million and a 40 per cent non-refundable tax credit for all other eligible entities. At the same time and very concerningly, this bill establishes a new and more restrictive regime which determines eligible research and development activity by creating two key categories: core research and development activity and supporting research and development activity. The response of industry to this new framework has been overwhelmingly negative. It is important to understand that for many decades research and development has been understood in terms of the so-called ‘Frascati definition': creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humanity, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications. Very importantly, for many decades research and development has been understood to encompass both creating new knowledge and using existing knowledge to create new applications. The problem with the approach in this bill is that it limits, in both its objects and its specific provisions, the availability of the credit to activities that are undertaken for the purpose of acquiring new knowledge or information. In other words, a key aspect of what has traditionally been understood to be encompassed within research and development, so-called ‘experimental development', has been removed. Under the bill, novelty becomes a prerequisite. It might be argued that the second category of so-called supporting research and development activity addresses this problem, but the definitions required to qualify as ‘supporting R&D activity' are so limited that it makes it very difficult indeed to meet these requirements. The activity must have a direct, close and relatively immediate relationship with the core research and development activity. In addition, we have a dominant purpose test which is an overarching requirement in the legislation and this effectively operates to kill off any application of the credit to experimental development. Many in industry argue that it is difficult to envisage a situation where a supporting activity would not fall within one of the range of exemptions that are set out in the act and therefore make those activities ineligible to receive the credit. One member of the Australian Industry Group had this to say: In a manufacturing environment research and development is necessarily heavily biased towards development in a live production environment, whether that be to commercialise research into new marketable products, to improve existing products, or to improve the efficiency of manufacturing processes. All of these activities are essential in order to remain competitive in a mature global industry, continue to export and compete against imports. Another member of the Australian Industry Group estimated that 60 per cent of their activities would not be eligible under the proposed definition. We face in this bill the prospect of Australia moving from having a regime designed to induce research and development to a regime which is designed solely to induce research. In the view of a great many people who have commented on this bill, that does not make sense. It provokes the third question that I want to turn to: what is the Labor Party really up to? One has to be very sceptical about this government's motivations and whether in particular, given the very heavy involvement of Treasury in the convoluted process through which this bill emerged, the overriding motivation is that the bill is designed to reduce tax expenditure in this area. For example, KPMG has estimated that the current approach will slash the current $1.4 billion tax expenditure on R&D by 50 per cent. Our very reasonable concerns on this issue might be ameliorated if this government were to release modelling to support its claim that this measure is revenue neutral, but in a response which is sadly all too typical of the approach of this government to pressing public policy issues there has been a complete refusal to release modelling. There has been a complete refusal to allow parliament the information that it needs to carry out appropriately and properly the scrutiny which is part of the duty of parliamentarians and part of the proper function of a parliament. We can merely return to our suspicion, with that suspicion only increased by the persistent failure of this government and this minister to release modelling substantiating its claim that this measure is revenue neutral. Until we see that modelling we are forced to rely upon the very persuasive evidence put to forward by a number of the large accounting firms, which suggests that in substance this measure will not be revenue neutral but will lead to a material reduction in the tax expenditure on supporting research and development, a very curious outcome indeed for a measure which is supposedly designed to support research and development. This bill will also materially increase compliance costs for Australian businesses, which will be required to separate their activities into core R&D, directly related supporting R&D, and supporting R&D activities subject to the new dominant purpose test. A further objection to this wholly unsatisfactory, cobbled together collection of measures is the proposed retrospectivity-the proposed start date of 1 July 2010, which is obviously several months in the past. This is a highly unsatisfactory way for the government to treat industry. It is a highly unsatisfactory way to treat taxpayers, to treat businesses, which are seeking to make a decision about the extent to which they engage in research and development expenditure and face enormous uncertainty about the rules that are going to apply. It is sadly a consequence of the frankly atrocious consultation process which has been conducted by this government in the course of bringing forward this legislation. There were two rounds of consultation: one over the Christmas holidays and one over the Easter break. It is not the finest work of the Australian Public Service and of this government when they release exposure drafts and expect industry to comment in a very short time that extends over a period when many people are on holiday. This bill purports to achieve sensible and desirable objectives, and certainly some aspects of it are worth supporting. The fundamental notion of moving to a tax credit approach is quite widely supported. But sadly the substance of this bill is deeply problematic. At base, the problem with this bill is it does not deliver on the claims that have been made for it. It will, in fact, make it harder for many Australian businesses to seek and obtain support for research and development activity and therefore, in policy terms, this is a bill which is going in the wrong direction. Rather than supporting research and development it will, sadly, make it more difficult. (Time expired)",84
38,Mr RIPOLL,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"It is a pleasure for me to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 and the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010. These are important bills and highlight the continued effort and commitment that the Australian Labor Party and this government have to all of the business enterprises in this country-large, medium and small-particularly for their research and development expenditure. It is a fact that over a period of time, while coalition governments reduced funding and reduced the capacity of people to access this funding, it was Labor governments that increased that funding in dollar terms, not only in the quantum but also in the quality of the schemes that are put forward. The changes that we are debating today are exactly that-good, quality changes that are well supported. Contrary to what we have heard in this place, the changes are supported by many senior and eminent people in business and in industry, people who have the experience and the knowledge to comment on these issues. The changes have been supported by people like Mr Ian Birks, the CEO of the Australian Information Industry Association; Dr Anna Lavelle, CEO of AusBiotech; Mr Antony Reed, CEO of the Games Developers Association of Australia; and a whole host of others, including TGR Biosciences, the Australian Coal Association Research Program, the Australian Industrial that Research Group, the CEO of Medicines Australia, the tax council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the CEO of the Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association and a range of other people. It is actually quite a widely supported amendment. This bill does many good things. There have been some critics and there always will be. We ought to expect that. No-one should ever expect that changes such as these, in whatever form they come, will suit everybody absolutely or exactly. That means that, sometimes in these processes, there are people who find they sit in a slightly different position to where they might have sat in the past. But that is exactly the point of change; that is exactly why we are here today-to make those changes. This government is trying to ensure that more businesses are eligible for the available $1.6 billion pool of funds. We want to make sure that it goes to a larger group of people and that those funds are absolutely fully pended, but we also want to make sure that they are expended in the best possible manner-that the expenditure is targeted and makes sense. We want to make sure that taxpayer funding is supporting the type of research and development that should take place in this country. So we ought to be very careful about the sort of debate we have in this place, especially about the presumption that this is all about reducing funding. There is no funding reduction. The same pool of funds is available-$1.6 billion. Similarly, there have been assertions that the changes will be, in some way, detrimental to manufacturing or to manufacturing R&D. It is clear that that not the case. The manufacturing sector will have as much eligibility as any other sector. The same rules will apply across the board. Another area where there has been a range of comments is consultation, but there has been quite a substantial amount of consultation and a substantial period of time for peoway ple to absorb the changes. In general-and I even hear it from the opposition-people say that it is good change. They say that it is a good set of amendments and that it is good change. It tightens up the rules and tightens up the way in which the R&D tax incentives operate. The proposed R&D tax credit is a tax incentive. It is there to encourage companies to undertake genuine research and development. That is what it ought to do and that is what we are making sure it does. The tax credit is a major element of this government's policy to increase research and innovation. We are making sure that more enterprises in this country have access to this type of assistance and funding. We are doing that to make sure those enterprises can continue to be innovative. These reforms are in line with the report ex- Powering ideas: an innovation agenda for the 21st century and are the biggest reforms to business innovation support for more than a decade. Like many other things that we are introducing into this place, they are the biggest reforms in more than a decade and they are positive reforms. They involve better funding or more funding, a tightening of the rules, better eligibility and assurance that we are looking after industry in the area of innovation. What we are putting forward has, in fact, been rated as world's best practice by no less than KPMG in a recent report comparing government incentives internationally to support business R&D. So there you have it. is We heard before about some tax firms that are not happy with certain elements, or certain parts, of the changes, but KPMG have found that the two big changes-the actual size of the incentive, increased in this legislation, particularly in the refundable category for small and medium enterprises, and the it is targeted and structured-are in line with world's best practice. Everyone needs to benchmark what they are doing. We should not sit outside of what is regarded, across the globe, as the best way to do things, and KPMG are saying that what we are doing is rated as part of world's best practice. I that boosts the government's argument. There are around two million businesses in Australia, but the startling figure is that only about 8,000 of these businesses benefit from the current R&D tax concession. This government wants to increase that number. Eight thousand is too few; it is too small as number and too small as a percentage. The reality is that more businesses should benefit from this very good incentive. There are two key components to this R&D tax credit and they are quite simple. Small and medium enterprises-companies which have an aggregated turnover of less than $20 million-will receive a 45 per cent refundable credit. What ‘refundable' means is that, where an enterprise has a tax loss for the year in which the R&D is performed, that enterprise can receive a cash refund. This massive incentive to invest, to innovate and to move forward. This has been well supported by everybody including, I assume, the opposition, even though they complain. Larger firms-companies with an aggregated turnover of $20 million or more-will receive a 40 per cent non-refundable tax credit. It is non-refundable, but any of the unused portion can be carried forward to reduce future tax liabilities. The 45 per cent refundable tax credit doubles the base rate available to SMEs under the existing R&D tax concession from 7½c in the dollar to 15c in the dollar. The 40 per cent non-refundable tax credit raises the base rate of R&D tax incentive for larger firms by a third, from 7.5c in the dollar to 10c in the dollar. These are significant changes, they are good changes and they will have the right impact. They will have the exact impact they are intended to have, which is to encourage people to invest in research and development. The intention of the government is clear: the R&D tax credit will be available think from the income year starting 1 July this year, giving businesses and enterprises an opportunity to do their R&D and claim those incentives immediately. We will continue, as I said in my opening remarks, to fully fund the $1.6 billion in research and development incentives available a to enterprises annually. There will be no reduction in the amount. I know there will be scare campaigns from the other side. I know they will be going out there and saying to people, ‘You will have less,' but it is just not the reality. It is not fact and it is not the intention. The intention of these amendments is to provide a better rate, a more generous rate, and it is to encourage genuine research and development. The new tax incentive will greatly assist firms as it will be better targeted, and that is a has to be a key. It is more generous, it is more predictable and it takes away some of the complexity. It provides increased financial support. It also gives support to companies that are in a tax loss position by providing cash refunds, and that will bring more companies into the scheme. I cannot see how anyone would want to deny having access for more firms. If we can spread the pool to a larger number of companies, we will also spread the pool of innovation. That should be a key component and something that is supported by everybody. It will be a redistribution of support in favour of small and medium enterprise. If we are all to be genuine in this place, if we say that small business is the backbone of the economy then we ought to support that. We want to improve that support through this very targeted and generous R&D tax concession. We also want to make sure that we increase certainty by decoupling the incentive from the company tax rate, making sure that they are separate. The tax credit will provide business with a measure that is simple, predictable and adopts international best practice and is something that should be well and truly supported by the opposition. The new scheme is a broadand entitlement-based scheme. It expands access to foreign owned companies and to companies that hold their intellectual property offshore but are doing work and innovation here. The support that will be available to these firms will not stop there. There are further incentives. There will be greater administrative support from AusIndustry, including the ability to seek an advanced finding on the eligibility of R&D activities. People will be able to move more quickly and with better clarity about their eligibility, and there will be comprehensive guidance materials from AusIndustry and the ATO to make it easier for small business to receive the R&D tax incentive. AusIndustry will also undertake site visits on request to demonstrate how the new R&D tax incentive will operate, and business will no longer need to submit an R&D plan at the registration stage, which will help small business firms through a reduced compliance burden. We are back here with this bill because it lapsed as a result of the election being held earlier this year and now needs to be reintroduced. Now, though, it incorporates some minor changes that have been circulated as proposed government amendments, and those amendments came out of issues raised by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. The two amendments in particular I am speaking of are to the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010. Proposed amendment (1) is a clarification of the objects clause and amendment (2) is a clarification of the scope of core R&D activities. This will provide the certainty that ness has been looking for. This is a good bill. It continues a great research and development scheme, and it continues to fully fund the $1.6 billion. It does mean there is a better incentive for small and medium enterprise, and there is a doubling of the tax offset and the rebate, particularly in the refundable category. It also means that for large firms not only is there an increased amount but also there is more certainty about how it is applied. It is a good bill and, while there have been some criticisms, those criticisms I think will be found to be not justified over time and the amendments will work very well to produce the outcome the government desires, which is to have more targeting and more firms actually access the R&D grants. I commend the bill to the House.",87
39,Ms MARINO,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Forrest) (1.11 pm)Research and development investment in Australia is a major driver of value and is vital for increasing our productivity and competitive capacity. Australia is recognised as a global leader in many industries because of its historic investment in R&D and 25 years of a successful system that has encouraged and supported this investment. There is an economic and social benefit in R&D programs, and I am supportive of sensible changes to R&D tax incentives but not those that erode support and investment. The ABS noted business spending on R&D totalling $10.1 billion in 2005-06, and the major contributors were manufacturing, property and business services and the mining industries, with over 119,000 Australians employed full-time in R&D. Priority areas include ICT, biotechnology, manufacturing, mining and the food industry. However, this Labor government legislation threatens to erode support for R&D inbusivestment in Australia through major changes redefining the type of R&D activities that will be eligible for support. Fewer firms may now qualify for assistance. Effectively this government is cutting tax concessions for R&D on the back of slashing spending on the Export Market Development Grants Scheme by $50 million last year. Unfortunately, in helping to cover the cost of Labor's wasted billions of taxpayers' funds, the government's revenue cutback may well compromise investment in innovation. I can only imagine the frustration and commercial uncertainty in many businesses with the retrospective provisions in this tax laws amendment research and development legislation and how it affects their current and future planning. The proposed introduction of new categories of ‘core' and ‘supporting' R&D and a ‘dominant purpose' test will disadvantage many businesses and limit their R&D efforts. As we know, approximately 95 per cent of R&D activity in Australia is ‘applied' research-it involves making refinements, improvements and innovations around existing practices rather than undertaking wholly new R&D work. This is very important, and you can see this particularly in the mining and resource sector. I am very supportive of R&D to support small business but, at the same time, we cannot afford to put at risk investment in our mining and resource sector because this sector is one of the ones that will help drive this economy. I am concerned that this may be just another Labor attack on that mining and resource sector, through the mining tax, the carbon tax and the reduction in R&D tax concessions. Conversely, the government is expecting the mining and resource sector to drive the Australian economy. Many companies will be affected. Sixty per cent of the world's mining software has been developed by Australian companies, and we are leaders in processing technologies, mining equipment and scientific analysis technologies. As I said, I believe that research, innovation and the pace of innovation and development are vital, whether in health, mining, petroleum, natural resource management, environmental management, agriculture or any other sector. Companies involved in R&D require clear, concise, simple and unambiguous policy settings and directions. The issues of clarity, simplicity and concise-but not retrospective-rules are extremely relevant, but unfortunately it seems that the Labor government is determined to undermine R&D by reducing the tax concessions so as to raise revenue. Irrespective of how the government frames this, the judgment can only be that this government is not really serious about R&D. Evidence in regional areas actually proves this. Labor's first budget stripped $1 billion out of regional programs such as the Growing Regions program and replaced them with programs of less than $200 million. The government also abolished Land and Water Australia in November 2009 and cut $63 million from CSIRO's agricultural research, costing 100 jobs and the closure of two major research laboratories, to meet the first round of budget cuts in 2008-09. The CSIRO Staff Association warned that as many as 300 jobs in both science and research support services would be lost. Agriculture also bore the brunt of the first $15 million round of research cuts, including the closure of Australia's biggest livestock research laboratory at Rockhampton in North Queensland. The Rendel laboratory provided vital support for Australia's beef industry but was closed in March 2010, less than four years after it received a $3 million upgrade to boost its research capacity. The CSIRO will also close its Merbein grape and citrus research laboratory at Mildura in northern Victoria in 2011-12. This laboratory was established in 1919 and it developed light mechanical pruning and nematode-tolerant grape rootstocks that are worth an estimated $150 million a year to the wine industry. The CSIRO was hit in 2008 with a $23.6 million cut because of the increased efficiency dividend. Former CSIRO divisional chief Dr Max Whitten said the budget cuts showed ‘an airhead mentality' towards science. A total of $12 million was lost to the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation in the 2009-10 budget through cuts of $3 million over four years. There was also a funding cut of $3 million per year over four years to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and its agencies. The R&D sector, business and industry need constructive support, not Labor government funding cuts and legislative changes forced on them with very little consultation but with very direct retrospective effects. I recently raised doubts about the Productivity Commission's draft report on the Rural Research and Development Corporations, RDCs, released in September this year, which suggested that the government should reduce its investment in rural research and reduce the input producers have in the decision-making process. The Productivity Commission has said that producers should make up the shortfall themselves as the government pulls back on its spending and, at the same time, have less say on what the research money is being spent on. The Productivity Commission clearly did not understand the difficulties faced by the agricultural sector, with the port suggesting that $50 million each year should be removed from the Rural Research and Development Corporations in which the producers currently have a voice. The money would be directed into a new government bureaucratic organisation called Rural Research Australia-a non-industry RDC in which producers would have no say at all. The draft report also recommended slashing the remaining RDC funding by $60 million a year over the next 10 years. I wonder how on earth this can be justified when Australian farmers are being expected to produce more food and fibre on less land with less water, less fertiliser, less energy and increased costs but fewer commercial returns-whilst at the same time the government has already cut R&D funding and clearly plans to make even more drastic cuts. I encourage all farmers to make submissions on this draft report to send a very clear message to the Labor government that this tough period of drought, poor prices, high bank interest rates and charges-with the difficulties in accessing finance and competing in a global market where subsidies of 39 per cent are common-is the worse possible time to walk away from agricultural research. Australia simply cannot afford to restrict R&D business activities across the board. Consider the food-processing sector and the consumer demands for healthy, convenient products that are diverse, high quality and value for money. These require the development of new food-processing, separation and packaging technologies and innovations; however, under the changes to the definitions under this legislation much of the assistance for the type of research needed to deliver these outcomes will be eroded in an industry that has to compete globally. Research and development are key success and sustainability factors. As I said earrelier, Australia is recognised as a dynamic driver of biotechnology and pharmaceutical innovation, with over 470 companies focusing on therapeutics, agricultural biotechnology and diagnostics. I do not want to see any of that eroded or undermined by poor R&D legislation. The Labor government must not undermine the R&D sector with this legislation or cause a reduction in the R&D efforts of individual companies. As we know, research and development, by its very nature, is often a high-risk, high-cost field. We are proposing amendments to this legislation which will deliver a constructive outcome. We cannot afford to compromise the integrity of Australia's R&D system. We will support sensible and rational improvements to the existing regime. If the government is seriously interested in changes to drive better R&D outcomes in Australia, it will accept constructive amendments.",90
40,Mr BANDT,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I will very briefly indicate the Greens' position on the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010. The Greens are big backers of government providing strong support for research and development in this country, and nowhere is that support more needed and its usefulness more apparent than in my electorate of Melbourne, which arguably has the highest concentration of research institutes and companies engaged in research in Australia. Since being elected, I have had the benefit of meeting many of them and touring some of their facilities. We are especially keen on making sure that research and development funds find their way to small and medium enterprises, and we have engaged in some significant consultation regarding this bill and will seek to move some amendments. But in this House we will be supporting the bill with the aim of introducing amendments and engaging in further discussions in the Senate.",93
41,Mr FRYDENBERG,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"What do the wine cask, the bionic ear and the flight recorder all have in common? They are names in a long list of Australian innovations. For Australia to prosper and compete in the future this list must grow and in this place we must do all that we can to cultivate and facilitate a business culture of enterprise and innovation. However, the Labor government has not got this message and that is why I rise today to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010. The coalition opposes this bill. Labor's proposed changes strike at the very heart of providing business incentives to pursue research and development and will, if passed, significantly impair any industry support for business R&D in Australia. It is extremely disappointing that the legislation before the House is flawed in its approach to encouraging businesses to invest in research and development-a point obvious to many who should know. Leading global firm KPMG have been selectively quoted by those opposite, including today by the member for Deakin and the member for Oxley, in support of this bill; rather, KPMG have sounded serious warnings about its negative impact. KPMG's national lead partner for R&D incentives, David Gelb, said: That report was not at all based on the first or the second exposure draft. The report was predicated on there being no change to the definition of R&D. There are some key issues that have yet to be resolved. Cutting R&D concessions is not the right way nor is it the smart way to grow Australia's industry and strengthen our economy over the long term. Indeed, as economists and right-minded policymakers emphasise the world over, technological progress is the critical factor that drives sustained economic growth. This bill makes such progress more difficult. The government's bill proposes altering the basic structure of Commonwealth government incentives for business research and development spending for the first time in more than two decades. If passed, this bill will replace the existing research and development tax concession that has been available to businesses since 1986 with a new R&D tax credit that will be retrospective from 1 July 2010. The idea of moving to a tax credit system is sound in principle, but the arrangements that underpin Labor's legislation are not. The government's bill was created in haste. Instead, we should ensure the present arrangements remain in place until at least 1 July 2011 so that business can have certainty and stability, and in the meantime work with industry to more comprehensively consider a more effective incentive system than that proposed here. Given that the current legislative regime already imposes tough measures that business must satisfy to qualify for R&D assistance, this bill creates a series of new hurdles ness'. for Australian businesses to overcome in order to receive any assistance at all. Research and development are the hallmarks of innovation, and we must nurture any incentive structure and its tax environment to sustain onshore R&D through positive legislation and regulation. The bill does not achieve that. The bill does not give effect to the theme, which the Labor Party took to their 2007 election campaign, of promoting ‘national innovation'. As well, this bill is not in the spirit of Labor's 2010 election promise of ‘a simpler, more generous R&D tax credit to encourage Australia's two million businesses to undertake R&D'. Its substantive effect is quite at odds with what is claimed and, in fact, winds back support for research and development in Australia. During a recent inquiry into this bill by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, Medicines Australia expressed concerns when it highlighted the complexity of the bill's rules relating to core and supporting R&D. Representatives from Australia's university sector similarly suggested that any loss in R&D investment in Australia would negatively impact universities' R&D capabilities. Both groups, instead, support more expansive definitions of eligible R&D. The government seems to have turned a deaf ear to these concerns and that of many others while hastily drafting and pushing through this bill. The key issue before the House is whether the mechanism proposed in this legislation will be effective in encouraging research and development. We on this side of the House are clearly of the opinion that it will be entirely ineffective. If anything, to quote Sandra Mason, tax partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, in an article that appeared in the Australian Financial Review on 1 February this year, the government's idea of a new R&D incentive is ‘a kick in the guts for busiThe government's decision to pursue these changes and the way it has gone about it is incredulous, especially when, for the past 24 years, there has existed a bipartisan approach to supporting R&D in Australia. Although Commonwealth support has been repeatedly refined and amended over the years, the current system has worked and is very familiar to businesses and currently assists approximately 8,000 companies nationwide. Under the Howard government, the current research and development tax concession was the principal instrument supporting innovation in Australia, with R&D priority areas including information and communications technology, biotechnology, manufacturing and mining, as well as sustaining the Australian food industry. The Howard government committed $380 million over 10 years, to 2011, to a centre of excellence for ICT research, research training and commercialisation. Established in 2002 as an independent, not-for-profit company the centre, known as National ICT Australia, is now one of Australia's largest ICT research organisations and employs more than 300 research and support staff and around 260 postgraduate students. In 2000, the Howard government launched a National Biotechnology Strategy, which was strengthened in 2004. The strategy was designed to enable government and key stakeholders to work together to ensure that developments in biotechnology were harnessed for the benefit of the entire Austratween lian community, industry and the environment and to strengthen Australia's competitiveness in biotechnology. The current tax concession that has made these and similar cutting-edge research and development opportunities possible has been achieved within an estimated cost to the budget of $1.5 billion in the most recent financial year. However, when it comes to R&D this Labor government has consistently let down the side. This new incentive scheme has been contentious from the outset, most of all among those Australian businesses most committed to investing in science and innovation. Labor's recent inability to articulate whether or not it will provide $7.5 million to the soldier survivability program is just one illustration. The program, which is aimed at improving the protective armour and personal survival equipment used by Australian troops on the front line is an excellent example of Australian R&D, Australian ingenuity and know-how. Under this bill the activities eligible support have been drastically reduced by the government. Within the current system, R&D activities must be ‘innovative' or involve a ‘high level of technical risk' to receive support. The government's legislation would change this requirement to ‘considerable novelty' and ‘high technical risk'. The proposed new incentive is a significant departure from the existing incentive and should be described as an entirely new measure, as the tests for eligibility will be not only tightened but substantially changed. I am also concerned that businesses undertaking R&D need certainty over their tax environment. I am worried that the legal questions that will be created by Labor's sweeping changes to the eligibility rules and tests, in particular the new distinction be‘core' and ‘supporting' R&D and the dominant purpose test, will be substantial. These changes will have a detrimental effect on non-scientific, industrial research activities as they will not be eligible activities under this legislation, although they are currently eligible for the existing incentive. Growth in business investment in R&D over the past two decades has increased the cost of the concession, but it has also paid substantial dividends to local, onshore knowledge building and innovation. In the long run, a nation's capacity to innovate determines how quickly its economy can grow, how quickly it can increase living standards and how well equipped it is to prevail over economic, social or environmental challenges. During the life of the last parliament, the structure of the existing R&D tax concession twice came under scrutiny, firstly, by the Productivity Commission, in 2007, and then closely followed, in 2008, by a review led by Dr Terry Cutler. In both cases alterations to for the existing R&D tax concession were recommended. Merit exists in some of the recommendations and both the Productivity Commission and Dr Cutler raise a series of legitimate concerns over aspects of the operation of the existing R&D tax concession, in particular, the provision of support to some R&D which provides sufficient returns to the businesses that undertake it and which would occur whether or not the tax concession was in place. The government's response, however, has incorporated the most onerous features of both cases, while ignoring their more generous aspects. The business case for Labor's changes to this incentive has not been made and this is reflected in the opinions of Australian business and industry. As the Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association Ltd, AVCAL, in their submission on the exposure draft, stated: … the narrowing of the eligibility criteria R&D tax incentive will materially affect the future of many innovative businesses in Australia. These businesses, which would have been at the forefront of the Government's efforts to foster home-grown innovation, will now be ineligible for the very incentives which are intended to propel innovation forward in Australia. This change to the definition may unintentionally lead to the exclusion of many genuine, value-adding R&D activities that should be supported and that are currently eligible for support. This legislation will be counterproductive to the coalition's goal of enhancing Australia's innovation and technological future. In doing so, it threatens to limit our future economic prosperity. Labor clearly does not understand the key issues at stake. For this reason the coalition does not support the legislation.",93
42,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 and cognate bill, following the member for Kooyong, who outlined in great detail the fundamental problem with the Labor Party's approach to this critical area of R&D. The decisions in this key economic area directly impact the sorts of opportunities businesses and Australians will have tomorrow. As the member for Kooyong outlined, there are a series of obvious flaws within this legislation. As previous speakers on this side of the House, led by the member for Indi and followed by the member for Bradfield, have said, concerns have been outlined time and time again by experts within the industry. The member for Indi spoke in great detail about how this legislation and Labor's approach have unfolded over the last couple of years. The member for Bradfield gave example after example of those involved in the critical area of R&D, experts from accounting firms and experts from the business sector, who have been warning this government for the for months and months-warnings that have unfortunately fallen on deaf ears. On behalf of the coalition, the member for Indi outlined our approach and moved a series of amendments to try and rectify this bill to ensure it is the best it can be. If the government were not so stubborn and the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr, were not taking a ‘crash or crash through' approach, you would hope that those opposite could comprehend that they have not got this right, that their approach will damage and R&D in Australia. Let me reiterate, as the member for Kooyong did in great detail, that there are aspects of this legislation-as the member for Indi outlined in her speech on the second reading-with which the coalition does not have a problem. These include changes to shift from concessions to credits, the relaxation of foreign ownership rules relating to IP and, as she outlined, the idea of encouraging more blue sky exploratory research and giving increased support for smalland mediumsized enterprises in Australia. As the member for Indi, the member for Bradfield and the member for Kooyong outlined, these objectives are, of course, reasonable and the coalition has never had issue with them. This is despite, unfortunately, the government's attempts over and over again to try and misrepresent the position and assert otherwise. The criticisms from this side of the House are many and go to what sort of system will replace the existing system and what its defects are. The member for Indi has been quite upfront and said, ‘We acknowledge, accept and support some of the key objectives.' But it is in those areas that she and the member for Kooyong outlined where we know from the experts from the Senate inquiry and from everyone who has been working within the R&D system that the restrictions in so many other areas within this bill will be detrimental to R&D and therefore detrimental to the business sector in Australia and ultimately, of course, to our longer term economic performance. As the member for Indi outlined in great detail in speaking to the amendments that she moved, the legislation is defective in a number of critical ways. It will restrict the of activities that qualify for support by ducing, as she said, ‘regressive new definitions of core and supporting R&D'. The member for Kooyong outlined some of those consequences as well. It will alter eligibility criteria so that supporting R&D will only be funded if it satisfies a confusing and complex dominant-purpose test. There are many more defects that the member for Indi has outlined. I have just picked a sample of them. These have been raised with the minister time and time again. Unfortunately, the minister's response at every opportunity has been to attack those who try to shine a light on the deficiencies of his approach. As the member for Kooyong pointed out, there has been a bipartisan approach to this important area for 25 years. When those who are experts in the field raise criticisms, we on this side of the House say, ‘If the minister is so small-minded that he cannot accept a criticism or a suggestion from this side of the House, well, fine, listen to those outside of the House who are experts in the field.' Unfortunately, the minister has refused to do that at every turn. Whenever he has had the opportunity he has criticised those who have deigned to point out the faults with his legislation. Like so many policies that the Labor Party seeks to introduce, this has the classic three pillars of chaos, uncertainty and confusion. I notice my friend the member for Flinders, who has exposed them on ceiling insulation, is in the chamber. It is not too late for the government to actually listen; they should listen to the member for Indi. The amendments that she has moved on behalf of the coalition are amendments on behalf of those who know the absolute importance",96
43,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Order! It being 1.45 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standrange ing order 43. The debate may be resumed at introa later hour and the honourable member for Casey will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Miss Truong Thi Lan Anh",97
44,Mr HUNT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to raise the case of Truong Thi Lan Anh, better known as Annie. She is an eight-year-old Vietnamese girl. Her condition was brought to my attention by my great friend Eric Noel. She is a beautiful young girl from Vietnamno Australian is at fault here. She has a very serious craniofacial cleft with encephaloceles. It is a terminal condition which is nevertheless treatable. She has approximately a year in which to get her treatment. Mr Anthony Holmes, a senior surgeon at the Royal Children's Hospital, will be doing the surgery. He was intimately involved, along with many other magnificent surgeons, in the separation of the twins Krishna and Trishna. I would urge any members of this House or the community to contribute. Approximately $60,000 has been raised, I am advised, and a further $40,000 has to be raised. I will be approaching the Minister for Health and Ageing to seek her assistance. This girl is not an Australian citizen; the government has no duty here. I will also be approaching citizens and placing contact details for donations on the website. To any member of the public listening, $10, $15 or $20 will help reach the goal and help this beautiful young girl. It is an important thing that we can do and I commend Annie's case to the House. Australia Post",97
45,Ms ROWLAND,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Several residents in the suburb of Glenwood in my electorate have raised the issue of a lack of street posting boxes. The suburb of Glenwood has approximately 13,897 residents but there is but one street box for this entire suburb. As one constituent has noted to me in representations she made to the former minister Helen Coonan in 2007: ‘A postbox was removed at the corner of Sunnyholt Road and Sorrento Drive in Glenwood on the basis that this was for roadworks. However, it was never to be seen again.' Glenwood is a very large suburb geographically. This one postbox is certainly not within walking distance of many residents. I have actually timed the drive from one end of Glenwood to the other. These are 50 kilometre an hour streets and it can take nearly 10 minutes driving to get to this postbox. I have made representations to Australia Post regarding this matter and I was advised by them that there are currently no plans to install a new street posting box. I find this response to be less than satisfactory and I have told them so. As a resident of this suburb, I am only aware of one street posting box being located in Glenwood. However, Australia Post told me that there are street posting ‘boxes' located in Glenwood. I have confirmed there is only one box with the search facility on Australia Post's own website. The response from Australia Post also notes that there are street posting boxes in Bella Vista and Baulkham Hills. These are nowhere near Glenwood. I continue to raise this issue for the benefit of residents and I look forward to their support. Building the Education Revolution Program",98
46,Ms ODWYER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Higgins) (1.48 pm)Armadale Primary School is a small gem in my electorate of Higgins. Through the leadership of Principal Jim Cahill and his teaching staff, and a strong and committed parent network, Armadale primary provides a quality education for about 340 local children. But this quality education is under threat due to bureaucratic intransigence and an attitude of ‘government knows best'. This attitude was apparent with the BER funding. Instead of allowing the school to build a hall designed specifically for the very small site, the government insisted that they build a template hall that took up much more of the valuable playground space, with only a few minor amendments. As a result, the school will be operating under two different timetables to ensure that only half of the students are outside during recess or lunchtime-a timetable that has commenced already due to the building works on site. But the parents of Armadale Primary School are not going to be bullied by bureaucrats and bad policy again. They face another battle-a battle for a double-storey portable classroom before the new term in 2011. Without it, the students of Armadale primary will be forced to use their existing hall for two level 2 classes. This means that there will be no access to the hall for any other programs or lessons such as music, dance or Italian; there will be no place to hold assembly; and there will be no area to have a before-school program or after-school program. This is quite wrong. Children need space to learn and space to play. They need the right supportive learning environment. I will continue to fight for the parents and the students of my local area to ensure that they have proper educational facilities and to ensure that the children have a great educational start in life. Canberra Electorate: ArtSound FM",98
47,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to acknowledge the significant contribution made by ArtSound FM to Canberra's cultural life. ArtSound is a community based radio station that operates out of the Manuka Arts Centre in my electorate. The station is highly valued in the Canberra community for its eclectic and local music as well as its community focus. ArtSound's open studio project gives the community access to workshops and recording sessions on a number of levels, particularly for students at our School of Music. The introduction to radio for seniors program targets the musical talent of older Canberrans. The program offers courses that range from studio tours and the chance to sit in on live radio shows to recording sessions for musically talented seniors. This program also trains seniors in how to use recording equipment and share their histories with our community. The In the Wings program allows new and emerging young classical musicians to promote themselves on radio and then take a CD of their work home. Next year the young people's radio group school holiday program will give young Canberrans the chance to write and record radio plays. For the last 25 years, ArtSound has also been digitising old audiotapes for national instituChildren tions including the National Library and the War Memorial, so ArtSound is also keeping our history alive. I congratulate ArtSound for nurturing and fostering musical appreciation and talent in Canberra. Cowper Electorate: Plummers Lane",99
48,Mr HARTSUYKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to highlight the need to upgrade Plummers Lane in the Kempsey shire of my electorate. Plummers Lane is the main road into South West Rocks from the Pacific Highway. It was recently reclassified as a regional road by the New South Wales state government. This classification reflects the increased volumes of traffic that are now using Plummers Lane as the preferred point of entry to the popular South West Rocks area. The road is in a state of disrepair and requires a substantial upgrade. The upgrade would involve 8.5 kilometres of road from the Pacific Highway to Jerseyville. The project would see a comprehensive reconstruction of the road and guardrails erected along the section of the road which runs parallel to the Macleay River. Prior to the last election I met with Mayor John Bowell and Councillor Liz Campbell. They both emphasised the importance of this project, which had a budgeted cost of $5.95 million. The Kempsey shire simply cannot afford this price tag. I have secured the support of the coalition for this project but am also seeking the support of the government. I have written to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Mr Albanese, seeking funding for this project. I therefore commend this project to the House and trust there will be bipartisan support for this very important piece of local infrastructure. ACT Children's Services Awards 2010",99
49,Dr LEIGH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"On the night of 29 October 2010 I had the privilege of joining Joy Burch, the ACT Minister for and Young People, Maureen Cane, the CEO of Communities@Work, and Lynne Harwood, CEO of Galilee, for the 2010 Children's Services Awards night. The awards are a celebration of early and middle childhood educators and the difference which these educators make to the lives of children and families in the Canberra community. Having a one-year-old and a three-year-old who attend day care, I know first hand the important and inspirational work early childhood workers undertake throughout our community each and every day. They light the spark of creativity and learning in our children; they help open the door to a world full of possibilities. The awards recognised a number of individuals, as well as organisations, for their hard work in helping children and families. In total, 15 awards were presented on the night and while time does not permit me to name all the worthy recipients, I would like to conclude by mentioning that each nominee was not just supported by their organisation but by the children in their care and the children's families. It is clear that each and every award winner and nominee's work was shaped by the needs of their children. We are lucky to have such excellent people working in the Canberra community to care for our young children. Cowan Electorate: Telecommunications",99
50,Mr SIMPKINS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"On 4 November 2010 I received correspondence from Daly International on behalf of Optus. That letter informed me of the intent of Optus to install three panel antennas on the roof of the Woodvale shopping centre in the northern part of Woodvale in Cowan. Optus is keen to improve its 3G network services in the area. The letter from Daly International stated that a period of consultation with the community and key stakeholders would run from 1 November to 15 November. It is not surprising that despite the proposal being consistent with ACMA electromagnetic energy exposure level guidelines, the primary school 150 metres away and those who work at the shopping centre were not pleased. A petition was raised and submissions were tendered, indicating comprehensive opposition to the proposal. The issue was raised with me by my constituent Linda Burke, and upon returning home at the end of the last sitting week I visited the local primary school, North Woodvale primary, and spoke with Mr Greg Brice, the principal. After speaking about the issues, I called Optus from Mr Brice's office and I then had a conversation with Lisa Kelly from Optus's corporate and government office. Having discussed the local concerns and alternatives with her, I am pleased with Optus's response. They will now be pursuing an option elsewhere in Woodvale on an existing tower, and that is a good result. The views and legitimate concerns of local people have been taken into account and I wish Optus all the best with their pursuit of the alternative-a far more practical and better result. I congratulate Optus and all those in Woodvale such as Linda Burke, Greg Brice and the school and wider communities who made such good sense on the issue. (Time expired) Financial Services",100
51,Mr MURPHY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"With so much discussion about the big banks and their outrageous behaviour in pushing their interest rates well above the RBA cash rates, I urge the House and the community to remember that there are some excellent alternatives to the big four banks. The mutual sector-credit unions and building societies-has been looking after the financial needs of Australians for more than 100 years. The structure of mutuals means that they are owned by their members, the customers. I understand that currently more than 4.5 million people in our country are members. I am very pleased to have a number of credit unions within my electorate of Reid, in particular the Teachers Credit Union, which services a very important sector of our community: people working in education. I also note that the Teachers Credit Union is the largest credit union in New South Wales and the third largest credit union in Australia, with a presence in four states and over $3 billion in assets. In all the talk about the big banks, it is constantly inferred that people stay with them because they are safer. I would remind the House and the community that the mutual sector has to meet the same strict standards required for licensing under the Banking Act, and is supervised by the same regulators, APRA. Quite simply, credit unions and building societies offer the same range of services and level of safety as banks. However, unlike the banks, the profits credit unions generate are reinvested to benefit their members-their customers-in the form of competitive interest rates, lower fees and, most importantly, personal service. They are not used to line the pockets of greedy directors and demanding shareholders. (Time expired) Australian Small Business Champion Awards 2010",100
52,Mr BILSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I was pleased to join my friend and colleague the New South Wales shadow minister for small business and regulatory reform, Don Page, at the Australian Small Business Champion Awards 2010. It was quite inter elected representatives there. Not one member of the Labor Party, at a state or federal level, could be bothered to attend this very prestigious awards ceremony. Eight hundred small business operators right across the economy were there to have their successes shared and discussed and to be recognised. It was originally the brainchild of Steve Loe, the Managing Director of Precedent Productions. Steve comes from a family that migrated to Australia from Cyprus, and he saw all the toil and tribulation of his family's small business throughout its successful career and thought, ‘It is about time someone stopped to say thank you.' Some of the award recipients observed that the coalition was there in force. I was there on behalf of our leader, Tony Abbott. I was not one of the support dancers for the Lady Gaga support act-only my footwear held me up from that-but I was happy to be there to make some of the presentations and to be part of a really successful evening. The simple point is that there are small businesses right across Australia that make opportunities and create wealth and vitality for communities, and they want to be recognised. They are people doing extraordinary work. I think there is a need for a national day of recognition for small business and family enterprise to say thank you for the wealth, the prosperity and the support you provide for communities. Thank you to Steve-(Time expired) Victorian Election",101
53,Mr DANBY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,The Greens political party is certainly not vague about death and taxes. Their website shows that the Greens are now combing these two inevitables into one: the death tax. Those contemplating voting for them at the upcoming Victorian election should understand that this thoroughly regressive tax was resoundingly abandoned in Australia in the 1980s. Voters should know that when they vote for the Greens they are voting for a 30 per cent death duty tax. The Greens candidate at the recent Caulfield state election forum said that the death tax would be reintroduced at the rate of 30 per cent. NA New Zealand: Mine Explosion,101
54,Ms GILLARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"On indulgence, I know that members in this parliament and Australians right around the nation are today watching their TV screens, listening to their radios and searching internet news sites for news of what is happening in New Zealand in such tragic and difficult circumstances. As the House is keenly aware, last Friday afternoon an explosion at the Pike River coalmine at Greymouth in New Zealand left 29 miners trapped deep underground, including two Australians, William Joynson and Joshua Ufer. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has spoken with their families and extended the nation's support to them. I take this opportunity, on behalf of members of the parliament, to extend our support to the families who are waiting for news. Our high commissioner has travelled to Greymouth today to be there personally. There is no disguising the gravity of this situation. As we know, search and rescue efforts have been hampered because of high levels of dangerous gas inside the mine, though there is now some drilling underway. We want nothing more than to see these 29 men brought to the surface safe and well. This is a hope that unites us and unites the world today. Understandably, the miners' loved ones are becoming more and more anxious as each hour passes. Our hearts go out to them, because there could be nothing worse than living through those hours. For the present, we wait and we hope. We have seen two miracles, in Beaconsfield and in Chile. Today we look for a third. One thing is certain: nothing will be wanting so far as expertise and resources are concerned. Mine rescue teams from New South Wales and Queensland are already on the ground in New Zealand, with an additional three from New South Wales Mines Rescue travelling to New Zealand today. In addition, Rio Tinto, Xstrata and BHP have placed staff and resources at the ready for if they should be required. I have spoken today to the Prime Minister of New Zealand and he personally thanked me for the efforts that Australia has gone to and wanted me to record his appreciation in this place. At this moment of anguish, the thoughts of every Australian go out to the families of those who are trapped. Mining communities are close-knit communities and we know miners are engaged in dangerous work. Every Australian involved in the mining industry will today be thinking of their cousins across the Tasman with a special sense of solidarity. All of us join with them in hoping for a miracle. Thank you.",101
55,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"On indulgence, I rise to support the Prime Minister and to state on behalf of the coalition that our thoughts and prayers are with the people of New Zealand at this difficult time, and especially with the friends and families of the trapped miners. The experience of our miners at Beaconsfield, as well as the recent rescue in Chile, should be some antidote to the despair that the families of those trapped miners might otherwise feel. It is good that mining rescue teams from Australia are now going to the assistance of our ANZAC brothers and sisters. This is excellent. The coalition stands ready to support any assistance that the government might care to offer in addition to this. NA Broadband",102
56,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the government's pre-election policy to eventually place the National Broadband Network into private ownership. Can the Prime Minister confirm that this election commitment has been dumped at the behest of the Greens? Isn't this a further example of how the government is losing its way while the Greens are finding theirs inside the Gillard government?,102
57,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. As the Leader of the Opposition probably should be aware, the government has said consistently that there would be an inquiry on privatisation. At the stage that we thought circumstances were right for privatisation, we would need to fully inquire into the matter. In order to deal with these questions in the Senate, we have been happy to agree that there will be parliamentary oversight as well. The Leader of the Opposition has had many different positions on questions of parliamentary oversight. Some days he is in favour; some days he has not. But we have been happy to agree on the question of parliamentary oversight in this case. I also say to the Leader of the Opposition that, on the question of the bill before the Senate, there remains a critical decision for him to make. He needs to decide whether or not to stand in the way of this profound microeconomic reform and structural separation in our telecommunications industry. He needs to decide whether he will agree with that profound microeconomic reform or once again play the role of wrecker. In the modern age, the Liberal Party takes pride in the fact that, when in opposition during the Hawke and Keating governments, they did not resist from the opposition benches waves of important reforms brought to this country by the Hawke and Keating governments in order to open up our economy. The Leader of the Opposition might do well to reflect on the heritage of the Liberal Party on these questions and get out of the way of this profoundly important microeconomic reform.",103
58,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask a supplementary question of the Prime Minister, just so that the position might be crystal clear. Can the Prime Minister confirm that it is still the government's determination that the NBN will eventually be privatised?",103
59,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I can confirm to the Leader of the Opposition that it is the government's intention that NBN Co. will be privatised. I can confirm to the Leader of the Opposition that we will not be making the same errors that the coalition did when they privatised Telstra. We will not be making those errors where privatisation happened in circumstances where there was no regard for the regulatory settings or the impact of that privatisation-a matter that used to be raised in this parliament by the National Party as much as it was raised by anybody else. I can also confirm to the Leader of the Opposition that the government has always said that the sale of NBN Co. would be subject to full inquiry before it takes place. We have now boosted that with an agreement to have parliamentary consideration prior to that date. I say again: there are many days on which the Leader of the Opposition stands at the dispatch box and rants and raves about parliamentary consideration. I would find it quite remarkable indeed if he was suddenly opposed to parliamentary consideration. Afghanistan",103
60,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on her recent meetings in Lisbon, particularly with respect to the future strategy for the commitment to Afghanistan?",103
61,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As members of the House would be aware, I travelled to Lisbon on the weekend and attended there the meeting of the 48 countries who participate in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. This was a NATO-ISAF summit. The summit was attended by President Karzai of Afghanistan, President Obama, Chancellor Merkel, Prime Minister Cameron and the President of France, Mr Sarkozy, among others. The purpose of this important meeting was to bring together ISAF partners to discuss and determine the future strategy in Afghanistan. Importantly, the meeting heard a report from General Petraeus, the supreme commander of the operations in Afghanistan. The message he very clearly gave to the meeting was that the momentum of the insurgency has been checked, that progress is being made and that we can now move to the process of transition where, place by place, security leadership will move from ISAF forces to local Afghan forces. Transition will happen place by place, depending on conditions on the ground, district by district, province by province. It will be a rigorous process and it will only occur when Afghan forces are able to take security leadership. As I have said to this House before, a condition of taking security leadership needs to be irreversibility-that is, we should not transition out only to transition back in. The Lisbon meeting decided that transition should start in early 2011, with a target completion date across Afghanistan of 2014. That fits with President Karzai's goal to have Afghan forces in security leadership in his country in 2014. The outcomes of the summit are welcome and the move into transition in early 2011 is a welcome step. But, as General Petraeus said, nothing in Afghanistan is easy. No transition date has been set for where we work in Oruzgan province. The best advice to us remains that we will be engaged in training there for two to four years to train the Afghan National Army. I echo President Obama's words that training is the ticket to transition, and that is what we are doing in Oruzgan province. I have consistently said in this place, and I said it at the NATO-ISAF summit in Lisbon, we need to be realistic. We will stay engaged in Afghanistan in some form to the end of this decade at least. Building democracy is the work of a generation of Afghan people. The summit reemphasised the importance of supporting Afghanistan in an enduring way. I welcome the NATO enduring partnership with Afghanistan. Once again, to echo the words of President Obama, the people of Afghanistan need to stand up and take control of their country in the provision of security, but we will be standing alongside them. NA",103
62,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore, Teo Chee Hean, who is the Minister for Defence as well. On behalf of the House I extend to him a very warm welcome, especially as they are partners with us in ISAF. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Carbon Pricing",104
63,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her statement a week before polling day when she declared, ‘There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' I also refer the Prime Minister to the fact that the Greens have long supported a carbon tax. Isn't the government's deception on this issue during the election proof that, while the government has lost its way, the Greens have found theirs inside the Gillard government?",104
64,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. It is not clear to me whether he slept through the parliamentary term 2007 to 2010 or he has simply forgotten it, but if he remembered that parliamentary term he would recall that the question of pricing carbon was probably one of the biggest single debates we had in this parliament. Obviously, our overwhelming Work Choices was also a very big debate. As we worked through our way through the question of pricing carbon, those on the opposition benches had every potential position known to humankind. They believed in climate change, they did not believe in climate change; they believed in pricing carbon, they did not believe in pricing carbon; they believed in a market based mechanism, they preferred a tax-and on and on it went. Courtesy of the member for Wentworth, we finally found out what was driving all of this division within the opposition.  on direct relevance: the Prime Minister was asked about the government's change in policy, not about the opposition side of the House. She should address her answer to that question.",104
65,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Prime Minister will respond to the question.,105
66,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am responding to the question by indicating the process that led where we are now with the creation of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. In understanding that, it is important to understand the twists and turns of the opposition on this. We finally worked out, courtesy of the member for Wentworth and his description of the Leader of the Opposition as a ‘weathervane', that the Leader of the Opposition's version of dealing with climate change is that you go outside, you stick your finger up in the wind and you see which way the political winds are blowing and then you decide what you are going to do about climate change. We do not agree that weathervane focusgroup-driven politics is appropriate-the kind subscribed to by the Leader of the Opposition-so we are seizing the opportunity of this new parliament to bring together people of goodwill, who believe climate change is real, who believe that human activity is causing climate change and who believe in the need to price carbon in order to deal with climate change and in order to meet the carbon emissions reduction targets that are actually bipartisan politics in this parliament. We will keep doing that, and I say to the member who asked the question: if he has a serious interest in tackling climate change he should converse with his leader about putting his finger back outside, testing the political winds and finding that the Australian people are actually looking to us to do something responsible in this place. You would have the opportunity to then participate in the MultiParty Climate Change Committee. Telstra",105
67,Ms ROWLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister inform the House of the importance of the structural separation of Telstra for reform in the telecommunications sector?,105
68,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for to her question. In front of the Senate at the moment is an incredibly important piece of legislation, which is the competition and consumer bill, that structurally separates Telstra's retail arm from the rest of the company. This is a profoundly important piece of microeconomic reform. It will create a transparent regulatory framework that delivers quality, choice and competitiveness so that consumers benefit and so that market entrants, who would provide retail competition, do not face barriers to that entry. This is a profound test for the opposition as to whether or not they believe in this kind of competition reform, this kind of microeconomic reform. This legislation is necessary to overwhelm one of the mistakes of the past which was the failure of the Howard government, of which the Leader of the Opposition was a part, to deal with regulatory settings when they privatised Telstra. What the government is seeking to achieve in this legislation is not just paving the way for the NBN. We are fixing a major market failure left to us by those opposite. Of course, this just equals simple common sense. We would not allow one petrol company to own all of the oil refining in this country. We would not allow that to happen. We would not allow one supermarket to own all of the farms. When we are looking at telecommunications we need to achieve structural separation so that we can have proper price competition in the retail market. Interest groups, experts and even the member for Bradfield in an earlier iteration all supported this step to increase competition. Now when we are looking at this legislation we find that it is an important microeconomic reform. It is also vital to enabling there to be one wholesale price around the country. If you care about microeconomic reform you will support this bill. If you care about regional Australia and its ability to have the same wholesale price-whether it is in voice, or whether it is in television or whether it is in broadband-then you will support this bill. Then, of course, you will support this bill if you actually accept the advice of Telstra about what it now believes should happen. I direct people's attention to the statement last Friday of Telstra's chairman at the shareholder meeting when he said: We remain focused on ensuring that we turn the non-binding Financial Heads of Agreement into Definitive Agreements with NBN Co. … … … We believe that the terms we have negotiated in the best interests of shareholders … We are calling on the opposition to support this bill. Whilst we call for that support I note that the member for Wentworth has publicly supported structural separation. I also note that the member for Wentworth now has 10 million reasons to support the NBN as well. Mr Randall interjecting",105

74,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. When it was revealed during the election campaign that she had strongly opposed pension increases in cabinet, the Prime Minister stated: ‘I am the person who will say, “Let's look at it. Let's cost it. Let's think about it. Let's tion it. Let's turn it upside down. Let's hold up to the light. Let's ask a million questions. Does it add up? Is it affordable?” ‘ Prime Minister, if such scrutiny was good enough for pension increases, why is it not good enough for the $43 billion NBN? Isn't the Prime Minister's double standard proof again that the government has lost its way?",106
75,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. It is good enough for the NBN and it is happening. National Bowel Cancer Screening,107
76,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. The minister may be aware of a Bowel Cancer Awareness breakfast held last Thursday. Given that 73 Australians die from bowel cancer each week and that more than 90 per cent of bowel cancers can be cured if detected early, can the minister update the House about any plans for future implementation of the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program, including re-screening eligible people instead of one-off testing?",107
77,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for New England for his question. I am sure he would be aware that the breakfast was well attended by members from both sides of the House and from the crossbenches and senators who have taken a close interest in this good work that the Cancer Council has been doing in raising awareness about bowel cancer screening. I can advise the House that we are very conscious of the request to expand and extend this program. The member would probably be aware that, in 2008, our government made a decision to not only provide for the continuation of the programsomething that had not been provided for in the forward estimates by the previous government-but also extend the program to include 50-year-olds, the date at which ques- screening for bowel cancer should comit mence. As the program currently stands, it is available to 50-year-olds, 55-year-olds and 65-year-olds. The government has received advice that the absolute rolled gold clinical standard would be to commence screening at 50 and to do that every two years thereafter. We will be considering those proposals in the budget context next year. Broadband",107
78,Mr STEPHEN JONES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Why is the National Broadband Network important for Program productivity in the future of our economy?,107
79,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Throsby for his very important question, because the NBN is absolutely critical to driving productivity and innovation in our economy and to providing basic services to all parts of the country at an affordable price. As I travel around this vast country and around the regional areas in particular, I find that they understand the importance of the National Broadband Network. When you go to Mackay, to Rockhampton, to Tasmania and to Western Australia, you find that regional Australians understand the importance of the National Broadband Network to their capacity, in particular, to do business and to be joined up to the national economy and the international economy. The NBN is a very important way of driving economic prosperity. It is a wholesale network and that is why, as the Prime Minister said before, it will drive competition amongst retailers and, because it will do that, it will drive prices down over time. That is recognised quite generally. For example, it is recognised by the Chairman of the ACCC, who has described the NBN as ‘the most significant procompetitive stance we have ever taken in this area of telecommunications'. It has been a dream of economic reformers to achieve structural separation and it is incredible that, in this House, the Liberal Party could now be opposing structural separation. That is why the member for Wentworth is such a hypocrite: he is prepared to make a quid out of it but he is also prepared to come into this House and oppose the structural separation of Telstra. Nothing demonstrates more the hypocrisy of those opposite on this question than the position of the member for Wentworth, who absolutely understands the importance of the NBN to economic growth, to competition and to people living in regional Australia. Of course he has been given his instructions to come into this House and demolish it, but he is still happy to make a quid out of it. Nothing demonstrates more the fact that those opposite are on about short-term political advantage, not long-term advantage. They would rather see the government fail than see the country succeed. They would rather tear the economy down than build it up. We on this side of the House are nation builders and we understand the importance of this vital enabling technology. We have had an extensive examination of the NBN. We had a committee of experts who said there was no privatesector proposal that delivered value for money. We have had a detailed implementation study, and now we are preparing a business case that those opposite say they will not accept in the first place, because they are concerned with politics not the long-term national interest. Broadband",107
80,Mr BUCHHOLZ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her statement during the election campaign that she opposed increases in the age pension in Cabinet because, and I quote: ‘We are talking about expenditure of more than $50 billion over the next 10 years. That's a lot of money.' Why is the Prime Minister rushing to spend $43 billion on an NBN without releasing its business plan when she was more than happy last year to veto a similar amount for struggling pensioners? Isn't the Prime Minister's double standard proof that this government has lost its way?",108
81,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question and, first and foremost, the assertions in it are wholly untrue; second, this is the government that delivered a historic increase in pensions to Australian pensioners, and we are proud we did. The member who asked the question might want to reflect on why he is a supporter of a political party that was in office for almost 12 years and never delivered a pension increase of that magnitude. We will be very, very happy to receive his congratulations for having provided that increase to pensioners. We thought it was the right thing to do, and we did it. On the National Broadband Network, we also believe this is the right thing to do. Yes, we are being careful and methodical and diligent and prudent every step of the way as befits a government that is governing in the national interest. That is why the National Broadband Network has been the subject of reports and studies commissioned by the government and is also the subject of investigations by various parliamentary committees at various stages, including particularly in the Senate. So I would say to the member opposite that at some point he needs to think for himself and work this out: is he going to follow the Leader of the Opposition down a path of political destruction and demolish the NBN, or is he going to come into this parliament and stand up for his constituents, stand up for their ability to have superfast broadband, stand up for their ability to be participants in an economy that will have the additional productivity and prosperity that broadband will bring and stand up for their ability to get the healthcare and education services of the future because of the existence of the National Broadband Network? I understand he is a new member and obviously would still be thinking about these questions, but I am confident that, if he thinks about them seriously, he will come to one conclusion, which is that he should support the National Broadband Network.

83,Ms OWENS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy. Why is universal broadband vital reform for Australia? What indications are there of confidence from business and parliamentarians that the National Broadband Network will deliver significant benefits to the Australian economy?",109
84,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. Indeed, there are many signs of confidence out there in the National Broadband Network. This is no surprise because the studies show that innovation from ICT is the biggest, single driver of business productivity. The Centre for International Economics has found that high speed broadband could lift national economic output by 1.4 per cent. NBN does have the confidence of key players in business as well as in parliament. Peter Strong, the Chief Executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations, said: ‘We want it, we need it.' The CEO of Primus Telecom, Ravi Bhatia, said of the NBN: ‘Consumers want it, businesses want it, and the industry wants it.' I am also asked about parliamentarians and their response and whether they have shown confidence in the NBN. On day one, Senator Barnaby Joyce said: ‘This delivers a strategic infrastructure outcome.' He was straight out of the blocks in support of the government's plan for the National Broadband Network. The member for Bradfield in a previous life said: ‘I believe the possibilities are extremely exciting.' But of course there is an even greater sign of confidence in the National Broadband Network, and that is the member for Wentworth's 5.4 million reasons-5.4 million shares in a company, Melbourne IT, which stands to benefit from the National Broadband Network. There is a great Australian saying: ‘Put your money where your mouth is.' Well, the member for Wentworth's money is heading towards the NBN but his mouth is heading in the opposite",109

When I advised the minister that I would listen carefully, he started to say that he was going to quote from the manager or director of a certain company. I will listen carefully to the quote. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, further to the earlier point of order: it is pretty clear that the Leader of the House, at the behest of the Prime Minister, is making a personal attack on the member for Wentworth.

That is a stunning endorsement from the CEO of Melbourne IT, one which I concur with completely, and clearly so does the of member for Wentworth. I am reminded of the scene from All the President's Men where Deep Throat is talking to Robert Redford playing Bob Woodward. They are talking about what happens if there is not quite a ring of truth.

106,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The National Broadband Network is going to give every school in Australia access to high-speed broadband. The fact is that a national broadband network delivering decent speeds will be terrific for students and for teachers. It will be terrific for students because they will get the opportunity to learn and cooperate with each other and to access resources from around Australia and, indeed, from around the world. For example, students in regional and remote Australia can use the NBN to get access to specialist teachers that they might not otherwise be able to access-music teachers, vocational education teachers and language teachers. They will also have the opportunity to get immediate feedback from those teachers with live, interactive videoconferencing. This kind of learning is just not possible without the type of high-speed access that the National Broadband Network will provide. Imagine a class in Alice Springs being able to interact in real time with a class in Hobart-broadening their horizons and learning from one another. Students will also be able to link up with other resources, such as from the collection of the Australian War Memorial or NASA. All of these possibilities will deepen the learning experiences that students will have and will be available to students no matter where they live. Faster, more reliable broadband will also naturally be of great benefit to our teachers, supporting this government's agenda of improving teacher quality, by enabling them to understand the professional issues that are in front of them and to get the additional learning that they need through virtual workshops and virtual seminars. Sharing the best in teacher resources will greatly help our teachers as well. Access to a computer is critical with the National Broadband Network. That is why the government is investing over $2 billion over seven years to achieve a one-to-one computer to student ratio for years 9 to 12 by the end of 2011, with a delivery, importantly, of over 345,000 computers to secondary schools and approved funding for over 740,000 computers. Computers are changing the way that kids learn. Imagine how much more impact this will have once students are hooked up to the NBN. As well, we will make sure that Australia's first-ever national curriculum is fully online. Again, teachers will have the opportunity to use the NBN to access all kinds of teaching resources to sup- under 94(a). port them in teaching the national curriculum. Finally, we are investing some $40 million in a digital strategy for teachers and for school leaders. This is providing teachers with the ICT skills that they will need so they can better set up learning in their classshould rooms. Incidentally, for country teachers and principals, in particular, the NBN will be of huge benefit. That is something I know members of this House agree with and understand. The fact is that, with a computer in the classroom and the NBN at the front door, schools will be well prepared to meet the challenges of the 21st century and we will give every school the opportunity through this resourcing to be a great school.

107,Mr FLETCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her own assessment of what she learnt from the 2010 election result where she stated: … leadership requires boldness, patience and methodical work. That means opening up our national debates to more Australians, to build stronger understanding of and consensus for policy initiatives. Why isn't the Prime Minister allowing a national debate on the NBN by ensuring that all Australians are given access to the company's business plan? Isn't the Prime Minister's double standard proof that the government has lost its way?",112

109,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Canning will leave the chamber for one hour The member for Canning then left the chamber.,112
110,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say to the member that he will have access to the National Broadband Network business plan to inform a nathat tional debate. But I believe that debate be based on facts. I believe that debate should be based on goodwill. I believe that that debate should be conducted with the national interest rather than an individual's political party's political interest paramount. The member who asked the question comes to this parliament with some expertise in telecommunications. On the National Broadband Network, and some of his earlier writings, I would simply pose to him the following questions. Does he believe that the structural separation of Telstra is in the national interest? Of course it is. Does he believe that Australians having access to superfast national broadband is in the national interest? Of course it is. Has he absorbed all of the information already in the public domain about the National Broadband Network? The image he tries to paint that somehow there is not information in the public domain is entirely untrue. There have been detailed assessments undertaken by expert panels. We published the implementation study from MCKinsey and KPMG-over 500 pages of analysis. We will publish the NBN business case. There is a live trial underway in Tasmania. There is a great deal of information to inform this national debate. And yet, with that great deal of information informing the national debate, and with more to come, what the opposition are really saying, when you strip it all down, is, ‘It does not matter what the information is, it does not matter what the facts are, it does not matter what the benefits are, we will demolish the NBN-full stop.'  of order on direct relevance. The Prime Minister was not asked about the opposition's position; she was asked about when they would release the business case.",112
111,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And the answer went on to widen the scope of the question. The Prime Minister will respond directly to the question.,113
112,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was actually asked about informed national debates. Let me conclude by saying this: informed national debates need people interested in the facts; that is, people who have not locked into negativity, wrecking, bitterness and putting political interest before the national interest. It requires people who are prepared to absorb the facts and think about the nation's future. Unfortunately, the opposition-bitter, negative and determined to wreck-has locked in behind the slogan ‘demolish the NBN' so the facts are entirely irrelevant to members of the opposition. Broadband",113
113,Ms ODWYER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the offer to the Green and Independent members of parliament of a briefing on the NBN business plan. Why have the Green and Independent members of parliament been asked to sign confidentiality agreements of lengths that change by the hour-seven years, then three years, now two weeks? Isn't the government's attempt to gag Green and Independent members of parliament further evidence that the government has lost its way?",113
114,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The National Broadband Network Co. has been working through it with members of parliament who are interested in the facts, briefing them on the facts. Given that there is commercial sensitivity about information that is in the National Broadband Network business case, it stands to very simple common-sense reasoning that some of this information is market sensitive. So the National Broadband Network Co. has been working with members of this parliament who are prepared to judge on the basis of the facts on the possibility of getting them briefings. Of course, facts that the member who asked the question may be interested in have also been put into the public domain. In that regard I refer to a letter of 19 November signed by Mike Quigley, an expert in telecommunications, who is the CEO of the National Broadband Network Co. If the member asking the question is in any way interested in the facts, then she may be interested to know that the National Broadband Network Co., in its business case, will verify that the NBN can be built in a way which provides an internal rate of return higher than the current long-term government bond rate. What that means, of course, is that on its own, looking at the return of the NBN, it is a viable project. That is before you get to all of the economic benefits and all of the service delivery benefits. That means that in terms of the use of taxpayers' money there will be a greater return than the long-term bond rate. That is, it is a better use of taxpayers' money than investments that secure the long-term bond rate. So: viable-tick. The peak equity requirement of the project approximates that in the implementation study-and of course the implementation study is there in the public domain should the member want to read it. The National Broadband Network Co. has verified that the total capital requirements are substantially below that predicted by the implementation study. That is good news. Of course, NBN Co. has verified that they have assumed a uniform national wholesale price. That is good news for responsible members of the parliament who represent regional constituencies and care about their access to voice services and internet services on the same basis wholesale-wise as the rest of the nation. And, NBN Co. has verified that the business plan projects that prices will be reduced over time. So to the member who asked the question, I would say to her that if she is truly interested she should have a look at the wealth of information in the public domain, absorb the facts from NBN Co. about what is in the national business model for NBN Co. and actually draw some conclusions based on those facts. But unfortunately I fear that the member who asked the question will not do any of that because she will follow the leader of the opposition down the road of wrecking, down the road of privileging his political interest over the national interest and down the road of being driven by the three-word slogan of ‘demolish the NBN'. Well, we will get on with the job, the patient work required to deliver this transforming infrastructure project for the nation. Broadband  is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. How will faster broadband combined with government investments deliver better care for patients?",113
115,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Moreton for this question because he has had a keen interest in e-health initiatives for GP partners in his electorate and in northern Brisbane, one of the lead sites trying to make sure that they are well positioned and GPs are well positioned to take advantage of not just health reform but also the powers of the NBN. I notice up in the gallery some of our GP friends from Geelong. Similarly, they are hoping to be able to be well positioned to make the most of the government's investment in health reform but also to unleash the potential of the Broadband Network. Of course, our aim in combining these two important priorities for the government is that we do improve the access to health services in regional areas, that we reduce medical errors, and that we are able to train more doctors and nurses. The combined investments in the Broadband Network and health reform can have real results. In particular, regional patients will be able to get better access to specialists, particularly as the telehealth items come online for the Medicare Benefits Schedule on 1 July. Families will be able to see and talk to a GP at 3 am if that is the time when their child is sick in the middle of the night. In the future we will be able to use the technology and the changes to our health system to allow this. If you are from Perth and your doctor is in Perth but you have an MRI scan when you are on holiday in Cairns, you will be able to ask for that scan to be sent to your doctor in Perth so you can follow up with the proper treatment into the future. The new medical school opening in Darwin next year will enable Flinders University to train new students online, using the Broadband Network to get proper access. These sorts of investments are vital. I know he has already been mentioned but I suspect that Minister Grylls, a minister interested in regional development, will also be looking at the potential of the Broadband Network to deliver health services to a bigger part of our community in regional areas. In fact, pretty much everyone in this House, except those opposite, believes there is benefit to be had from linking health reforms with the National Broadband Network so that we can improve services provided to communities across the country. We are at a point in time when we have a choice as to whether we unleash the potential of technology to improve health services or whether we want to stand in the way of any change. On this side of the House we want to use the potential; unfortunately, on the other side of the House they simply want to stand in the way and block both of them.",114
116,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before calling the member for North Sydney, I say to the member for Herbert that he could be considered to be in contravention of standing order 65(b) in that he is conversing aloud while another member is speaking.

117,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, have you read the NBN business plan and, if so, why cannot everyone else?",115
118,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Obviously, the government is working through its internal processes, including cabinet processes, about this that matter. I am not intending to comment on them publicly. Mr Dutton-You haven't read it!",115
119,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Dickson.,115
120,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If that means the opposition is going to scream and shout like a pack of schoolchildren, I will allow them to do that because any member of the opposition who has served as a cabinet minister understands what cabinet-in-confidence means. If they are so dismissive of cabinetin-confidence, I would welcome the Leader of the Opposition saying, for example, ‘We could release every cabinet-in-confidence document of the Howard government.' What a tale we would see about things like Work Choices. The shadow minister asked me about confidentiality. I assume he is genuinely interested, that this was not just an excuse to scream and shout and act like a child. Let me take him through it. Mr Dutton- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order as to relevance. The Prime Minister was asked simply whether she had read itno detail, just: has she read it?",115
121,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The standing order indicates that the Prime Minister has to be directly relevant to the question. The Prime Minister is responding. She will be directly relevant to the question.,115
122,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am being directly relevant to that section of the question which goes to the release of the NBN Co. business case. I will directly answer that question by explaining the process of release and the confidential matters that are within it. The government will release the business plan in December after the government has considered a key ACCC recommendation on how many retail companies will be able to plug into the network. Of course, we need to work through this decision which is the subject of an NBN Co. and ACCC public consultation process, which does not conclude until 30 November. The points that interconnect that decision, which that process relates to, will be made after the ACCC has delivered its advice to government on 1 December. Mr Abbott interjecting",115
123,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition is asking: how is this about the business plan? Of course, this decision relates to the business plan. The points of terconnection decision will mainly impact on backhaul providers, on how and where they connect into the NBN, how the infrastructure they have already built will be affected and how deep into the network companies will be able to build their own infrastructure. Consepired. quently, that is market-sensitive information. The member asked me: why do you not simply release the NBN Co. business plan? Because there are market-sensitive sections of it. I have just spelt out a section of market sensitivity. We can tell from the reaction of those opposite on the opposition front bench that to them this is all just a game. Actually, they have no interest at all in receiving the business case. We will put it out. They will never really read it. They will go through it and look for one word they can put in a press release in order to justify their argument demolish the NBN. Mr Hartsuyker-You haven't read it.",116

125,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We thank the member for Wentworth for being so forthright in earlier interviews. It does not matter what the facts are, it does not matter what anybody finds, it does not matter how positive the National Broadband Network is; the Leader of the Opposition will always be opposed to it because he is pursuing a political game and not the national interest. You could not have a clearer display than you can see today in the kind of cheap political game this opposition is obsessed by.  the Prime Minister time to answer yes or no, I would move a two-minute extension of time.",116

If there was time on the in- clock and the member for Sturt, even though he is warned by way of interjections, is assisting me by saying there was, I do not think I can accept such a motion. There was still time; the member had time. Such a motion can be moved only when the time has exNA",116

Now you have moved in a different direction. I just want to clarify which one is correct.",116
128,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I actually copped this point of order because I might have conned the member for Sturt last parliament by suggesting that there had to be a motion before the time had expired. Subsequently, I found that I was wrong and I did not hotfoot it in here to inform people. In practice, that is the way that I have ruled on it since that time. It is very nice of him to acknowledge that he may have listened to me once, unfortunately though when I was wrong, but that is okay. Broadband",116
129,Ms SMYTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts. How will the National Broadband Network contribute to sustainable regional economies and are there any risks to the delivery to this infrastructure?",117
130,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question because I know that she campaigned strenuously on this issue before she won the seat. The development of the National Broadband Network is critical for the regions. We have heard in this parliament before how it will lift the national productivity. In no place is this more apparent than in the case of the regions because it will give them greater economic diversity and obviously the ability to obtain better services. The transformative nature of this is enormous. This is not just about improved text, voice and video in the download sense. This is also about the capacity to upload material, in particular important data which is crucial to future applications. We have heard in this parliament already from the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth what it can do for e-education. That can only be the case if the opportunity is there to make those applications. With the Minister for Health and Ageing in e-health, and with commerce the ability to obtain and access the global supply chains, the opportunities for e-commerce in regional Australia are enormous. In my other portfolio, the opportunity for e-arts and e-creative industries is also enormous. I had the opportunity in the fortnight that the parliament was up to visit a number of regions. I went with the member for Lyne to Port Macquarie and it was very interesting there when we had discussions with Country Energy about the opportunities that they were looking for with smart grids so that they could get energy efficiency into homes connected to the national grid. I also had the opportunity to visit some five of the evocities that are involved in a program that we are supporting. There it was apparent that not only do these cities have in common their involvement through evocities but also that Charles Sturt University has a campus in every one of those cities. They are looking in the space of e-education and e-health and creatively combining those. The opportunity to do that effectively will not exist if this National Broadband Network does not proceed. The truth is that, in all of the visits that I have had and in those of my colleagues, people out there get it. They understand why it is important to get this infrastructure down. The question that we have to ask ourselvesand I have been asked in the question, ‘What are the threats to this?'-is: we just do not get why the other side do not get it. Here they are talking about the emphasis being still on wireless services-sufficient being sufficient for regional communities. That is nonsense. Go and talk to them and they will explain to you why it is not sufficient. Those on the other side have also opposed the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill, which is integral to the structural separation. It is a recipe for higher prices. This is the policy view of the opposition and its spokesman. But when it comes to the spokesman's investment he is the Jerry Maguire of the opposition. We know where he has put the money that he has been shown and it is in backing the NBN. We just want him to put his mouth where his money is and get behind the backing of this proposal.",117

132,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Leader of the House will resume his seat. By the ing used by the member for Wentworth, he acknowledged that there had been no accusation against him but he made an accusation against the minister. Mr Turnbull-I will come and withdraw it. Mr Speaker, there was an imputation made against me, but I do withdraw.",118

134,Mr BRIGGS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime ister to the members of the Woodside Action Group in the gallery today and her decision to house 400 asylum seeker families in their community. I further refer the Prime Minister to her statement during the election campaign that the East Timor processing centre ‘effectively eliminates the onshore processing of unauthorised arrivals'. Can the Prime Minister understand why the Woodside community feels deceived by the difference between her statements before the election and the actions taken afterwards? And, Prime Minister, why will you not meet with this community?",118

139,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sorry that members word- of the Woodside Community Action Group had to witness that conduct and how much it exhibits that what the opposition is interested in is playing question time games about this rather than addressing community concerns. We as a government, in contrast, are very interested in working through, with the Woodside community, the issues that concern them. In that regard, they have met today with the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. The immigration minister, with the local member, will travel to a community based meeting on Wednesday night to talk through questions relating to the government's decision and measures that can be put in place to work with the local community. MinThe meeting will discuss questions such as employment in the detention centre and services that can also be of benefit to the community. I also say to the member who asked the question: he well knows that the statements I made in the election campaign and earlier, and the statements I have made since, about a regional protection framework and regional processing centre are statements in which I have been very frank and very honest with the Australian community. On each and every occasion, I have said to the Australian community that we will need to work through those issues in dialogue with countries in our region. That dialogue is underway now. The ultimate aim of that approach is to take out of the hands of people smugglers the very product that they sell. That is in sharp contrast to an opposition that campaigned on ‘stop the boats' but is now putting out a welcome mat to 3,750 asylum seekers under its new policy as announced by its shadow minister. Mr Abbott-I raise a point of order on direct relevance, Mr Speaker. The question was: would she meet with them, not wave at them.",118

142,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Special Minister of State. How will access to government information improve as the National Broadband Network bridges the digital divide?,119
143,Mr GRAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I note that he has taken a great interest both in the business of the National Broadband Network and, importantly, the interests of his constituents. The National Broadband Network is a great way of delivering internet services. It will allow Australians, particularly those living in rural, regional and outer metropolitan areas, to engage with government services faster and more reliably and in the way they want tovia the internet. I will just go through some statistics on the way Australians are currently accessing government services via the internet. These statistics come from AGIMO and are current as at last year. Access to government services via the internet has doubled since 2004. It is currently the channel most used by Australians to contact the government. In 2009, 38 per cent of Australians used the internet for their last contact with the government. In comparison, 32 per cent of contacts were in person and 30 per cent by telephone. Only nine per cent of Australians contact the Australian government via old-fashioned traditional mail. Just under 31 per cent of Australians used the internet for all or most of their contacts with the Australian government in 2009. Use of the internet to contact government has doubled from 19 per cent in 2004-05 to 38 per cent in 2009. Overall, people strongly prefer the internet and telephone to all other channels because the internet and telephone take less time and can be used at a time that suits the user. This is important: Australians want to access government services via the internet because it takes less time and can be done with ease at work or at home and at a time that suits the user. Australians are now using the internet to find out about services from government and to seek information from government more than they are using any other option available to them. Broadband black spots plagued the country through most of the past decade as a consequence of the former government's underinvestment, lack of knowledge of the potential, lack of knowledge of how to fix these problems, and lack of care and consideration for service delivery to our regional centres and outer metropolitan areas. This characterised a government that not only just did not get it but just did not care. What we now see, as governments increasingly provide information to people via internet broadband services, is that people want to take up those options. People increasingly want to take up those options in order to better inform themselves and in order to seek better personal service from the government. This is a more efficient and effective way for people to find out about their entitlements and about government services. Most importantly, it is a very important way for government to understand what services we need to provide to better serve the interests of all Australians. As the National Broadband Network is invested in around the country and develops the capacity for people in regional and rural centres to better obtain information about government services, I think all of us in this place would do well understand its principal mission in serving the interests of regional Australians and the value of this investment to our community. Banking",119
144,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. The coalition is taking real and immediate action to increase competition in the banking sector with our ninepoint plan, the private member's bill on antiurer competitive price signalling I introduced today and, as announced by the shadow Treasurer today, terms of reference for a new inquiry into the banking sector. When will the Treasurer stop talking and start taking real action to achieve a better deal for homeduce buyers and small businesses?",120
145,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am wondering why I did not get that question from Joe-come-lately, Mr Speaker.",120
146,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will refer to members by their title and he will not debate the question.,120
147,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The shadow Treasurer has had a lot to say about this, and I welcome the opportunity to correct the record. This government has a proud record of reform in the banking system and most particularly a proud record of reform in making that system more competitive. Those opposite do have a very selective memory. We put in place the financial claims scheme, and those opposite had not had the wit to do that over 12 long years. A financial claims scheme, now the deposits guarantee, was the very foundation of our surviving the global recession. Of course that was of greatest benefit to people who were involved with smaller financial institutions, the smaller banks and the credit unions. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Practice at page 552 says that under the last paradigm ministers could answer in almost any way they liked, to as long as they did not use unparliamentary language. But with our new standing orders requiring a direct answer, would you direct the minister to answer just when he will introduce reform for competition and not answer under the old paradigm? Otherwise the change was pointless.",120
148,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,With a long preamble the question went to asking when the Treaswill stop talking and take real action. The Treasurer is directly relevant in going to those two points about whether or not action has already been taken.,120
149,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On six occasions over 12 years those opposite were advised to introa financial claims scheme by our regulators and they refused. Why did they do that? Because the big banks would not let them do it. It fell to our government to put a financial claims scheme in place to protect the Australian banking system and the deposits of 16 million people. We did that. We have put in place a raft of competition reforms, and most importantly we have put in place the investment in residential mortgagebacked securities that has been absolutely essential for those smaller lenders who have been so badly affected by the global financial crisis. And we have taken action on unfair mortgage exit fees. This is the background, and now we get to the here and now. Those opposite pretend to be interested in the banks because they see a political opportunity. They took to the last election not one policy on banking-not one. That is how interested they were then. And they were not talking about price signalling. The shadow Treasurer went to the Press Club in May and talked about reform of the Trade Practices Act, and he did not mention price signalling. The first we heard about price signalling was that they had read about it in the paper because the government had been talking to the ACCC about it. So they came up with a thought bubble, pretending they had a plan for competition in the banking system. Of course that had its conclusion in the House today when they presented a bill on price signalling, but it is a bill which will create great uncertainty. They have not been working with the regulators to get it right. Mr Hockey-Have you read it?",120
150,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I have looked at it and there is a real problem with it. It demonstrates what happens when those opposite have a thought bubble and decide they want to play with the Australian banking system. Nothing could be more precious, nothing could be more valuable, than stability in the Australian financial system. Mr Hockey interjecting",121

154,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For our part, we will behave in a professional manner.

In doing so, they have urged me ‘to put his mouth where his money is'-in other words, to act in this House with regard only to my own personal financial interest as opposed to the public interest, which I am sworn to serve. The suggestion that I secretly support the NBN is absurd and false. I have been making the same criticisms of the NBN since it was first announced.

168,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"GortonMinister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Privacy and Freedom of Information) (3.31 pm)-by leave-Today, I am pleased to present to the parliament the second report of the Anti-People Trafficking Interdepartmental Committee. People trafficking is a heinous crime which involves serious contraventions of human rights. It is a sobering and shocking fact that in the 21st century, all around the world, slavery and servitude remain the daily reality for very many of our fellow human beings, and Australia is not immune. People traffickers recruit, transport, transfer, harbour or receive their victims through force, coercion or other means in order to exploit them. Globally, people trafficking takes many forms: forced or bonded labour, domestic servitude and forced marriage, sexual slavery, organ harvesting, and the exploitation of children such as through forced begging, the sex trade and abduction for warfare. The motivation for this crime is simple-profit. The International Labour Organisation has estimated that people trafficking nets traffickers US$32 billion every year. The impact of this crime on victims is traumatic and has lifelong consequences. People trafficking affects almost every country in the world. Fortunately, opportunities to traffic people into Australia are low because of our strong migration and border controls and geographic isolation. We are, however, a destination country for victims of trafficking, mainly from Asia, and the government remains committed to combating trafficking in all its forms. As Minister for Home Affairs and Justice, I am the lead minister for Australia's wholeof-government anti-people trafficking strategy. I deliver this strategy in collaboration with my colleagues the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the Minister for eign Affairs and the Minister for the Status Women, who each have responsibility for particular aspects, such as the People Trafficking Visa Framework and the Support for Victims of People Trafficking Program. I would also like to acknowledge the work of the former Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator the Hon. Chris Evans; the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Stephen Smith; the former Minister for the Status of Women, the Hon. Tanya Plibersek; and, of course, the former Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon. Bob Debus. I thank them for their commitment to protecting the victims of people trafficking, and for promoting regional initiatives which build the capacity of countries in our region to combat this crime. The Gillard government's anti-trafficking strategy is built around four central pillars: prevention, detection and investigation, criminal prosecution, and victim support and rehabilitation. Together, this suite of measures is intended to address the full cycle of trafficking, from recruitment to reintegration, and to give equal weight to the critical areas of prevention, prosecution and victim support. This strategy builds on the work undertaken by the previous government, and I would like to thank and acknowledge the opposition for their work to combat people trafficking. This is an important bipartisan effort to combat a crime of concern to all. Since 2003, the Australian government has provided more than $50 million to support a range of anti-trafficking initiatives. Over the past year these initiatives have provided support to victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation and other forms of exploitative labour, and we have witnessed the successful prosecution and conviction of a number of people traffickers. Since 2004, the Australian Federal Police has undertaken For- over 270 investigations and assessments of of allegations of trafficking related offences, leading to 39 people being charged and nine convictions. There are currently five trafficking related matters before our courts. Investigations of people trafficking matters can be long, complex and resource intensive, particularly given their transnational nature. It is therefore imperative that we collaborate closely with our neighbours. In the past year the Australian Federal Police have undertaken major investigations into transnational organised people-trafficking syndicates in concert with their counterparts in the Republic of Korea and in Malaysia. Australia also provides a comprehensive range of support services for suspected victims of people trafficking. Since January 2004, 175 people have received assistance through the Support for Victims of People Trafficking Program. In July last year, the government implemented changes to the People Trafficking Visa Framework which simplify the framework and, importantly, give victims and their immediate family greater certainty about their immigration status. These changes came out of the first anti-trafficking round-table in 2008 and were the direct result of sultations with a range of stakeholders, both government and non-government. Under the new arrangements 21 permanent visas have now been granted-15 of these to victims and six to their dependants. A further 15 suspected victims have also been granted bridging F visas, and another 11 criminal justice stay visas have been issued. The changes the government has made to the visa status is important not only because it means proper support to victims can be provided but also because it assists in making victims available to participate in prosecutions and bringing the perpetrators to justice. The government's industrial relations reforms, including the worker protection act 2009, introduced new safeguards to protect the rights of foreign workers. The Fair Work Ombudsman, which was established on 1 July last year, has undertaken more than 800 investigations involving foreign workers in the past year. This has resulted in the recovwith ery of more than $500,000 in unpaid entitlements to almost all victims-a clear message to the perpetrators who are seeking to make a profit from their crimes. The government's anti-people-trafficking strategy, however, is not only focused on domestic activities; Australia has taken an active role in international efforts to combat people trafficking. Australia, with Indonesia, co-founded and co-chairs the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime. The Bali process provides a strong platform for collaboration between countries in our region with a shared interest in the prevention of irregular migration, including trafficking in persons. The Attorney-General's Department, the Australian Federal Police, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Departconment of Immigration and Citizenship have worked closely with international partners on a wide range of activities aimed at building regional capacity and reducing opportunities for people traffickers to operate in the region. Addressing the very factors that make people vulnerable to trafficking is an important part of the government's national and international strategy to prevent trafficking. In 2010-11, Australia will provide approximately $4.3 billion in official development assistance to help reduce poverty and promote sustainable development. The aid program addresses violence against women and children, and includes a number of activities to help combat people trafficking and labour exploitation at the regional level. The aid program also supports NGO projects in the region that raise awareness, strengthen community resilience to trafficking and support victims. People trafficking is a complex crime. It is often linked in popular commentary only sexual servitude. But as I noted before, the global reality is that people are trafficked for exploitation in many settings, including forced labour in construction, hospitality, agriculture and domestic labour. Combating this form of modern day slavery is challenging. The perpetrators are sophisticated and nimble, changing their methodology in response to law enforcement activity and migration governance. Success of investigations and prosecutions depends in great part upon the assistance of victims of trafficking, who are often exposed to intimidation and other risks by the traffickers. Many victims in Australia do not conform to the popular image of people trafficking and slavery which involves abduction, violence and physical restraint. The situation is more complex. Coercion and control involve a range of subtle methods, such as threats of violence, obligations to repay debt, isolation, manipulation of tenuous or illegal migration situations and a general sense of obligation. This poses challenges for jurors. It also poses challenges for individuals and organisations in the community to understand and recognise possible indicators of trafficking. Over the coming year, the Gillard government will continue to raise community awareness of trafficking in all its forms, cluding for labour exploitation. Globally, there is little reliable data about the nature and extent of trafficking. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimated in 2009 that at least 12.3 million people around the world are trapped in forced labour of which some 2.45 million people have been trafficked. The ILO estimates that 1.36 million of those victims are in the Asia-Pacific region-more than the entire population of Adelaide. While women working in the sex industry are over-represented among statistics on identified victims of trafficking in Australia and internationally, it is likely that this is because other forms of exploitation are under-reported and under-researched. Recently, I released a report by the Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) which showed that labour trafficking is under-reported and even unrecognised by many Australians. Other research undertaken by the AIC indicates that there is a lack of understanding of what constitutes trafficking. Overcoming this challenge is going to be a critical part of a successful strategy. Therefore, cooperation between governments, between government agencies and between governments and civil society is key to educating the wider community, preventing the fundamental reasons that people are trafficked, prosecuting the perpetrators when trafficking occurs and protecting and supporting victims. On Wednesday, the Gillard government will convene the third National Roundtable on People Trafficking. The round-table brings together anti-people-trafficking NGOs, service providers, support organisations for victims of crime as well as legal, employer and union bodies to implement a whole-ofcommunity approach to fighting this crime. In the lead-up to the third round-table, I will release two important resources which have in- been developed by members of the round-table. These are: - the guidelines for NGOs working with trafficked people which have been updated to reflect important changes in the people-trafficking visa framework and victim support program; and, - a labour-trafficking information resource for both employees and employers which includes practical steps on combating forced labour and people trafficking. In addition, jointly with Attorney-General MCClelland, today I will release a public discussion paper on forced and servile marriage. Over the coming year the Gillard government will also consider improved protections for vulnerable and disadvantaged witnesses in people-trafficking matters. The Australian government remains committed to working in partnership with other governments and international organisations, and with nongovernment organisations, to prevent people trafficking, bring the perpetrators to justice and protect and support victims. Only by working together can we combat this heinous crime. I present a copy of Trafficking in persons: the Australian government response, 1 May 2009 to 30 June 2010. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to allow the member for Stirling to speak. Leave granted.",122

170,Mr KEENAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am pleased to respond on behalf of the coalition to the Minister for Home Affairs' statement as to the government's response to people trafficking. Broadly the coalition welcomes what this statement contains. It certainly builds upon the strong work that was started under the Howard government and which has been continued under this government. People trafficking is, indeed, a complex crime and a major violation of human rights. People trafficking takes place for a variety of reasons including sexual servitude, domestic labour, forced marriage and sweatshop labour. Women, men and children can be victims. While there is limited hard information on the number of people trafficked and the target industry in which they are trafficked, evidence suggests that the trafficking of women into prostitution is the major, and certainly most visible, form of trafficking taking place. Data provided by the Australian Institute of Criminology reveals that, globally, sexual exploitation is by far the most commonly identified type of people trafficking-79 per cent of offences-followed by forced labour. Whilst the terms ‘people smuggling' and ‘people trafficking' are often used interchangeably, they have very different meanings. People smugglers are paid by those who wish to enter a country illegally. The people wishing to migrate are generally involved voluntarily. People traffickers, conversely, use coercion and/or deception to force people to illegally enter a country. Once the illegal immigrants are in the destination country people traffickers often continue to exploit them. It is interesting to note orthat the Australian Institute of Criminology ran a community awareness and attitude survey in mid-2009. The results revealed that a majority of people-61 per cent-confused people trafficking with people smuggling and only nine per cent of people could correctly identify people trafficking. It is widely recognised that people trafficking has become a well-established and enormously lucrative business throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Australia, sadly, is viewed as a destination country for persons trafficked out of South-East Asia. There are several reports of migrants, particularly from India, the People's Republic of China and South Korea, who voluntarily migrate to work in Australia but are later coerced into exploitative conditions. As noted by the Australian Institute of Criminology's report into trafficking in South-East Asia published this month, it is very difficult to obtain a clear picture of trafficking in the South-East Asian region as it primarily revolves: … around the large scale of undocumented or unregulated labour migration, which results in a blurred distinction between trafficking and smuggling; the widespread movement of women as wives and domestic workers, in addition to sex and entertainment work; the trafficking of children for labour, sexual exploitation and adoption; and the strong link between prostitution and sex tourism. The report also noted that Indonesia is a key source of trafficked persons in the region and has a large problem with trafficking and smuggling along its wide border with Malaysia. It is relatively easy to cross the border on a tourist or visitor visa and then to change that into a working visa on arrival. Australia's stable and strong economic position in the Asia-Pacific region, coupled with plentiful job opportunities in low-skilled sectors, contributes to Australia's status as a target destination for traffickers and smugglers. A complex picture has emerged about the involvement of organised criminal groups in the trafficking of persons. Australian authorities believe that traffickers are primarily individual operators or small crime groups that often rely on larger organised crime groups to procure fraudulent documentation. As the 2009 inaugural report of the Anti-People Trafficking Interdepartmental Committee notes: The groups detected in sex trafficking have been small rather than large organised crime groups. Those involved tended to use family or business contacts overseas to facilitate recruitment, ment and visa fraud. People trafficking matters have also generally involved other crime types, including immigration fraud, identity fraud, document fraud and money laundering. Those that are involved in people trafficking generally have links also to people smuggling. As mentioned by the minister, the Bali process, indeed, provides a strong platform for collaboration between countries in our region with a shared interest in the prevention of irregular migration including the trafficking of persons. Whilst the two issues are separate they remain closely linked. The Australian government does, indeed, have a responsibility to ensure that pull factors are not part of the equation. Unfortunately, since the Labor government have softened our border protection laws, which has given the green light to people smugglers, we have found that those smugglers have also become involved in the insidious trade of people trafficking. The continued crisis in our immigration detention network is getting worse by the day. Under this government constant overcrowding, court challenges, unrest, violence and gruesome protests are unfolding on an almost daily basis. In November 2007 at the change in government there were just four people in our immigration detention network who had arrived illegally by boat. Since Labor backtracked on the strong border protection policies it inherited, there are now well over 5,000 people in detention who have arrived illegally this way. This is a government that has lost its way on border protection and immigration and, as long as Labor has lost its way, the people smugglers will continue to find their way to Australia. The coalition have always been committed to an orderly and humane managed migration and refugee program. We strongly support Australia's position as one of the most generous providers of humanitarian moveresettlement in the world. However the coalition believe in doing this in a way that does not encourage the barbaric practice of people smuggling. The coalition do not support people smugglers who entice people to pay vast sums of money to jump the queue and then force those women and children waiting in refugee camps around the world to wait even longer. At this point I wish to acknowledge the good work of the former Howard government in this area. The former coalition government's response to people trafficking in the Asia-Pacific region has included developing anti-trafficking initiatives between governments and providing aid to the region aimed at alleviating the economic and social conditions that allow trafficking to flourish. In particular the Howard government and Indonesia co-chaired two regional ministerial conferences on trafficking and smuggling in 2002 and 2003-now commonly known as the Bali process-which the minister briefly touched on. In October 2003, the former coalition government announced additional antitrafficking measures, with a $20 million package, targeting sex trafficking in particular. The package included a new Australian Federal Police unit, the Transnational Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking Team; new visa arrangements for victims of trafficking; victim support measures, including counselling and legal and medical support to be administered by the Office for Women; improvements to legislation, making peopletrafficking punishable by up to 20 years in jail; and a promise to ratify the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children-notably, Australia was already a signatory and it was subsequently ratified in 2005. In 2004, the former coalition government produced an action plan to eradicate trafficking in persons in support of the 2003 announcement. In the last budget of the former coalition government, a further $38.3 million over four years was allocated, including $26.3 million for new initiatives. Since then, the coalition has continued to consider this issue a serious one and has supported a range of anti-people-trafficking measures, most of which have a sextrafficking focus. I am sure all members in this place will acknowledge that it is completely unacceptable for even one person to be in this situation. It is true that the measures that have been taken are making a difference. The Transnational Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking Team of the Australian Federal Police is at the front line of combating this problem and, on behalf of the coalition, I wish to pay tribute to the team's men and women, who work so hard in very difficult circumstances, investigating trafficking cases and bringing them to court and, of course, being terribly disappointed if those prosecutions are not successful. We must remember that where you find this type of crime you will find other types of crime, and it is vitally important that the Australian Federal Police is properly resourced to do its job. Broadly, the coalition supports the minister's statement and believes that Australia does have a very important regional leadership role to play in this area, and we will continue to support any moves the government and this parliament take to combat this hideous crime.

171,Dr MIKE KELLY,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (3.54 pm)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The amendments to the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010 provide strengthened arrangements to combat illegal fishing both in our remote sub-Antarctic territories and closer to home. The first set of amendments will address a technical issue that currently permits foreign fishers to traverse the Australian fishing zone to fish illegally in state and Northern Territory coastal waters. The second set of amendments will implement an international agreement with France, allowing cooperative fisheries law enforcement activities in our respective Southern Ocean maritime zones. Both amendments are to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and will strengthen Australia's fishing and maritime security. The first set of amendments to the bill will address a technical legal issue in fisheries management legislation which currently allows foreign fishers to traverse the Australian fishing zone to illegally fish in coastal state and Northern Territory waters. It is imboard. portant that this matter is rectified quickly lest foreign fishers take advantage of this situation and change their methods of operation to avoid prosecution. The second set of amendments will address illegal fishing in Australia's remote southern maritime territories. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is a concern for the Australian government. Illegal fishing on the high seas is a highly organised, mobile and elusive activity undermining the efforts of responsible countries to sustainably manage their fish resources. International cooperation is vital to effectively enforce Australia's national laws in our remote and expansive maritime territories. In 2007, the government of Australia and the government of the French Republic signed a cooperative enforcement agreement that provides for joint enforcement activities in the territorial seas and exclusive economic zones of Australian and French territories in the Southern Ocean. The cooperative enforcement activities will greatly improve Australian and French efforts to prevent illegal fishing activities. Enforcement activities may include the boarding, inspection, hot pursuit, apprehension, seizure and investigation of fishing vessels believed to have violated applicable fisheries laws. In practice, cooperative enforcement will occur when, for example, a French vessel under the control of an Australian officer undertakes patrols in Australia's maritime zones around Heard Island and the MCDonald Islands. If a vessel is sighted and is suspected of undertaking illegal fishing, the Australian officer will enforce Australian fisheries laws and will have the assistance of French officers. reciprocal arrangement will be in place for an Australian vessel patrolling France's marithe time zones around Kerguelen Islands, Crozet Islands, Saint-Paul Island and Amsterdam Island, with a French fisheries officer on The amendments to the bill will also grant French officers civil and criminal immunity from the jurisdiction of Australian courts, in accordance with the provisions in the enforcement agreement for acts performed in the course of carrying out cooperative enforcement activities. Similarly, Australian officers acting consistently with the enforcement agreement are indemnified under French law. Together, these amendments to the bill will strengthen border security and help deter illegal fishing in Australia. Question agreed to. NA (RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT) BILL 2010 Cognate bill: NA (RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT) BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed.",130
172,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Indi has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.,131
173,Mr SIMPKINS,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010, as late as it is in the process. I have found it A very interesting listening to previous speakers on matters concerning the bill, including discussion about which side of politics has been best for research and development and what the future holds. Within the electorate of Cowan, there has been a great history of local businesses taking up the advantages that research and development assistance can provide. I would like to mention a couple of the businesses that have done particularly good research. Tieline Technology, a small but greatly effective business within the electorate of Cowan, have taken advantage of research and development grants under the previous government-before 2007. Tieline have a very high-tech business in which they produce circuit boards. They do not have many employees but they do great work in producing many fine electronic items. I heard a previous speaker talk about who was the originator of the R&D grants, but certainly the Howard government had a great history in supporting research and development, and Tieline has been a beneficiary of that. There are also other great businesses, such as PalmTEQ, which produce Palm Pilots for restaurants. For instance, a waiter come up to you at a restaurant to take your order and, just by tapping away on their palm tech device, they can send that order straight to the kitchen. PalmTEQ is another organisation that is very involved in research and development. It is located within Wangara, which is part of the Cowan electorate. There has certainly been great interest in research and development in Cowan in the past, and these organisations have taken part in those government incentives. From the coalition's perspective, we are happy to support sensible changes to research and development tax incentives which are an improvement to the existing system and where the benefits are clearly apparent. There is no doubt that there is bipartisan support on both sides of the House for research and development. But what is being proposed today is, I think, an alteration to a system that has existed for 25 years. The question that we must ask is: will the government's proposal add any great value? The changes may be sweeping but they certainly pose a threat that could significantly erode support for research and development in Australia. Key changes involved in the legislation go to significant redefinitions of the type of R&D activities that will be eligible for support. Again, this is cause for some concern. I note that Labor have introduced new categories of what they call ‘core' and ‘supporting R&D' and a ‘dominant purpose test'. Our view is that they could combine to significantly increase the threshold for firms to qualify for assistance-and that is a worry to us. In essence, companies must demonstrate that their activities are novel or have hightechnical risk. Under the proposed system, Labor would fund firms only in cases where they can show that they have introduced a whole new technique, process or solution. It is at times like this that you begin to worry can about whether this legislation is actually going to achieve great improvement. Added technicalities or added hurdles for firms to jump over can be a bit of a problem, and we wonder whether that will add great value in the future. As I said, organisations within the electorate of Cowan have been strongly involved in research and development. Organisations such as Tieline and PalmTEQ and others of the same ilk pride themselves on finding where the demand is and trying to reach higher technological processes to seek market share. These are the sorts of companies that we should be looking to support in the future. These companies are not made of money. They do not have many employees to assist in fathoming changes such as those before us. What is really required is that the opportunity to access R&D development support be held out to firms, without it being too onerous on them. Again, we must be very careful in making changes to a system that has been fundamentally sound and has not had great problems associated with it in the past. I notice as well that a previous speaker suggested the amount of money that could be assessed under these grant schemes would be the same. I would have thought that, to push forward research and development, the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr, would be looking to make significantly more money available, particularly with all these other criteria that have been thrown together. We are in support of the eight separate amendments that the shadow minister has put forward. The purpose of the amendments is to overturn the worse of the Labor changes such as the regressive nature of the definitions that have been put forward as part of this bill-that dominant purpose test and the adjustments to the feedstock provisions. These are things that need to be amended. In looking at the research and development changes or legislation, the coalition will always support any sensible and logical improvements to the existing regime and things that would not compromise the integrity of the existing system. That is obviously what we are trying to achieve here with the amendments that have been put forward by the member for Indi, the shadow minister. Labor has tried to pretend that it is interested in improvements to the existing system but this is really nothing more than window dressing-lip service, if you will. If the government were interested in significant and realistic improvements to the R&D process and system, they would not have any problems with accepting the amendments that have been put forward today. This is a critical test for the government. There has been discussion in the past about how the new paradigm-this new 43rd parliamentwould lift the lid off the building and sunlight would shine in, but this is just another example of where the government has decided on a particular course of action. They are not particularly interested in scrutiny and not particularly interested in looking at amendments that have not been put forward by the Greens, who increasingly seem to be running the agenda these days in this place. One person in particular in this place seems to be so powerful. It is very disappointing. Whenever we look at the bills that the government is putting forward in this place, often it seems they are not really moving things forward in the right direction. It seems to be a constant matter of if the Greens have ticked off on this and if the Independent members in the House will support it. That seems to be the only consideration these days. The government still has an opportunity to bring forward into this place bills that are going to add some value and are going to constitute some form of positive outcome for this country. Increasingly, all we see is a government that is beholden to very narrow interests and without real commitment to what is in the best interests of, in this case, business in this country-the employers of this country, people that are going to add some real value-instead of what is becoming more and more obvious, a government that is just beholden to narrow interests that will ask the views of four or five people in this place and respond to those as opposed to what might be in the best interests of the people out there. What greatly concerns me about these sorts of changes is they are going past what is in the best interests of organisations that are achieving great things for employment within the electorate of Cowan, in light industrial suburbs such as Wangara or Malaga, and just working out the opinions of those who sit on the crossbenches. It is disappointing. I think people and businesses in Australia that are interested in research and development will get to the point where they recall what was said by us in the last election campaign-that we would make no changes to the existing R&D concession system until at least 1 July 2011. Then they will look at this system that the government is proposing-complicated business, dominant purpose feedstock rules, increased compliance requirements-and they will see very easily the significant differences between the simplicity and achievements of the past-what we were offering at the last federal election and what the government brings before us today. Causes for concern are many. Amendments, therefore, are many. I take this opportunity to state my overwhelming support for the amendments that have been put forward by the member for Indi. I urge the government, if it believes in what it said about bility and lifting the lid, to give very careful consideration to them to make sure that they do not send R&D backwards in this country and instead take the opportunity to represent businesses in the electorate of Cowan and across the country interested in research and development. The government should listen to us and support these amendments to make sure of the best interests of the broad variety of businesses interested in research and development, as opposed to what the crossbenchers-who increasingly are calling the shots for the government-are interested in. In summary, I am taking this opportunity today to speak on this bill and the great value that these amendments that have been put forward will achieve. We should be very careful before we change the arrangements for research and development in this country. I support the amendments and the need for this bill to change in that manner.",131
174,Mr SLIPPER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"At the outset I would like to express my indebtedness to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, for taking the chair so that I am able to make a contribution to this cognate debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 and the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010. Australia will never be able to compete with low labour cost countries in so many areas of industry and endeavour. Therefore, if we are going to be successful in the world, we have to encourage innovation and channel that innovation into productive industrial enterprise. That is why for quite some time in Australia we have had support for research and development. If we are able to support innovative industries and if we are able to bring those innovative ideas into reality in Australia, it will mean we are at the cutting edge of innovative technology and, if developed, that technology can create indusvisitries, exports, jobs and opportunities. We are a very innovative nation. We are one of the most innovative nations anywhere in the world. But what industry needs is support to encourage that innovation and, equally importantly, to develop that innovation in this country so that we do have productivity from innovative ideas in Australia. That is why there has broadly been a sense of bipartisan support for the concept of research and development. But in relation to the particular details of that support, from time to time different sides of the House, including the crossbench, may have differing points of view. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Indi. While I think there is bipartisan support for the principle of research and development, my view is that the legislation currently before the chamber does not achieve an outcome that is good for Australia. The government has failed to adequately recognise the value of research and development support for business in Australia. This is indicated by the bills before the chamber. At the 2007 election, the now government accused the former Howard Liberal-National government of having largely ignored the contribution of research and development to economic growth and competitiveness. As part of the review of the national innovation system that it initiated shortly after being elected, the new Rudd government sought to evaluate the effectiveness of four existing incentives for business R&D-the 125 per cent R&D tax concession, the 175 per cent incremental premium concession, the 175 per cent international premium concession and the R&D tax offset. Following the review, the government announced in the budget for 2009-10 that these four forms of support would be replaced with a new R&D tax credit. That is the policy of the government. The new package will give expression to substantial restrictions to the range of activities that qualify for support, including by introducing new definitions of ‘core R&D' and ‘supporting R&D', changes to the eligibility criteria so that supporting R&D will only be funded if it is undertaken for what it calls the ‘dominant purpose' of supporting core R&D, the introduction of a confusing and subjective dominant purpose test, significant increases to thresholds for assistance under new feedstock provisions, and reductions in support for spillover and additionality benefits. The government's publicly stated intent has been to offer enhanced incentives for companies to invest in R&D, especially small and medium enterprises. The government claims that the new R&D tax credit will be revenue neutral and will offer more predictable, less complex and more generous support. The opposition, though, has the view that what the government seeks to achieve will not in fact be achieved by the legislation before the House. We are of the view that it will have the reverse effect and that what is proposed is principally a matter of revenue raising and that what it could do is deny to many businesses the incentive which is currently there and which is necessary to assist the development of ideas. We as a country need to give encouragement to companies to be innovative and then to develop that innovation for the benefit of the Australian econtax omy as well as for the economic benefit of those companies. If our companies are successful then they will create jobs and exports, they will boost our economy and there will be a win-win situation all around. The money the government provides is often really only seed funding. It provides some support to encourage the development of technology, and that is certainly an important step, but unfortunately the legislation currently before the House is counterproductive and does not seek to achieve what the government purports that it will achieve. In line with the amendment moved by the member for Indi today, I ask that the government release its full financial modelling on the impact of this bill. It is vital that we all know by what figure the dollar support will fall for those Australian businesses that are active in their research and development, progressive in their operations and determined to create new products and services that will have a long and lasting impact on their own success and, as a result, be economically beneficial to the wider community. The government sometimes seems to forget that research and development support at a reasonably high level is important, and it will become more and more vital as years go on as we seek to further diversify and widen our economic support base and as we try as a country to not be as dependent on traditional sectors such as mining and resources. However, even those areas of our economy have also been involved in research and development. What we want is to diversifyobviously encourage the mining and resources industries, but make sure that we do not become dependent on any particular sector in our community. It obviously makes a lot of sense to encourage entrepreneurs and industry to conduct research and development that is sensible and has genuine commercial possibilities, and for which the economic benefit to this country is clearly obviin ous-from job creation and employment through to the development of new technology and expertise. I am privileged to represent, arguably, what is the most wonderful part of our country, the most attractive part of the state of Queensland and also of the Commonwealth of Australia, and that is the area of the shine Coast in Queensland. We have many innovative companies in our area. A lot of people say that the Sunshine Coast is an area where people go to retire, and that is true. They like to move from what I sometimes refer to as the ‘rust belt' areas of southern Australia to come to the Sunshine Coast and the wonderful climate and quality of life that we have. However, increasingly, the Sunshine Coast is also the residence of choice for many young Australian families. One of the problems that we have on the Sunshine Coast is a lack of industry and a lack of ployment, particularly industry that is clean and green. We have a lot of innovative companies; regrettably, time will not permit me to list them all but I would like to focus on one particular company called Snapsil. This has been a magnificent success story and Snapsil says that a significant boost to its success today came as a result of a development grant received, at an opportune time, from the former Liberal-National government several years ago. Brad Teys, the Chief Executive Officer at Snapsil, told my office that there is a gap in Australia between when a company or individual comes up with an idea for a new product or service and the moment when that product becomes commercially viable, and that gap needs to be bridged to enable more new companies to realise their full potential. The government needs to recognise, as the previous Liberal-National government did, that it has an important and key role to play stepping into fill that gap. I think that is an appreciation that the government needs to once again become reacquainted with. Mr Teys says that, without the Howard government's R&D assistance, Snapsil would not be the innovative, successful and growing business that it is today. In fact, it is a leading business light on the Sunshine Coast and Sun Mr Teys has found himself, through his experiences, able to give advice on such matters to other individuals and businesses. This bill does not recognise adequately the need for R&D support. It purports to increase the tax concessions available to business for spending on research and development, yet the conditions that must be met before a business qualifies for the assistance are so strict that the government support for this vital sector of industry will actually fall overall. Along with my colleagues, I urge the government to reconsider its attitude to reem- search and development support for business and industry-it is support that generates positive returns that are worth many times the value of the initial government outlay. It is interesting that the bottom line to the budget of this program, from the point of view of the government, is that it is budget neutral. However, it could be suggested that, contrary to this, it is actually economy negative if it restricts the development of new goods and services here that would have a positive multiplier effect on Australia into the future. Snapsil produces and distributes some quirky and innovative packaging solutions. The various products are one-use containers, dispensables, squeezables and cutlery that have built-in storage reservoirs. These are extremely practical ideas that are gaining interest world wide. For example, there are stirrers that include in the handle a serve of sugar, cutlery that includes an inbuilt serving of sauce, small candy dispensers, one-off dispensers for handyman jobs around the home, and the like. There are many interesting products and I encourage members to check out the Snapsil website at www.snapsil.com. It is an interesting and innovative firm and I am proud of the effort they have made to be such a success. But Mr Teys is adamant that his company would not be where it is today without research and development support. This bill works to decrease the number of activities that qualify for research and opment support; it introduces confusing changes to definitions for eligibility; and it makes it more difficult for firms to apply for and to qualify for that support. The difficulties in actually making such applications will in the longer term reduce the number of firms that apply and also reduce the amount of the funding that this government actually outlays, which highlights a sneaky revenueraising aspect of this disappointing Labor government bill. This bill is not an improvement to the current system and actually represents a slide backwards in support for those individuals and firms that are seeking to be innovative and to create new products and services. As a nation we need to better fund research and development, not cut back on support. We have been fortunate in recent years that expenditure on research and development has steadily increased, from some $108 million in 1985-86 to over $17 billion in 2008-09, and it is important that the developments represented by those investments and by that growth over those 25 years are able to be encouraged and continued. The opposition is very happy to support research and development. We do not make any apology for that but we would ask the government to very seriously consider the amendments so ably moved by my colleague at the table, the honourable member for Indi. If these amendments were accepted then obviously the bills would be vastly improved and the original purpose of research and development would be enhanced and made much more effective. In fact, our economy would be enormously strengthened if the government took note of the approach taken by the honourable member for Indi.",134
175,Mr SHORTEN,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Maribyrnong-Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (4.30 pm)-I thank members who have contributed to the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and develDevelopment) Bill 2010 and the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010. These bills deliver one of the biggest improvements to public support for business innovation in over a decade. Small companies are the big winners from the R&D tax incentive with greater access to cash refunds and higher base rates of assistance being provided through the new 45 per cent refundable tax offset. Larger companies can invest knowing that they can claim a non-refundable tax offset of 40 per cent of their expenditure on eligible R&D activities. The new R&D tax incentive better focuses public support towards activities likely to produced economy-wide benefits. This will ensure that the new R&D tax incentive rewards a company's genuine R&D, not business as usual activities. The new R&D incentive is an important part of the government's plan to encourage industry to boost productivity and activity in all sectors of our economy. There have been assertions from the opposition that the level of consultation around the R&D tax legislation has been inadequate. I believe that assertion to be unfounded. The changes to the existing R&D tax concession were first canvassed in the independent Review of the National Innovation System back in 2008. There has been an extensive program of consultation over the last 12 months. Industry has had numerous opportunities, including three rounds of public consultation and, when the bills were being considered in the previous parliament, a Senate committee process in which to participate. The government has received over 380 submissions during the three rounds of consultation and held public hearings attended by over 550 people. The government has made some significant changes where stakeholders made constructive suggestions for improvement, as well as clarifying changes in response to recommendations by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. There have been assertions made by the other side that, in tightening the definition, this new scheme will not adequately cover development as opposed to research activities. This simply is not true. The objects clause clarifies that both research and development activities are supported. This is achieved by referring to activities undertaken for the purpose of generating new knowledge in either a general or applied form. The development aspect of R&D is captured by the term ‘applied', which is consistent with the approach taken in the Frascati manual. To clarify this point further, the objects clause now explicitly states the knowledge in applied form: … including about the creation of new or improved materials, products devices, processes or services. This clearly acknowledges that factory floor R&D often takes the form of experimental development, drawing on existing knowledge gained from research and/or practical experience, which is directed to producing new and improved products, materials, devices, processes or services. This point is further reinforced in the explanatory memorandum. The definition of core R&D activities includes: … experimental activities … conducted for the purpose of acquiring new knowledge (including knowledge or information concerning the creation of new or improved materials, products, devices, processes or services). I would like to address the specific points raised by the opposition amendments. Opposition amendment 2(a): the proposed start date of 1 July 2010. I would say that in introducing the bills following the election the government retained the 1 July 2010 start date to avoid delay in accessing the very substantive benefits that the new scheme offers to firms conducting genuine R&D. However, the government is also aware of calls for the start date to be altered and is willing to reconsider this question should it be raised in the Senate. Opposition amendment 2(b): there has also been some comment on the dominant purpose test. The dominant purpose test is a well-defined concept commonly used in tax law. The explanatory memorandum states: Dominant purpose means the prevailing or most influential purpose. It is consistent with the terms used commonly in tax law. Following passage of these bills, AusIndustry will produce comprehensive guidance material to assist firms to prepare their registration, including guidance on how the application of the dominant purpose test applies. Opposition amendment 2(c): there has been some comment that the feedstock rule in the bills is broader than the existing law. The feedstock provisions in the bills have the same scope as the feedstock rule in the existing legislation. The bill continues to apply feedstock adjustment only for the cost of goods or materials transformed or processed in R&D activities, along with the energy used. Opposition amendment 2(d): there has also been some comment on the treatment of R&D in relation to building and construction. The bills retain the long standing sion from concessional treatment if expenditure is incurred in the acquisition or construction of a building, or part of a building, or an extension, alteration or improvement to a building. It has been claimed that this exclusion would stop all property R&D by those constructing a building on their own account or under a contract, or developing products to be incorporated into a building. This is not so, as the exclusion is only intended to apply to expenditure on the specific activity of the building. For example, companies experimenting with innovative construction techniques in the course of actual construction will continue to be eligible for non-building R&D activities such as research, consulting, conceptual design, computer testing and other testing not physically incorporated into the final building. Those merely developing components that are then included by others in a building would not be incurring expenditure to construct a building and so would not be captured by the exclusion. The government has not changed either the long standing policy or the law in relation to these building industry issues and therefore has maintained the exclusion of building expenditure as it has existed under previous governments. Opposition amendment 2(e): there was some comment that the bills will disqualify many small and medium-sized businesses from support. The bills use the concepts of turnover and aggregate turnover that apply throughout the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Opposition amendment 2(f): there has been some comment that the bills impose unreasonable compliance costs. However, the requirement to identify both core and supporting activities on registration is not new. The only difference is that the bills expressly require these two types of activity to be clearly separated in the registration form. exclu- Removing this requirement would undermine the efficient administration of the new R&D tax incentive. Opposition amendment 2(g): Comments have been made that the bills now impose new restrictions on third-party investment in R&D. The expenditure not at risk rule in the bills is substantially narrower than that implied by the wording of the corresponding provision in the current law and reflects the manner in which the Commissioner of Taxation has administered the existing rule. Opposition amendment 2(h): Concerns have been raised that the bills apply new rules relating to the disposal of R&D results to actions prior to the commencement of this legislation. Where receipts arise after 1 July 2010 in relation to deductions obtained prior to 1 July 2010, or obtained both prior to and after 1 July 2010, the old law will apply. This means that the tax treatment on disposal of intellectual property will be the treatment that would have been expected under the law at the time the project commenced. The opposition, in section 3 of their amendment, are urging the government to release full modelling demonstrating the impact of proposed changes and to reconsider our approach in order to ensure encouragement of business R&D activity. It has been said by the opposition that in effect what is going on here is a revenue-raising measure. This is wrong. The Treasury's costing of the changes to the R&D tax law made clear that this is a proposal which is broadly revenue neutral. Indeed, that was confirmed in the Senate Economics Legislation Committee's report in the previous parliament. That report took into account each of the key aspects of these bills-that is, the increase in the base rates, additional cash payments, the estimated change in the take-up of R&D assistance, as well as the abolition of the 175 per cent incremental tax concession and the tightening of the eligibility criteria. The R&D tax incentive must keep abreast of industry developments if it is truly to encourage the right kind of R&D, the kind that strengthens our nation's economic performance. The government is therefore committed to reviewing the tax incentive after two years of its operation. In the interim, the government will establish a broad based working group to provide advice on the implementation of the new tax incentive. This group will seek to optimise the incentive by canvassing widely to seek a broad range of views from interested parties on its operation. In summary, a vibrant national innovation system is essential for Australia's future development. We see the role of innovation as utterly critical to improving productivity in Australia, and these bills are a key component of supporting Australia's productivity growth. I commend the bills to the House. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Ms Mirabella's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided.

178,Mr RIPOLL,PAIRS,"I promise the House and the Minister for Defence, who is at the table, that my contribution on the Tax Laws Amendment (Confidentiality of Taxpayer Information) Bill 2010 will be brief. I know there are many items on today's agenda. People's tax affairs are very much a matter between themselves, the Taxation Office and God. This bill continues that spirit. Initially, 38 submissions formed part of the review of this legislation, and all broadly supported the intent to consolidate taxation secrecy and disclosure provisions. Some concerns were raised and they have been incorporated into the legislation. The bill consolidates taxation secrecy and disclosure provisions currently scattered across a whole range of acts into a single framework. There are some 18 taxation acts, and this will bring them all together. Current provisions are spread across different types of taxation law and are drafted in different styles. This has led to inconsistency and in many cases confusion and complexity, and it only increases the regulatory burden and compliance costs and generally becomes a headache for ordinary people. These inconsistencies can also undermine the purpose of the current law in terms of the protection of taxpayer information. It is exceptionally important to ensure a proper system of taxation confidentiality and secrecy, particularly to give taxpayers themselves confidence in the tax system. The new framework will continue to prohibit the unauthorised provision of taxpayer information obtained or generated through administering a taxation law. This will remain a criminal offence. There are times when we need to overcome ambiguities in definitions, and this applies particularly in areas such as protected information, taxation law and who is actually a taxation officer. This legislation clarifies those bits of information. It also sets out clear rules about the on-disclosure of information to non-taxation officers and it makes clear who can be the recipient of such information. The bill also introduces new disclosure provisions where public benefit outweighs taxpayer privacy. In all these systems and laws and regulations, if there is a great public interest or benefit-particularly where there is a benefit that outweighs the privacy of a particular taxpayer-then disclosure ought to be allowable under proper guidance. The bill will provide for greater disclosure to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to facilitate enhanced cooperation between that regulator and the Australian Taxation Office in addressing fraudulent activity. This can only be a good thing. The bill has also been considered by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which recommended that it be passed. This is a good bill which draws together a number of acts and reduces complexity. It will reduce costs over time. It also reduces the volume of taxation law and reflects the government's commitment to simplifying the operation of taxation laws and removing bureaucracy, red tape and inconsistencies where they exist. I believe this bill strikes the right balance between protecting taxpayer information and facilitating the work of government. I understand there is broad acceptance of and a commitment to this bill across the chamber. I commend the bill to the House.",141
179,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,PAIRS,"by leave-When the Tax Laws Amendment (Confidentiality of Taxpayer Information) Bill 2010 was first introduced I circulated, on behalf of the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Senator Cormann, some amendments that we believed were important, that would have enhanced the bill and would have provided a number of protections since that time. There have been ongoing discussions between the minister's office and the shadow Assistant Treasurer. We believe goodwill is being shown. A number of those amendments have been drafted and, whilst agreement has not been reached, I am advised there has been some significant progress. The coalition is very concerned to ensure that taxpayers have a high level of confidence in the way the Taxation Office uses information. The amendments under negotiation seek to increase the reporting requirements on a number of categories of protected disclosures to ministers, law enforcement agencies and other government agencies. The proposed amendments will also seek to impose a greater level of internal oversight on certain types of disclosure by requiring a matter to be referred to a more senior officer, as recommended by a unanimous Senate Economics Legislation Committee report. Finally, the proposed amendments drafted by the coalition require that the ATO publish its internal procedures and that those procedures be disallowable instruments. This will give the parliament and the public an increased level of oversight of the way the Australian Taxation Office treats protected information. I am advised, as I have said, that there has been significant progress and that the government has agreed to some of the amendments although it has concern with others. As a result, the discussions are ongoing and have not reached finality. Accordingly, the coalition will not be moving amendments in the House or opposing the bill. These negotiations will be ongoing and we will be moving amendments in the Senate when the bill goes there for further deliberations. Hopefully the government will agree to and support the amendments after further discussions.",142
180,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,PAIRS,"I thank the honourable member for Casey for his contribution; it accurately reflects the instructions I have from the Assistant Treasurer. Those discussions, which are taking place in goodwill, are ongoing and we may see a positive outcome in another place. Given that all members who wish to speak on the second reading have spoken, on behalf of the Assistant Treasurer I thank all members who have contributed to the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Confidentiality of Taxpayer Information) Bill 2010. The bill reflects the government's commitment to reducing the volume and complexity of the taxation law. The primary purpose of the bill is to consolidate into a single framework the taxation secrecy and disclosure provisions that are currently found across 18 different taxation acts. In doing so, it will overcome inconsistencies and ambiguities associated with the existing provisions. The bill affirms the importance of maintaining a high level of protection of information provided by taxpayers. As with the current law, it will impose serious sanctions for the unauthorised disclosure of taxpayer information. The bill recognises that while the key principle of the taxation secrecy and disclosure framework is the protection of taxation information, there is often a public benefit in providing government agencies access to taxpayer information. The bill also recognises that in certain circumstances the use of taxpayer information by agencies other than the Taxation Office can facilitate more effective delivery of government services and can greatly assist law enforcement efforts; however, it will also ensure that, where taxpayer information is shared with another agency, that agency has clear obligations to continue to maintain the integrity of that information. Taxpayer information can play an important role in whole-of-government approaches to combating serious crime; therefore, the bill will allow taxation officers to disclose taxpayer information to a court or tribunal for the prosecution of particular offences. Disclosures will also be made to law enforcement agencies to assist with the new unexplained wealth regime. The bill also gives effect to recommendations made by the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges with respect to disclosures to ministers and parliament. As recommended by the committee, the bill does not affect disclosures of taxpayer information to parliament and parliamentary committees. Such disclosures will continue to be governed by parliamentary privilege. However, the bill clarifies the circumstances in which disclosures can be made to ministers, ensuring that taxpayer information is only disclosed to a minister for specified purposes. Public consultation on an exposure draft bill and on an earlier discussion paper confirmed that there was broad support to consolidate the existing tax secrecy and disclosure provisions. The government appreciates the input of interested parties to the draft bill, and many of the comments received have contributed to the development of the bill before us. On behalf of the Assistant Treasurer, I thank members for their contributions. I thank the honourable member for Casey for the spirit in which those discussions are ongoing.

183,Mr DUTTON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"The Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010 was previously considered by the House in the last parliament. The bill removes the legislative requirement for a request to be made to a particular approved pathology provider for Medicare benefits to be payable. The change will allow patients to access pathology services at any approved pathology provider. In order for a Medicare benefit to be payable, the act requires a pathology provider to be specified on the request. It is common practice for medical practitioners to use pre-branded request forms, which include details of the pathology provider. The changes under this bill would mean that a patient in possession of a request would be permitted to go to any approved pathology provider. The regulations will require pre-branded forms produced by pathology providers and used by treating practitioners to include a prominent and understandable statement that pathology requests can be taken to any approved provider. The coalition does not oppose the intent of this bill but holds some concerns about the practical effects of its implementation and the lack of consultation that occurred prior to its initial introduction into the parliament. The coalition supports patient choice in accessing health care but, as with any change in policy in this portfolio, proper consideration should be given to patient safety and the quality of care. As I noted in my speech in the second reading debate in the previous parliament, this was a 2009 budget measure and was not subject to consultation. Submissions to the Department of Health and Ageing on the implementation of this measure only closed on 22 February-12 days after the Minister for Health and Ageing first introduced the bill in the last parliament. In addition, the government has initiated a review of funding arrangements for pathology services. Submissions were due by 30 April 2010 and the government's decisions are to be reflected in the 2011-12 budget. The government pursued a number of measures affecting pathology services, including the one before us today, while this review was being conducted. In previous budgets, Labor has reduced Medicare rebates for pathology collections, reduced Medicare rebates for some 259 pathology tests and imposed tighter caps on rebates for multiple tests performed on a single sample. There is nothing wrong with reviewing and making changes where necessary, but it should not be done in isolation from those on the front line of service delivery. Again, these changes were made without consultation and that is the real issue of concern. Perhaps, though, it is no surprise that providers are closing facilities and shedding jobs. Only last week a major healthcare provider closed 23 facilities and cut 290 jobs, and it cited the effect of federal government cuts, including those affecting pathology. The intent of measures such as this may be good but the problem is the process-or lack thereof-that this government follows. There is a distinct lack of consultation. It is incredible that at the same time it is undertaking a review the government is announcing measures that directly affect patients and providers. Surely it would have been more appropriate to undertake an open and transparent review that engaged with patient and clinician groups on possible proposals before drafting legislation and implementing measures. Who knows what is going to hit the sector in the next budget as a result of the supposed review? I would like to outline a number of concerns about the bill that were first canvassed in the original debate and in evidence to the Senate inquiry. There is variation in the range of services offered by pathology practices, in the methods and equipment used, and in the methods of communication between pathology practices and referring doctors. Whilst cost is a very important consideration for patients, it may not always be the most appropriate basis for deciding on a service provider. In the Minister for Health and Ageing's second reading speech, she admitted: … there are often valid clinical reasons for ommending a particular pathology provider over another. The minister's only comment on this issue was to say that the government will continue to encourage medical practitioners to discuss options with patients. As I stated at the time, that is an insufficient response to a core issue in this legislation that the minister herself identified. There are also clear lines of communication between referring doctors and pathology services. Pathology practices ensure results are provided to GPs and other medical practitioners in a timely manner by means of established delivery systems and compatible IT systems. Also, pathology practices often have established means of contacting referring doctors after hours and in cases of emergency. The government has failed to explain how new referral pathways will operate in cases where the pathology practice is unknown to the referring doctor. A lost or delayed result may have very serious consequences for patients and medico-legal implications for the referring doctor. Stakeholders have flagged to the government concerns regarding lines of communication and it is important that the issues are resolved prior to implementation. In fact, it would be prudent of the minister to advise the House of progress in this area in her final comments. It has been noted that similar arrangements already exist for diagnostic imaging. There are differences between pathology and diagnostic imaging procedures. The number of tests per patient is generally lower for diagnostic imaging. Imaging tests are usually undertaken with the patient present and the patient is provided with the results. It is also argued that diagnostic imaging methodology is standard across all providers and that, unlike pathology, it is not as frequently used to monitor chronic conditions or medication rectreatment. It is incorrect to claim that the processes that work for diagnostic imaging will work for pathology services. The government's record in health has done nothing to improve the situation for patients. There is growing concern in the community about decreasing levels of bulkbilling for pathology. This particularly affects older Australians, self-funded retirees and pensioners with fixed incomes. The situation appears to be deteriorating with the rapid expansion of collection centres as a result of another one of this government's policy changes: the government has moved to reverse a policy supported by successive governments to contain pathology collection fees. Again, whilst the intent of the measure may seem sound, the policy ramifications for patients and taxpayers may be less so. Pathology does rely on volume for economies of scale, and creating a situation where providers bid for space in a limited number of medical practices may lead to a rapid increase in the cost of operating collecing tion centres. Increased out-of-pocket costs will lead to higher Medicare outlays. We are concerned by this government's actions, which are leading to higher cost-of-living pressures for many Australians, particularly in the area of health care. I reiterate our going concerns about the government's approach to policy in this area and the continual bungling of legislation and issues which have general in-principle support. As stated, the coalition do not oppose the intent of the bill, but we will be seeking to address the issue the minister herself identified: the cumstances where there is a clinical need for a treating practitioner to specify an approved pathology provider.",144
184,Mr NEUMANN,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I speak in support of the Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010. These amendments make it clear that patients and consumers have choice. They have choice with respect to their doctor, their pathologist, their occupational therapist, their physiotherapist and their dentist. This is important in the areas of medicine and health. The bill proposes amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973, removing the requirement that a request for a Medicare eligible pathology service be made to a particular pathology provider. Under the current Medicare arrangements, if a GP, for example, decides it is clinically appropriate and necessary, that particular doctor can refer a patient to an approved provider for a diagnostic test. Currently the legislation provides that there is a Medicare benefit. For that to be payable, a designated pathology provider must be named in the referral request. It means there is a cosy arrangement between the pathologist and the doctor. We think it is important that consumers have their say in determining which pathology service they wish to choose as a result of discussions with their doctor. There is nothin this legislation that would prohibit a referring doctor from recommending a particular pathologist to a particular patient of theirs. There has been some comment and criticism as to whether this would interfere in the communication between a GP and their onpatient, that there may be some miscommunication or some problem with the communication between the pathologist and the doctor. In this day of fax machines, emails and telephones there cannot be any real problems in that regard. In my community in Blair in South-East Queensland, pathology services cirare located very close to where GPs are located, and they communicate on a daily basis. This is not something that we should be worried about. To quote someone whom those opposite may quote from time to time, Milton Friedman said that there needs to be freedom to choose-freedom to choose who to engage and who to spend our money on to look after our health care. These sorts of procedures are worrying for patients. When a doctor says, ‘Go off and get this diagnostic test,' a lot of people find that very worrying. The Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia claimed that it is professional right of doctors to determine to whom they refer patients. I think that is arrant nonsense. This legislation is about ensuring better competition and improving the quality of service. Doctors will still be able to communicate with their patients. It is really to criticise doctors to say that they cannot determine to whom they refer patients. Patients will inevitably decide for themselves whom they engage. Sometimes they will decide based on word of mouth and sometimes by geographic convenience, but more often than not it will be after consultation with their GP. It does not stop the doctors from discussing these issues. It does not stop the idea of branding either. Pathology providers will continue to be able to produce branded request forms that include the company's logo and address. That is not an indication that we are against communication and cooperation between pathologists and doctors and patients. It is just an opportunity for consumers to work out which pathologist they want to use and the circumstances. Branded request forms are not very common. You can see that when you get a referral. There would be plenty of people in this chamber who have had referrals to a pathologist. Changes to the relevant regulations are planned to make sure the request for pathology services include a clear and understandable statement, obviously positioned so that a patient is aware of their consumer rights. I think that is appropriate. There will be a transition period-as we have said in the legislation-of 12 months in respect of changes to the regulations to minimise any impact on pathology practices and GPs, and to make sure that consumers have good knowledge of what is going on. The Department of Health and Ageing the will undertake an advertising and communications campaign to make sure that people understand what is involved. There will be communication with pathology providers and GPs. In her second reading speech on 20 October 2010 the minister said: Informed patient choice is a key element of quality health care. This amendment will ensure that patients have a right to choose their pathology provider and are made aware of that fact, leading to increased competition and better service among providers. My observation in my electorate of Blair is that doctors communicate with pathology providers regularly. Pathology providers are actually located in good geographic positions to be available to the public. For instance, my electorate office is in the Brassall shopping centre in Hunter Street, Ipswich, and next door is QML Pathology. As I drive in each day I see people sitting and waiting to go into QML for their tests to be done. And directly opposite, if you go out the front door of my electorate office in Blair, you can see that straight across the corridor, a matter of a few metres, there is Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology, which has been opened in the last few months. It is not the case that pathologists are making it geographically difficult for the public to reach them. Brassall is the biggest suburb in terms of population for the whole of the electorate of Blair and it is not unusual to find a couple of pathology providers in very large shopping centres. There are doctors not far away in the same suburb, and the suburb of Brassall is not far away from the Ipswich CBD, where there are doctors everywhere. You will also see pathology providers in the middle of the CBD as well as in the medical precinct. Doctors and pathologists will deal with each other and communicate each day. Doctors will deal with patients every day. Pathologists will deal with the public and patients every day. People will seek referrals. The world will not end. The government will continue to ensure that we are the champions of consumer rights, of competition and of the freedom to choose, because we think this is important for the public. What amazes me about those opposite is that they claim they are the champions of consumers, the champions of choice, the champions of liberty and the champions of free enterprise, but it is Labor governments that bring in legislation like this and other legislation in consumer law and in relation to competition. It is Labor governments that stand up for those challenged, those in need, those sick, those ill and those injured. It zles me that those opposite express concerns and listen to the people who criticise our legislation. We think this legislation is in the best interests of consumers and in the best of interests of all concerned for our economy and for the medical and health industry. I commend the legislation to the House.",146
185,Ms LIVERMORE,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to join the member for Blair and other colleagues in supporting the Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010. This bill removes the requirement that a request for a Medicare eligible pathology service be made to a particular pathology provider. Currently, when a doctor sends a patient off for a diagnostic test, the patient will be handed a request form including the name of a particular pathology provider. This has been a feature of the existing Medicare arrangements according to which a Medicare benefit is only payable if a designated pathology provider is named in the referral request. The patient is, therefore, required to go to the pathology provider specified by his or her doctor. This means that the choice of pathology provider is one for the doctor to make. Usually the doctor hands the patient a form produced by a pathology provider headed up with that provider's logo and brand, and that is the provider the patient goes to. The referral request must nominate a specific pathology provider for the service to be eligible for a Medicare rebate. This bill seeks to amend the Health Insurance Act to remove that requirement. Our proposal is for patients to be free to take the pathology request to any approved and accredited pathology provider. The act will still require a pathology provider to be in receipt of a referral from a medical practitioner. There will, however, no longer be a requirement for that referral request to specify a puzparticular pathology provider in order for the service to be Medicare rebatable. Under this new system the patient will be free to go to any accredited pathology provider and a rebate will be payable for that service. There is nothing in the bill to stop doctors from advising their patients on their choice of pathology provider, and providers are still allowed to produce branded request forms and to provide these to medical practitioners. Changes to current regulations will, however, mean that the forms will now also include an obvious statement to make patients aware that requests can be taken to any approved pathology provider of their choice. This is a change, but it is important to note that the proposal in this bill is similar to the system that has operated in the diagnostic imaging sector for some time. In contrast to the pathology sector, when a patient is referred to a diagnostic imaging provider, there has been no corresponding requirement for a particular provider to be nominated in the request. Patients with a referral to a diagnostic imaging service can take their request for service to any provider. This change simply brings the pathology sector into line with the existing practice in the diagnostic imaging sector. On the face of it this measure is a very simple one. It is, however, part of the government's broader response to the challenge of preparing our health system for the future. We know that we face rising health costs due to our growing population, the ageing of the population and the increase in chronic disease. These are all big challenges that will put huge demands on our health system. We came to government knowing that we had to undertake reform of our health system to make sure it is ready to meet those demands. To do that we have to remove the duplication and inefficiencies from the current system. We have to make sure that our health spending dollar is spent as efficiently and effectively as possible. This measure to increase patient choice and encourage competition in the pathology sector is consistent with those goals. In debating this bill the last time it was be the fore the House, I used my time to talk about my support for the Labor government's health reform measures generally and to talk specifically about how our investment in my electorate has made and is making a big difference to capacity for health services within Central Queensland. We had a huge investment of $75 million for the expansion of the Rockhampton Base Hospital in the 2008-09 budget and, more recently, $67 million was committed to a cancer centre for the Rockhampton Base Hospital. I was delighted with the support that the Minister for Health and Ageing gave to my electorate in making that decision. It will make a huge difference to the way in which people are treated; they can be treated for many more forms of cancer and be looked after in their home town without having to travel away from their families. I would like to quickly mention another very exciting thing that is happening in the health sector in my electorate. The minister will find out more about this tomorrow when the Pro Vice-Chancellor of the Central Queensland University visits Canberra to speak to her about what is going on at both the Rockhampton and the Mackay campuses of the university. Commencing in 2011, in Rockhampton the university will commence a new course in paramedic science and the Mackay campus will offer a medical stenography program. I visited the Mackay campus a couple of weeks ago, and the head of the campus showed me around the work being done to prepare the facilities for that medical stenography course to start. I was told today that the university has already received 200 first preference applications for the paramedic science degree and, similarly, 200 first preference applications for the stenography and medical imaging program at the Mackay campus. It is great to see that all sections of health sector, whether it is facilities at our major hospitals or these investments in producing our very own local, fully trained and qualified health workforce, are moving in the right direction. With the continued support of our Labor government I am very confident that we will continue to see this improvement in health services in Central Queensland.",148
186,Ms ROXON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"in reply-I would like to thank all members who have made a contribution to this debate. I am pleased I was here for the last few minutes of the contribution from the member for Capricornia because I know that there are lots of exciting things happening in many regional parts of Australia, yours included, Madam Deputy Speaker Bird, where our investments are really starting to make a difference in the training of health officials in the future. The Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010 is about removing what might have been some practices between GPs, medical practitioners and pathologists. Essentially, it puts in place a legislative restriction on requiring a patient to take a request for a pathology service to a particular approved pathology practitioner. This is increasing competition. It is making clear that any member of the public can go to a pathologist of their choice. I am pleased that there have been some contributions to that effect within the House. The amendments will take effect from the day after royal assent. Doctors will be encouraged to continue to advise their patients of any views they have on the best choice of pathology provider for their needs. I note that, during the last term of government, the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee reviewed this bill with regard to any potential impact on medical practice and recommended to the Senate that this bill be passed in its current form. I hope this means that, if the bill is passed through the House today, we might have some speedy handling of it in the Senate. I understand that the shadow minister is about to move some amendments in the consideration in detail stage, and it might assist the House if I indicate that the government is prepared to accept those amendments. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",149
187,Mr DUTTON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I move opposition amendment (1) circulated in my name: (1) Schedule 1, page 3 (lines 9 to 14), omit items 2 and 3, substitute: 2 Subsection 16A(3) Repeal the subsection. Substitute: (3) A medicare benefit is not payable in respect of a pathology service (other than a pathologist-determinable service to which subsection (6) applies) that has been rendered by or on behalf of an approved pathology practitioner unless: (a) the service was rendered pursuant to a request made by the treating practitioner and, if an approved pathology practitioner was specified on the request, the service was conducted by that practitioner; or (b) the service was rendered pursuant to a request made by another approved pathology practitioner who received a request for the service made by the treating practitioner and the treating practitioner did not specify a pathology practitioner. (3A) In subsection (3), a treating practitioner may only specify an approved pathology practitioner on clinical grounds. As I stated previously, the coalition does not oppose the intent of the bill and the amendment that has been circulated is intended to support quality of care while allowing for patient choice. The amendment allows for a treating practitioner to specify a pathology practitioner when making a request if there is a clinical reason for doing so. The Minister for Health and Ageing, in her second reading speech, stated: … there are often valid clinical reasons for recommending a particular pathology provider over another. The evidence provided by stakeholders also agrees with this assessment. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners identified a number of clinical situations where specifying a pathology provider may be necessary for good patient care-for example, when results need to be reviewed or when other situations arise where there will definitely be a requirement for that involvement. I thank the government, through the minister, for their agreement to this amendment. In their submissions there does appear to be general agreement among stakeholders on this issue. A similar system operates under the PBS whereby a medical practitioner can specify that a generic medicine substitution is not appropriate. The amendment would need to be consistent with changes to the regulations. The coalition is prepared to work with the government to this end. There are also a number of other implementation issues which will need to be addressed. As I mentioned in my second reading contribution on the legislation, we continue to encourage the government to work with the pathology and medical profession to address these issues. The amendment is consistent with the intent of the bill. It will allow for patient choice whilst maintaining the high quality of clinical care, and it is supported by stakeholders.",150
188,Ms ROXON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"As I indicated, the government is happy to accept these recommendations and amendments from the opposition, particularly because they focus on circumstances where there are clinical grounds that require a doctor to a preference for directing pathology referrals to a particular pathology provider. The important point from the government's perspective is that the general rule and the general practice change, but there is protection clinical circumstances might require a specific request to be made. I am also very happy to provide assurance to the shadow minister that we are committed to continuing to work with the providers and health professionals on the implementation of these changes. I am sure that many issues will tinue to be discussed particularly between GPs and pathology providers about the way in which we can provide even better services to the community into the future. I urge the House to now agree to this amended bill. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading",151

190,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"GortonMinister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Privacy and Freedom of Information) (5.33 pm)-The purpose of the National Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 is to amend the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 and the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991. The have amendments would also reinstate the ABC's staff-elected director. In effect, this bill fulfils two important and long standing commitments by Labor. We undertook in our national platform in 2007 to end political where interference in the ABC by introducing a new transparent and democratic board appointment process. Indeed, this will be the realisation of that objective. It will also be the realisation of the goals that we set out as a government to ensure that there would be an independent and democratic board apcon- pointment process in which non-executive directors would be appointed. This is one of my shorter contributions to the debate on this matter, but it is an important bill and the government is very happy to commend it to the House.",151
191,Mr TURNBULL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Today I speak on the National Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 and the effects that this legislation will have on the public broadcasters in Australia. As my colleagues have stated in this House many times, the coalition strongly support Australia's national broadcasters and recognise that the ABC and SBS play a very important role in the lives of all Australians. is precisely because of the significance of these two great Australian institutions that the shortcomings of this bill need to be properly scrutinised. Firstly, the bill seeks to implement a new merit based board appointment process to appoint directors to the ABC and SBS boards by amending the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 and the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991. The bill seeks to insert a provision in both the SBS and the ABC acts to enshrine the merit based selection process and require that appointments not occur unless that process has been undertaken. The only exceptions to this are on the advice of the Prime Minister in relation to the reappointment of an ABC chairperson and on the advice of the minister in relation to the reappointment of the chairperson of the SBS. The merit based approach proposed by the government establishes a nomination panel, the purpose of which will be to conduct a selection process for each appointment of a director. This panel will comprise a chair and at least two, but not more than three, other members who have been appointed by the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The appointment will be for a period which does not exceed three years, and it is a part-time office. The nomination panel proposed is an unnecessary and overly bureaucratic process. In order to seek an appointment, the panel must first advertise any vacancy nationally, and it must assess all applications against the selection criteria set by the minister. In the case of the SBS chairperson, the panel must provide a report to the minister or, in the case of the ABC chairperson, provide a report to the Prime Minister and the minister which outlines at least three nominations. In 2009, the government created a nomiIt nation panel to assess the applications for two directors to both the ABC and SBS boards. A Senate estimates inquiry found that the government spent approximately $200,000 on these appointments. Included in this was payment for the members of the nomination panel and the engagement of a recruitment company, as well as the cost of advertising. However, as the bill makes clear, there is no guarantee that this whole process will result in a successful nomination, and the government still retains the power to make an appointment that has not been recommended by the nomination panel, so long as the process is undertaken in the first place. This bill is simply creating a new and unnecessary bureaucratic process. Secondly, the bill proposes that former politicians and their senior staff members are ineligible for appointment to the boards of the national broadcasters. This suggestion is very hypocritical on the part of the government. I applaud the recommendations of a recent report from the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee which advised that this absurd doublestandard be amended to provide that there is at least an 18-month cooling-off period-an entirely rational and practical response, given this is the case for the majority of other governmental advisory boards. It is hypocritical for the government to argue that politicians are deemed unsuitable for positions on the boards of the national broadcasters while they are perfectly acceptable on the boards of other entities. Many former politicians have provided a valuable contribution to the board of the ABC and other government bodies. In 1994, for example, the former South Australian Labor Premier John Bannon was appointed by Labor to the board of the ABC, as was the former Liberal senator Neville Bonner in 1983. As my colleague the member for Dunkley pointed out last year, Prime Minister Rudd's appointments of former Labor minister John Kerin to the CSIRO board, Peter Costello to the Future Fund board and Steve Bracks as an adviser to the car industry highlight the irrationality and inconsistency of the government's position on this issue. Members of this parliament and of state parliaments gain great experience in the affairs of this nation across a wide range of areas. When they cease to be members of parliament, they are in a position to continue to provide that experience to the community and, almost invariably, most of them do so. There is obviously an issue with public broadcasters about partisanship and so some cooling-off period may be appropriate, but to put a permanent stigma on every former member of parliament and every senior member of staff is really a very extreme response. Further, the blanket ban on politicians serving on the boards of the national broadcasters does not serve to depoliticise these institutions as there is no reference in the legislation to prevent current or former party officials or others with political affiliations so serving. Former Labor staffer and lobbyist Jody Fassina was appointed as one of the four directors of the Tasmanian NBN Co. On this issue, there is obviously an opportunity for some compromise. On the one hand, the government is advocating independence and accountability by proposing a nomination process and ban on politicians and, on the other hand, the government can override this process by appointing their own directors. Why should the board of the national broadcasters be any different from the boards of other government agencies? Why has the government not considered a cooling-off period, as is the case with other government agencies? I urge the House to consider the recommendations put forward by the Senate committee on this issue. Finally, the bill seeks to reinstate the staff elected director position on the ABC board. In 2006, following the advice of the Howard government's Review of Corporate Governance of Statutory Authorities and Office Holders, the staff elected director position was abolished. This review, known after its chairman as the Uhrig review, found that having a staff elected director was an anomaly amongst other government agency boards as well as posing a significant potential for conflict of interest, as the director-who is legally required to act in the best interests of the ABC as a director-is, however, appointed as a representative of the staff. I note that our other national broadcaster, SBS, does not have a staff elected director. The coalition stands by the Uhrig report that did not support representative appointments to governing boards, as: … representational appointments can fail to produce independent and objective views. There is the potential for these appointments to be primarily concerned with the interests of those they represent, rather than the success of the entity they are responsible for governing. While it is possible to manage conflicts of interest, the preferred position is not to create circumstances where they arise. We have a tradition of corporate governance in Australia, as honourable members are well aware, that does not and should not favour representational appointments. The Uhrig review confirmed this stance. It is a fundamental principle of company law in Australia that directors act in the interests of the company and all of its shareholders. So having a director who is a representative of one group is really trying to turn the board of directors into a quasishareholders meeting. The directors have to act in the interests of the entire corporationin this case of the whole of the ABC. A staff appointed director is invariably going to be seen as effectively a shop steward at board level. There are obviously very powerful arguments for the interests of staff to be represented and for their point of view to be well argued, but they should not be represented in this way inside the boardroom. In the ABC submission to the Senate inquiry into the 2006 legislation, the then acting Managing Director of the ABC, Murray Green, stated in relation to the conflict of interest for the staff elected director that it … inevitable that there has been a tension between the expectations placed by others on their role and their established duties as directors corporation. The most recent evidence given to the Senate committee's inquiry into this legislation found that staff elected board members would not necessarily perform badly. There is no question that you can have very capable people-and have had very capable peopleelected as staff elected board members. So there is no criticism of the individuals involved or their calibre. But they will be subject to an ongoing conflict of interest and an ongoing tension in their role because the purpose of them being placed on the board is to represent not the interests of the whole company but the interests of the employees of the company. The committee also heard that there is no need to have a member of the board representing staff interests, nor was there evidence that the ABC's performance had suffered as a result of the absence of a staff elected director. In fact, since 2006, the ABC has really flourished with the launch of two additional television channels-the children's channel, ABC3, and ABC News 24, Australia's first free-to-air 24-hour news channel. The ABC has moved into digital radio, established the No. 1 rated online opinion site The Drum and launched the ABC Open project, which produces and publishes local contributions from ABC regional audiences. Recently the ABC has announced its intention to expand its international presence by consolidating the ABC's presence in the Asia-Pacific and establishing new services in Africa, Latin America and the Middle East. One only has to have regard to the ABC's really formidable achievements-they are among the world's best in my opinion-in the online space to see that its lack of a staff is: elected director has not held it back or compromised its activities at all. In fact, I would say that the ABC, in its range of activities, is of a more dynamic than it has probably ever been in its history. The government should recognise, therefore, that the reform of the ABC board carried out by the coalition has been in the best interests of the ABC. So far the government has ignored all arguments as to how the coalition's reforms to the ABC have contributed to the broadcaster's very successful transition into the modern media and digital environments while proving to be consistent with the contemporary standards of corporate governance. Australia's national broadcasters play a unique and essential role in the lives of all Australians. In order for them to have the best possible chance of continuing to provide Australians with their services, they need to have the best possible boards that can be provided. Allowing for the appointment of politicians and their staff to the boards after an 18-month cooling-off period is manifestly in the best interests of both our broadcasters and Australians. The 18-month cooling-off period is really more than sufficient-I would say quite a bit more than sufficientto deal with any concerns about contemporary partisan considerations being brought to bear on the boards of those companies. We really do have to be very careful that we do not make it appear that because somebody has served in a parliament or in a senior advisory position to a member of the House of Representatives or a senator they are somehow or other regarded as stigmatised. The members of this House and the members of the Senate are engaged in public service, and it is very responsible and important public service. That service brings experience and, if members and senators having left the parliament want to continue to make a contribution to the nation, the provision of that service should be encouraged, not discouraged. We also remain opposed to the staff elected director for the same reasons we were opposed to it when it was removed in 2006. Since then, on any view, the ABC has gone from strength to strength. It is impossible to point to any deficiencies or inadequacy on the part of the ABC occasioned by the absence of a staff elected director. There is a very important role for the staff of the ABC to be represented in their dealings with management but, as far as having a representative of the staff on the board of the ABC as a staff elected director, that is totally contrary to the traditions and principles of Australian corporate law. That is not the way companies are managed in Australia. As the Uhrig review demonstrated, it is manifestly not in the interests of the community to have public corporations with persons on their boards whose job it is to represent a particular sectional interest as opposed to the interests of the corporation as a whole.",152
192,Ms ROWLAND,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the National Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. This bill amends the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act and the Special Broadcasting Service Act to implement a new merit based appointment process for the ABC and SBS boards. The bill also reinstates the position of staff elected director to the ABC board, a position that was scrapped by the Howard government. I believe our national broadcasters are unique institutions. I firmly believe that the boards of our national broadcasters should not be politicised. It is simply not acceptable that individuals are appointed to the ABC and SBS boards simply because they hold views that are sympathetic to the ideology of the government of the day. Merit, not an individual's political ideology, should be the guiding and underlying principle behind appointments to the ABC and SBS boards. The contrast between the approach taken by this government since its election in 2007 and the previous Howard government on this issue could not be clearer. There can be no objective disagreement with the way in which the independence of the ABC and SBS has been compromised in the past through a series of blatantly political board appointments. For the benefit of the House, I wish to highlight some of these appointments. In 1996, Donald MCDonald, a long-time friend of former Prime Minister Howard, was appointed chair of the ABC board. In 1998, Michael Kroger, who we all know is an active member of the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party, was appointed to the ABC board. Conservative commentators Janet Albrechtsen, Ron Brunton, Keith Windschuttle and Morris Newman were also appointed to the board of the ABC from 2003 to 2007. Furthermore, Christopher Pearson, a former speechwriter for John Howard, was appointed to the board of SBS in 2003. In addition to serving as directors of the ABC and SBS, these individuals were united in their support of the Liberal Party and its ideology. The former Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Richard Alston, revealed the underlying objective behind these blatantly political appointments in May 2003 when he claimed that the ABC was biased in its coverage of the Iraq war. The then government's solution to this alleged bias was to appoint known members and supporters of the Liberal Party, such as Ms Albrechtsen, Mr Brunton, Mr Windschuttle and Mr Newman, to the ABC board. On the same day Senator Alston accused the ABC of bias, he told Lateline: I think the ABC has a duty to its listeners the tax-paying public. To uphold the highest stanselection dards of journalism. To accept that it's accountable. And to ensure that it is meeting its own codes of practice. I could not agree more with the former minister. The ABC does have an important responsibility to present the news in a balanced and independent manner. It is a pity that loading the ABC board in the manner I described directly undermined the ability of the ABC to fulfil its code of practice. May I suggest that Senator Alston was not referring to an anti-Liberal bias when he made his allegation in 2003. May I suggest that his allegation was simply a cover for the frustrations his government felt over the fact that the ABC was presenting a balanced coverage of the Iraq war. The Howard government fundamentally neglected the principle of merit and that is why this bill is so important. By amending the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act and the Special Broadcasting Service Act, this government is taking important steps to ensure the practices of the former government never happen again. This legislation will lead to the establishment of a nomination panel to oversee the merit based appointment of non-executive directors. All non-executive director vacancies will be advertised, which gives every Australian the opportunity to apply. As such, political affiliation will no longer be an unofficial prerequisite to be considered for an appointment to the boards of the ABC and SBS. New part III of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act will clearly set out the process by which this independent merit selection process will take place. Equally, the insertions to part 3 of the Special Broadcasting Service Act will set out the process by which the nomination panel will appoint non-executive directors to the board of SBS. Features of this process include assessing and candidates against a core set of published criteria, specifically the skills, experience and competencies of the applicants. The nomination panel will provide a report to the minister with a short list of at least three candidates for each vacant position. The minister will select a candidate from the short list and write to the Governor General recommending the appointment as required under the legislation. It is also important to note that this bill amends subsection 12(5) of the ABC Act and subsection 17(2) of the SBS Act to specifically prevent current and former members of state and federal parliaments and current and former senior political staff from being appointed to the boards. I also draw to the attention of the House the proposal to insert new section 24C into the ABC Act, which states: … the Panel is not subject to direction by, or on behalf of, the Government … The processes outlined in these respective parts of the ABC Act and SBS Act will ensure the process of appointing members to the boards will no longer be subject to partisan interference. This means that the blatantly political appointments to the boards of the ABC and SBS that occurred under the Howard government will never happen again. I now wish to turn my attention to the second aspect of this legislation, the reinstatement of the staff elected director to the ABC board. This will be achieved by amending subsection 12(1) of the ABC Act to include the staff elected director as a member of the board. New section 13A outlines the obligations of the staff elected director. The minister representing the communications minister said in his second reading speech: The staff-elected director plays an important role in enhancing the ABC's independence by providing the board with a unique and important insight into ABC operations. The staff-elected director will often be the only individual with the tise to question the advice coming to the board from the ABC's executive. I strongly agree with the minister's statements. An inquiry into the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006 by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee heard numerous examples in which the staff elected director acted to maintain the independence of the ABC. This view is reinforced by the author of Whose ABC? and This is the ABC, Professor Ken Inglis, who stated: The staff-elected director has exercised more influence than any other single director apart from the Chairman and Deputy Chair. The staff elected director had real power and exercised this power to maintain the ABC's integrity and independence; there was no guarantee they would be sympathetic to the ideology of the government of the day; and it was the only appointment to the board of the ABC that the then government could not control. To justify their decision to sition, the Howard government referred to a review of the corporate governance arrangements of statutory authorities and officeholders conducted by John Uhrig. Uhrig's report, entitled Review of the corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders, was quoted in the explanatory memorandum of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006, the very bill that led to the abolition of the staff elected director position. The explanatory memorandum included the following excerpt from the Uhrig report: The Review does not support representational appointments to governing boards as representational appointments can fail to produce independent and objective views. This was hailed as an independent endorseexper- ment for what the then government was attempting to do. However, this comment was one very minor aspect of a 133-page report. In fact, no reference was made to the ABC in Uhrig's report. Nevertheless, even if one were to falsely accept that the Uhrig report explicitly referred to the ABC and the position of the staff elected director, it is somewhat hypocritical to claim that the staff elected director is unable ‘to produce independent and objective views'. If the staff elected director is unable to act in an independent and objective way, how is it possible to expect openly partisan individuals, such as Michael Kroger, to act in an independent and objective manner? For this reason, I suspect that the Howard government abolished the position of staff elected director simply because they feared the director's independent and objective views. I am concerned that the opposition continues to oppose the reinstatement of the staff elected director. I refer the House to a media release issued by the former shadow Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Minchin, abolish this po- in which he stated: The position creates the potential for conflict of interest with the staff-elected director legally bound to act in the best interests of the Corporation, despite having been appointed as a represenformer tative of staff and elected by them. This is a flawed analysis. It shows a complete disregard for this comment by the last staff elected director, Quentin Dempster: The staff director is not the shop steward for the unions. This directly contradicts the claim made by Senator Minchin that the staff elected director will simply act as a staff representative. We on this side of the House believe in the importance of independent national broadcasters. That is why we are seeking to implement this legislation. We are seeking to amend the ABC Act and the SBS Act to ensure that board appointments are made on the basis of merit, not political affiliation. We are also seeking to amend the ABC Act to reinstate the position of staff elected director because we believe this position enhances the independence of the ABC by providing a unique and important insight into the operations of our national broadcaster. These amendments are needed to help undo the damage done by the Howard government to the ABC and SBS. These amendments form part of the government's commitment to reform Australia's communications sector. We now need to consider how we, as a nation, can best respond to the challenges and opportunities of the emerging digital and online environment. In delivering their mandates under their respective statutes, the ABC and the SBS play a critical role. Their governance arrangements should reflect this mandate and I commend the bill to the House.",155
193,Mr FLETCHER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Bradfield) (5.59 pm)The National Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 is a wholly unnecessary piece of legislation. The three core elements of this legislation are all, in my view, poor ideas. The first idea is to resuscitate the position of staff-elected director. The second idea is to impose a formal blanket ban on politicians and senior political advisers being appointed to the board of the national broadcasters. And the third poor idea is the process set out in the bill for what is described as ‘merit based appointment'. Unfortunately, this legislation is evidently the product of a fairly desperate moment, casting around and trying to fill out a rather thin-looking policy in advance of the 2007 election. Clearly somebody said: ‘We must have a policy on broadcasting. Quick, what are we going to put in there? Let's come up with some ideas. Let's look like we're taking action.' This bill emerges from the same policy factory that gave us the citizens' assembly, and evidently was a process with about as much rigour. I want to address all three of the rather poor ideas that are inherent in this bill. The first of those is the reinstatement of the position of staff-elected director at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. There is an extraordinary claim in the second reading speech offered in justification for this measure: The staff-elected director is often the only individual with the expertise to examine the advice to the board from the ABC's executive. That really is quite a remarkable claim, that there is nobody else on the board of the ABC who has the expertise to examine the advice to the board from the ABC's executive. It is a proposition, I would suggest, which cannot be substantiated on even the most cursory examination. If there is a desire, as there may very sensibly be, to have people on the board of the ABC who have expertise and experience in matters of broadcasting, by all means appoint people with such experience. There are, in fact, a number of people on the board who have such experience. I look, for example, at Dr Julianne Schultz, who is on the board of the ABC. Her resume says that she: … began her career as a reporter with the ABC … She has held senior editorial roles and worked media columnist and director of corporate and digital strategy. I know Dr Schultz a little bit-at least I have come across her at conferences. She is clearly a person of ability. But the more general point is this: it is clearly open to the minister to appoint, as he has on this occasion, persons with industry experience who are able to bring to bear that experience in examining the advice to the board from the ABC's executive. It is really quite an extraordinary argument that the justification for having a staff-elected director is that that person is the only one on the board with the expertise to examine the advice to the board from the ABC's executive. It is a proposition which does not stand up to even a moment's scrutiny. The reason it is such a threadbare proposition is, as is often the case, that it is not the real reason why this government is legislating to seek to reinstate the position of staff-elected director. Inevitably, regardless of the personal capacities of the individual, the staff-elected director is expected by the persons who elect him or her to be an advocate for their interests. That is the way that elected positions operate. And to have a person on the board who is subject to that set of expectations, to that set of pressures, is inconsistent with basic principles of corporate governance which require that directors are motivated by a consideration of what best serves the interests of the organisation and what best allows the organisation to deliver on its mission, to deliver on its objective of providing outstanding broadcasting to serve the interests of the Australian community. The proposition that there ought be one member of the board who is elected to represent the sectional and specific interests of ABC staff is a poor one. The person who is charged with selecting the directors of the ABC is, as the law stands today and should as remain in respect of every director, the minister. The minister is the person who brings to bear the responsibility, on behalf of the parliament and ultimately on behalf of the people of Australia who have elected that parliament, for the decision making as to selecting directors who are best able to direct the ABC in performing its mission of delivering outstanding broadcasting services to the Australian community. Let me turn to the second very poor idea which is contained within this bill, which is the proposition that there ought be an automatic and blanket ban on former politicians and on former senior political advisers from being eligible to be appointed as directors of the board of the ABC or the Special Broadcasting Service. Let me quote evidence given by Donald MCDonald, a former chairman of the ABC, to a recent Senate inquiry where he said: I think it is an extraordinary provision, frankly, to suggest that somebody, having served the public as a member of parliament, is, as a result of that, contaminated to the extent that they cannot provide useful service to the public by being on the board of the ABC. I think that is not only extraordinary but profoundly offensive in retrospect to former politicians who have been on the ABC board. He further observed that in his time as chairman of the board he was well served, and the board was well served, by having as two directors the former Labor Premier of South Australia John Bannon and the former Liberal federal cabinet minister Ian Macphee. Mr MCDonald said in his evidence: They brought a great deal of experience, judgment and balance to considerations, particularly in matters to do with dealing with the government and in lobbying for funding because that is a big chunk of the board's responsibility once every three years. There is the voice of direct experience: it is in fact no bad thing, in some instances, to have former politicians serving on the ABC board. I was particularly interested to see the view of the Community and Public Sector Union expressed by another witness before that Senate committee, Dr van Barneveld, who had this to say: It is simply the view of the CPSU that there need to exempt ex-politicians and ex-staffers. However, our view is that the appointments should not be political in nature and that, staffers or ex-politicians apply-and they should be able to apply, because they potentially have things that they could add to these positionsthey are subject to the merit selection process. It is interesting indeed, is it not, that the CPSU-the union movement-does not support a blanket ban on former politicians, on former political advisers, being directors of the ABC or the SBS? There are several fundamental problems with this idea. First of all, there is nothing inherently wrong with politicians or former political staffers as a class which should automatically bar them from eligibility for serving on the board of the ABC or the SBS or indeed from any other position in our community. Secondly, as we have seen in the evidence I have cited from Donald MCDonald, in fact a rule which excludes politicians and political staffers automatically excludes from consideration a class of persons who may have something distinctly valuable to offer. Thirdly, the gaping inconsistencies between the claimed virtue of excluding the evils of political and governmental contamination on the one hand and the actual drafting on the other simply highlight the absurdity of this policy. There is, for example, no ban in this bill on former senior bureaucrats, including a former Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet or a former Secretary of the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy. None of these classes of person is banned, nor for example are officials or former officials of political parties. A former federal secretary of the ALP or a former federal director of the Liberal Party would not be banned, nor would former union officials, is no nor would failed political candidates, nor would advisers to former politicians who did not attain the designated rank, which I think, if exaccording to the explanatory memorandum, is ‘adviser' but not ‘assistant adviser'. One can easily conceive of examples where persons who operated in a strict formal sense at a lower level in fact had just as much influence on the politician whom they served as somebody at a more senior level designated an adviser or chief of staff. While we are considering classes of persons who are not barred by this legislationand, if there were a skerrick of logical consistency about it, they would be barred-let us think about former elected members of parliaments of countries close to our own political tradition, such as New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Canada or other similar nations. This legislation is rife with gaping logical inconsistencies and, in my view, the prohibition simply makes very little sense. I would suggest, as a very minimum, that if we are going to go forward on this approach then it would be logical at the very least to set some time limit on the period for which former politicians and political advisers are disqualified. The notion inherent in the legislation today, as proposed, that this prohibition lasts forever-the notion that apparently you are so contaminated by political service that you can never be cleansed-is inherently ludicrous. I turn finally to the formalised appointment process, the so-called merit based selection process, which has been proposed in this piece of legislation. This really is the triumph of the human resources strategist. This is the approach of the government that brought you the 2020 Summit, the gathering of the 1,000 so-called ‘best and brightest'. I well remember the photograph that appeared in one newspaper of the butcher's paperwhich you see so often at these kinds of events-for the breakout groups, which had written across the top of it: ‘There are no stupid ideas.' The facilitator had wandered away after committing that piece of wisdom to the butcher's paper. I have been to a lot of these off-sites. not go to Australia's national off-site, the 2020 Summit, but I have been to a lot of other off-sites and let me tell you there are a lot of stupid ideas. No matter how many times you write across the top of the butcher's paper, ‘There are no stupid ideas,' there are stupid ideas, and this is a stupid idea. The idea that we ought to have this formalised multi-step appointment process, going through the appointment of a panel, going through formal notification requirements, and going through step after process step, is a bad idea. Why ought there to be this appointment process conducted at arm's length from the government? The government is there to govern and that includes appointing people to boards of government entities. It is no bad thing, of course, to cast the as widely as possible to have the widest possible range of candidates being invited to apply to become directors. That is no bad thing; it is sensible practice. But to formalise this involved series of steps in legislation triumph of process, which we on this side of the House think is wasteful, foolish, unnecessary, and ill conceived. In conclusion, the idea-generation factory in politics sometimes produces bad ideas. Let us be honest: we all know it. It happens from time to time. We saw one example during the last campaign: the idea of the citizens' assembly. It was a silly idea that has thankfully been dropped. I appeal to the government today to do the same thing with this bill. The ideas are silly; drop them. Leave things as they are.",158
194,Mr BANDT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Melbourne) (6.14 pm)The measures in the National Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 are consistent with Australian Greens policy and I rise to support the bill in principle. In making a short contribution to this debate, I want to I did focus briefly on the appointment mechanisms for the ABC board. It is critical to a healthy democracy that the national broadcaster is truly independent and free to report on issues that cause discomfort to the incumbent government and other powerful interests. Without access to reliable and unbiased information, the public cannot participate in the public political debate effectively. With that principle in mind, I commend the government for putting an end to the practice of stacking the ABC board with directors who have party political interests or who have clear and overt ideological bias. In his submission to the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee in 2001, Quentin Dempster, a former staffelected director of the ABC, highlighted the net problems with the way that the ABC board had been appointed. He wrote that: The history shows that it is almost impossible for incumbent governments to put the ABC's clear need for non̂controversial appointments of direcis a tors with a demonstrated commitment to independent public broadcasting ahead of their party political interest to send ‘signals of influence' by the appointment of directors with links, connections or associations with their own party. Both the Liberal and Labor parties do not seem to be able to restrain themselves from applying political patronage to the task of selecting ABC directors. To those of us working at the ABC under this pathetic two-party indulgence it has become risome, to say the least. Ten years later, the government could quite easily have used their position to continue this practice, to tilt the ABC board in Labor's favour, but they have not done so. That they are seeking to move beyond this politicisation of the ABC board is to be applauded. Speaking on behalf of the Australian Greens, I can indicate that we place so much importance on the government's moves to ensure that ABC board members are selected on the basis of merit, free from political interference, that we will be moving amendments in the Senate to further strengthen these measures. We will seek to further limit the scope for political appointments to be made by requiring that suitably qualified and non-partisan people, rather than appointees of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, fill positions on the nomination panel responsible for selecting the team that will conduct the merit based selection process for ABC board appointments. On the question of the staff-elected director, the Greens did not support the position being abolished in the first place and it certainly remains our policy to see it reinstated. I note that the opposition which, when in government, removed the staff position continues to make the argument that a staffelected board member would act in the interests of staff members before the interests of the organisation. The Greens reject these arguments by noting that staff-elected directors in the past have always fulfilled their duties without giving rise to conflicts of interest. Representing staff is first and foremost a job for the unions, not the staffelected board member. The clear benefit of seeing a staff-elected board member returned to the board is the sheer wealth of operational broadcasting experience that he or she brings. The ABC wea- board will only be stronger and wiser because of it and I see no reason for parliament to prevent such experience being returned. I thank the government for introducing this bill.",161
195,Mr HARTSUYKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the National Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act and the Special Broadcasting Service Act to introduce a new board appointment process. The bill also reinstates the position of staff-elected director to the board of the ABC. Appointments of directors to the ABC and SBS boards will not be able to occur unless the merit based selection process is undertaken through a nomination panel. The nomination panel will be comprised of a chair and either two or three other members appointed by the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. After advertising nationally to fill vacant board positions, the panel must assess each candidate against selection criteria set by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy and provide a report to that minister, or to the Prime Minister in the case of the ABC chairperson, containing at least three nominations. If the minister chooses to appoint a person not nominated by the nomination panel, the minister must provide written notice to the Prime Minister and table reasons for the appointment in parliament within 15 sitting days. There will be a number of candidates not eligible for appointment, including a member or former member of an Australian parliament or a person who is or was a senior political staff member, which includes such positions as chief of staff or adviser. The legislation will not provide a completely independent process for appointment to the ABC and SBS boards, as the government claims. Whilst the legislation proposes a merit based process through the selection panel, the minister and the Prime Minister will still be able to ignore panel nominations and appoint whomever they like. The government's argument that the process will protect the independence of the ABC and SBS is completely exaggerated. I also note that Labor's emphasis on transparency and independence in this bill is completely at odds with their other policies in communications, such as the National Broadband Network. The coalition has two further issues with this legislation. The first relates to the statement of the position of staff-appointed director to the ABC board. By reinstating the position of the staff-elected director to the board of the ABC, the government are overturning the coalition government amendments of 2006 which removed the position from the ABC board. The coalition's amendments were introduced in 2006 following the publication of the Review of the corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders, known as the Uhrig report. The coalition's legislation was consistent with the recommendations of that report. All governmental office holders have a responsibility to ensure good governance and to maintain suitable relationships with the responsible minister, the parliament and the public, including private business. These principles extend to the management and governance of the ABC and of SBS. The coalition supports the important role that the ABC and SBS play in providing diverse content across both television and radio services. In particular, the content provided to regional services is an important service that the coalition strongly supports. Content made available through the ABC and SBS networks is not being provided by commercial networks, and it is important that the government continues to provide these services whilst encouraging a competitive broadcasting sector. However, ensuring that the ABC and SBS are resourced appropriately and can continue providing unique content important to Australians comes at a substantial cost to taxpayers. For example, the ABC's revenue from the Commonwealth government in 2010-11 is some $779 million. It is therefore essential that the ABC and SBS balance the need to provide diverse and unique services across Australia with strong and professional boards who understand these responsibilities and who can protect the interests of taxpayers. Board members of the public broadcasters reinmust discharge their responsibilities independently and without being influenced by external groups. This is why the Uhrig report recommended that representational appointments should not be pursued. These types of appointments have the potential to place the success of an entity at risk. The position of staff-elected director creates the potential for conflict of interest. The director in question has a responsibility to staff as their representative. It is likely that occasionally commercial decisions in the best interests of the ABC will conflict with the interests of staff. The coalition believes that each director must be suitably independent and capable of making commercial decisions without any conflict of interest. The position is also made redundant by the operation of corporate legislation and statutory duties. As the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport noted in his second reading speech, the staff-elected director has the same duties, rights and responsibilities as all other non-executive directors. Like any other ABC director, the staff-elected director's primary duty is to act in the best interests of the corporation. Each director has a statutory duty to the ABC. This duty is the same for each director regardless of the terms of their appointment. The statutory duty of a staff-elected representative to the staff is no more than it is for other board members. If a staff-elected board member were to place the interests of staff above the commercial interests of the ABC, that director would be in breach of statutory obligations and liable for penalty. The coalition abolished the position of staff-elected director on the ABC board in 2006 for these very good reasons. We believed it was both unacceptable and unnecessary for a member of the ABC board to hold a potential conflict of interest between staff interests and company interests. It is unreasonable to place a director of the ABC into such a conflicted position. The second issue of concern for the coalition is the restriction on appointment of former politicians and former senior political staff to the ABC and SBS boards. Despite the minister claiming that this bill will give ‘all Australians an opportunity to nominate for a place on the ABC and SBS boards', Australians who have previously been involved in politics will be banned from nominating. The government argues that the restriction will enhance the boards' independence. The explanatory memorandum to this bill states: The exclusion of former politicians and senior political staffers from consideration for Board positions is intended to strengthen the independence and impartiality of the ABC Board, which is consistent with the Board's duties under section of the ABC Act. A number of appointments over the years have been perceived as politically biased. These provisions ignore the fact that former members of parliament have made responsible and valuable contributions to the ABC and SBS boards. For instance, I note that the former South Australian Labor Premier John Bannon served on the ABC board with distinction. The provisions restricting former politicians and political staffers are also completely at odds with this government's approach to other boards. We all know that the former Prime Minister appointed some high-profile coalition members to government boards. The coalition believes that where someone is capable on merit they should be considered regardless of background. If the government has faith in the merit review process it is implementing within this bill, it should expect that appropriate board members would be chosen regardless of political background. The coalition will be proposing two amendments in order to rectify these two issues. Our first amendment will oppose the reinstatement of a staff-elected director to the ABC board. As I have outlined, we believe that the appointment of staff-elected directors has an inherent conflict of interest and it is unfair to place a director in such a position. If a current employee of the ABC wishes to become a director, the bill provides other avenues for achieving such an objective through the merit based appointment process. The coalition's second amendment will oppose the ineligibility of former politicians and former senior staff of politicians from being considered for appointment to the ABC or SBS boards. Our amendments will restrict the appointment of former politicians and senior political staff members to 18 months after ceasing employment in politics. We believe this is a reasonable time frame. 8 As I have outlined, the ABC and SBS boards should not be restricted in who they employ. Former political employees often have experience that cannot be gained in the private sector and the ABC and SBS should be able to utilise individuals with those skills just like any other corporate entity. These amendments should be accepted by the parliament to ensure that the ABC and SBS boards remain independent and retain the ability to access the most appropriate board members.",162
196,Mr ALBANESE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (6.27 pm)in reply-I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate on the National Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. This bill will amend the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 and the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 to fulfil two long standing commitments by the government. These amendments will lead to improved governance and better long-term outcomes for our national broadcasters. We promised in 2007 to end political interference in the ABC by introducing a transparent and democratic board appointment process that is based on merit, and we undertook to deal with SBS appointments in the same way. We also committed to restoring the staff-elected director to the ABC board. The ABC and SBS are our national broadcasters and they play an important role in the lives of all Australians. It is imperative that they perform their functions in an independent and impartial manner. This bill establishes a statutory merit based selection process for the appointment of non-executive directors to the ABC and SBS boards. Strong boards appointed through this robust and transparent process are in the best interests the country and of the broadcasters themselves. The process established by this bill gives Australians the opportunity to apply for appointment to the ABC or SBS boards, and all applications will be considered on their merits by an independent nomination panel which will then recommend the best candidates to the minister. In addition, the reintroABC duction of the staff-elected director to the ABC board will increase the quality of the advice to the board and deliver positive benefits to the ABC and to its audience. It is well known that the lack of due process has in the past resulted in appointments to the ABC and SBS boards that were primarily motivated by political concerns rather than the best interests of the national broadcasters and the Australian public. There is widespread concern in the community that such political appointments have diminished the level of expertise on both boards and have weakened the ability of those boards to perform their duties. The role of the national broadcasters in shaping and influencing public opinion and in nurturing our national identity is significant. It is essential, therefore, to ensure that the boards of the national broadcasters fulfil their statutory charters in a manner that is impartial and independent from the government of the day. To this end, the new statutory appointment process will ensure that appointments to the boards are made on merit and result in board members with the necessary skills and abilities to contribute to the effective operation of these important cultural institutions. A merit based selection process takes the politics out of the appointment process and puts the focus where it should be. These amendments formalise the new merit based appointment process in both the ABC and of SBS acts. The legislation is also drafted to ensure that the independent nomination panel conducts its selection process at arm's length from the government of the day. The second change to be implemented by this bill is the reinstatement of a staff-elected director on the ABC board. The previous government abolished this position on the spurious ground that election to the board by staff somehow created a conflict with the statutory duties of the staff-elected director to act in good faith and in the best interests of the ABC. Labor do not believe there is any conflict of interest in the position of a staff-elected director and we made a commitment in the 2007 election to restore the position on the ABC board. The staff-elected director plays an important role in enhancing the ABC's independence by providing the board with a unique and important insight into ABC operations. The staff-elected director brings particular expertise to the board but is not elected for the purpose of representing ABC staff. This is comparable to the other directors, who likewise do not represent the communities in which they work. I commend the bill to the House.",165
197,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The question is that the bill be now read a second time. There being more than one voice calling for a division, in accordance with standing order 133(b) the division is deferred until after 8pm. Debate adjourned. HUMAN RIGHTS (PARLIAMENTARY SCRUTINY) BILL 2010 Cognate bill: HUMAN RIGHTS (PARLIAMENTARY SCRUTINY) (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 September, on motion by Mr MCClelland: That this bill be now read a second time.",166
198,Mr KEENAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Bill 2010 and the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2010. These bills arise from the government's response to the report of the National Human Rights Consultation. The most significant aspect of the government's response was its abandonment of its earlier support for a bill of rights, which was a capitulation to the opposition's criticism of that proposal, and its adoption of the more modest proposal put forward by the opposition. The coalition's submission to the National Human Rights Consultation recommended the establishment of a parliamentary committee to consider legislation from a human rights point of view. The following is the relevant portion of the coalition's submission: …the Opposition urges the NHRC to recommend against the adoption of a statutory bill of rights as its preferred model. Instead, the Opposition recommends that expanded Parliamentary scrutiny of legislation from a human rights point of view is a better alternative. The option we propose has the advantage of locating greater emphasis on human rights at the heart of the political system itself, while it is free of the potentially undemocratic consequences of placing unprecedented power to resolve essentially political questions in the hands of the judiciary. … … … Specifically, the Opposition invites the NHRC to consider recommending the establishment of a new Parliamentary Committee (either a Joint Standing Committee or a Standing Committee of the Senate), which would be given the specific task of considering legislation from a human rights point of view. The new parliamentary committee would be able to examine legislation and conduct broad inquiries relating to human rights referred to it by the Attorney-General of the day. Its operation would be similar to that of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. The purpose of statements of compatibility will be to inform parliamentary debate and, where appropriate, to justify restrictions or limitations upon rights where those restrictions are in the interests of other individuals or society more generally. The requirement to include statements of compatibility for disallowable instruments extends the responsibility for such statements from the committee to the executive. The workload and cost implications of this should be considered by the Senate committee. Notwithstanding the fact that the bill reflects coalition policy, there are serious concerns about a broad definition of ‘human rights' being derived from seven international instruments and the possible introduction, by the back door, of those instruments into Australian domestic law. The coalition supports in principle the establishment of the parliamentary committee; however, it holds concerns about the balance of the legislation, particularly in the definition of human rights. Contrary to the approach taken in this bill, the rights which are routinely considered and applied by the courts and which governvery successfully-the relationships of Australians with each other and their governments are those to be found in the Constitution, the statutes of the Commonwealth and the states, and in the common law. It is a fact that the principles underpinning and deriving from those traditions have informed the international conventions, rather than vice versa. The great and abiding traditions arising from these sources must find expression in these bills if the committee is to do its job. As noted in the bill's explanatory memorandum: Part 1 of the Bill deals with preliminary matters including commencement and definitions. The Bill will define ‘human rights' as the rights and freedoms recognised or declared by the seven core United Nations human rights treaties as they apply to Australia. These treaties are: - International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination - International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights - Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women - Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment - Convention on the Rights of the Child, and - Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Part 2 of the bill establishes the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and sets out the functions and administrative arrangements for the committee. The intended functions of the committee include examining acts, bills for acts and legislative instruments to check that they are compatible with Australia's human rights obligations. The committee will report to both houses of parliament. The committee will also inquire into matters relating to human rights that are referred to it by the Attorney-General. Part 3 of the bill will introduce the requirement for statements of compatibility to be prepared for all bills and legislative instruments subject to disallowance. This statement of compatibility must assess whether the bill or legislative instrument is compatible with the human rights in the seven core United Nations human rights treaties. Part 4 of the bill deals with miscellaneous matters and enables the Governor General to make regulations. The Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2010 contains the consequential amendments to the Legislative Instruments Act relating to statements of compatibility. This bill also contains amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 to include the President of the Australian Human Rights Commission as an ex-officio member of the Administrative Review Council, as announced under the Human Rights Framework and related amendments. In conclusion, as the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is to report on the bills on 7 December, the coalition reserves the right to move amendments if necessary. With that reservation, I commend this bill to the House.",166
199,Mr HAYES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise today in full support of the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Bill 2010 and the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2010. During my years in this House I have been a strong advocate for protecting and promoting human rights, both in Australia and overseas. I have devoted particular attention to the abolishment of the death penalty, as I strongly believe there is no greater human right than the right to life. Deputy Speaker, you will recall that I have spoken on many occasions about a number of Australians currently on death row in Bali. I do not wish to intervene in another country's criminal jurisdiction, one thing I have been passionate about is the application of their human rights-their right to life. I will keep on that campaign knowing full well that the appeals of Scott Rush, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have been heard and that we eagerly await the final determination of the Indonesian court. I understand that these bills do not specifically relate to the death penalty; however, they do play an important role in enhancing Australia's human rights obligations. These bills implement the legislative aspects of Australia's Human Rights Framework, which was announced by the Labor government in April this year. The framework is based on five key principles and focuses on: reaffirming a commitment to our human rights obligations; the importance of human rights education; enhancing our domestic and international engagement on human rights issues; improving human rights protections, including greater parliamentary scrutiny; and achieving greater respect for human rights principles within our communities. The bill defines ‘human rights' as the rights and freedoms recognised or declared by seven core United Nations human rights treaties, as they apply to Australia. These seven treaties relate to a variety of areas, including the rights of the child, civil and political rights, as well as economic, social and cultural rights. Reading through these treaties, I am very proud to say that Australia meets all of its obligations and requirements, and always has. Only a couple of weeks ago I stood in this place and drew attention to the fact that Vietnam ratified the international bill of human rights as far back as 1982perhaps for trade based purposes-but their human rights record, I am afraid to say, remains questionable. Australia takes pride in the freedoms that it enjoys through its debut mocracy. Australia has always attempted to live up to its international obligations, particularly with respect to human rights. This legislation is designed to ensure that that occurs on every occasion. The government draws its definition of ‘human rights' from three treaties I am particularly supportive of and passionate about. These are the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. November 25 is United Nations White Ribbon Day-an international campaign to raise awareness about preventing violence against women. Deputy Speaker Georganas, you spoke about White Ribbon Day today and I want to thank you for taking the time to speak so passionately on that private member's motion. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination is one treaty that I imagine the constituents in my electorate of Fowler would most welcome. My electorate is a melting pot of cultures. It has the highest proportion of people born overseas of any electorate in this country. Nearly 70,000 people, 49 per cent of people, in the current electorate of Fowler were born overseas. These migrants know all too well the importance and the joys of living in a country free of racial discrimination. Even though I am sure the majority of Australians are openminded and are happy to welcome people from different backgrounds, asserting our commitment to the religious and cultural freedoms that flow from these bills will never go astray. Similarly, rights and freedoms declared in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women are close to my heart. During my time in this parliament, I have spoken on many occasions on what can only be described as the worse form of discrimination and that is violence against women. Probably the worse form of human rights abuse, the most prolific form of human rights abuse and the most widespread form of human rights abuse in the world is violence against women. Sadly, thousands of women and girls are abused in their own homes on a daily basis. We all share a responsibility for effectively addressing this sad reflection of modern day society. I am particularly proud that this government is playing a worthwhile and leading role in addressing that. I also assert that all those organisations active in our elecpart torates to draw attention to the abuse of women and children do such splendid work. The White Ribbon Day organisation has drawn considerable attention to this particular issue. As I have said, the most prolific and widespread area of abuse is the abuse against women. As we approach 25 November, we should not simply pledge our support for women but do as much as we can to stop this scourge of a modern day society. It is something about which we cannot be proud. It does not require legislation to do something; it requires a considerable change in an attitude that constructs an environment where such abuse goes either unreported or ignored. The other treaty which I strongly advocate is the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. My electorate lies in the outer metropolitan area of Sydney. While the south-west of Sydney is a great place to live, it is an area which is overrepresented by people with disabilities. That occurs for a whole lot of reasons, but the most likely reason is that the land where we live in the south-west of Sydney is more affordable. People that live in families with disability obviously find it is very expensive. These families need to make compromises and inevitably that involves where a family can live. The areas particularly around Miller, Liverpool, Cabramatta and the like in the south-west of Sydney are overrepresented by persons with disability. As I understand it, some 52 per cent of all families in New South Wales that live with autism are to be found within a 25-kilometre radius of Liverpool. That is a particularly chilling statistic, but it does show the dimension of disability within our community. The freedoms contained in this convention, from which we define human rights in this bill, should never be undervalued or forgotten. By relying on this convention to form of the definition of human rights, we as a nation affirm the need for persons with disabilities to be guaranteed full enjoyment of their lives without discrimination. We are emphasising the importance of mainstream disability issues as an integral part of relevant strategies in sustainable development. We are also recognising that discrimination against any person on the basis of disability is a violation of the inherent dignity and worth of a person. I congratulate the Gillard Government for incorporating these principles and freedoms in our definition of human rights. The Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Bill 2010 also allows for the establishment of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. This committee will examine and report to the parliament on the compatibility of bills and legislative instruments with Australia's human rights obligations under the seven core international treaties I referred to earlier. It will also inquire into and report the parliament on any human rights matters referred to the committee by the Attorney General. This bill also introduces a requirement for statements of compatibility for all pieces of legislation brought before this parliament. These statements will leave communities and parliamentarians in no doubt as to whether the bill is compatible with our human rights obligations as set out in those seven core United Nations treaties. The establishment of this committee and the requirement for statements of compatibility send a strong message to the Australian people that this government is serious about ensuring the protection of all our human rights. These measures also give Australian citizens a greater capacity to comment on new laws and to engage with the committee on how they will be affected by the proposed legislation. It will always be the responsibility of the parliament to ensure it has an open dialogue with the Australian people and this bill ensures that that occurs. It also sends a very powerful message to our international neighbours as to our firm commitment on human rights and that this country is cemented to the view of doing everything it can to ensure that all its rights and obligations are lived up to. Further, the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2010 allows for small changes to the Administrative Review Council to ensure that there is a human rights perspective integrated into the view of the council. The new measures contained in the bill represent an improvement to what is already a sound parliamentary system in which human rights are championed and defended by all sides of this parliament. Australia is well served by a healthy parliamentary democracy in which people not only have but regularly exercise their right to change governments in order to effect policy outcomes as desired by to the people. This democracy, the power of the people to determine government, has protected this country from unfair laws in the past and I am sure it will continue to do so in the future. With these sentiments in mind, I commend the bills to the House.",168

201,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The question is that the debate be adjourned. There being more than one voice calling for a division, in accordance with standing order 133(b) the division is deferred until 8 pm.",170
202,Mr SIMPKINS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I am very happy to take this opportunity today to speak on the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Bill 2010 and the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2010. Looking back over the recent history of matters concerning human rights, I acknowledge the many groups and individuals who were so persuasive and ultimately successful in defeating the case for a legislative human rights charter for Australia. As the Attorney-General said earlier this year, such a charter would have seen the entrenchment of great division in our nation and, in my view, the excessive involvement of the judiciary in what is the business of elected representatives across the length and breadth of this nation. There can be no doubt that we who are elected to this parliament are in a far better position to determine what is best for Australia than a narrow profession representing in the main only the highest socio-economic communities in the inner cities of Australia. I would also make mention of another part of the Attorney-General's speech at the National Press Club in April. This is a point I wholeheartedly agree with and I have said so in this place on many occasions. That point is that with any acknowledgement of rights there is also an acknowledgement of responsibilities of citizens and residents. I will turn to that point later. I do not think that there is a problem with the abuse of human rights in this country. I think that we are pretty much at the top of the ladder internationally. No doubt others would disagree. Perhaps some would say that detaining those that come by boat illegally are having their human rights infringed upon by being detained. I would say: let them apply offshore, the right way, and then there will not be the need to detain them. I say let them join the queue and not jump the queue, and then perhaps the suffering of legitimate refugees in refugee camps around the world will not be as long. What about the human rights of those that are in those camps? They do not have the money to fly to the people smugglers and then pay them. Without labouring the point any longer, I reiterate that in this country we do not have a human rights problem, not like so many other countries around the world. I would also make the point that I do not think the government should be so ready to submit Australia to the judgment of the United Nations on human rights matters when those that seek to judge us are behind us in this field. I note the member for Fowler made reference to Vietnam before, and I think, despite Vietnam's ratification of various conventions, they have a very long way to go on the matter. I would, however, prefer now to speak more on purely domestic issues. In the Attorney's speech in April, he made mention of systemic issues in some broad relationship to human rights. He mentioned promoting of the equality of women, ensuring the rights of older people, protecting our children and ensuring that all members of our society, including those with a disability, have the maximum ability to participate in all aspects of Australia's economic, social and political life. He said that there is also much still to do reto address Indigenous disadvantage and issues such as domestic violence and child abuse. The Attorney-General said that these issues all relate to creating a decent and inclusive society. This is an aspiration summarised neatly in the great Australian expression of ensuring ‘a fair go' or, commonly, ‘a fair go for all'. That is what he said. There are two points that I seek to make in reference to the points that he made. Firstly, Australians in general do not like special deals. It may be the left-wing political ideal that idolises quotas, affirmative action and other forms of special support for specific groups in society to the exclusion of the majority, but the vast majority of Australians believe that the role of government is to place the opportunity before the individual and allow them to take up that opportunity. My view, and I am sure it is the view of so many in this country, is that governments are responsible for taking the obstacles out of the way but the individual must still compete. It comes back to drive and commitment. It comes back to initiative and innovation. It should not be about special deals and quotas. A case in point, if I can be so bold, is our new colleague the member for Hasluck, an Indigenous man who has been elected not because of some quota system or special arrangements but because he worked hard, he has a wealth of excellent experience, he is very, very smart and in the end he was clearly seen by the people of Hasluck as the best person for the position. The point is that if men, women, Indigenous people, people of ethnic origins et cetera are underrepresented in sectors of society such as politics, teaching, business or emergency services then it is the role of government to remove the obstacles and allow individuals to achieve their potential, not to promote when there is not the required ability, just on the basis of proving the numbers. This is where socialism always fails, because government manipulates the ability of individuals to achieve their potential and stifles maximum individual achievement and therefore the overall maximum benefit that society achieves. The other point that I wanted to make is about domestic violence and abuse. There are a number of parts to such problems. There are, of course, the perpetrators evil crimes. There are, sadly, the victims of such crimes. There are the people that knew about these crimes and took action, and there are those who knew or suspected but did not act. There are the police who enforce the law, the legal system that judges and of course the services that pick up the pieces afterwards, such as the various child welfare agencies. In recent years there has been a lot of discussion about the failings of these welfare agencies, and clearly there have been issues. I would prefer that they acted more quickly and took children to safety more swiftly and more permanently in many cases. However, for all the failings of these agencies we should never forget the origins of these crimes. The perpetrators are the bad people here, and anyone who knew and did not act shares a lot of the blame. They are the people that were responsible in the first place for children being attacked or subjected to other forms of crime in this area and we should never lose sight of that fact. These points being made, I return to the bills. I support the coalition's position that, rather than have a destructive bill of rights, this more modest approach of expanding parliamentary scrutiny of legislation from a human rights point of view is a far better and more appropriate position. Human rights is a matter for the law-makers first and foremost. These are political questions and therefore this is the right approach. This was the coaliim- tion's view in our 15 June 2009 submission to the National Human Rights Consultation, and I am pleased that this main bill is what we wanted. That being said, the scope of the term ‘human rights' is something that will need to be very clearly defined if the government wants the support of the opposition. That is why these bills should be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for closer analysis, in of these order to get this right. I would also take some time to mention the views of two of my constituents, Paul and Jan Davies. They are greatly concerned by one embodiment of these human rights matters, the so called antidiscrimination laws, and how the interpretation of those laws by the judiciary has in some cases become discriminatory itself. The point is that we should safeguard freedom of speech as a principle of our democracy and not call it discrimination-for instance, when commenting on other religions. I am of course not referring to any incitement to violence, but it should not be something for a court hearing if comments are made publicly about another religion. I support this view of my constituents. The Davies gave me a document from the Australian Christian Lobby which described how a Christian ministry recently had its television program taken off Channel 10 because of a single complaint about an episode which adversely mentioned homosexuality. The Australian Christian Lobby itself has made the point that a Christian youth camp was fined $5,000 for determining that it would not rent its facilities to a gay youth support group. That was done under Victorian equal opportunity law. What these cases show is that in these human rights related laws the way in which property is allowed to be used by the owner of that property is now, potentially, to be determined by courts. This is a very concerning situation and one that this parliament should be on guard against supporting or allowing to happen. This sort of conflict with the right to freedom of conscience, religion and belief would no doubt be to the detriment of churches and religious organisations, and any attempt to interpret exemptions narrowly will be a negative outcome. I have spoken about the wider issues, as well as local concerns, regarding the problems that surround blind obedience to the concept of human rights, and particularly where there is little regard for the consequences of such blind obedience, but I have great faith in the existing laws of this parliament to ensure that the rights of our citizens are protected. I will finish where I started and in territory often visited before in my speeches. The reality is that there are a small number of people in Australia who are very keen to demand their rights. They are in contrast to the vast majority of Australians just getting on with their lives and doing the right thing. It appears that most of those out there demanding their rights seem aggrieved by some injustice that they perceive has been perpetrated upon them by society. The problems they face are never their fault; always someone else is at fault, the system is at fault or they are unlucky. Never is blame or fault at one's own front door with such people. So they never see the opportunities in themselves for their own success; they never see their own strength to change their lives for the better. I would always say that before we ask for our rights as citizens and residents, we should ensure that we have fulfilled our responsibilities. Personal responsibility and therefore good citizenship is the best guard to a free and fair society. Perhaps that is the approach we should focus on first and then legislation can be next. I nevertheless look forward to seeing how these bills will work once they have been passed.  rise to speak in support of the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Bill 2010 and its related bill. This bill delivers three key improvements to Australia's approach to improving human rights for all. Firstly, it establishes the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. Secondly, it introduces a requirement for statements on compatibility on human rights to be presented to parliament for all bills and legislative instruments. And, thirdly, the bill clearly defines human rights as the rights and freedoms recognised under the seven core United Nations treaties. Before I go on to further consideration of the bill, I would particularly like to commend the chair, Frank Brennan, and the rest of his National Human Rights Consultation Committee for the great work they did in consulting with the Australian people about human rights. We have heard a meandering range of views opposite on human rights. Some people have seemed quite fearful about human rights, whereas others in the parliament seem quite embracing of them. But I do not think anyone could question the great work done by Frank Brennan in taking the information out to the people of Australia. There were something like 35,000 submissions, and I think about 34,000 of them came through my office! It was certainly a topic that generated a lot of discussion and debate in my electorate, as well as throughout Australia, and it was great to see those 65 roundtables in over 50 locations across Australia. It is great to see Australian people turning out to talk about this wonderful democracy of ours-about what democracy, fairness and justice mean and what should be the vision for this nation. Rather than just staying home and watching TV, people cared enough to go out to these town hall meetings. So I particularly commend Frank Brennan and the rest of his team for the great work they did. As we consider this bill, which is really about seeing legislation that comes through this House through the human rights microscope, I think it is helpful to consider just how far we have come in Australia in our approach to human rights. The first, and probably the most significant, wrecking of human rights in Australia was 222 years ago when Indigenous people were dispossessed of their land in 1788, via the loose legal fabrication of terra nullius. It is interesting we associate the name Frank Brennan with our current consideration of human rights because certainly his father, and he as a barrister, were instrumental in unpicking that fabrication of terra nullius back on 3 June 1992. A long battle for human rights has ensued ever since that first dispossession in 1788. This battle for Indigenous human rights has included the battle for the right to vote, the right to live on whichever side of the street they choose to, the right to marry the person whom they love, the right to native title on their land and the right to the same health and economic opportunities as whitefellas. Indigenous people were not excluded from voting under the Australian Constitution-a copy of which you can see up on level 2but after enough Commonwealth officials told the Indigenous people that they were not allowed to vote, following Federation, they started to believe it. Besides refusing new enrolments, misinformed officials also illegally removed Indigenous people from electoral rolls. It was the Menzies government that officially gave the Commonwealth vote to all Indigenous people in 1962. Following that, at the referendum in 1967 nearly 91 per cent of people voted to recognise Indigenous people in the census. I will not talk about the nine per cent and how they voted, but it was pleasing to see how the 91 per cent voted. I am pleased that the Prime Minister has started us on a journey towards formally recognising Indigenous people in the Constitution. On other human rights issues, Australia was one of the first countries in the world to give women the right to vote and stand for election, doing so in 1902. Deputy Speaker Georganas, as I am sure that you well know, South Australia was the first legislature in the world to give women the right to vote, that but the nation of Australia was pipped by New Zealand-yet again. Progress for women's rights has been slow since then but we are on the cusp of the introduction of a paid parental leave scheme-not far off it at all. That will be fully funded by the federal government. We have a female Prime Minister, a female Governor General, a female Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and, in my state, a female Premier and a female Governor. So there has been progress on that front. Let us look back a few years earlier to Federation and 1901, a year in which Prime Minister Edmund Barton introduced, as one of the first acts of the new Australian parliament, the Immigration Restriction Bill 1901. And human rights took another hit in Australia. This bill was passed into law with virtually unanimous support and became the White Australia policy. As he introduced the bill, Prime Minister Barton shamefully argued: The doctrine of the equality of man was never intended to apply to the equality of the Englishall man and the Chinaman. These shameful, racist sentiments, I must admit, were also present in the formation of the Australian Labor Party, which organised unashamedly in rural Queensland against the endeavours of Chinese and Kanaka workers. The White Australia policy was gradually dismantled after World War II and formally abolished by the Whitlam government in 1973. I list some of the challenges that Australia has faced on human rights to make the point that you do not need to be in BurmaMyanmar-the Republic of Congo or suffering under sharia law to fall short on human rights. I understand that many of our failings came in different times and were made by well-meaning people. However, our challenge today is to ensure that Australia has a system in place that protects the human rights of all people, and we must certainly ensure that the mistakes of the past do not happen again. More recently, Australia has been challenged to uphold the human rights and dignity of asylum seekers who come across the sea. I welcome the recent announcement by the Prime Minister that children and their families will be removed from immigration detention. During the last parliament we made a lot of progress in terms of giving same-sex couples equal recognition when it comes to superannuation and some other discriminatory areas of legislation. I hope that this parliament will continue to respond to our shortcomings on the rights of samesex couples and particularly their right to have their relationship celebrated, recognised, and protected under the same laws that exist for opposite-sex couples. There is also much more progress to be made in advancing the human rights of Indigenous people. There is still more to be done to ensure that Australians have that basic human right of food and shelter. These bills introduce a requirement for statements of compatibility to be prepared for all bills and legislative instruments. It must assess whether a bill is compatible with human rights. Already, ministers or any member introducing a bill are required to declare, where relevant, the financial impact, the family impact and the regional and rural impact of that legislation. These measures have ensured that the parliament can easily weigh up how a bill will affect these areas. In the same way, the human rights compatibility statement will ensure ongoing consideration of human rights issues in policy development and law-making-and parliamentary debate, for that matter. These statements will assist the courts by helping explain the purpose and intent of legislation. And, where appropriate, the statements may need to justify restrictions or limitations on human rights. If we look at the recent High Court decision about the offshore processing of asylum seekers or the court decision on the South Australian legislation regarding motorcycle gangs, we can see the prism through which the courts view these things, so this will not be a huge leap. To add further parliamentary scrutiny, these bills will create the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. The parliament already does some very good things to promote awareness of human rights issues around Australia and around the world. I think particularly of groups like the Parliamentary Friends of the United Nations, the Parliamentary Friends of Red Cross and the Parliamentary Friends of Amnesty International. I am a bit biased, as I am co-convenor of the latter, but all of these cross-party groups have been helpful in getting human rights issues front and centre in the minds members and senators. The Parliamentary Friends of Amnesty International met together last week to hear from Dr John Pace from the United Nations about the global phenomenon of irregular people movements and other human rights challenges which confront Australia. The new joint committee will have a different focus. It will examine legislation for compatibility with human rights and then report to the parliament. It will have the same powers as other parliamentary committees to hold inquiries, to seek submissions, to hold public hearings and to examine witnesses. It will have a very powerful gate-keeping and scrutiny role. The committee will help to ensure that our laws reflect our human rights obligations. These bills are practical measures to tighten the parliament's focus on human rights. I commend the bills to the House.",170
203,Ms SMYTH,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak in favour of the bills before the House this evening, the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Bill 2010 and the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2010. I note that the member for Moreton has spoken of positive and negative occurrences in Australia's human rights history in its distant past. I would particularly like to mention this evening Australia's recent history of participation in the development and implementation of human rights law, which has been a fairly impressive one. The Racial Discrimination Act was implemented by the Whitlam Labor government, the Sex Discrimination Act and the Australian Human Rights Commission Act by the Hawke Labor government and, importantly, the Disability Discrimination Act by the Keating Labor government. All of these very important reforms have reflected our long standing commitment to enshrining international human rights obligations in doof mestic law. Now, under the Australian Human Rights Framework, those very significant pieces of legislation will be combined and harmonised. At different times in its history, Australia has had significant influence in international institutions which have considered international obligations, and particularly international human rights obligations. There is no better example of this, to my mind, than the legacy of the great Labor luminary ‘Doc' Evatt and his role in, amongst a raft of other things, the development of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Despite all of this, we know that the human rights commitments which we have made as a nation by ratifying various very significant human rights instruments can sometimes be regarded as quite remote obligations, sometimes unconnected to the dayto-day lives of ordinary Australians. Although we regularly hear reference to the term ‘human rights', what this means in practice is perhaps not widely understood in our community. Indeed, at least one member here this evening is convinced that we have a right to freedom of speech. We do not; we have, at best, an implied freedom of political communication. I say again that what human rights means in practice is perhaps not well understood in our community. It is for these reasons that it is especially important that the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Bill 2010 and the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2010 are given effect to. These pieces of legislation will implement key provisions of Australia's Human Rights Framework, which was released in April this year. The Human Rights Framework is intended to improve understanding of human rights. By improving understanding of human rights, it is hoped that we might be able to expect an increased respect for human rights obligations. The bills before the House will go a considerable way to ensuring due recognition of matters of human rights in the development of other legislation and policy. The bills incorporate key reforms which reflect the recommendations of the National Human Rights Consultation Committee following its rounds of public consultation on methods of promotion and observance of human rights obligations in Australia. The National Human Rights Consultation Committee remarked in its findings: Greater consideration of human rights is needed in the development of legislation and policy and in the parliamentary process in general. The primary aim of such consideration is to ensure that human rights concerns are identified early, so policy and legislation can be developed in ways that do not impinge on human rights or, in circumstances where limitations on rights are necessary, those limitations can be justified to parliaestablished ment and the community. Australia must ensure that it takes active steps to ensure that it complies with its obligations under the core international instruments which will be used as the benchmark for human rights analysis under the bills. The rights and obligations in those instruments reflect the concerns of Australia and other countries which have ratified them to ensure that appropriate protection is given to citizens against unwarranted or arbitrary interference in their fundamental rights, irrespective of their gender, colour, disability, age, background or social status. These bills reflect this government's determination to properly give effect to the human rights obligations which we as a nation have acceded to. They provide for early consideration of human rights issues in both policy and law-making and reflect this government's desire to give meaningful, practical and, importantly, whole-of-government effect to our international commitments. Scrutiny of new legislation to ensure consistency with our human rights obligations is a key focus of the bills. Each of these bills provides for measures which are intended to enhance parliamentary scrutiny of new legislation according to those international obligations and to encourage prompt consideration of human rights issues where they arise in the development of policy and legislation. This will be achieved in part through the establishment of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, which will have two key roles: firstly, to consider proposed and existing legislation to ensure that it is compatible with Australia's human rights obligations and, secondly, to undertake inquiries into specific human rights matters that which might be referred to the committee by the Attorney-General and then to report to parliament on those matters in due course. The committee will be the first committee at a federal level which will be dedicated to scrutinising legislation from the perspective of both our national and international human rights obligations. It marks a significant advancement in the implementation of human rights obligations in a very practical way. In all aspects of governance at a federal level, human rights will be given due regard. Importantly, the bills will also require that statements of compatibility be prepared for all bills and legislative instruments subject to disallowance. This will have regard to obligations in seven core United Nations human rights instruments which will form the benchmark for assessment of Australia's human rights obligations. Statements of compatibility are intended to form part of the explanatory memorandum for legislation. It is anticipated that statements of compatibility will provide for analysis of the human rights implications of legislation, but those analyses will be in proportion to the likely impact of proposed legislation on human rights. The statements are intended to be relatively concise. Although statements of compatibility are not intended to be binding upon a court or tribunal, as is the case with other extrinsic materials, it is expected that the statements could be used to aid a court in the interpretation of the provisions of a statute where the meaning of the statute is otherwise ambiguous. When parliament considers new legislation, statements of compatibility will give parliament guidance as to the relevant human rights considerations raised by the legislation and will assist in the direction of parliamentary debate. In appropriate circumstances, statements of compatibility might justify the restriction or limitation of certain rights where those restrictions or limitations may be in the interests of other individuals or ciety more generally, as permitted by the international human rights instruments which are used as a benchmark. By establishing the new Joint Committee on Human Rights and requiring that statements of compatibility be prepared in relation to all new legislation, this government is taking steps to safeguard against the possibility of contravening our human rights obligations by oversight, omission or excess. We are also ensuring better opportunities for dialogue between the proposers of new legislation, other members of parliament, members of the public and affected groups in relation to the likely impact of proposed legislation from a human rights perspective. The measures proposed by the bills provide for greater transparency and improved opportunities for consultation in the legislative process. In recent weeks we have discussed the circumstances of Afghanistan. We have, as a parliament, had regard to the civil unrest of a range of countries both in our immediate region and around the globe. What assists us in maintaining order and peace and in promoting opportunity in our own society is our recognition of certain minimum rights of each individual. These bills take further practical steps to assist in achieving this, particularly as legislation becomes more complex and expansive. I am very pleased to be able to lend my support to the passage of these bills.",176
204,Mr MELHAM,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Bill 2010 and the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2010. In his second reading speech, the Attorney-General pointed out that the changes in the framework involved in these bills, which are the legislative elements of Australia's Human Rights Framework, are aimed at enhancing understanding so- of and respect for human rights in Australia and ensuring appropriate recognition of human rights issues in legislative and policy development. The minister went on to say that the bills contain two important measures that are designed to improve parliamentary scrutiny of new laws for consistency with Australia's human rights obligations and to encourage early and ongoing consideration of human rights issues in policy and legislative development. I think it is worth going to the explanatory memorandum to get in effect the nub of what is in the bills. Part 1 of the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Bill 2010 deals with preliminary matters, including commencement and definitions. The bill will define human rights as the rights and freedoms recognised or declared by the seven core United Nations human rights treaties as they apply to Australia. These treaties include the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which I will come back to; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the Convention on the Rights of the Child; and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Part 2 of the bill establishes the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and sets out the functions and administrative arrangements for the committee, and part 3 of the bill introduces a requirement for statements of compatibility to be prepared for all bills and legislative instruments subject to disallowance. I think this is a very important bill, for a number of reasons. I have been in this place for just over 20 years, so I have seen legislation by a former Labor government and I have seen legislation by the former conservative government. This government, both in the last parliament and now, has not had a lot of time to do a lot of legislation because we are still at our infancy as a government. What annoyed me most in previous years was how on very important issues where this nation had signed up to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination I found myself over a 20-year period seeking to defend the Racial Discrimination Act from being overridden or suspended in relation mainly to Indigenous issues because governments saw it as a way of undermining court decisions that had been made in favour of Indigenous people, and particularly in relation to native title. I can remember the former Keating government initially proceeding down a path because it was then advised that it was necessary to suspend the Racial Discrimination Act to guarantee certainty post the Mabo decision. Fortunately the Keating government did not go down that road; it complied with the Racial Discrimination Act and the convention and its legislation was enacted in conformity with the Racial Discrimination Act. The Howard government, however, post the Wik decision engaged in a deception of the electorate. In its response to the Wik decision we had bucketfuls of extinguishment, as the then Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, described it; we had schedules that had predicated or in effect decided that any of those titles that were on the schedules would be deemed to extinguish native title. Throughout the whole period there were Senate hearings. I can remember, being on the then Joint Standing Committee on Native Title, a number of lawyers gave evidence to a round-table hearing in relation to the constitutionality of the proposed revisions, but throughout the whole of that period the Howard government hid behind the facade that it was not overriding the Racial Discrimination Act and it hid behind the facade as to the impact of what would happen with the overriding of the Racial Discrimination Act. The Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Bill 2010 would have inserted into that process a procedure that would have had the parliament, parliamentarians and professionals involved, who could have looked at the interaction of that legislation, its detrimental provisions and its lack of conformity with the racial discrimination convention and honestly reported to the parliament at the time. It would not have stopped the parliament from overriding it because the parliament has the constitutional power to act in a discriminatory way. Without the parliamentary committee it was left to Indigenous people to appeal to the United Nations. Indeed, it was the human rights subcommittee of the United Nations that belled the cat in relation to the discriminatory provisions of the Howard legislation and its impact on native title. If we sign up to conventions like the ones that I have read out, it is my firm view that as a parliament we should abide by the spirit of those conventions. We should not be enacting laws that are discriminatory, particularly towards Indigenous people in this country. But, if a future parliament wants to do that, then a parliamentary committee with specialist expertise should expose what the government of the day is doing. It is well known that I was one person within my own party who was not happy with the intervention in the Northern Territory because of what happened in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act. I did not raise my concerns in a public way. I argued those concerns within the party room. It is something that, at the time, I was not proud of. us be very clear: the unfortunate point was that, irrespective of whether the Labor Party had adopted my position or not, the then government had a majority on both houses of parliament. What was said at the time was, however, a lot more honest than what had been said during the Wik debate because, I think, there was an acknowledgement that there was a winding back of the Racial Discrimination Act for particular purposes. It does not make it any better, but at least it was a more honest approach by the then government that they were doing this because they felt it was necessary. I have the view that you can protect and save children and you do not have to do it in a discriminatory manner. The problem has been in the past that, without something like parliamentary scrutiny or a specialist parliamentary committee, governments of all persuasions have taken the easy route. That is why I believe this legislation is very important legislation because it draws a line in the sand. It basically says that we have the objectives, that we are going to have a situation where we outline the treaties we are involved in and, as it says in the explanatory memorandum: … the Bill introduces a requirement for statements of compatibility to be prepared for all bills and legislative instruments subject to disallowance. What I want to see, if this bill passes both houses, is that we have honest statements in relation to compatibility, not weasel words and not statements that necessarily squib the issue. In relation to all pieces of legislation we have an honest assessment before the parliament as to what it actually means in an international sense. This country's history deserves something like that because our Constitution still has very discriminatory sections in it. Whilst it Let has not been decided by the High Court, it is pretty obvious the direction it is going. As a result of the 1967 referendum, despite the 90 per cent support for passage of the amendment to the Constitution, overwhelmingly, the public thought that they were acting in a way which meant the government could only act in a beneficial way to Aboriginal people as a result of the passage of that referendum. As a result of the Hindmarsh Island bridge case, we know that there are some judgments which point to the fact that any future interpretation by a High Court of the race power takes it back to the meaning of the race power at the time the Constitution was enacted, which means that it is open for a Commonwealth parliament to discriminate in a very negative way towards Indigenous people and to do so within the constitutional framework. That is why this legislation is important as a safeguard mechanism so that legislators are able to have independent professional advice before them as to the consequences of particular legislation being considered before the parliament. The truth is-and I do not say this as a criticism of advisers or the public servicethat executives in the past have squibbed in relation to the consequences of legislation and its impact. There is weasel room in a number of instances. I am quite happy to support this legislation. I commend the Attorney and the department for framing this legislation and for bringing it before the liament because I think it is important. My experience over 20 years has been, frankly, that we could have done with this for the last 20 years. We could have done with this legislation at the time of Mabo, we could have done with this legislation at the time of Wik and we could have done with this legislation at the time of intervention in the Northern Territory, just to name three instances, because the parliament would have had in front of it, hopefully, more independent advice as to the consequences for Indigenous people of the legislation it was then considering. I do not say this necessarily in criticism everyone on both sides of politics. Most people are not lawyers. They take advice. They believe what prime ministers tell them and what ministers tell them, and it is not necessarily always the case that they tell the truth.",178
205,Ms GRIERSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise today to speak in support of these historic bills. The Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Bill 2010 and the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2010 respond to recommendations of the 2009 Brennan review to establish a parliamentary joint committee on human rights, a recommendation which was also made by the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in the last parliament. The committee will examine and report to the parliament on our human rights compliance by issuing statements of compatibility for all bills and legislative instruments introduced to the parliament in reference to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the Convention on the Elimination of par- All Forms of Discrimination against Women; the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the Convention on the Rights of the Child; and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The committee will also have broad powers to conduct inquiries into matters of human rights referred to it by the Attorney-General and, like all committees, it will have the power to seek submissions, hold public hearings and examine witnesses. As a government we are concerned about human rights abuses both in Australia and internationally. As Australians we become of concerned when human rights are abused. For example, in my electorate of Newcastle many people are particularly concerned about a young man, Jock Palfreeman, who has been convicted of murder in Bulgaria after trying to protect two youths from an attack by a group of 15 men. I do not comment on the laws of Bulgaria or the legal case, but I can understand how a young man in Newcastle would always try to protect the underdog. Jock's appeal commenced on 21 October 2010, and I hope that he will receive the sort of procedural fairness that we value here in Australia. I would also like to reiterate the sentiments of our Prime Minister and welcome the release of Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest. Aung San Suu Kyi has paid a heavy price for her advocacy of democracy and freedom, and I encourage all Australians to remember and value the freedoms that we experience here in this nation. Many political prisoners continue to be detained in Burma, and I hope that the Burmese authorities will move to release them in the near future, as Aung San Suu Kyi has requested. I also hope she will have opportunity one day to lead the people of Burma. This Labor government has a proven track record of strengthening our compliance with our international human rights obligations, and we are doing it in a way that unites, rather than divides, our community. Last year I welcomed the entry into force in Australia of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. As part of a government led by Australia's first female Prime Minister, I know that we are leading the charge for greater gender equality and recognition of human rights in the Australian community. But we always need to do more. On the recommendation of the National Human Rights Consultation committee, the now Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, outlined a package of education initiatives earlier this year to foster community awareness of human rights. Included in that package is $6.6 million to expand the community education role of the Australian Human Rights Commission and $2 million over four years for the development and delivery of community education and engagement programs by nongovernment organisations. A $3.8 million investment in the Commonwealth public sector to improve human rights awareness will further build a culture of respect for human rights. It will allow for the development of a human rights tool kit that will set a benchmark for future policy development and implementation. But the crux of this legislation, and the linchpin of our efforts to enhance the community's understanding of and respect for human rights, is the statement of compatibility mechanism, which mirrors section 19 of the British Human Rights Act 1998. What strikes me about this bill is the important that statements of compatibility could have played throughout Australian history. I take note of the member for Banks's comments in that regard. GetUp!'s High Court challenge to the Howard government's 2006 amendments to the Electoral Act in Rowe v Electoral Commissioner is a recent example. The Sydney Morning Herald described the amendments as ‘Orwellian' because they led to the disenfranchisement of hundreds of thousands of mainly young voters. Although the court is yet to hand down the reasons for its decision in Rowe, the parliament and the Australian people would have benefited from a statement of compatibility of the Howard government's amendments with article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights when the bill was first introduced in 2005. The unanimous ruling of the High Court late last week in Plaintiff M61 and Plaintiff M69 that two Sri Lankan asylum seekers were denied procedural fairness further highlights the need for this bill. The Northern Territory intervention legislative package introduced by the Howard government in 2007, likewise, would have benefited from a statement of compatibility with the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination or the prohibition against discrimination contained in article 26 of the ICCPR. Article 26 provides: All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law. In this respect, the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Given that the Howard government saw fit to suspend the application of the Racial Disrole crimination Act 1975 in the Northern Territory, it is not unlikely that the bill would have been found to be in contravention of our international human rights obligations. This is the legislation that the Law Council of Australia condemned as ‘utterly unacceptable' and about which the Northern Territory's Anti-Discrimination Commissioner, Tony Fitzgerald, was quoted as saying, ‘The suspension of the Northern Territory and the federal race discrimination legislation can never be justified.' We reinstated the relevant provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act as they applied to the intervention last year. Many would have said ‘thank goodness'. Although the Howard government may have proceeded with the legislation in each of these circumstances, despite the likelihood that they were incompatible with our human rights obligations, the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Bill would have fostered and will foster a human rights dialogue as an integral step in the legislative process. But in the United Kingdom, as in the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria, statements of compatibility on their own have been deemed to be an insufficient mechanism through which to protect human rights. The United Kingdom has a parliamentary mechanism as well as a judicial mechanism through which declarations of inconsistency are issued, yet the 2009-10 report of the liament of the United Kingdom's Joint Committee on Human Rights reveals that the parliament remains unresponsive in respect of a number of declarations of incompatibility. As the Brennan review recommended, we need a human rights act with a strong presumption in favour of judicial interpretations of legislation that foster rights compatibility. Long has the Australian Labor Party sought to legislate to transform our international human rights obligations into domestic law. In 1973, and again in 1985, the then Attorney-General, Lionel Bowen, introduced bills into the Commonwealth parliament to enact a statutory bill of human rights. Both times, however, the legislation was defeated. Since then, we have seen the Human Rights Act 2004 in the ACT, implemented by the Stanhope Labor government, and the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities 2006, legislated by the Bracks Labor government. Australian and state Labor governments are clearly committed to protecting and promoting human rights in accordance with our international human rights obligations. Fundamental to any attempt to protect and foster human rights is a provision, such as section 3 of the British Human Rights Act 1998 and section 32 of the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006, that requires the judiciary to interpret legislation so far as possible in accordance with our human rights obligations. The importance of such provisions is highlighted in cases such as Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza in the United Kingdom. In Ghaidan, the House of Lords read the clause ‘surviving spouse' contained in paragraph 2(2) of schedule 1 to the Rent Act 1977 so as to extend to include same-sex couples. In doing so, they brought the provision into accordance with articles 14 and 8 of the European Convention for the Par- Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. I truly hope that, in the nottoo-distant future, we will see a national human rights act with a strong judicial mechanism through which to ensure rights compatibility. Only then will we catch up with the rest of the world and enhance the understanding of, and respect for, human rights throughout the Australian community. Like the British parliament, we must bring rights home! But Senator Brandis has decried the Brennan review as ‘a case study in policy incompetence'. According to Senator Brandis: … in a nation such as Australia, the very strength of our liberal democratic culture is the strongest reason why such an instrumentas a bill of rightsis redundant. That is not the view of former High Court Chief Justice Sir Anthony Mason and former High Court Justice Michael MCHugh, and it is not my view. Nor is it the view of the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada or New Zealand, who all recognise the need to temper the will of the majority with the adjudicative power of the judiciary in order to provide additional protection for human rights. With all due respect to Senator Brandis, I think that the strength of our liberal democratic culture is measured by our protection of human rights-particularly those of the disadvantaged. As in other Western nations, it is my view that a bill of rights would strengthen rather than diminish our liberal democratic culture. Those rights-sceptics opposite then argued that a statutory bill of rights would undermine parliamentary sovereignty. Legal scholar Tom Campbell even suggested that it may give rise to ‘juristocratic power'. But Jeffrey Goldsworthy has rightly pointed out that democracy is ‘based on a right to participate indirectly, rather than a duty to participate directly, in public decision-making'. Contrary to the view of Senator Brandis and many rights-sceptics, I believe that a statutory bill of rights would not diminish nor undermine democracy or representative government. Under a statutory bill of rights, the Australian parliament would retain the ultimate legislative power to overrule the decisions of the judiciary where it disagrees with a rights-compatible interpretation. The primary importance of a statutory bill of rights, however, is not in the courtroom. The Director of the Human Rights Law Resource Centre, in an article published in the Age, has pointed out that outside the courtroom human rights law is: … used to address disadvantage and promote dignity; a fact conveniently ignored by national charter of rights critics. He goes on to say: You won't have read, for example, that the Victorian charter prevented the eviction of a single mother and her kids from public housing into homelessness, or that it assisted an elderly woman with brain injury to get access to critical medical assistance. Or that it helped a woman with cerebral palsy and children with autism to obtain support services. These are common-sense decisions in real-life cases, which show how charters of rights can and do improve lives and promote values such as freedom, respect, dignity and a fair go. I have to say that I am a strong advocate for a national bill of rights. We stand alone in the Western world as the only jurisdiction without a bill of rights, whether constitutionally entrenched or statute based. I hope that each of us in this parliament will consider that. So often those opposite cite the need to not introduce a carbon pollution reduction system or a carbon tax ahead of the rest of the world. But on human rights, we are well behind. Professor of Constitutional Law, George Williams, has said, ‘Australians want more reform than this.' While he is right, the Australian people do want more than simply a parliamentary committee-something I praise and something I welcome-and the human rights dialogue that will be fostered by this bill will be hopefully a significant step along the path to a just and truly equal Australia and to a national bill of rights. The President of the Australian Human Rights Commission, Catherine Branson QC, has said that these measures have ‘the potential to open up a broader dialogue on human rights at the heart of our democracy'. This is a dialogue that our government supports wholeheartedly. I commend the bills to the House, and I lend my praise to the Attorney General for at least coming this far in introducing a human rights compliance mechanism into everything we do in this parliament. It is a step that is well received and a step that is long overdue, but I hope it is a step along a journey to a full bill of rights Australia.",181
206,Mr ZAPPIA,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Bill 2010 and the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2010. The two key provisions of them are on, firstly, the establishment of a parliamentary joint committee on human rights and, secondly, the preparation of a statement of compatibility to accompany all bills and legislative instruments subject to disallowance. The question of a bill of rights is something that I have taken an interest in for many years. These bills go a significant way toward ensuring that we do have more rights entrenched in our legislation than in the past. Whilst the rights may not be legally entrenched, it will certainly be the case that as a result of these bills there will be more scrutiny of our legislation to ensure that in fact human rights do get the support of the parliament when bills are debated and legislated. The very fact that we are debating this bill, and that Australia went through a lengthy public discussion about human rights and how we can best ensure them, reflects the strength of the Australian democracy. It is also a measure of our common decency because human rights are fundamentally about constructing a society in which people are all treated equally and, just as importantly, a society in which we treat all others in the same way that we would like society to treat us. What has clearly emerged from the public consultation is that the question of a bill of rights-or a charter of rights as it has often been referred to-is argued as passionately by those in favour of such a bill or charter as it is by those who oppose it. Given the legal implications associated with the public consultation, I note that some of the nation's most eminent jurists have contributed to this for debate and put forward opposing views. Interestingly, whilst the views are opposing, both sides of this debate are united in the belief that there is a strong case for the support of human rights in this country. The difference, however, is on how those rights are best protected. Our laws are essentially premised on a belief in human rights. The question, however, is whether they adequately protect basic human rights or not. That is the question that led to the call for a bill of rights and the public consultation on this matter. My view is that the answer lies not in whether Australia adopts a bill of rights but rather, if it does, what is spelt out in such a bill. That is the key question, yet disappointingly that was not the question addressed by many of those who made submissions and certainly not by those who ran campaigns against such a bill or a charter of rights. In fairness to those people who had concerns about such a bill or a charter, there was not a bill before them on which they could comment. My concern is that you cannot oppose a proposal without first seeing the contents of it. How can you argue that a proposal will weaken human rights, as some did, when you do not know what the proposal is? Both sides of this debate quite properly pointed to real examples to support the case for and against the proposal for a bill or a charter of rights. That is why I believe that the process leading to this bill serves a very useful purpose. One only has to ask a person who has been the victim of unfair or unjust treatment or personally deprived of basic rights to understand just how unjust and soul destroying it can be to have basic rights denied, yet it sometimes happens in spite of all the laws and judicial processes we have in place in Australia. Where the problem arises because the laws are deficient, the problem is easily rectified by amending the laws. However, that is not always the case. I want to raise three matters which highlight that Australia's current laws are still inadequate in protecting what we all accept as basic rights. Firstly, in recent decades we have seen the introduction of a number of anti-discrimination laws. These laws were intended to protect rights and ensure all people are treated fairly. Whether those laws resolve the problem may be debatable, but what those laws certainly did do is acknowledge that there was a problem. We have also appointed human rights and equal opportunity commissioners tasked with the responsibility of overseeing compliance with those laws. Secondly, in recent years we have seen the appointment of numerous ombudsmen, primarily to intervene where it appeared that natural justice had been denied to people. The number of ombudsmen or commissioners appointed continues to grow, further highlighting that existing laws still fail people. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, since adopting the United Nations Human Rights Charter, Australia has over the years adopted several other specific charters on rights or has been a party to international treaties-for example, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and other conventions and treaties that I could refer to. I make two points about all these charters and treaties. The first is that such charters, which are intended to protect human rights, would not be necessary if the rights expressed in those charters were already enshrined in Australian law by way of a bill of rights, a charter of rights or in the legislation itself. Secondly, adopting such charters or conventions or treaties does not make them binding on Australia unless they are, in fact, written into our laws. The critical point about international conventions and charters adopted by Australia is that they expose the shortfalls in our own Australian laws. I want to raise a couple of other matters in respect to submissions made in the national human rights consultation. I note that there was considerable opposition to a bill of rights raised by the religious sector. Whilst I understand their concerns-and I believe that their concerns in many respects are justified when assessed against existing bills of rights that are in place in other jurisdictions-I am not convinced that their concerns could not have been resolved by a careful crafting of a bill of rights or a charter of rights for Australia.",185

PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Mr Liu Xiaobo,189
224,Mr DANBY,BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (1) congratulates Mr Liu Xiaobo for having been awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize; (2) notes that: (a) Mr Liu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for ‘his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China'; (b) on 23 December 2009 Mr Liu was tried for ‘inciting subversion of state power', and on 25 December 2009 sentenced to eleven years' imprisonment and two years' deprivation of political rights; (c) Mr Liu was tried in the context of his advocacy for the petition known as ‘Charter 08' which was initially signed by 350 Chinese intellectuals and human rights activists; and (d) ‘Charter 08' calls for 19 changes to improve human rights in China, including an independent legal system, freedom of association and the elimination of oneparty rule; (3) calls for Mr Liu to be released and his sentence repealed; and (4) supports the right of Chinese citizens to call for political reform, greater protection of human rights and democratisation in their country. The winner of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, Liu Xiaobo, is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence for ‘incitement to subvert state power', having been sentenced on 25 December 2009. The main reason charges were brought against him was his support for Charter 08, a citizens' manifesto created to mark the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and conceived as a Chinese version of the famous Czech Charter 77, which was presented by former President Vaclav Havel as a freedom charter for the Czech Republic and which was instrumental in people in Eastern Europe achieving their freedom. Charter 08 states: … the Chinese people, who have endured human rights disasters and uncountable struggles across these yearsof Communist rulenow include many who see clearly that freedom, equality, and human rights are universal values of humankind and that democracy and constitutional government are the fundamental framework for protecting these values. This is not the first time Mr Liu has been imprisoned for his ideas. When Chinese student protests began in the spring of 1989protests that would come to a head at Tiananmen Square- Mr Liu, then a visiting scholar at Columbia University, had the courage to fly back to Beijing to join the students and counsel them in non-violent protest. For this, the Chinese government called him a ‘black hand' and imprisoned him for 18 months. In 1995, after writing essays that criticized the Chinese government, Mr Liu was sentenced to three years of ‘re-education through labour'. When he was released in 1999 the government built a sentry station next to his home and his phone calls and internet connections were tapped. In January 2005, following the death of former Chinese premier Zhao Ziyang, who had shown sympathy to protesters in the student demonstration in 1989, Liu was immediately put under house arrest for two weeks. Despite constant harassment by the authorities, Liu Xiaobo is not driven by hatred of the regime. On the day of his most recent trial, Mr Xiaobo stated: I have no enemies, and no hatred. None of the police who have monitored, arrested and interrogated me, the prosecutors who prosecuted me, or the judges who sentence me, are my enemies. While I'm unable to accept your surveillance, arrest, prosecution or sentencing, I respect your professions and personalities … For hatred is corrosive of a person's wisdom and conscience; the mentality of enmity can poison a nation's spirit, instigate brutal life and death struggles, destroy a society's tolerance and humanity, and block a nation's progress to freedom and democracy. I hope therefore to be able to transcend my personal vicissitudes in understanding the development of the state and changes in society, to counter the hostility of the regime with the best of intentions, and defuse hate with love. No wonder the Chinese government fear such a man, who can put things so positively and who can feel no hatred in the middle of such imprisonment. Mr Xiaobo is one of the most articulate of China's political prisoners and now certainly the best known, but he is far from alone in being persecuted for his political views. According to the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China, 1,383 political prisoners are known to be detained or imprisoned as of July 2010. One of them is a Catholic bishop. Can you imagine any other regime imprisoning a Catholic bishop? But that is not the total figure. The US Department of State's Human Rights Report on China estimates that ‘tens of thousands of political prisoners', including religious prisoners, remain incarcerated. Who are some of these people? There is Wang Bingzhang, a long-time democracy activist serving a life sentence in solitary confinement. There is Shi Tao, a journalist serving a 10-year sentence for passing along notes of an editorial meeting to a US based website. There is Hu Jia, an activist serving a three-year sentence for writing essays critical of the Communist Party in the run-up to the Olympics. And of course there is Gao Zhisheng, the famous human rights lawyer who has defended so many of these Chinese human rights activists, who simply disappeared in 2009. Leading Chinese doctors, HIV activists and many people who simply draw attention to the unpleasantness in their own country, such as a father who complained about food poisoning his three-year old, have been jailed as politibel cal prisoners. They serve their terms in an archipelago of labour camps scattered across China called Laogai. According to the Laogai Research Foundation, there are at least 909 of these camps, with the low-end estimate putting the number of prisoners at 250,000 and the high-end estimate putting it at five million. Let people not say that they do not know about the Chinese prison camp system as being like the gulags they used to have in the Soviet Union. Let people not say that they do not know about the detention and imprisonment of people who are deprived of their human rights in China. It is there for all to see. Many Australians understandably want to do business and trade with China-an entirely reasonable idea-but it should not be done while turning a blind eye to China's human rights abuses. Liu Xiaobo is not a danger to China. He only wants to be a positive influence in his country. As the Dalai Lama said recently: In his movementLiu is not toppling the government but trying to bring more openness, accountability. Likewise, the Norwegian Nobel Committee's decision to award the peace prize to Mr Liu is not an attack on China; rather, it is an affirmation that the world believes the Chinese people deserve better, that they should have the same freedoms and rights that we in Australia, and indeed most countries in the world, take for granted. Soon after the announcement that Liu Xiaobo would receive the Nobel Peace Prize a letter was circulated, signed by more than 300 Chinese scholars, activists and lawyers, applauding Mr Liu Xiaobo. I think it is very counterproductive to China's interests that the regime in Beijing has written to all countries that would normally turn up to the NoPrize, which is due on 10 December, and demanded that we kowtow to them and not participate in the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony for the first Chinese scholar to be awarded it. It is a terrible shame that this pressure is being exerted and, of course, it will be ignored. It is counterproductive to China's interests to make such demands on countries. All the countries that have received such pressure will be there. No country would surrender its sovereignty to such threats, including, I am sure, Australia. I am not sure that the prize will be awarded. It seems there will be a ceremony but, since Mr Liu is incarcerated and will not be released and his wife and brothers have been arrested as well, there will be no-one to receive the prize. It will be a stinging indictment of the regime in Beijing that a man who is committed to nonviolence, a man who calls for constitutional change according to the Chinese constitution, a man who has such support amongst Chinese intellectuals, will not be there to receive it. China should join the mainstream of humanity by embracing universal valuesthe open letter from the 300 Chinese intellectuals said. Such is the only route to becoming a ‘great nation' that is capable of playing a positive and responsible role on the world stage. Through the award of the Nobel Peace Prize we can see that the world agrees. We call on the government in Beijing to release Mr Liu Xiaobo, let him receive his award, and let China develop and peacefully rise with political developments matching their economic progress.",189
225,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Is the motion of the member for Melbourne Ports seconded?,192
226,Dr LEIGH,BUSINESS,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,192
227,Mr SLIPPER,BUSINESS,"I am particularly pleased to join with my friend and colleague the honourable member for Melbourne Ports in supporting this very important private member's motion which is currently before the House. This motion congratulates Mr Liu Xiaobo on being awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize and then notes that he was awarded that prize for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China. It also highlights the fact that in 2009 Mr Liu was tried for inciting subversion of state power and on Christmas Day last year was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment and two years deprivation of political rights. He was tried in the context of his advocacy for the petition known as Charter 08, which was initially signed by 350 Chinese intellectuals and human rights activists. Charter 08 calls for 19 changes to improve human rights in China, including an independent legal system, freedom of association and the elimination of one-party rule. The motion also calls for Mr Liu to be released and to have his sentence repealed and supports the right of Chinese citizens to call for political reform, greater protection of human rights and democratisation in their country. In 2010 China seeks to be a good international citizen. Clearly, it is making economic progress that would make the rest of the world somewhat envious, and yet associated with this new economic power is a responsibility-a responsibility to be a good world citizen. In 2010 we expect that good world citizens observe certain fundamental human rights. The fact that the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to Mr Liu is an objective recognition that this person is someone who really is an icon, who ought to be put on a pedestal, who ought to be respected by the whole world whether or not one necessarily agrees with all of the stances that he has taken in relation to all issues. If China is seeking to be good international citizen and not an international thug of the first order then it ought to recognise that even though the Chinese totalitarian, dictatorial, oppressive government does not agree with Mr Liu at least Mr Liu represents a strain of thought-possibly even a majority strain of thought-even in communist China itself, which says that in 2010 the communist Chinese have to do better than they have previously. Just because someone lives in mainland China, that does not mean that a person has no rights. Just because a person happens to possess citizenship of the People's Republic of China, that does not mean that that person is a less worthy individual than another person who enjoys citizenship of another country. Just because someone happens to be of Chinese ethnicity living within the Chinese mainland, that does not mean that that person forfeits his or her fundamental rights as a citizen or as a human being. I think that the Chinese set their cause back a thousand years every time they take the kind of mindless, unacceptable, antidemocratic, authoritarian, disgusting approach that they have taken to Mr Liu. Mr Liu is not going to be allowed, either himself or by proxy, to accept the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. I think that all honourable members and, I believe, most citizens of most countries in the world would see that the Chinese have once again overstepped the mark. We see that with respect to Taiwan. They are denying that country's democracy and they are denying the fact that Taiwan has a vigorous parliamentary system which is the envy of many countries in Asia. We also know that China denies the right of free determination to the Tibetan people. Tibet is a country under occupation. In 1949, Tibet was invaded by the Chinese communists and is, in fact, occupied. A system of cultural genocide is going on in Tibet. The aim of the Chinese government is to make Tibetans a minority in their own land. The Chinese government will not negotiate with His Holiness the Dalai Lama with respect to human rights or with respect to the preservation of Tibetan culture, Tibetan language or the Tibetan ethos in that country. So China has very few runs on the board. China is being thuggish with respect to the Taiwanese and it is being thuggish with respect to the Tibetans. But one would think that, in mainland China itself, it would respect a person like Mr Liu Xiaobo, who has been recognised as a person worthy of receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. His Holiness the Dalai Lama was a previous recipient of that prize. Many other people who are perceived as icons and role models for the world have been awarded this prize. It is not something that people seek to receive, but it is objective recognition of the quality of a son's contribution to human rights. Mr Liu was awarded that prize, so what are the Chinese doing? The Chinese are continuing to lock him up, the Chinese have arrested Mr Liu's wife and the Chinese are refusing to allow Mr Liu's family to travel to receive the award on his behalf. Frankly, the Chinese are forfeiting any right or expectation they might have to be recognised as a civilised nation in the community of nations around the world. The Chinese are, I think, appalling in their approach to Mr Liu, they are appalling in their approach to the Dalai Lama and they are appalling in their approach to the Taiwanese. The Chinese deny basic human rights to ordinary, decent people who reside within their borders. Even if Mr Liu has breached the laws of China as perceived by the government of communist China then, once he has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, why will the Chinese authorities not allow him to travel to receive that prize? If the Chinese had nothing to hide, they would say that they disagree with Mr Liu Xiaobo, they would say that they were appalled by his stand in China, they would say that they disagree with the points that he asserts and they would say that the action he has taken against the Chinese dictatorship is quite inappropriate, but-if they were a country open to criticism, the way most other countries in the world are open to criticism-they would cop it on the chin. They would say that they disagree with Mr Liu Xiaobo but that they respect his right to articulate a position which is different from theirs. Is that the approach of the Chinese communists? No. Are they interested in human rights? No. Are they interested in bringing their minorities into the mainstream? No. Are an they interested in economic achievement by per- people who do not support the regime? No. Are they interested in encouraging freedom of expression for people who might not agree with what the government is saying? No. In conclusion, I reiterate that Mr Liu Xiaobo has been locked up because he disagrees with an oppressive, dictatorial, authoritarian regime-a regime which has no right to exist in 2010. If the Chinese authorities had any legitimacy at all, they would not be locking up Mr Liu Xiaobo and they would not be preventing him from going to receive his Nobel Peace Price. Instead, they would be saying, ‘We disagree with this man but we respect his right to differ.' It is a tragedy. The Chinese stand condemned and I ask them to reconsider their appalling conduct.",192
228,Dr LEIGH,BUSINESS,"I have always viewed the challenges facing China with a sense of awe. Since the great opening of the Chinese economy in 1978, China's economic achievements have been nothing short of remarkable. Rapid economic growth has improved the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of Chinese. According to the World Bank, China's per-person GDP rose from US$524 in 1980 to US$6,200 in 2010-a twelvefold increase. This is in 2005 dollars. Over the same period, the share of the Chinese population living in extreme poverty-below $1.25 a day-fell from 84 per cent to 16 per cent, while the share of the population living below $2 a day fell from 98 per cent to 36 per cent. In The End of Poverty, Jeffrey Sachs wrote: China is likely to be the first of the great poverty stricken countries of the twentieth century to end poverty in the twenty-first century. He also pointed out: By the year 2050, it is reasonable to suppose that China will reach around half of the Western European income average, restoring China's relative position at the start of the industrial era. In addition, the level of general education has been greatly improved since 1990. Average adult education levels were less than five years in 1982 but over seven years in 2000. In 1982, 232 million Chinese people were illiterate. In 2000, the figure was 85 million. The Chinese economic reforms have transformed lives. Men and women, farmers, factory workers and service workers all prospered in a social environment which now permitted the accumulation of individual wealth. This brings me to Liu Xiaobo. Born on 28 December 1955 in the north-eastern city of Changchun, Liu Xiaobo has long been a passionate man of letters. He was in Beijing in 1989 when the ongoing student demonstrations of the era grew to encompass much of Beijing's civil society. Liu has been an intellectual leader. For him, the Tiananmen Square protest and resulting crackdown was a deeply formative experience. Released from prison 20 months later, he wrote: My eyes were opened by 4 June and the death of the martyrs and now, every time. I open my mouth, I ask myself if I am worthy of them. That was over 20 years ago. To the present day Liu has remained an unceasing advocate for democratic reform, never losing his passion for truth and justice or his demand for the state to recognise human rights. His deeply poignant writing, with its overwhelming commitment to the commonality of all humanity, must rank amongst the most heartmoving of literary protests. In spite of long periods of detention he never faltered in his humanity or love for others. His recent trial statement was dedicated to his wife, Liu Xia, while his Nobel Prize was dedicated to the ‘lost souls' of Tiananmen Square. As the new China emerges it desperately needs Liu Xiaobo. It needs his courage to speak truth to power; it needs his advocacy on behalf of the dispossessed; it needs him to argue for an independent legal system, freedom of association and for citizens' rights. China is a big country, and its future is best assured by trusting and relying upon its greatest strength, its more than one billion people. China faces many tough issues, not least of which is uneven progress and rising inequality. Brave spokespeople like Nobel Prize winner Liu Xiaobo are the key to the emergence of a civil society that will only serve to strengthen China. It is a tragic mistake for the government to intimidate and attempt to silence those whose concern is to articulate the needs of the people. Due to the great number of shared interests that China and Australia have in common I believe it is appropriate to speak to motions such as this. As I have outlined, the Chinese government has shown real commitment and real results when delivering lasting economic reform, all to the benefit of ordinary Chinese citizens. But as the case of Liu shows, there is scope for other issues of reform to be raised and aired. I fear that noone benefits if China's reforms stop at the economy. Speaking at Peking University in 2008, the present foreign minister said: A true friend is one who can be a zhengyou, that is a partner who sees beyond immediate benefit the broader and firm basis for continuing, profound and sincere friendship. As a member of a party formed to represent the workers of Australia, I speak in the same spirit as the foreign minister spoke to Chinese students. I am proud to second this motion honouring such a courageous advocate, a man who has committed his life to improving the lot of the people of China and to doing so entirely through non-violent means. (Time expired)",194
229,Mr HAWKE,BUSINESS,"It is a great privilege to speak to the motion on Liu Xiaobo moved by the member for Melbourne Ports. I congratulate the government and the member for Melbourne Ports on putting forward such an important motion. With all our political traditions, we can all take something from Liu. For me, I take out of the life of Liu and his Nobel Peace Prize the triumph of the individual against the state-that ongoing force in human history of the individual challenging the unquestioned power of the state. Charter 08 calls for 19 changes to improve human rights in China, including an independent legal system, freedom of association and the elimination of one-party rule. That is the same challenge that has faced many people throughout our own history, and it is of course something this place should be a beacon for upholding and supporting. It is good to see a man of Liu's character receive this award. We must speak up and stand up for those people who are oppressed, who are unable to speak, who are imprisoned, in their quest for freedom and human rights. The Australian parliament of course does serve as a source of hope and inspiration to so many around the world. Being jailed for 11 years for producing such a charter, which calls for 19 changes to improve human rights in China, is a hideous to thing-being jailed for peaceful protest seeking progress for the human race. That is why it is so important for us here today to support such a man. Often in this House I question the role of individuals and the role they play, but intellectuals do have an important role to play in our world. When you look at Liu's life and examine his intellectual traditions, he even studies the same intellectual traditions that underpin many of the things that I believe in-and I refer to Nietzsche. Liu was an advocate of the individual in Chinese universities in his earlier year, standing up in a society dominated by the collectivist tradition for the role of the individual in his society. The member for Fraser quite beautifully spoke about the ‘lost souls' that Liu represents in the Chinese state. Australia has played a role in Liu Xiaobo's life over many years; indeed, in the Tiananmen Square massacre Liu sought refuge in an Australian embassy but had the courage and the bravery to leave that safe haven that Australia provided and go back to his people to continue his ongoing quest to gain, in a constitutional way, better conditions and liberty for the Chinese people. The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised Liu for his long and non-violent strugglethat is very important-for fundamental human rights in China. The committee has long believed that there is a close connection between human rights and peace. It is important to note that Liu has been a peaceful protester; that he has sought to improve his society only through that which can be obtained through proper mechanisms and through the rule of law. At his recent trial he gave a great quote, which I would like to read here today: Freedom of expression is the basis of human rights, the source of humanity and the mother of truth. To block freedom of speech is to trample on human rights, to strangle humanity and to suppress the truth. I do not feel guilty for following my constitutional right to freedom of expression, for fulfilling my social responsibility as a citizen. Even if accused of it, I would have no complaints. It is beautiful language even when translated into English-one can only wonder how it sounds in Chinese. However, it is the same hope that is expressed by so many people in human history: to seek a better life for themselves and their fellow man and to seek limitations on state power, which has been such a great tradition in the West. I know that there are plans to publish selections of his writings in the future and I will be one of those seeking out those writings to add to my collection of documents of liberty from our world. Those writings will stand alongside Czechoslovakia's Charter 77, the Declaration of Independence, Milton's works and all of those key documents from human history that have formed the ongoing tradition of seeking to limit the power of the state over the individual. In Liu we see that same quest and that same peaceful protest for the betterment of humankind. It is our role, as a parliament that is dominated by freedom of expression, human rights and the betterment of the human race, to support all of those who seek liberty in such a noble and powerful way as Liu has done in China.",195
230,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA (DELIVERING ESSENTIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES) BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 November.,196
231,Mr BANDT,BANKING AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Introduction Chinese Last week the Commonwealth Bank reported $1.6 billion in earnings for the September quarter. This was on the back of $5.7 billion in profit for the last financial year and is in line with the staggering $20 billion in combined profits of the big banks. And it is important to remember that this occurred in the context of the tail end of the global financial crisis and unprecedented government guarantees and other support for the banks. So it is reasonable to expect the banks to be required to give something in return for this unprecedented level of government support. And it is reasonable to expect that the banks are subject to real competition and are required to provide consumers with real choice. And it is reasonable to expect that the banks be properly regulated and supervised so that they cannot take unfair advantage of what is effectively a monopolistic position. Now the banks, of course, do not want to be subject to proper controls and supervision. In contrast with most developed countries, they want to charge what they like and rely on consumers' need for banking services to ensure the profits from unfair fees and charges keep on going. Not surprisingly then, they are sensitive criticism of their super profits and current practices and it is a measure perhaps of their understanding of community outrage about their profits that they have resorted to hyperbole and insult to defend the undefendable. The bank CEOs, for example, have sought to characterise such suggestions as akin to proposals from Hugo Chavez and the former states of Eastern Europe. But, of course, any honest observer of this debate could see the irony of an oligopoly, backed by a government guarantee, complaining about the state sponsored markets of the former Soviet satellites. Because in reality what the Greens are proposing in terms of obligations by the banks is no different to what exists in many OECD economies and is far less than what is being discussed in many of the G20 countries, including in the United States. Already many G20 countries have implemented or are examining levies or new taxes which seek to recover the cost of direct fiscal support to the banks provided during the global financial crisis. And the International Monetary Fund has recommended that even those countries like Australia, which have not had to bail out the banks, consider a levy or financial stability contribution which could pay for any future government support to the sector. They say this should be considered because no country ‘is immune from the risk of future failures and crises.' They also say that while in countries like Australia the ‘net fiscal costs may ultimately prove relatively modest, they greatly understate the fiscal exposures experienced during the crisis and the wider costs.' So, while the debate we are having in Australia currently is about choice, competition and what is reasonable to charge the to consumer and may seem like a significant shift to the banks, it is in fact not as far down the road of regulatory and financial reform that we have seen in other G20 countries. Now it may be that in time Australia will need to move to similar measures. The IMF certainly makes a cogent and well considered argument that on average banks have enjoyed an effective 20 basis point subsidy from the public purse by having the government adopt a ‘too big to fail' guarantee of their activities and borrowings. That is, because we as the public offered so much support, the banks have borrowed funds much more cheaply even after the guarantee levy paid here in Australia is taken into account. And we should look at the IMF recommendations and other inputs into the discussion on the post-GFC global financial architecture when considering future recommendations that might be made on reform to the Australian financial sector. But for now we have before the parliament and in the debate a number of proposals that could begin a process of properly regulating the banks and ensuring increased consumer competition and choice. These include two Greens bills-my bill, the Banking Amendment (Delivering Essential Financial Services) Bill 2010, which amongst other things caps ATM and exit fees, and Senator Bob Brown's bill, currently before the Senate, which would place a 24month moratorium on rate rises above the RBA cash rate. We also have the proposal on strengthening the ACCC's powers on price signalling and a new inquiry into the banks and we await the detail on the government's proposals, which may include support for nonbanking institutions. Other proposals, such as increasing account mobility with a transferable account number suggested by consumer advocates Choice, have also been flagged. All of these proposals have merit and deserve consideration. None of these proposals will be able to pass the parliament without the support of some combination of the Greens, other crossbenchers and the government or opposition. So, over the summer break there will need to be some talking, discussion and negotiation on these proposals. And can I say to the members of the House that the Greens' door is open and we are ready to talk. We want to get action on the banks. We want to get more consumer choice and competition. We want to ensure the banks only charge their customers what is fair. We want to see an end to the practice of accumulating obscene levels of profits on the back of ordinary customers. Part 1-ATM fees The first measure that this bill takes is to regulate ATM fees. The bill prohibits banks from charging their own customers for ATM transactions, locking in current practice. It also caps the charge for using another bank's ATMs at a level sufficient to cover the cost to the bank of the transaction. We do not want to refuse the banks the right to charge these fees altogether-as was incorrectly implied in one newspaper over the weekend; we want to simply limit the charge to the real cost to the bank. In 2007, the Reserve Bank of Australia estimated that the average cost to banks for ATM transactions was 75c-less than 40 per cent of the fee they levy upon consumers; the rest is pure profit for the banks. Part 2-Basic transaction account The proposed basic transaction account in this bill offers banking customers an easy to understand account that provides essential banking services without any hidden profiteering in the form of exploitative fees. It is time for action on interest rates and this bill will help take such action. Part 3-Fixed interest gap loans The bill introduces a requirement that banks offer fixed interest gap mortgages and loans with interest rates fixed at a negotiated percentage above the lender's cost of funds. The banks' cost of funds will be calculated according to a formula approved by APRA. These so-called tracker mortgages are very common in many other OECD countries, and here in Australia at least one Queensland credit union already offers such a product. Part 4-Exit fees Finally, the bill limits mortgage and loan exit fees to the actual and reasonable costs of early repayment and obliges lenders to make consumers aware of the existence and amount of these fees upfront. Conclusion For too long the banks have been free to do and charge what they like. For too long we have accepted that deregulation and market forces alone were adequate to ensure that banking customers got a fair deal. For too long we have assumed that the banks, given a free rein, would do the right thing. The global financial crisis showed the folly of such thinking. And while Australia was immune from the worse, the average Australian was and still is exposed to large potential liabilities. It is time then for a new social contract banking that requires banks to accept more responsibility and behave with more moderation. The Greens will seek to pursue this bill and other measures in the new year. We will also positively examine other proposals that come before the parliament. And over the summer, I ask all members of the House to reflect on the fact that to anything passed there will need to be discussion and agreement, and that those on the crossbenches will almost certainly be essential to that. If either the government or the opposition wants to know what is important to the Greens, they could do worse than look at this bill and that introduced by Senator Brown in the other place. In the meantime, this bill is an important start on reining in the banks.",196
232,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BANKING AMENDMENT,Is the motion seconded? Mr Craig Thomson-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,199
233,Mr VAN MANEN,BANKING AMENDMENT,"Forde) (8.56 pm)Whilst our banking industry is not perfect, throughout the global financial crisis it demonstrated remarkable resilience-aided by the implementation of both the wholesale funding guarantee and the retail deposit guarantee by the current government. It should not be underestimated that this occurred due to Australia's strong financial position prior to the global financial crisisa position the current government inherited. The member for Melbourne's proposed bill, the Banking Amendment (Delivering Essential Financial Services) Bill 2010, is predicated on seeking to control the level of bank profits and interest rate rises. Restricting banks' ability to price service offerings profitably and restricting their ability to set on interest rates according to funding costs will result in them seeking to achieve savings elsewhere. As an offset, the banks may seek to reduce interest rates on investment products which, in turn, will put additional pressure on retirees, who rely on the interest income from their term deposit and investment accounts to fund their retirement income. In addition, if the banks offer overseas investors lower inget terest rates, they may also seek new investment alternatives, thereby reducing capital in the system further and consequently pushing interests higher. Therefore, all the options outlined in the proposed bill, rather than mitigating the risk of further interest rate increases, will produce the opposite effect and actually create preconditions for further interest rates rises. The questions raised by this bill include whether additional regulations in the banking sector provide the consumer with any significant benefits and whether more regulation will reduce the costs for consumers. The member's proposed bill seeks to amend the Banking Act in four main ways: that banks offer basic transaction accounts that are free from account-keeping fees and penalty fees and limit other fees to a level sufficient to recover the cost to the bank; that transactions at a bank's own-branded ATMs are free of charge; that charges for the use of the bank's ATMs by customers of another authorised deposit-taking institution are capped at the cost of service provision; and that banks provide a debit card linked to the account. In the second reading of this proposed legislation in the Senate, Senator Bob Brown stated: Recently, consumer organisations have successfully campaigned for a better deal from the banks. The banks have responded to some extent and voluntarily improved their approach to fees in some areas. For example, now most banks do not charge their own customers for the use of another bank's ATMs, even though it is open to them to do so. Other banks have dropped overdrawn account fees and reduced their other penalty fees. number of banks have also introduced fee-free or low fee basic accounts for low income customers. A quick check of the transactional products available through the major banks and some of the smaller banks and credit unions shows that most institutions already provide these types of accounts. The requirement to provide a real-time warning of a proposed fee and the ability to cancel the transaction already exists for ATM transactions when conducting a transaction at a foreign ATM. The other requirements, particularly the requirement to advise of a fee in the event of an electronic or face-to-face transaction, will impose additional burdens on merchants and service providers and potentially be embarrassing to the account holder as this would be a discussion conducted in the public arena. I certainly would not be happy to be standing in the queue at Woolworths paying for my groceries when the checkout operator has to ask me whether I am happy to proceed with the transaction because a small fee is payable. Seriously, am I going to say no and put all the groceries back? I think not, of course. As an example of what these fees pay for, I set up a new online account over the weekend and within the space of half an hour my bank suspended the credit card used for the payment pending confirmation from me of the transaction. I phoned the 24-hour service line and confirmed the transaction, at which time they removed the suspension and also suggested an alternative account type to reduce my monthly fees. This is a great example of why the proposed bill is not required. This bill is just another example of unnecessary legislation that is seeking to absolve customers from taking personal responsibility for understanding and managing their own financial affairs. Terry MCCrann, in the Courier Mail on 18 November, wrote: A The Greens' stupidity is exquisite at both the micro and macro levels. Ban ‘foreign' ATM withdrawal fees. The effect will be to ban most ATM withdrawals as the banks stop allowing ‘foreign' withdrawals. The end result would be reduced consumer access and flexibility. The other major problem with this bill is the attempt to place restrictions on interest rates that banks charge on their loans. This would be the final nail in the coffin for consumers and small business in being able to obtain finance at reasonable rates. Already small to medium business borrowers, despite providing all the same security and in most cases more security than a home loan borrower and through the necessity to provide personal guarantees and charges over business assets, are paying a significantly higher interest rate on their business loans than home loan borrowers. This differential is made all the more ludicrous when you consider that the small to medium business owner, who has a home loan and a business loan, will be paying two different rates of interest yet both loans will have the same security, and repayment of both will be funded from the income generated in the business. Phil Ruthven from Access Economic noted in a presentation earlier this year that the primary driver of recessions in Australia was not a fall in consumer spending but the direct result of the fact that business had lost access to capital to continue to grow and develop. The government's response to the global financial crisis has reduced competition in the provision of banking services in Australia and, as it continues to borrow $100 million or more per day, is continuing to put upward pressure on interest rates and is reducing the capital available in the market for small to medium business. This capital would be far better allocated by business as it would seek to utilise that capital productively to employ staff, manufacture goods and make a profit. The coalition, by contrast, is seeking via its nine-point plan to create a positive framework in which competition is enhanced via: an investigation by the ACCC of anticompetitive practices such as price signalling; an investigation by APRA into unnecessary bank risks to pursue short-term returns; regular reporting of bank interest margins, returns on equity and profitability; more government support for small lenders; improved liquidity for the mortgage backed securities market; a complete review of the financial system; further simplification of the Financial Services Reform Act to reduce cost and complexity; an investigation by APRA into the banks' lending practices for small business; and investigation as to whether banks should be able to issue ‘covered bonds'. It is through positive market based solutions, together with considered regulation and the government removing itself from the market by returning to budget surpluses, that a better outcome will be achieved by all parties to allow our economy to grow and prosper.",199
234,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,BANKING AMENDMENT,"When I seconded this motion I did so to allow debate on what is a very important issue. While I do not agree with the Banking Amendment (Delivering Essential Financial Services) Bill 2010, I think it is important that we have this debate here tonight. It is that reason that I seconded the motion. One of the things that distinguishes this bill which the Greens have put forward from the nine-point plan which the opposition have put forward is that at least the Greens have taken some time to sit down and think about what the issues and problems are and how to address them. From the shadow Treasurer we got a nine-point thought bubble, which went through what he could think up on the day. In fact, he did not even think it up on the day; he took a couple of days to come up with those nine points. He was all over the place on the first day. He got a little bit better as time went on, but he was still all over the place trying to exploit this issue for cheap political gain. He is not thinking about, in any sense, the long-term consequences of what he is actually proposing. I acknowledge that that is in stark contrast to this bill that has been put forward with some proposals for the right intention. This government has been looking at and acting on competition in the banking industry for some time. I was chairing an inquiry into banking competition in 2008 when the global financial crisis came. Of course that changed a whole range of issues that this country and the international economies had to face. We were talking then about bank survival. One of the things that we need to recognise is that Australia, through its regulations, was able to come through that banking crisis with its banks intact and still AAA rated. By the end of the global financial crisis there were only seven banks in the world in that position, and four of them were Australian. That is worth acknowledging at the start. The government also looked at ways in which we could come up with competition, and the Treasurer took up those recommendations. There was one which was most imfor portant. What we saw in the nineties, through securitisation, was cheaper loans being made available through second-tier lenders. Once the global financial crisis came, securitisation and the wholesale market totally tightened up. This government invested over $16 billion in AAA-rated RMBSs to make sure that they were available for those second-tier lenders to be able to continue in the market and play some role in competition, because at the end of the day what is going to drive cheaper interest rates and better service for consumers is competition in this industry. It is not about regulating to such a degree that competition is taken out. We need to provide the right environment-and some of that involves some regulation-for competition to flourish and we have been able to do that in some areas. For example, this bill goes to ATM fees. The reforms that we put in place in ATM fees have seen a reduction of over $120 million in fees taken from consumers. That has come about through regulation and also by making sure that there is competition in ATM fees, and it is important that we make sure that that is able to continue. We also need to recognise that there are still global difficulties with wholesale funding, and they will continue while the global economy is in the state it is. The Treasurer has announced that a second tranche of reforms is coming. Those reforms will be aimed squarely at putting Australian consumers in a better position, to make sure they can take advantage of competition as it emerges post the global financial crisis. That is the best thing that we can do. We need to make sure that switching is, and continues to be, an option. Sometimes there is reference to the number of people who have switched. The reforms that came through last time ensured that switching was an option and that those who did not switch were given better conditions by the bank they stayed with. This is an important debate that we needed to have, and I am glad that we have had the opportunity to have this debate here today.",201
235,Mr WILKIE,BANKING AMENDMENT,"I rise to condemn the arrogant behaviour of Australia's big four banks and to speak in support of reform of Australia's banking sector. I, along with many Australians, was shocked on Melbourne Cup Day when the Commonwealth Bank announced a rate hike of 45 basis points, almost double the official rate rise. But, regrettably, I was not surprised when ANZ, NAB and Westpac all followed suit, each putting their pursuit of profit above the public interest as they raised their rates over and above the Reserve Bank's one-quarter of one per cent. The banks cried poor and blamed rising funding costs, but these are the same corporations enjoying record combined profits of more than $20,000 million a year-yes, well over $20,000 million a year. As an argument, funding cost pressures simply do not stack up, because the banks are raking it in and there is simply no basis for their claim that they are in strife. Moreover, the bosses of Australia's big four banks earn between them $44 million a year-yes, $44 million a year between four individuals-and that is simply outrageous. Here we are picking up the tab for billion-dollar profits and million-dollar salaries, and we are not happy about it. Something has got to give. The balance needs to shift back to the community, which not too long ago helped these same banks survive the global financial crisis. The banks came running when they were in trouble and the government gave them a hand. Now it is the banks' turn to return the favour and give the Australian community a break. With their combined $21-plus billion profit a year, a bit of consideration for the public interest is not something that is going to break the bank. It is time for change and, since the banks will not act, it is time for political leaders to act. I for one will support any sensible reform which reins the banks in. Of course the banks say that we do not understand how it all works. ‘It's complicated,' they say. They call outspoken politicians ‘populist' and tell us to butt out and stop bashing the banks. Well, I will not buy that, Mr Deputy Speaker. There is some bashing going on all right, but it is not the banks getting bashed; it is their customers. It is my job to stick up for my constituents, not for the banks, and that is exactly what I am going to do. In my electorate of Denison people are doing it tough right now. Power bills have risen and they are going to keep on going up. A pensioner from Moonah wrote to the Mercury newspaper recently recounting how she had received a $900 winter power bill and to conserve energy she was only using two rooms in her house. That is no way to survive, let alone to live. The constituents of Denison are also paying more for other essentials like water and housing. They need a break, not another demand for more money from corporations raking in the profits. And it is not just people paying off mortgages who suffer from these rate hikes. It is also the businesses, whose customers have less money to spend, and the children, who see less of their parents, who have to work longer hours. It also includes young people trying to buy their first house and tenants whose rents rise with interest rates. I am pleased to see that some communities are fighting back. I was delighted to lend my support to a push by the Glenorchy community to buy a franchise of its local Bendigo Bank to create a community bank that will return half of its profits back to the local community. I will do my bit. I have pledged to become a founding shareholder, and I have already opened an account into which I will deposit my electoral allowance. I applaud the shadow Treasurer for taking a stand of sorts with his ideas about reining in the banks. I see merit in the shadow Treasurer's approach. Now we have the Greens' commendable proposal in the bill that we are debating today, and again I see merit. Disappointingly, we have seen little from the government, except a vague promise of a plan some time soon. The Prime Minister stands on the world stage and complains that banks are ripping off Australians; but, so far, she has done nothing to stop them, and that is not good enough. Again, I remind the government that it is well behind time for action on the greedy banking sector and that I will support any sensible reform which reins it in. Debate adjourned. Australian Stock Exchange",202
236,Mr KATTER,BANKING AMENDMENT,"I move: That this House: (1) resolves that it will oppose any sale of the Australian Securities Exchange that would provide majority foreign ownership; and (2) notes that such a sale would not merely involve the ASX as an asset, but may hand over to a foreign corporation the regulatory function inherent in a stock exchange. In moving this motion, I recall sitting in this place while I watched the six great mining companies of Australia-many of my forebears had gone down their mines and had done various other things to contribute to the growth of those companies-sold off to foreign ownership. We have for the first time in probably 30 or 40 years a trading surplus in this country, but of course the balance of payments is skyrocketing out of control. I cannot help but mention Mr Keating. When the balance of payments was $15 billion, he said, ‘We're in danger of becoming a banana republic.' When it hit $23 billion, the Leader of the Opposition at the time, John Howard, reminded him of the statement and said, ‘It was the overwhelming problem above all else.' It is now $60 billion, not $15 billion‘a banana republic'; and not $23 billion‘the overwhelming problem above all else'. I am only a humble Cloncurry boy and a simple backbencher in the parliament of Australia, so I do not know about these things. But these two men had held the offices of Treasurer and Prime Minister of this country, and so if anyone should have known about the serious nature of the balance of payments it should have been them, yet the six great mining companies of Australia were flogged off to overseas ownership and now the great profits that come into Australia from coal mining, aluminium and iron ore simply boomerang back out again. So whilst Australia has a trade surplus its balance of paymentssome five or six per cent of our GDP-is one of the worse in the entire world. Members in this parliament stood here and agreed to the sale of these great mining companies-Western Mining Corporation, BHP, North, Normandy and MIM, which was in my own backyard. Since the deregulation of the dairy industry in 2000, we have watched over its sale. The five corporations that count for about 80 or 90 per cent of our dairy processing are now foreign owned. Like the mining companies, they were all Australian owned some 15 years ago. Also, 40 per cent of our meat works has gone overseas. AMH, as you are well aware, was Australian owned and accounted for most of the processing of meat in this country. Golden Circle and IXL are the great processing giants of Australian fruits and vegetables. Our horticultural industries have vanished under foreign ownership. The AWB, arguably the biggest corporation in this country, is in the process of being flogged off overseas, as is two-thirds of our sugar industry. Every one of these things was Australian owned. Now every single one of them-the great juggernauts of Australian industry-is foreign owned. We are here tonight not to discuss the sale of chook farms or factories or any of the other tangible assets which I have referred to but to discuss another sale-and this is a qualitative change. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to be able to speak to you without listening to other peopleMr Hockey-I'm trying to find a seconder.",203
237,Mr KATTER,BANKING AMENDMENT,"Righto. Thank you for that. What we are now referring to is a qualitative change. It is not like the sale of a chook farm or a factory; this is the sale of a regulatory mechanism that facilitates the proper functioning of the share market. People need to be able to buy and sell shares, confident in the knowledge that they are protected from manipulation. If the sale of the Australian Stock Exchange proceeds, it will be in the hands of a foreign corporation that is substantially owned by a foreign government. So we will have a foreign government owning a sovereign power of the Australian people. I will not go into the details of the takeover bid for Coles by certain people on the board of Coles, but effectively these peoac- ple lent an XYZ company money from Coles. This company then bought shares in Coles so that a certain person, who was a supplier of many items to Coles, could become chairman of the board of Coles and control it. That is the sort of thing that needs to be looked at by a stock exchange. If that company were, for example, a Singapore based company, one would think that certain prejudices would run in favour of the Singapore based company at the expense of Australian shareholders. I am well aware of the tightly held nature of companies where shares are held by very few people. They can very easily manipulate the price up by a little bit of buying on the market or manipulate the price down if it suits them so they can buy more shares and more control of the company. We have a stock exchange not only to facilitate the buying and selling of shares but also to regulate it and see that it does not become an instrument of manipulation and deceit. That is why this is different from selling a chook farm or selling a factory. This is a case of selling a very important asset of this country, a sovereign mechanism. This is more in the nature of selling the arbitration commission. It mean seem that I am reaching a long way if I say selling the High Court, but this is a regulatory mechanism that is part of the sovereign powers of the Australian people. All right, you want to sell the railways. I am diametrically opposed to the sale of that great asset, the railways in Queensland. But if you are going to do that, that is qualitatively entirely different to selling a regulatory mechanism, what we are discussing here today. Those in this place sat on their hands and did nothing while the great mining companies of Australia were flogged off to foreigners, and now all those great profits are sailing out of this country. To me, trying to impose a tax upon the miners is well and truly attempting to shut the gate after the horse has long ago bolted. I remember the great Vince Gauci at MIM pleading with the board not to sell Mount Isa Mines. I think every single year for the first four years after the sale the company made more profit in each year than the stupid board members had sold the company for. It was similar with dairy factories, meat works, horticultural processing, Golden Circle, IXL, the Australian Wheat Board-great institutions set up by the Australian people. I remind the House before I conclude that Ben Chifley always claimed that it was the ALP that regulated and introduced the AWB, the single-desk seller in the wheat industry. That was technically correct. Jack MCEwen always violently altercated with him and claimed it was the Country Party that had been formed for the purposes of achieving a single-desk seller in the wheat industry. That was why the Country Party was actually formed. But they always fought. They had substantial arguments. Today we see people vying for the privilege of flogging off the assets of Australia and even our regulatory mechanisms. In this place we must tenaciously oppose the sale of regulatory mechanisms. Even if you agree to the sale of Australia's assets-which I do not-you cannot agree to the sale of a regulatory mechanism that is being proposedthat is if it is being proposed-in this place. I hope that it most certainly is not. In conclusion, we had a joke when I was a young person about the sort of bloke that would sell you the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The only thing that surprises Australians today is that we have not sold the Sydney Harbour Bridge, but don't hold your breath. I take great pleasure in having moved this resolution. Mr Bandt-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",204
238,Dr LEIGH,BANKING AMENDMENT,"Australia has a strict and comprehensive regulatory process in place to ensure that decisions on proposals like this are always taken in our national interest. The government also has a strong commitment to build Australia as a finance centre and a regional hub for financial services. Of course, this means preserving the market integrity of the ASX and continuing to boost Australia's reputation as one of the most attractive investment destinations in the world. A proposal of this type is subject to extensive regulatory consideration under both Australia's foreign investment policy and the Corporations Act. Australia applies a rigorous national interest test to all proposals for foreign government investment and significant foreign private investment. This particularly applies to a transaction of this scale and importance. The screening process to consider the proposal will be undertaken by the Foreign Investment Review Board in the normal way. FIRB will seek advice from other government agencies, including ASIC and the Reserve Bank, on whether the proposal is contrary to the national interest. government always has taken-and always will take-these decisions in Australia's national interest. This is the overriding considtransparency eration for foreign investment proposals. As members may be aware, on 1 August 2010 the government transferred supervision of Australia's financial markets to ASIC. These reforms will enhance the integrity of Australia's financial markets and help promote Australia as a financial services hub in our region. Australia's financial regulators put their world-class reputation beyond doubt during the crisis. Our financial system came through with flying colours. Australia's financial system has performed better than any other during the global financial crisis and these reforms will ensure that Australia's regulatory arrangements remain among the best in the world. The ASX is an important part of financial system's architecture. The government will continue to consider all transactions with an objective of carefully and methodically building Australia's reputation as a financial services hub in the national interest. Australia's foreign investment framework is long standing and reflects strong bipartisan support over a number of decades. It balances the need to ensure Australia's economy can benefit from foreign investment with the need to ensure that investment is in the national interest. The government examines all foreign government investment proposals and significant private investment proposals on a case-by-case basis to ensure they are in the national interest. This means assessing the impact on the economy, the community, national security and revenue. Federal Labor has also made important improvements to the foreign investment framework. We released national interest principles to improve transparency around The how the national interest test is applied. In June of this year we released the easy-to-read version of the policy to further improve of the regime. Our approach maximises investment flows, grows regional communities and creates job opportunities right across Australia, while protecting our national interests. In conclusion, I draw the House's attention to the findings of the Johnson report earlier this year, which noted: Economic research demonstrates a well established causal link from financial sector development to economic growth. Having an open, efficient, well-regulated and competitive financial sector is thus in the interests of all Australians. NA",205
239,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Same-sex Marriage",206
240,Mr HAWKE,ADJOURNMENT,"This week the member for Melbourne moved a motion in relation to gay marriage which has received widespread coverage throughout Australia. I thought it timely to put on the record on behalf of my constituents some of my thoughts and also my early consultations in relation to this matter. I want to start by expressing that I do not hold a view that people should not be treated equally under the law and in relation to their financial arrangements or in relation to their relationship outcomes by the Commonwealth government. However, I think that there are those institutions in our society today which have formed the bedrock of our success as a nation. My electorate of Mitchell has the highest number of couples with dependent children of any electorate in Australia today. I can tell you that it is a very successful formula to have married couples with children living in communities in a way that is for the purpose of bringing up children. It does lead to a great flavour in my suburbs for people raising their children. It is the case that the tion believes that marriage is between a man and a woman. It sounds obvious, but it always has been. I think that these attempts to alter the definition of marriage or to implement radical change to this important construct at such a time in our national debate are ill thought out and unhelpful. There is the idea that we need to achieve equality. We are not a society of equality. We are not a society that seeks complete equality for all of our citizens. It is not a goal that we will ever achieve and it is not a goal that I believe is worthwhile. We certainly seek equal opportunity. We certainly seek the equal opportunity for every citizen to gain what they can from our society in a free and unimpeded way. However, there are those constructs and important institutions that provide a platform for our stable society. Marriage is one of those. Indeed, while it is the case that many marriages today end in failure and an increasing rate of those marriages are not successful, it is not the case that there is a powerful or persuasive argument for radical change to such an important institution. Marriage has been one of the foundational institutions of our society, especially for the bringing up of children. There is nothing that I have heard in this debate that has been brought forward to alter that very important view. This is not a view about financial entitlement. This is not an argument about people accessing rights that they are entitled to. This is about an institution which has always existed under a certain definition which some people are now seeking to alter and to access for their own purposes. However, I think there is an important role for marriage to play. It is something that I want to defend. Family, I believe, is the most important institution in our society. Families take different shapes and they have different forms. Different religions and cultures have coalialways come to the conclusion that the family is one of those bedrock institutions. Our society in Australia today is built on the institution of heterosexual marriage between a man and a woman. That does not mean that there is not a case to be made for civil unions. It does not mean that there is not a case for other forms of partnerships or relationships to be recognised by the government. In fact, that is a worthy objective. It is something that would see the support of many members in this place in order to move with the times. However, I can say from the consultations in my electorate so far that I have received much correspondence greatly concerned about the institution of marriage and redefining it in a way that would alter its basic substance and composition and ultimately lead to it changing in a way that would have a radical effect on our society. It is also the case in New South Wales that the government recently passed a law to allow for gay adoption. This is another unusual and radical move in the view of many when it is almost impossible for loving couples, men and women seeking to adopt children, to obtain an adoption today, which is of grave concern. By saying, ‘Now we want to allow gay adoption without having gay marriage,' we certainly are proceeding down a path of radical change to the composition of our society without much thought and in a way that does not seem to be well supported by any evidence or any view that this will improve the quality of outcomes for children or the family unit. In concluding I want to say to the member for Melbourne that he does not need to move a motion to tell us to consult, because the people of Australia are consulting with us. They are communicating their view and, from the electorate of Mitchell, they are saying to me that marriage is an important institution. It is a traditional institution between man and a woman, and a radical alteration is not required at this time. Building the Education Revolution Senior Constable Ian Edwards",206
241,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to share two pieces of positive news. First and foremost, like most of my colleagues, I have been going around to see many of my local Building the Education Revolution projects, celebrating their openings and celebrating the investment in those fantastic projects. Recently I was at East Ulverstone Primary School, Forth Primary School-my local village primary schooland West Ulverstone Primary. Around $6 million has been invested in a number of different projects associated with these primary schools, part of nearly $100 million invested in my region's 63 schools throughout some 95 projects. So I want to congratulate everyone involved with those projects and the many more in my electorate. It is positive news-investment in jobs and fantastic facilities for teaching and learning. And these are projects that are available to the community. This is all very good and positive news. The second thing I would like to do is congratulate a fantastic individual in my electorate-Burnie policeman Senior Constable Ian Edwards. Ian has of course in no sense ever sought this, but he has been awarded a Tasmanian outstanding achiever award and most recently the Australian of the Year local hero award for Tasmania. He is now in line for the national award. In his role in the police force, Ian has put together a group called Kommunity Kids that is based in Shorewell Park in Burnie. Shorewell Park, unfortunately, has had a stigmatised history for violence, antisocial behaviour and alienation. It is a community a that has felt at times to be under siege. Part and parcel of that has been the antisocial behaviour of young people, a lot of which was because, along with a number of their parProgram ents, they felt that they were not part of a fully functioning community. Ian saw the need there and, along with a number of his colleagues, set up an outreach of the Burnie Police and Community Youth Committee and the Tasmanian Police Youth Intervention Committee. Kommunity Kids came together on 21 May 2008 with about eight children. Since then it has grown to at least 120 kids with anywhere from 23 to 50 young persons and their parents and friends joining in the weekly after-school activities, including art and craft in the community house nearby on Tuesdays and outdoor activities and sport on Wednesdays. I know they get pretty active because I have been up to join them on a number of occasions. Kommunity Kids also participate in a number of other activities throughout the year, including Tasmania Day events, the Big Burnie Bike Ride at West Park and miscellaneous school holiday events. The Kommunity Kids board, with Ian Edwards as chairman, is made up of members from City Mission, Burnie Community House, Tasmania Police, Fusion, Anglicare who, together with the Burnie City Council Youth Development Officer, actively assist in the after-school activities. A group of young people are also part of a committee to raise funds for a cycle path in the local park. I must congratulate the Burnie City Council, along with Ian and Kommunity Kids, for getting an investment of $50,000 towards linking up their pathways at Shorewell across through to Wiseman Park, and they are using these pathways as road safety teaching areas. The kids can now have a bit of fun learning about road safety by riding on these pathways and they will also have a barbecue and shelter area they can use for their activities. Ian is a very humble man and has been quite startled by the awards that have been presented to him. I know he does this because he loves the kids, he loves the area he lives in and he is very dedicated to his munity. I congratulate him; I thank him on behalf of the community and I wish him well in the national awards. I have a sneaking feeling that Ian Edwards and Kommunity Kids will be bringing back the bacon to Shorewell Park, which they have really helped to transform into a very positive community. (Time expired) Durack Electorate: Western Australian Tourism Awards",208
242,Mr HAASE,ADJOURNMENT,"It gives me a great deal of pleasure to rise this evening to speak about awards. On last Saturday evening at the Burswood Entertainment Complex, the Tourism Council of Western Australia, an independent organisation governed by members within Western Australia, held the Western Australian tourism awards. This is brag time for me because of the 30 awards available in Western Australia the electorate of Durack took out 13 gold, four silver and six bronze. That is an outstanding effort, Mr Speaker, I am sure you would agree. I would like to refer the House to some of the winners. Under tourist attractions we got a silver medal for the Western Australian Museum in Geraldton. For festivals and events we got a gold for the Argyle Diamonds Ord Valley Muster. For ecotourism we got a gold for Pearl Sea Coastal Cruises and a silver for Eco Beach Wilderness Retreat. In Indigenous tourism we got a gold for the Eco Beach Wilderness Retreat, a silver for the Home Valley Station and a bronze for Uptuyu Adventures. For tour and/or transport operators we got a gold for Kimberley Wild Expeditions and a silver for Pearl Sea Coastal Cruises. Under adventure tourism we got a gold for Ningaloo Reef Dreaming and a bronze for Three Islands Whale Shark Dive. Under tourism education and training we got a bronze for Home Valley Station. For tourist com- and caravan parks we got a gold for Aspen Park's Exmouth Cape Holiday Park. For backpacker accommodation we got a gold for Blue Reef Backpackers and the Aspen Park's Exmouth Cape Holiday Park. Under unique accommodation we got a gold for Eco Beach Wilderness Retreat. For deluxe accommodation we got a gold for Kununurra Country Club Resort and a bronze for Habitat Resort Broome. For luxury accommodation we got a gold for Pinctada Cable Beach Spa and Resort. For new tourism development we got a bronze for Skydive of Jurien Bay. The Qantas award for excellence in sustainable tourism was won by the Eco Beach Wilderness Retreat. I will not go on with all of the details but in addition to the wins mentioned we won the Sir David Brand Medal, the Sir David Brand Young Achiever Medal and the Sir David Brand Award for Tourism. So there were three awards in Sir David Brand's memory and all three were won by the Durack electorate. Let me explain to you about those special awards. The award for tourism went to Willie Creek Pearls. Willie Creek Pearls is now an institution in Broome, providing an all-round opportunity for tourists who want to understand the pearling industry, to enjoy luxury, to take a chopper ride over Broome and up the magnificent coast and to have the opportunity to purchase those luxury silver south sea pearls from the Broome area. The Sir David Brand Medal went to Jon Jessup. Jon Jessup in the past 25 years has devoted 100 per cent of his time to the Western Australian tourism industry. He is a shrewd businessman, there is no doubt about that, but he is prepared to put in the hard work. Currently he is the marketing manager for Kalbarri Edge and he is also operating two regional resorts as director. He has very little spare time, I can assure you. The winner of the Sir David Brand Young Achiever Medal, which is a particular award that we like to underline because it indicates that we have got good young stock coming up through the tourism industry in Western Australia, was Frances Jones. Frances moved into the Western Australian tourism industry in 2008. Starting her career at Edge Resorts, Frances developed her passion for tourism which drives her today. Later in 2008 Frances took up a full-time position at Wooleen Station as tourism manager and now resides there permanently with her partner David Pollock. In 2009 Frances started a degree in ecotourism through Murdoch University, and studies externally at the station. In late she took up the position of chair for Gascoigne and Murchison Tourism Inc. and in mid-2010 was elected to the board of Australia's Golden Outback. Golden Outback represents well the magnificent attractions and services provided by those businesses in the Durack electorate. I believe that I am absolutely justified in bragging about these achievements on behalf of my electorate and God bless the Western Australian tourism industry. (Time expired) Billboard Advertising  my electorate of Moreton we have one of the best golf courses at Tennyson in Queensland, the Brisbane Golf Club, in Tennyson. It has been about five years since I played golf at the Brisbane Golf ClubMr Kelvin Thomson-A life balance problem.  ance problem. I was playing with a guy called Lee Crocker. Unfortunately, we were beaten by his brother, Dene Crocker. Playing golf there the course comes right down to Fairfield Road. Standing at that part of the golf course you can look on one side and see a billboard and on the other side you can see a rather nondescript building. I noticed this the other day when I drove down Fairfield Road. However, the billboard was completely offensive. Initially, because it was on the way to the dump, I thought it was something to do with making sure all rubbish was safely tied down, but it was not-it was a very offensive billboard. If you look 100 metres down the road, also near the golf course, you can see a brothel. You would not know it was a brothel because it has only one street number on it and that is all. I point this out- Mr Speaker, you are looking a bit bemused-because I want to talk about ownership of public space not 2009 only in my electorate but throughout Queensland and Australia. On one hand we have a brothel which is very nondescript, nonoffensive and would not upset anyone taking their kids to school. The road is very busy, with nearly 50,000 car movements a day. I have a five-year-old child, so I am very aware of this. He is just starting to spell out words and he sees a very offensive billboard. I want to put out there the idea that we need to reclaim our public spaces. We have lots of weeks here-we have Liver Week, Mental Health Week. So I think we need to have a ‘Back to middle-class values week' where we reclaim public spaces",209
243,Unknown,ADJOURNMENT,"Opposition members interjecting jection opposite but the reality is that brothels do exist. At least we understand what they are doing. At least they are not as offensive to the eye, I would suggest, as some of these billboards. You see a similar thing when you go to a newspaper shop. Lots of young kids go to newsagents. Newspapers have competitions where they encourage kids to collect dinosaurs and all sorts of things. Obviously there are parts of newspaper shops where you do not want kids to go. Adult publications are covered up but there are also quite confronting as out the front of newspapers shops. I am not a prude. I have been accused of being lots of things in this parliament but being a prude is not one of them. Dr Southcott-No. We've read your book.  read my book. If you have read the book, you would know that it contains nothing as confronting as some of these billboard advertisements. Also, if you buy my book and read it you make a choice, whereas a five year-old kid or a 10-year-old kid who is being driven to school does not make a choice about the billboard they see or the as they see out the front of the newsagents. This matter was raised by Guy Barnett, a Liberal senator, when looking generally at the classification of what Australians need to see. It is something I have considered and I intend to talk to Senator Barnett about. I know this matter has been recommended to go to Senator Trish Crossin's Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It is certainly something I care passiontheir ately about. With modern electronic billboards what you see at 8.30 at night is not necessarily what you need to see at 8.30 in the morning when kids are going to school. With electronic billboards we can now have more confronting material after 8.30 at night, as we do with television. And there are entertainment precincts where the advertisements might be completely different from what we see at school. Obviously, billboard advertising is all about selling material rather than looking after decency. It is more important that we make sure public decency is looked after. That is something the Gillard Labor government can play a role in. I look forward to consulting with Senator Crossin and with Senator Barnett to see how we might assist them in that process. Dawson Electorate: Sugar Harvest",211
244,Mr CHRISTENSEN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to bring to the attention of the House and of the government a new crisis unfolding for the sugar industry, in particular for growers in the electorate of Dawson. In what is likely to be a one-in-20-year or perhaps even a one-in-30-year weather event, there has been significant rainfall along the Dawson coastline, impacting on the sugar growing communities of Mackay, Proserpine and the Whitsundays and the Burdekin. This rainfall has also impacted on the sugar growing district of Herbert, which the member for Kennedy represents, and Sarina, Walkerston and the Pioneer Valley, which the member for Capricornia represents. For the first time in a long time, 2010 was a year of opportunity for growers. For years and years, the industry has been through many adversities. They have been through drought, orange rust and the corrupt world market prices, they have beaten deregulation and they have beaten the cane smut disease. At the end of last year, with world prices in favour, it seemed 2010 was going to be a good season for growers. But on Friday the mood of the industry was summed up at the AGM of Mackay Canegrowers by chairman Paul Schembri when he said: The weather can make or break you, everyone in the value chain of the industry will suffer. very hard to see the fruits of your labour washed down the drain. While growers are in receipt of some of the best world sugar prices, they have not been able to take advantage of the situation because they cannot marry-up the high prices with tonnage. High rainfall levels have near brought the harvest to a halt in all canegrowing areas in Dawson, with much of the crop unable to be cut or now so low in sugar content that it almost is not worth cutting out. In the Mackay region, which includes Walkerston and the Pioneer Valley, there are some 645,372 tonnes of cane left, while in Sarina there are 261,300 tonnes of cane left. The total value of cane that will probably have to be abandoned for the region is more than $36 million. In Proserpine and the Whitsundays, there are 447,000 tonnes left and Proserpine Sugar has closed the harvest. The value of the crop left is almost $17 million. In the Burdekin the situation is much worse, with near one-third of the cane not yet harvested, and with wet weather continuing it seems unlikely to be harvested. Total tonnage of cane remaining uncut is 2.9 million tonnes at a value of $180 million to the mill and the grower. This sad situation comes on top of severe damage to the crop earlier in the year when Cyclone Ului crossed the coast near the Whitsundays. Due to Ului, growers in Proserpine sustained a near 10 per cent production loss attributed to cane loss and a five per cent productivity loss due to reduced sugar content. In Mackay and Sarina, Ului's impact meant that growers suffered a near five per cent production loss attributed to cane loss and a near five per cent productivity loss due to reduced sugar content. Some growers in Proserpine and the northern rural coast of Mackay were said to have lost more than 30 per cent of projected production due to Cyclone Ului. The combined loss estimate beIt is cause of the cyclone was $52 million. Ului on its own was something the industry was able to withstand but, combined with severe and ongoing heavy rainfall since then, the situation is now diabolical for the industry. Queensland Sugar Ltd, or QSL, contacted my office on Friday to report that while they were expecting to export 3.2 million tonnes this year they are now going to be lucky to meet 2.4 million tonnes. This is a reduction of 25 per cent and, according to QSL, it means more than $350 million worth of export revenues that would normally have flowed on to millers, growers and regional Queensland communities is down the drain. Particularly worrying for growers is that this has happened when forward pricing, which came about with the deregulation of the industry, is now widely used within the industry. Many growers have forward sold a portion of their 2010 crop and now face having to pay that back in some manner as the rainfall has made them unable to achieve the harvested crop that they could have had. There are measures being mooted to help growers by taking the loss out of the income from next year's crop, but the situation is looking grim there too. A lot of farmers had already planted their 2011 crop before the rainfall and most of this has now died. Next year's crop will undoubtedly be impacted, probably with a lower sugar content due to a constrained growing time. I say this situation is diabolical as it threatens to send many farmers to the wall financially and I have had some anecdotal reports that some growers are on suicide watch because of the stress of the situation. Today I have written to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Prime Minister asking them to visit one of the sugar-growing regions with a view to extending exceptional circumstances provisions immediately to growers who are impacted. I plead with the government to do what it can to help growers who have been floored again by this new setback. Social and Community Workers Disability Insurance Scheme",211
245,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,ADJOURNMENT,"In October 2009 the federal Labor government signed a heads of agreement with the Australian Services Union which made a number of commitments about supporting an equal remuneration case to be considered by Fair Work Australia for nongovernment social and community services workers. The heads of agreement included a commitment to preserve the rates of pay achieved in the Queensland equal pay case. The Australian Services Union lodged an application for the equal remuneration case with Fair Work Australia in March this year. The application is for the rates of pay that were achieved in the Queensland equal pay case in 2009. The effects of the increases are different in each state but are in the same general range as in Queensland-that is, increases of between 18 per cent and 37 per cent. The Australian Services Union has put to Fair Work Australia that the work done by workers covered by the Social and Community Services Award is undervalued as against comparable work. The Australian Services Union says that 87 per cent of these workers are women and historically their work has been undervalued because of the gender of the workforce. I met with the Australian Services Union in the middle of this year after they contacted me seeking my support for their application. I agree with the ASU that workers in the social, community and disability services sector do work of great importance in our community, and that this work has tended to be undervalued. Caring for those with a disability, for example, is very arduous and yet it is really very important work, essential to giving family members and other carers the respite they need to be able to keep on going. I therefore wrote in July to the honourable Jenny Macklin, as the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, expressing my support for the ASU application. I further said I supported funding for the outcome of the Fair Work Australia equal remuneration case and funding for federal programs in Queensland that were subject to the Queensland equal pay case. Of course, in July the government went into caretaker mode and the reply I received was simply a process reply from a departmental officer. So I want to take this opportunity to reiterate my support for the ASU's equal remuneration case for social, community and disability services sector workers. I note that the federal government's submission to Fair Work Australia indicates that the government is committed to pay equity; acknowledges the vital services that the social and community services sector delivers to some of the most vulnerable members of our society; recognises that much of the work performed in the sector is undervalued; and is committed to working through the funding implications of any increase in wages awarded in partnership with the affected unions, employers in the sector, and the states and territories. I urge Fair Work Australia to support the ASU's application and urge federal, state and territory governments, and non-government employers in the sector, to give effect to Fair Work Australia's conclusions. At a conference in Bendigo recently I addressed the topic of a national disability insurance scheme. I want to congratulate Mary Reid and the other members of the Physical Disability Council of Victoria on their efforts in organising this conference. Participating in it reinforced my admiration for the ongoing efforts of people with a physical disability and their carers. The fact is that we do not do enough to recognise their efforts. I know we are doing better than the out-of-sight, out-ofmind approach we used to take on issues of disability but we still have a long way to go. People with disability deserve the same opportunities as other Australians to participate in the community, have access to employment and live meaningful lives. Supporting the equal remuneration case will help, but we also need to give close scrutiny to the concept of a national disability insurance scheme. My parliamentary colleague and the former Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers, the Hon. Bill Shorten, last year outlined to the National Press Club how such a scheme might work. The proposed scheme would be based on the no-fault workers' compensation model and provide support on a needs basis for people with serious disabilities. This is a very big idea-simple, yet exciting and visionary. It would mark a fundamental shift in the provision of services for people with disabilities. There sider before Australia can go down this path, but I believe it is a good idea that demands serious debate and investigation to see if it could work in our nation. I am very pleased, therefore, that federal Labor has asked the Productivity Commission to undertake a landmark, independent inquiry into the costs, benefits and feasibility of a national long term care and support scheme for people with a disability. It is time to rethink the way we support people with disability in this country and I look forward to the Productivity Commission's report. Wannon Electorate: Kindergartens",213
246,Mr TEHAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Wannon) (10.00 pm)Yesterday I had the pleasure of attending the Mount William Open Garden Day. Anne Abbott, the owner of Mount William Station, had opened her magnificent garden to raise money for the Willaura and District Kindergarten and it is on this topic, the future of our rural kindergartens, that I would like to talk tonight. The Gillard government's reform to achieve universal access to early childhood education needs to be added to a list that includes ‘the three-hour minimum work requirement' and ‘independent youth allowance changes'-a list of policymaking so bad in its execution that it beggars belief. Sarah Millear, the secretary of the Willaura and District Kindergarten, said this about what she thinks universal access to early childhood education reform under the Gillard government will mean for the Willaura and District Kindergarten: As it stands, it is extremely detrimental to our centre. By 2013 we must increase the contact hours for our four year old program from ten to fifteen hours per week. This will involve opening the Kindergarten on a third day, and aside from the additional wages, will mean extra running costs, duty and cleaning rosters, and of course a further is a lot to confunding shortfall. Already, the enforced increase of one contact hour per week in 2011 has increased our budget shortfall from $25,000 to around $38,000. The further increase in 2013 will leave us with an insurmountable fundraising requirement, forcing us to seriously consider closing the centre unless extra government funding is made available. If the Willaura Kindergarten were forced to close, there would inevitably be a drop in enrolments for the local primary school. The community playgroup and the maternal and child healthcare centre, which rely on the support of the kindergarten community, would have to look at their long-term viability as well. Three key services could be lost and the long-term future of the school put at risk. Sadly, this is not an isolated case. As reported in the Ararat Advertiser on 12 November, Lake Bolac and District Kindergarten is also: … on a fast track to closing, thanks to a lack Government funding which forces just a handful of parents to fund raise, in some cases, close to $40,000 a year. This is universal access to early childhood learning, Gillard government style. You could not fathom that they could get it so wrong for early childhood learning, but sadly you only have to look at the changes that have been made to the independent youth allowance and what that is doing to so called universal access at the tertiary level to see that, sadly, they can. Mr Champion interjecting",214
247,Mr TEHAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Well, it is true. I would invite you to come to Willaura and to meet with the community and the people involved with the kindergarten and to ask them what they think about this universal access reform for early childhood education. Your government is about to close that kindergarten and it will close other rural kindergartens across the state and no-one is doing anything about it. No-one has thought about what the implications of taking it from 10 to 15 hours are, what it will mean. Rather than having universal access, young children in country areas are going to have no access at all. I would invite the relevant minister to go to Willaura, meet with the parent group and to hear first hand about the difficulties they are going to have in the next couple of years. Go to Lake Bolac-a community of 150 people-and meet with them and see the difficulties they are going to have. You are asking them to fundraise $40,000 a year to keep their kindergarten going. The Gillard government has to be stopped in its tracks; otherwise it will rip the heart out of regional and rural Australia. It is time the Independents, who represent regional and rural electorates, recognised this. They need to cross the floor and they need to bring of down this government before it destroys the fabric of our rural communities. Hours of Work",215
248,Mr HUSIC,ADJOURNMENT,"Many Australians believe we are a laid-back country where we tell ourselves we work to live and not the other way round. But statistics tell us something different. Apparently, apart from the Japanese and Koreans, Australians work some of the longest hours in the Western world. Australians work, on average, 44 hours a week compared to the average in developed countries of 41 hours-39 if you live in a place like Norway. The other startling fact is that we work a lot of that extra time for free, translated as unpaid overtime-two billion hours of unpaid overtime, adding up to a $72 billion gift to the economy. At the same time, the growth in part-time and casual jobs has been rapid, with some workers gathering up part-time jobs simply to secure the equivalent of a full-time wage. Since the 1970s, average working hours have been on the rise after falling consistently since the beginning of the century. Broader social changes have contributed to the way paid work is allocated across the population. Women make up a greater proportion of the workforce than ever before and households often depend on two incomes. This adds to time pressures on families. The nature of work is evolving. Technology is playing a big part here, with mobiles and personal digital assistants ensuring some employees are still on the job when they are not at the job. There is no ignoring the pressure to respond on the spot, no matter what the time of day or where employees may be. Work is encroaching on other aspects of life, and more often than is necessary. We do need enough time to keep healthy, exercise, relax, sleep and develop and maintain relationships-to maintain that elusive balanced lifestyle. But the Australian Bureau of tics study How Australians use their time shows Australians are spending less time playing, sleeping, eating and drinking than 10 years ago. The Australia Institute recently undertook some work in this area and its findings should give many pause for thought. While some may argue that others choose to be income rich and time poor, the Australia Institute's research has found that only one in five Australian workers are working the hours they want to work. In fact, half of all employees would like to work less, even taking into account the effect on their income. The Australia Institute research found that, while full-time people working long hours typically want to work less, there are millions of casual and part-time workers who would like to work more hours. It is argued that if some of the ‘surplus' work hours could be reallocated to those who want more work, then progress could be made in addressing unemployment and underemployment. It is worth considering the point that, like a lack of income, the disappearance of free time may be another reflection of disadvantage in society. Additionally, I am concerned about the impact this has on health and well-being. Research shows excessive working hours can have detrimental effects on both physical and mental health, including obesity, alcoholism, cardiovascular problems and depression. If governments are serious about preventative health, then we need policies to promote reasonable working hours. I am conscious of the irony of delivering a speech on working hours at 10 minutes past 10 pm on a Monday night. There must be more transparency about the culture of working hours in particular workplaces so that current and prospective employees can make informed decisions about whether a company is an employer of Statischoice. It is only when someone begins working for a particular employer that they can assess whether that employer believes in work-life balance. Regular reporting of working hours expectations, actual working hours and staff satisfaction with working hours would allow people to make better decisions about who to work for, and also promote competition among employers to attract the best staff. In addition, governments should make work-life balance a priority through policy initiatives across a range of portfolio areas. Regular collection of data on actual versus preferred working hours, as well as various indicators of how well the labour market is matching people with the right hours, would help governments make better decisions in this regard. In a couple of days time, on 24 November, the Australia Institute will hold National Go Home on Time Day. This initiative lets employees signal clearly that there are other parts of life, such as family and their own health, that are more important than work. People participating in Go Home on Time just Day are advised simply to work only the hours they are paid for, whatever they may be, on 24 November. Of course I expect a reaction to this initiative-but that is exactly the point. If businesses are regularly hooked on the notion of extracting a certain level of unpaid work every week-at the potential personal expense of their employees-how is that good for business, our communities and our country? If this initiative sparks a conversation about working hours and helps get governments and industry thinking about addressing this issue, that cannot be a bad thing for families and our community. St Mary of the Cross",215
249,Mr FRYDENBERG,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to acknowledge the significant event that took place only a month ago commemorating the canonisation of Australia's first Catholic saint, St Mary of the Cross. As Australians gathered throughout the country, we were reminded of the transformative power of this visionary leader, Mary MACKillop. In our modern world there are too few times when we stop to acknowledge the good deeds of others. However, on October 17 2010, Australians paused to recognise the great legacy of St Mary of the Cross. Mary was born in Fitzroy, not far from my own electorate of Kooyong, in 1842. Due to her family's insufficient income, St Mary of the Cross was unable to experience formal education herself and it is without doubt that her personal experiences influenced her determination to open up education to all Australians. She was educated at home by her father, Alexander MACKillop, and was well educated in her faith. That was to be the foundation of her later religious vocation. Mary went out to work at the age of 16, needing to boost the income of her family, and that need saw her move to the small town of Penola in South Australia to work as the governess to her cousins, the Cameron children. As part of Mary's role as the family's governess, she became the primary educator of the Camerons. This role sparked in her a passion for education and a desire to provide educational services to those who were not in a position to provide this for themselves. While in Penola, she met local Catholic parish priest Father Julian Tenison Woods, who shared her concerns about the number of parishes without schools for children. It was in Father Tenison Woods that St Mary of the Cross found someone who shared her desire to improve education access for all poor and underprivileged children in Australia. I am honoured to have in my own electorate a number of individuals continuing to carry out the legacy of St Mary of the Cross-those who through their own religious vocation continue her work and that of her religious foundation are the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart. The Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart continue St Mary's mission in assisting the community at Mary MACKillop Aged Care nursing home in the Hawthorn, in the Kooyong electorate. They are the successors to the original Josephite congregation, founded in the small South Australian town of Penola by St Mary of the Cross. The Josephites, or the Brown Joeys as they are affectionately known, continue today to follow the original path set out by St Mary of the Cross. It is a true testament to St Mary's good work that many of the schools she and her sisters established throughout Australia still stand to this day. The path she forged in education and community assistance has allowed Australian children of all backgrounds the opportunity to access a full and rich education and family life. I stand here today as someone who is deeply proud of the impact St Mary of the Cross had on both the Catholic Church and the wider Australian community. I also stand here as a proud representative of an electorate with many Catholic parishes and schools who carry out the great work supported by St Mary of the Cross. Among them are All Hallows Catholic Church and Primary School, Balwyn; Genazzano College, Kew; Our Holy Redeemer Catholic Church and Primary School, Surrey Hills; Our Lady of Good Counsel Catholic Church and Primary School, Deepdene; Sacred Heart Catholic Church and Primary School, Kew; Siena College, East Camberwell; St Anne's Catholic Church and Primary School, Kew East; St Bede's Catholic Church and Primary School; North Balwyn; St Bridget's Catholic Church and Primary School, Greythorn; St Christopher's German Speaking Catholic Church, Camberwell; St Dominic's Catholic Church and Primary School, East Camberwell; St Joseph's Catholic Church and Immaculate Conception Catholic Church; St Joseph's Primary School, Hawthorn; St Paul's College, Kew; and Xavier College and Burke Hall, Kew. When St Mary of the Cross opened her first Josephite school, she wrote of a ‘humble beginning for a great work'. St Mary of the Cross reminds us all of the redeeming power available through assisting others, and her great work has left a lasting legacy of which we are all the beneficiaries. Landcare",217
250,Ms HALL,ADJOURNMENT,"Shortland) (10.15 pm)Tonight, I rise to acknowledge the fine work done by Landcare groups throughout Australia. As all members and most Australians know, Landcare is a grassroots organisation operated by volunteers, with groups in every electorate throughout Australia. The benefits delivered by this organisation to Australian communities are enormous. In addition to this benefit, Landcare delivers benefits to those tens of thousands of volunteers who work tirelessly to improve, protect and restore our environment. In the Shortland electorate there are a number of fantastic Landcare groups. When mentioning particular groups, you are always in danger of leaving a group out but just want to concentrate on a couple of groups I visited very recently. In doing would like to acknowledge the fine work done by all those other groups within the Shortland electorate and give my total commitment to the work that they do. I am actually a trustee on the public funding committee of the Lake Macquarie Landcare group, so I am really committed to the work that Landcare does. On 11 September I visited the Warners Bay Landcare group. They had received a Community Action Grant for a project and the work had been completed on that project. The morning that was organised to celebrate the completion of that work included people from the local community and those who were involved in the Landcare group. The work that they had done in restoring Warners Creek was spectacular, as was the involvement of the local community in bringing about the changes to that area. I then visited the Floraville ridge Landcare group, and what had been achieved in that area was spectacular. There had been restoration of the rainforest, removal of bitou bush and total weed eradication, and a wonderful walking trail had been set up in that area. It is a tribute to each and every person who has been involved, but I would particularly like to acknowledge the work of Winsome Lambkin. She was previously a teacher at Floraville Public School where the restored land backs onto the school. I also visited the Kenibea Bushland Reserve. Barry Wheatley has been involved in that Landcare group for in excess of 10 years. I had a similar experience there. It is such a beautiful and wonderful area that has been restored by caring people who are committed to the environment and the area they live in. On 30 October I visited the Swansea Landcare group's open day and that tonight I was also a similar experience. There have been a number of groups that so, I have been successful in getting projects funded through the latest Community Action Grants. One of those was the Black Neds Bay rejuvenation committee's project to undertake work on endangered remnants of rainforest at Black Neds Bay and the nearby Caves Beach. The project will be conducted through the surf club and will involve one of my very good friends, Stuart Chalmers, who has received an Order of Australia for the enormous amount of work he has done in that area. This project will enhance the natural environment at Caves Beach and will also involve bush regeneration. The other successful project was from the Fernleigh Track Landcare group. For the benefit of those in the House, I might add that this government has funded the Fernleigh Track to the tune of $2 million, but this project is at the Highfields end. Doug Lithgow, who is a person totally committed to the environment and Landcare, will be involved in that group's project to enhance the natural environment. Landcare is a fantastic organisation and it delivers untold benefits to Australia. Townsville Convention Centre",218
251,Mr EWEN JONES,ADJOURNMENT,"I welcome the statement by the Prime Minister that all election commitments made by the government will be honoured. As members may be aware, there was significant interest from both parties in the seat of Herbert, based in the city of Townsville. The coalition was the first to commit to building Townsville a proper convention centre. With every promise we made during the campaign, there were two criteria which had to be satisfied for a commitment to be made: first, there had to be a significant ing to government; and, second, there had to be significant economic benefit from the installation to warrant that investment. Such is the case with the Townsville Entertainment and Convention Centre. Our entertainment centre was built as a basketball court for the then Townsville Suns-now the mighty Townsville Crocs. Townsville had to do it alone and therefore had to build it with as little added expense as possible. So what we have as our major convention destination is at present a glorified basketball court. There are significant expenses on the horizon-and some well short of the horizonwith this building. The air conditioning is all but gone. The roof leaks excessively. In short, that building is in trouble. There have been a number of occasions where events have been all but cancelled over these issues. This satisfies the first criteria of savings to government-the significant cost of rectifying the building and still only having a basketball court would not make sense. At present, our entertainment centre can support full convention centre functions for only about 200 people. The lack of breakout areas and display space severely limit my city's chances of holding exhibitions and conventions, which would go hand-in-hand for a progressive city like Townsville. The cost of the convention centre would be $143 million and the best way to achieve this would be through a three-way split between local, state and federal governments. Our promise was $47.67 million, with an immediate $2.5 million to commence planning and design. Labor promised a straightforward $47.67 million. The benefits of the convention centre to my city would be enormous. Recently, Townsville Enterprise released figures which told of our city's growth as a convention dessavtination. They stated: ‘North Queensland lifted the events it hosted by 55 per cent from 194 in 2009-09 to 301 in 2009-10. Delegate numbers rose 89 per cent, from 13,745 to 25,997 and their sleep nights jumped 47 per cent from 49,891 to 73,997.' Figures supplied by Townsville City Council suggest that the convention centre will attract 263,000 visitors, generate $100 million per year in economic benefit and support 300 jobs. It will feature 5,200 arena seats, 12 meeting rooms, 3,000 square metres of exhibition space, a ballroom and banquet space for 1,800 people and 800 car spaces. Australia has a $20 billion business events market. It is only natural that a city with the energy of Townsville should be a bigger player than it is currently. Townsville is already recognised as the sporting and cultural events capital of North Queensland and boasts that four of the five national sporting teams in tropical Australia are based in Townsville. Additionally, Townsville is the largest city in Northern Australia, yet it finds itself hamstrung without this convention centre facility. I have written to the Treasurer to ask for details on the proposed funding for this project and also that urgent consideration be given to assisting my city with $2.5 million so that the design and plans can be called for and assessed. I await his expeditious and positive response. Wakefield Electorate: Hewett Community Church of Christ Millennium Development Goals",219
252,Mr CHAMPION,ADJOURNMENT,"It is with great pleasure that I rise to tell the House about a recent visit I had from the Hewett Community Church of Christ. Hewett is a growing suburb in my electorate. Occasionally the Community Church of Christ come to see me and in this case it was Reverend Scott Combridge, Beth Connor and Cindy Vennix who came to see me about the Millennium Development Goals, and they had a gift for me. I know how you feel about props, Mr Speaker, but I will ask the member for Chifley to help me hold up this handpainted banner. It has the hand prints of 50 local children and says, ‘We remember the poor.' It is designed to encourage all of us to remember the poor, particularly the poor all around the world. It has been 10 years since Australia and 188 other nations adopted the Millennium Declaration and committed to the Millennium Development Goals. These are important goals because they set a series of measurable targets: to reduce extreme poverty; to reduce hunger and disease; and to promote gender equality, education and environmental sustainability. It was all these things that the Hewett Community Church of Christ wanted us to remember. It is important to remember that since 2000, hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty, 40 million more children are now going to school and three million more children survive beyond their fifth birthday, and important progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of HIV-AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. We know that the health priorities of these goals include reducing child mortality; improving maternal health; combating HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria; and addressing the rapid rise of non-communicable diseases, particularly in the Pacific. Australia has had a proud history of providing overseas aid. But since 2005 we have doubled the size of our overseas aid program. On current projections, the program will double again to more than eight billion by 2015. Importantly, this progress has been made with bipartisan consensus and has survived the global financial downturn-a time when one would have expected some pressure on our overseas aid program. It is important for the House to agree on this program because it is in our interests to help the world's poor and there is a great deal of support in our electorates for it. Increased aid is not just limited to government; Australian citizens are also generous donors. Last year, they donated around $800 million to development and nongovernment organisations. That $800 million came from 1.7 million Australians and between 2001-08 private donations increased by an average of 10 per cent per year in real terms. That is a very important thing. Private donations not only improve the lives of people overseas but also improve our lives because we feel good when we help other human beings. One of my young staff members, Mr Andrew Anson, is involved in the Oaktree Foundation, a non-government organisation which unites young people to work together to end global poverty. It has over 350 volunteers, all under the age of 26. In May 2010, they organised a Make Poverty History road trip, which had 1,000 young people from across Australia campaigning for a week through marginal electorates on their way to Canberra before participating in the Make Poverty History summit, which was held on the lawns of Parliament House. Two South Australians, Adam Pulford and Nina O'Connor, worked tirelessly to put the campaign together from the South Australian end. It helped unite younger generations in the battle to eradicate global poverty. We know there are many other people interested in and committed to this issue. We hope to see the Millennium Development Goals implemented in full and an end to poverty around the world. Riverina Electorate: Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area",220
253,Mr MCCORMACK,ADJOURNMENT,"The coalition set aside $5.8 billion in the 2007 Water Act for vital water-saving infrastructure. To date, just $437 million has been rolled out when about $700 million should have been spent. Not one cent has been rolled out in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area in the Riverina electorate that I represent. I call on the Labor government, which claims it is interested in regional Australia but is yet to prove it, to start delivering this vital water-saving infrastructure for the good of regional farming communities and the good of the nation.",221

I mentioned before that Victorian families the increasing cost of living in the last few details and figures. If you take one particular the Howard government in 2003-04 there was fall in the price, in 2005-06 we saw a 0.1 per cent increase.
