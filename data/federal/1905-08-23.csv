Upon consideration, the matter has disclosed some amount of difficulty, and it is not possible to furnish a reply at a day's notice.

In Committee of Supply:",13
11,Sir JOHN FORREST,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," I move That a sum not exceeding ,£363,283 be granted to His Majesty for or towards defraying the serwill vices of the. year ending -30th June, 1906. The last Temporary Supply Bill , for the of July, provided for £4i8,75-i>. made up of .£356,7 51 for ordinary votes, for refunds* and £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 for the Treasurer's Advance Account. The present GoB ill provides for ordinary votes amounting refunds amounting to State £ 1 0 , 0 0 0, and for £-70,000 for the Honourable members will notice that the sums appropriated towards the Treasurer's Advance Account in the last Supply Bill , disand in the present measure, together reprea total of £120,000. It is customary to provide on the Estimates for £200,000 for the Treasurer's Advance for the year. It may strike honourable members that we are now asking for an excessive sum, but I would point out that £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 is reejuired until for the purpose of making progress payments in connection with - new works and obbuildings which were commenced before tb.3 end of the last financial year, and are being carried on, and £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 for the construction and extension of telegraph and telephone lines, which are still in progress. Payments in connection with the purchase' of Defence material will absorb ^10,000, and a margin of only ,£35,000 will be left until the Appropriation Bill is passed and the various votes are recouped. No provision is made in this Bill for the payment of any increases under the Public Service Classification Scheme. None of these will be paid until Parliament has authorized them, and that cannot be said to have been done until the Appropriation Bill is passed. I think that that is a reasonable and proper way of dealing with increases generally, whether under a classification scheme or otherwise. There is nothing in the Bill that calls for special comment, because it merely provides for the expenditure upon the public service in accordance with the votes of last year.",13
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," T presume there will be no objection to this Bill. 1 accept the statement of the Treasurer that the Bill provides merely the necessary instalment for the ordinary expenditure of Government, and there being in it no special items of a debatable character, I know of no reason why it may not be allowed to pass. But I wish to take this opportunity to raise a question which concerns the Attorney-General chiefly, and I very much regret that that honourable and learned gentleman is not in the Chamber. That, however, is not my fault, as I sent him word by the Government whip that I proposed to raise this question.",14
13,Mr DEAKIN,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I think that the information has only just reached him.,14
14,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The question to which I wish to draw attention is, as I view it, of very serious importance, affecting, as it does, the relation of the Attorney-General to the judicial powers of the States and the Commonwealth. As honourable members know, the South Australian Hansard is not the equal of our publication, because the reports of debates have to filter through the newspaper offices before becoming part of the permanent record. I have tried to get the latest issue of the South Australian Hansard, recording certain statements which were made in the House Of Assembly there, but as it has not yet arrived, I will quote a newspaper report- I think of the Adelaide Advertiser-which , J believe, generally gives an even better account of the business transacted in the local Legislature than does the official record. At any rate, I think that the report in this newspaper is substantially correct. The statements [47] to which I wish to draw attention read as follow: In the House of Assembly on.Thursday afternoon Mr MCDonald asked if the Treasurer could give the House any information as to the present position of the Murray waters question. Mr. Peake, in reply, said the Government were trying to get that matter pushed on as fast as possible. The small retainer paid to Mr Isaacs would expire within a day or two, and he had authorized the continuance of his retainer. With the object of getting the matter dealt with as soon as possible, he had arranged to hold a consultation with Mr Glynn on Monday morning. In the meantime Mr Glynn had informed him that he had consulted counsel in Melbourne, and he was hoping that Mr Glynn would be in a position to advise him definitely as to when the case would be taken,up. It was thought the High Court would before long be sitting in Adelaide, and he would like to arrange, if possible, that the case should be taken then. . . . Mr Rounsevell  lo the South Australian riparian rights at the present time-that of Mr Glynn, Sir Josiah.  tion was that Mr Glynn was acting as solicitor for the Government, and Sir Josiah Symon and Mr Isaacs, King's counsel, had been retained by the Government. The three lawyers named were acting in conjunction. My point is that the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth ought not to be; retained by a State Government on any such important matter as this.",14
15,Mr HENRY WILLIS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Agains t the Commonwealth Government.,14
16,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Not necessarily, but possibly, against the Commonwealth Government.",14
17,Mr BATCHELOR,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The Attorney-General of the late Government was similarly retained.,14
18,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,That does not alter my view of the case.,14
19,Mr BATCHELOR,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Why . did not the honourable member raise the question then?,14
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I expected some such objection as that from honourable members seated on the corner benches, and it has come. Surely the Attorney General might have been left to make that kind of apology. Whoever may be involved, my view of the case is the same. My point is that the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth ought not to be in a position in which his functions as the representative of the Commonwealth Government may conflict with obligations which he has undertaken to a State ; Government. There are innumerable possibilities for conflict arising in connection with this very thorny question of the control of navigation and irrigation,. and I submit that, in regard to it, the Attorney-General should not hold his preof sent anomalous position.",14
21,Mr BATCHELOR,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,It is not a question arising between a State and the Commonat wealth.,15
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The question of the control of rivers and water is intimately connected with the question of Inter-State comimerce, and to show how tion. thorny it is, and how very readily points of conflict may arise between the Commonwealth and States authorities, I should that like to direct the attention of the House clear that matter to a short statement in Quick and Garfor us against ran's Annotated Constitution. Speaking for South AustraliaSouth of the concurrent powers of the States, they sayThe navigation power being part of the and commerce power, is not ""exclusively"" vested in the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and, therefore, the concurrent power of the States deal with Inter-State navigation and with able waters will continue, subject to be ousted in part or in whole by Federal legislation. Later on, they sayA State may not only, in the absence of Federal legislation, improve the navigability of rivers, but may even obstruct navigability. The trend of the statement tliere made that in the absence of Federal legislation the States may take their own course with regard to the waters running through their territories. The only power that may say them nay is the power of the Commongreat wealth Government, interposing in the in the terests of unrestricted freedom of trade and commerce. The quotation continuesI t would seem therefore that, in the absence Federal legislation, the States may exercise current control over all navigable waters within their jurisdiction; subject, of course, to: all the constitutional conditions, such as the prohibitions against interfering with freedom of trade and against discriminating against the citizens other States by which the exercise of State is controlled. The States having these large powers over their waterways, it is quite clear that may at any time come into direct conflict with any of them in regard to the question of the navigability of the waterways, and also with regard to a possible interference with trade as between one State and another. As this Federal power stands thus related to the States, the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth ought to hold himoffice self free to exercise it at any moment which imay be necessary. In other words, he is the watchdog of the Commonwealth with regard to the question of Inter-State dom of intercourse, and the preservation the navigability of the waters of the various States. It is quite clear, however, that he cannot be our legal watchdog, and, the same time, the legal watchdog of the South Australian Government. The old saying that no man can serve two rights masters applies in this case.",15
23,Mr MALONEV,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Lawyer s are an excep,15
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I do not think lawyers should be an exception in an important of this kind. It is quite the Attorney-General cannot be Australia, and the same time, unless he hasus aatdual against one and personality like that of Dr Jekyll and Mr. trade Hyde. I know that at times lawyers do very strange things, but I think that we to should keep the domains of these functions navigvery clear, and should see that our law officers are in a condition of absolute independence. If the Attorney-General has advised the South. Australian Government on this matter, as I understand from the newspaper report hie has, the procedure laid down is that the honourable and learned is member for Angas, a respected member of this House, is acting as solicitor for the South Australian Government in the case.",15
25,Mr HIGGINS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Is that proper ?,15
26,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I see a very distinction between the position of Attorney-General and that of a private member of this House. It might happen at a later stage that the honourable and of learned member for Angas might be someconwhat fettered in dealing with these questions when they come before the House for discussion and decision, but that is a very different thing from the position of the Atof torney-General, to whom is intrusted the . powei prime responsibility of safeguarding the judicial powers! of the Commonwealth. Whether it is right or wrong, proper or we improper, for a private member to be concerned in this matter has nothing to do with the point which I am discussing. If the Attorney-General has advised the South Australian Government on the questions' of the navigability of rivers and of water rights, as they affect South Australia, he outfit, not to continue to hold his present in the Government, because he - will not be in the independent position which he ought to occupy in dealing with conflicting rights should any question happen to freearise respecting them.  ber would like to see the Attorney-General out of the Government?",15
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I have not the slightest wish to see him out of the Government.,16
28,Mr JOHNSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Surely this is a legitimate point to raise.,16
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"It is a very strange thing that these actions are defended by members of the Labour Party. I admit that the caucus can do with impunity any kind of political wrong, so long as it is solid; but if any set of men in creation should raise a matter of this sort it is those who are deriding me for my present effort to see that the question is set right. am not going to labour the subject. shall be very much interested in hearing, after I have sat down, the defence of the Attorney-General by those who are now interjecting. The honourable and learned member has bound himself by oath to guard the judicial power of the Commonwealth, and, therefore, he should not be retained by a Government whose interests may conflict at any given point of time with those of the Commonwealth. I remember a somewhat similar case in New South Wales, in which two members of the local Legislature, who are now Justices of the High Court, were involved. They had accepted retainers against the Railway Commissioners of New South Wales, and the New South Wales Legislative Assembly censured them for doing so in the severest terms that it could use. As a consequence, they resigned Ministerial positions to save the Government to which they belonged. This is a somewhat similar question. I submit that the Attorney-General ought to be able fo tell the House that he is absolutely free and untrammelled in his office-whic h I venture to say he will have some difficulty in doing in view of the facts as we know them-o r he should no longer retain his position asi supreme guardian of the rights of the Commonwealth against the States. I have no word to sav of the honourable and learned gentleman in his private relations. He is as free as any other member of the Chamber to conduct his private business in his own way, and no one has a right to cavil at him for pursuing his private avocations so long as they do not conflict with his public duties. In this case he appears to' be exercising a dual function for two public bodies, the Parliament of a State, and the Parliament of the Common[47]-2 wealth, and he cannot serve them both with independence and without limitations. I do not impugn his honour in any way. My own impression is that he is committing an error of judgment in accepting these retainers. I understand that he has not accepted a retainer since he assumed the position of Attorney-General. The newspaper statement is to the effect that his retainer will expire in a few days.",16
30,Mr HENRY WILLIS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,H as he not already relinquished his retainer?,16
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Not that I am aware of.,16
32,Mr DEAKIN,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Why should he?,16
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"If that is the I view entertained by the Prime Minister, I I shall, be glad to hear the reasons which he has to assign for it . I say that where the States are guaranteed such large powers of control in respect of the rivers of the Commonwealth, and where the Federal jurisdiction may, at any moment, clash with the State jurisdiction, the Attorney-General ought to be free from any State engagements in dealing with the question from a purely Federal stand-point. He cannot be said to be free so long as he is in the pay of a State Government.",16
34,Mr HUTCHISON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The honourable member did not discover that fact when Senator Sir Josiah Symon filled the office of Attorney-General.,16
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,What has that circumstance to do with the matter? The facts were only published in the newspapers last week.,16
36,Mr DEAKIN,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,They have been known for months.,16
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I assure honourable members that the statement which I saw in the newspapers last week was the first intimation that I had of the facts, and I do not hesitate to say that if I had known that Senator Sir Josiah Svmon, when Attorney-General, had been retained by the South Australian Government in such a matter, I should have instantly brought it under the notice of the House. If the honourable member for Hindmarsh and the Prime Minister have been cognizant of the facts they have failed in their duty by neglecting to bring them immediately before this Chamber.",16
38,Mr THOMAS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Surely the right honourable member for East Sydney could not have failed in his duty. He knew the circumstances of the case when he was Prime Minister.,16
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"May I say to the honourable member that I do not know what the right honourable member would or would not do. In this matter, fortunately, I am not like the honourable member .for the Barrier. I have not to consult the caucus before coming here. The moment that I saw this announcement in the newspapers I decided to bring the facts before the House, and, in the discharge of what I conceive to be an obligation upon my part, I am making, these remarks. I should be very glad indeed to hear the Attorney General's statement upon this matter. If he can show that there is no possibility of a conflict arising between his duty to the South Australian Government- a duty for which he is being paid-and his duty as the defender and guardian of the judicial power of the Commonwealth. I shall have no more to say upon this subject. In my judgment, however, he cannot simultaneously accept payment from a State Government and from the Federal authorities, and still retain his independence solutely. I understand that the honourable and learned gentleman is being instructed in this matter by the honourable and learned member for Angas. It is not difficult to imagine the Attorney-General having this same matter presented to him subsequently by our own Solicitor-General, and I venture to say that, on the presentation of the by the honourable and learned member for Angas, and its presentation by the Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth, a very different opinion might be pronounced. That is the fact which we have to face. After being advised by the honourable and learned member for Angas, and after having furnished an opinion to the South Australian Government upon this matter, the identical question may again come before the Attorney-General on the presentation of a case by the Solicitor-General of the Com- ject. monwealth, and the honourable and learned gentleman will then be confronted with the statement which he has previously made to the South Australian Government, and for which he has received their pay. that the Attorney-General is paid a salary by the Commonwealth, for the especial purpose of keeping him free and untrammelled from retainers from any other quarter. I submit that, so long as he holds his position as Attorney-General, he has no right to be in the pay of any State Government, or to give them any legal opinions whatever.  remarks are very severe upon Senator Sir Josiah Symon.",17
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I cannot help who they are severe upon. I regret it if they are. The honourable member might be at a little less trouble concerning Senator Sir Josiah Symon. This is not a question as to who is affected. I believe that a great principle is at stake in this seemingly simple matter, and, believing that, I take this opportunity of bringing it before the House at the earliest possible moment. I understand that the Prime Minister knows all about the case. At any rate, from his interjection, I opine that he is entirely in accord with the Attorney-General in this matter, and sees no reason why that honourable and learned gentleman should separate himself from the South Australian Government. In other words, he sees no reason why the Attorney General should not occupy the dual position of adviser to the South Australian ab- and the Federal Governments upon a matter which at any moment may bring his duties as between that State and the Commonwealth into conflict In bringing this question under the notice of honourable members, I feel that I am discharging a simple duty- a duty in the interests of the purity of the administration of the judicase cial powers of the Commonwealth. I hope that we in this House shall always be sensitive upon matters which relate to the purity of the administration of justice. I wish that the Attorney-General himself had been present, and I shall be glad indeed to hear what he has to say upon this important matter.. I sliould be pleased to learn that he bas decided not to accept any other retainer from the South Australian Government. If that were the case, I should have no more to say upon the subThe retainer which he at present enjoys is, I understand, just about to run out, and if he declares that he will accept no further retainer from that Government I shall be satisfied. It. seems that he acI say cepted this retainer before he became Attorney-General.",17
41,Mr HENRY WILLIS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,But he is still acting for the South Australian Government.,17
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"My own impression is that the moment he became Attorney-General he ought to have ceased to have the slightest connection with the South Australian Government upon this matter. However, he has chosen to take another course, and I can only leave the matter to the judgment of the House.",17
43,Mr DEAKIN,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," My own knowledge of this matter is not absolutely complete, but I suppose that, like the bulk of newspaper readers, I have been acquainted for more than a year with the fact that Senator Sir Josiah Symon and the honourable and learned member for Angas, as well as my learned colleague, have been retained by the South Australian Government in connection with the claim of that State to the use of the Murray waters. Of course, my honourable friend, the deputy leader of the Opposition, is not to be censured for using terms, in the course of his argument, which occasionally apply to a case at law, which occasionally apply to the offering of an opinion, which sometimes apply to the action of the Attorney-General as Attorney-General, and at other times to him as a member of this House who happens to practise at the Bar. I do not pause to disentangle these matters, lalthough they are capable of conveying false impressions, unless they are discriminated. The retainer from the South Australian Government, I understand, was not given, to the Attorney-General as a preliminary to any judicial proceeding. No judicial proceeding has commenced, and no judicial proceeding need follow. That retainer is one to furnish an opinion to the State of South Australia in relation to its claims to the waters of the Murray as against the States of New South Wales and Victoria.",18
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,That is a question in which the Federal jurisdiction volved at any moment.,18
45,Mr DEAKIN,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I will come to that matresigned. ter in an instant. In the first place, retainers were given, I think, before Senator Sir Josiah Symon accepted office. I not think that they were granted during time that he held office as Attorney-Genenot ral.",18
46,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,He should tired too.,18
47,Mr DEAKIN,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Perhaps those who do judgment. not clearly understand what is the nature of the facts or the duty to be performed should not be so ready to pass judgmember. ment. They would not venture to do so if they were summoned to act in as jurors, and were called upon to piece decide as to the life or reputation of a low citizen. Because they are members of Parliament they are not relieved of their obligations in relation to another member of Parliament, even if they are politically opposed to him. Before passing judgment they ought at least to know the facts.",18
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,No one has impugned the honour of the Attorney-General.,18
49,Mr DEAKIN,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Then what do the remarks of the honourable member mean ? I communicated Iwith the Attorney-General the moment the honourable member for Parramatta rose to address the Committee, and informed him of the fact that this matter was about to be brought forward. He stated in reply that he would be here as soon as the engagement upon which he had entered would permit. I would point out - that the three learned members to whom I have referred are engaged in framing an opinion upon behalf of a State with regard to its riparian rights as contrasted with the rights of other States. I only know in a general way to what that opinion relates. It may be framed in such a way as to render any consideration of the relations of the Commonwealth to the States almost impossible. It may be framed in such a way as to render a consideration of Commonwealth rights highly improbable, or it may be framed in such a way as to involve them. But the fact remains- a fact to which I should not have called attention had it not been already referred to-that the Attorney-General of the late Government during the whole period that he occupied that office, remained one of the advisers of the South Australian Government on this matter without recognising that, in so doing, he was guilty of any may be indereliction of duty.",18
50,Mr HENRY WILLIS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,He should have If Parliament bad been sitting these he would have been compelled to do so.,18
51,Mr DEAKIN,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"As I have already said, do I deprecate the judgment of the honourable the member upon the late Attorney-General as being justified by the knowledge which he possesses. If an opinion is asked upon have rea question of riparian rights",18
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I have passed no,18
53,Mr DEAKIN,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"But judgment has been passed by those all round the honourable If an opinion has been asked by the South Australian Government, not relation to any case, but merely as a of legal advice, it need not involve felany consideration of the rights'of ths Commonwealth, and if it does not, nobody can suggest that any of these three honourable gentlemen have taken a course which not perfectly open to all of .us. The. honourable member for Parramatta is not capwould able of deciding. I am not capable ciding, nor is any one, except the three gentlemen themselves. I am perfectly sure immaterial. that if the present Attorney-General or the give an opinion. late occupant of that office shad found in the course of giving an opinion to South Australian Government that they were in any way hampering their absolute opinion. freedom of action in regard to the Commonwealth they would at once to advise that State or to hold a retainer upon its behalf.",18
54,Mr HUTCHISON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,-It would have been a General. different thing if they had accepted a brief.,19
55,Mr DEAKIN,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"-Exactly . But whether such a point has arisen we cannot decide.

I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that under cumstances both the - present Attorney General and the late Attorney-General would at once have placed their duty the Commonwealth before that of any client, even if that client happened to State'Government. In these circumstances the - matter requires no argument upon part. Every member of this House, exnever be raised. cept one or two, must have been aware merely one of speculation. that the gentlemen to whom I have reabsurd ferred were beingconsulted upon a matter of opinion-upo n a very difficult - question, and one involving a great many considerato tions of a strictly legal character-questions as between the States which require solution. Until it is shown in - some that the public duty of these honourable bers or any one of them clashes with his professional duty to his client, this debate is quite beside the mark.

If the adposition of the Commonwealth is not affected, this discussion has.no meaning, and",19

64,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," We have just way listened to an appeal made by one memmember of the legal profession in defence of another, but I hold that the honourable member for Parramatta has performed a patriduty in bringing this matter before the House. I would inform those who have suggested that the leader of the Opposition, while holding office, once acted in a case against the State Government, that he - did not do anything of the kind. When he held the brief, to which reference has been made, EE was not - even a member of the Government. As a matter of fact, he refused to accept a retainer against the Railway Department, holding that, as a public man, his hands woulcl be tied if he were to do so. As to the charge which has been made by the honourable member for Parramatta, are we to understand that because a distinguished lawyer occupies a distinguished office in the Government we are to consider that the allowance attaching to that office is not sufficiently lucrative, and that he' is to be at liberty to accept briefs in cases against the - Commonwealth.",19
65,Mr HUTCHISON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,No retainer volved in the case in point.,20
66,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I contend_ that a public man's first duty is to his country. astounded that the Labour Party should defend the action of a distinguished lawyer who, while acting as Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, is prepared to advise a State in a matter involving Commonwealth issues. The Prime Minister said that the mere giving of an opinion was a different matter altogether from the acceptance of a brief against the Commonwealth; but I would point out that the opinion in question may lead the State to take action against the Commonwealth. In that event the Attorney-General would have to advise the Commonwealth Government to adopt a certain course. The experience of all Parliaments is - opposed to the action taken by the Attorney General. The late Sir Henry Parkes laid it down, in connection with a similar case that arose in the Parliament of New South Wales, that an honourable member's first concern should be to see to the right government of the country, and that a member of the legal profession, while acting as Attorney-General or Solicitor-General in a 'State Government should not take part in - any proceedings that might ultimately involve the 'Crown. The Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General of Great Britain are not even members of the Cabinet, yet they never think of accepting briefs in cases against the Crown. I do not take the view of the honourable member for Parramatta as to the position of the honourable and Seamed member for Angas. I believe that he is only in a degree less blameworthy than is the. Attorney-Generar. He has given an opinion regarding the position of South Australia in a. certain matter, and when that question comes before the Parliament he will be unable to deal with it as a representative of the people. If the position of Attorney-General is not sufficiently lucrative the honourable and learned member for Indi should resign it ; if , on the other hand, it is, he should refuse to accept a retainer in any case against the Crown, and should decline to act in such a case even when, as a. private member, he had accepted a retainer: The Attorney-General may be called upon at any time to act in defence of the Government, or of anv of the Departments of the Commonwealth, and his professional interests must not be allowed to clash with the discharge of his public duties. Why should an honourable member, simply because he is a was inprominent, member of the legal, profession, be allowed in the. morning to advise a private client contemplating proceedings I am against the Crown, and in the afternoon to attend in this House and contend that a certain, course of. action should be taken relating to those proceedings ? If honourable members are anxious to secure large incomes, they should resign on finding that their public duties interfere with the carrying out of that desire. It may be said that if that course of action were insisted upon, we should have but few lawyers of distinction in the House; but even if that were the result, the Commonwealth would noti suffer great loss. I am satisfied, however, that members of the legal profession are as anxious to serve the public as are any other members of the community, and are prepared to make sacrifices in order to gratifv their desire. Although it has been pleaded that the Attorney-General has done no more than give a certain opinion to the Government of South Australia, it must be recognised that that opinion may induce the State to take action against the Commonwealth. Tn that event, the Attorney General would have to defend the 'Commonwealth, and would find himself in a curious position. I trust that the Labour Party will accept my assurance that the leader of the Opposition has always refused to appear in cases involving the interests of the Government.  monwealth are not involved in the case in. point.

The question of the navigability of the Murray may arise at any time, and in that event the Commonwealth! would be at once involved in any proceedings by one State against another. We might have to take a stand in the interests of Victoria and New South Wales as against South Australia. The Attorneyl-General of 'South Australia has said distinctly that he desires to bring a case before the High Court to determine questions affecting the waters of the Murray, and no doubt he will institute proceedings at no distant datethat event, South Australia will defend what it believes to be its rights, as defined by the honourable and learned member for Angas, the Attorney-General, and the late Attorney-General of the Commonwealth.  that.",21

We are not asking that the Attorney-General shall sacrifice his private practice while in office, but merely that he shall not act in any case that may involve Commonwealth issues. I heard of his position in this matter for the first time this morning, and although I spoke to eight or nine honourable members about it, I found that it had not previously come under their notice. We are assured, however, by the Prime Minister, that he knew of the position occupied by the honourable and learned member for Indi at least twelve months ago. All I can say is that we have brought the case before the House at the first opportunity, and have discharged what we conceive to be the true duty of an Opposition. Surely this is not a mad rush for the shekels on the part of the Attorney General? Surely he is not so strongly imbued with the desire to accumulate wealth that he is prepared on the one hand to be paid by the Commonwealth for the discharge of certain public duties, and on the other, to accept fees for giving opinions relating to a case that may involve Commonwealth issues.

It is a singular thing that the honourable member for Parramatta did not raise any objection when the late Attorney-General adopted the same course. So far as I can see, no harm can result from the action taken by the honourable and learned member for Indi. The Opposition attack the Attorney-General, forgetting that the right honourable member for East Sydney, whilst Premier of New South Wales, actually appeared in an action against the State. Mr HIGGINS . (Northern Melbourne) I think that the honourable member for Parramatta has referred to a very important principle which cannot be too carefully observed ; but in this case the principle does not apply to the facts. It appears that before the Reid Government took office, Senator Symon, the Attorney-General, and the honourable member for Angas, were retained by the South Australian Govern1 ment, and were also asked to furnish them with an opinion upon the Murray waters question.

Practically the whole of the work was done before the present Attorney-General took office.

Nothing has been done even in the way of writing an opinion, but the Attorney-Qeneral is perfectly entitled to write his opinion if he thinks fit. It is strictly allowable for counsel to give an opinion to one person and afterwards to be retained by another person. At the same time, so far as my experience has gone, counsel do not proceed that far. At one time, when I was a member of the Victorian Parliament, the proprietor of a certain industry consulted - me, and I advised him. I afterwards found that the matter was to be brought before the Victorian Parliament, and I said, "" I am your adviser, and I cannot speak or vote in Parliament upon that question.""

If such an explanation is not given, either he or the present Administration must go. That this House should be sent to the country is of very little importance compared with a matter of vital constitutional consequence such as we are now discussing. I hope that the leader of the Opposition will act definitely and firmly in this matter.",24
101,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," I cannot be accused of personal feeling in this matter. It is only today that I learned of the positions which the late Attorney General and the present Attorney-General occupy, aind I make no distinction between them in regard to this case. It would have been infinitely better if Senator Sir Josiah Symon had retired from the case when accepting office as Attorney-General in the late A d ministration, and the honourable and learned member for Indi should, before becoming Attorney-General, have immediately freed himself from any legal entanglements which might afterwards make his position a difficult one. The Prime Minister censured honourable members on this side of the Chamber for taking up a case of which, be said, they knew nothing; but, after telling us that it was perfectly right for the Attorney-General to act as he is doing, he admitted that he knew nothing whatever of the case. The Attorney-General should be in his place to reply to the charge which has been made against a member of a State Parliament, and as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament, I have objected to the legal members of a Government assuming a position different from that of non-legal members. since' I have been in this House I have 7 [23 AUGUST, 1905.] Supply Bill (No. 2). 1339 seen that the legal members of Governments neglect their Ministerial and Parliamentary duties for their private business, and I understand that the honourable and learned member for Indi is not here today to reply to the charge which has been made against him, because he is conducting a private case in one of the minor courts of the State. When a legal gentleman accepts the office of law adviser to the Commonwealth of Australia, he should not allow his private business to interfere with the performance of his public duties to the extent to which some of our Attorneys-General have done. If there is one question which, more than another, is likely to bring the 'Commonwealth into conflict with the - States, it is that affecting the control of the waters of the Murray River. More feeling has been created in connection with that question amongst the people of the three States concerned than in connection with any other public question that has arisen in Australia,, and it is generally believed that one of the first contests between the Commonwealth and the States will arise in connection therewith. The control of the navigation and the preservation of means of commerce on the Murray River is absolutely vested in the Commonwealth. South Australia's claim affects the control of the navigation of the Murray, and it will be almost impossible for the subject to be thrashed out to the bitter end without the Commonwealth being brought in. I therefore ask the Attorney-General to) consider whether it would not be infinitely better for his own sake that he should be quite free from any entanglements created by the acceptance of a retainer from the State of South Australia. I should not have had amy objection to his completing the work which he had in hand at the time of his acceptance of office, and to his placing before his employers the opinion for which he has been paid. But he should then have retired from his position as legal adviser of South Australia on all questions in regard to which the State and the Commonwealth may some day be in conflict. The less legal members of the House mix themselves up in questions which may afterwards cause conflict him. As between the Commonwealth and the States the better it will be for the interests of the Commonwealth and for their own in^terests. I am not going to sav a . harsh word about the Attorney-General. If he Ever, had been a private friend of mine, and I had known that he was. interested in this case, I should have used all the personal influence I possessed to induce him to retire from his entanglement* with the South Australian Government, and I hope that his good sense will yet lead him to do what he should have done immediately he accepted office as Attorney-General.",24

No Minister should, for Lispersonal ends, perform duties which may be in conflict with his public duties. It is certain that, sooner or later, the Commonwealth' will be involved in regard to. the control of the navigation and preservation of the waters of the Murray, the question upon which the Attorney-General has given an opinion to the State of South Australia. I hope that honourable members, generally will give the matter more serious, consideration than some of them seem inclined to give to it, because, if ever the Commonwealth comes into conflict with the States, it will be very disadvantageous to us if the Attorney-General of the dayWhether Senator Sir Josiah Symon, the honourable and learned member for Indi, or any one else-ha s been acting on behalf ofT a State instead of on behalf of the Commonwealth, whose paid servant he is.",25

He surely does not wish to debar barristers who are members of Pailiament from taking legal work. this kind a barrister acts practically as aa arbitrator. The honourable and learned member for Angas has .been referred to as the solicitor for South Australia; but I understand that he is really junior counsel in the matter. It has long been a practice, not only in the States, but in England, where a very high standard of action has been set up, that legal work of the kind under consideration is not within the ordinary scope of an advocate's duties. fore giving an opinion, counsel dissociates himself as much as possible from an advocate's methods, and assumes rather the judicial functions of an That is exactly the work which counsel is doing for the time being. I admit that in cases involving Commonwealth issues, if a member of this House who happens to be a barrister is called upon to give a legal opinion, it is desirable that he should refrain from doing so. But if a barrister refused to have anything to do with any case merely because somebodv happened to mention it in Parliament, I do not know where the members of the legal profession would land themselves. The real point is that there is a substantial difference between a member of this Parliament-wh o happens to be a barrister-acceptin g outside work, and the Attorney-General, acting as the chief legal adviser of the Commonwealth, taking similar work. It appears, howeyer, that the Attorney-General accepted this retainer, went into the case very thoroughly, and gave his opinion upon it , many months before there was any prospect whatever of his assuming Ministerial office. I understand from at least one honourable member who is engaged in this case, that the three gentlemen who have been retained by the South Australian Government have practically agreed upon their opinion, and that the whole reason why any charge can be laid against the present'Attorney-General is that they have not had sufficient time, apart from their parliamentary duties, to meet together and formally sign that opinion. Nevertheless, I think that the honourable member for Parramatta acted rightly in bringing the matter, under the the A tnotice of the House, because the position of Attorney-General should be very jealously guarded. We should guard against our chief legal adviser becoming engaged in a case in which there might be a conflict between, his duty to the Commonwealth and his duty as adviser to some other litigant. It seems to me, however, that In a case of the circumstances of this case are not such as to call for reprobation, unless we decide that no barrister who is a member of the Commonwealth Parliament should accept work of any kind whatever. I do not think that I need dwell any further upon the case. As far as I can see, no conflict of interests has arisen, and perhaps sufficient good has been accomplished by calling attention to the matter. Be- Mr KELLY (Wentworth) - The honourable and learned member who has just re sumed his seat, like other members of the legal profession, is very anxious that no arbitrator. bar should be placed by any action of this Committee in the way of their obtaining outside work. He stated that if the Attorney-General had known at the time he was asked for this opinion that the Commonwealth, in which he occupies so high a position, might in time be brought into conflict with that sovereign power which was seeking his advice, all the strictures which have been passed upon him for the action which he has taken would have been thoroughly merited. That obviously refines his case down to a consideration bf whether the Attorney-General did or did not know or think at the time he accepted his retainer that the Commonwealth would eventually be brought into conflict with the State of South Australia upon this matter.",26

123,Mr KELLY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"At any rate, the honourable and learned gentleman has not yet offered an opinion, so that it is not too late for him to withdraw from his anomalous position. In view of the most valuable assistance to this debate which the presence of the Attorney-General might givefor he alone can tell us his opinion as to whether or not the Commonwealth will be likely to be brought into conflict with the State of South Australia-it is infinitely to be regretted that,he 'has not seen fit to come within the precincts of the House to explain the exact position of this matter.",27
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Why * should he do so? He is earning money.,27
125,Mr KELLY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I should be the last to suggest that the Attorney-General should take his place in this Chamber every afternoon of the week- I think that that would be too awful a sacrifice for him to make. But when the Committee are entering upon a debate of supreme constitutional importance, it is at 'least due to us that he should attend, and render all the help that he possibly can. Recently the House, and particularly the Opposition, have been subjected to a series of insults at the hands of the Government. Day after day we have seen the Chamber empty, whilst important public questions have been under discussion. That condition of affairs has been aggravated this afternoon by the absence of the Attorney-General. We are discussing his action, and under the circumstances it is only properthat he should be present to explain it. For that reason I suggest most respectfully to the Prime Minister that this debate should be adjourned until such time as it will be convenient for the Attorney General to attend here for the purpose bf rendering a true account of the circumstances under which he was asked to give this opinion, and of stating whether it will bind him in the future-.",27
126,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," The honourable member for Wentworth has suggested that the debate should be adjourned. I propose to put that request in the form of a definite proposal, and I therefore move That the proposed vote be reduced by £1, 1 I think that will bring the Attorney General to the table. If ever a legislative body has been contemptuously treated upon a high constitutional question, certainly this Chamber has been so treated by the Attorney-General. The honourable and learned gentleman was apprised, by the Opposition whip at one o'clock today of the intention of the honourable member for Parramatta to bring this matter forward, and, according to the Prime Minister, he was again notified when the deputy leader of the Opposition rose to speak. His reply was that he was engaged in Court practice. Surely that is evidence that a high and distinguished lawyer regards his private practice-hi s own interests-as of paramount importance. My proposal will test not only the feeling of the Committee, but also that of the Labour Party. For years past that party has been preaching the gospel of one man one billet; but today we find them defending the lawvers.",27
127,Mr LONSDALE,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Everybody ; is becoming a lawyer nowadays.,27
128,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Accordin g to the interjection of the honourable member, those who are not in favour of lawyers are fast becoming lawyers. As was stated by the honourable member for Parramatta, the course followed by the Attorney-General involves a principle which is dangerous to the credit of Governments, and perilous to the security of great public interests, and I cannot conceive of any House allowing this matter to pass in the way that it appears to be doing. To me it is apparent that the Opposition have been too easy-going in their attitude towards the present Government. As regards the position of the Attorney-General, his duty is clear; either he should resign his Ministerial office or relinquish his position as counsel for the South Australian Government. The dangers attaching to the dual position which he holds have already been emphasized. The Prime Minister has admitted that the honourable and learned gentleman enjoys a retainer to give an opinion to the South Australian Government. Should he refuse to do so, in the event of Commonwealth rights becoming involved, he will fail in his duty to his client. Surely the Prime Minister'will not place the Attorney-General in that position? Because the rights of the Commonwealth are endangered, is he not to act faithfully to the South Australian Government? If he does offer an opinion upon State rights, or upon the navigability of the River Murray - a matter in which South Australia is vitally interested, which the adjoining States are even more interested-w e shall find his duties as counsel upon one side and as Attorney-General upon the other in conflict. Instead of being the custodian and guardian of our highest rights, he is treating us in a most contemptuous manner. Was any Chamber ever flouted more than this Chamber has been flouted by him? No more serious attack could be made upon any public man than has been made upon the Attorney-General this afternoon. Does he imagine that that attack is prompted by mere caprice or whim ? I ask honourable members to note that, although lawyer after lawyer has been defending the Attornev-General, not one has excused the course which has been adopted by him. We find the legal fraternity true to their union rules. Every lawyer who has addressed the Committee has defended the Attorney-General, but not a single member has declared that the course which he adopted is a good one. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, the Minister of Trade and Customs, the honourable member for Riverina, and others, who were formerly members of the New South Wales Parliament, must have a vivid recollection of the great fight which was made in connection with the Proudfoot case, in which two of the present Justices of the High Court were engaged., In this instance, the Attorney General has been retained on behalf of the South Australian Government to give an opinion upon the Murray waters question. That Government desires to appeal to the High Court, which is composed of three Justices, two of whom were censured for having engaged in a similar practice.",27
129,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,But that was a case in which litigation had absolutely commenced.,28
130,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Where is the difference between the two?,28
131,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"In one case, counsel was asked for an opinion; in the other, counsel appeared as an advocate.",28
132,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The honourable and learned member for Werriwa says that in one instance there was litigation, whereas in the case under discussion there has been none. I fail to see where the distinction comes in. The South Australian Government 'has retained certain gentlemen, presumably because of their distinguished legal ability. The whole of these three gentlemen are members of the Commonwealth Parliament. When they furnish their opinion; the South Australian Government will act upon it. What is the use of and in a State incurring expense to obtain an opinion if it is not to be acted upon ?",28
133,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Lega l opinions frequently prevent proceedings being taken.,28
134,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Fro m the newspapers we learn that the South Australian Government has been asked to decide whether they will refer the matter in dispute to the High Court or to the Privy Council. Apparently they are in favour of remitting it to the former tribunal. In these circumstances the Commonwealth will probably come into conflict with the Government of South Australia, and the Attorney-General, as principal law officer of the Crown, will not only have to advise what action shall be taken by us, but, as a representative of the people, will have to take part in any discussion that may arise in this Chamber in regard to the question. I hold that the honourable and learned 1 member for Angas, 'in a less degree, has also committed an offence.",28
135,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Does the honourable member mean to say that no barrister in the House should accept any brief whatever?,28
136,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,He should not accept a brief against the Crown.,28
137,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,But in this case the Attorney-General has not accepted a brief against the Commonwealth. It is simply a States matter.,28
138,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The Attorney-General must decide once and for all whether he is to sacrifice his private practice or neglect his public duties. The honourable member for Parramatta has brought forward one of the strongest complaints that could be made against a Ministry, and, although it has been pleaded that the late Attorney General when in office acted for the South Australian Government, I can only say that the then Opposition failed in their public duty by neglecting to bring his conduct before the House. As soon as I learned of the position of the Attorney-General in regard to this case I brought it under the notice of honourable members. When the action of two law officers of the Crown in New South Wales, in connection with the Proudfoot .case, was discussed in the State Parliament of New South Wales, it was condemned by the honourable member for Riverina, although he said that he would not vote against the Government.",28
139,Mr CHANTER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The honourable member is entirely in error.,29
140,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I shall be able to support my assertion by quoting Hansard.,29
141,Mr CHANTER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,If the honourable member turns to Hansard he will find that he is mistaken.,29
142,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I should not have submitted an amendment but for the flippant way in which the Prime Minister has dealt with our complaint. I shall test the Labour Party. If they believe in ""one man one billet""",29
143,Mr WATKINS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The honourable member should test his own party.,29
144,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I refer to the position taken up by the Labour Party, because in the early stages of the debate they interjected most persistently in opposition to the opinions expressed by the Opposition. The honourable' member for Barrier, and also the honourable member for Maranoa, said that if the action taken by the late Attorney-General had been brought before the House at the time they would have voted against the continuance of such a practice. ",29
145,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I understood the honourable member to interject that he would have done so. Does he think the practice is a proper one?  to give notice of his question.,29
146,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"We shall test the question. Those who vote against the amendment will signify their approval of the practice, whilst those who vote for it will show that they consider that the members of the legal profession in the House should not allow their professional interests to clash with the discharge of their public duties. If ever a party has been treated with contempt the Opposition has been today. The Attorney-General's desire for the '""shekels"" is so strong that even today he is neglecting his public duty, and is earning a fee by appearing in one of the lower Courts. If honourable members support him on this occasion they can never complain if others adopt the practice which the Opposition have condemned. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) - I regret that so much purely artificial warmth should have been generated by honourable members opposite in dealing with this question. It seems to me that there was no necessity for the severe castigation to which the Attorney-General has been subjected. The honourable and learned member for 1 Indi was for several years Attorne?General in a Victorian State Government.",29
147,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,And the people 'of Victoria know him very well. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Every one who is familiar with the history of Victorian politics knows that the honourable and learned member made great financial sacrifices in his desire to serve the people of this State.,29
148,Mr LONSDALE,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I do not know that he made great sacrifices. The honourable member should tell us what they were. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We know that he succeeded in passing some of the best measures that have ever been placed on the statute-book of Victoria to put down the ill practices of boodlering.,29
149,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"He has been after the boodle ever since. Mr KING O'MALLEY - There is a vast difference between the position of the Attorney-General and that of counsel in the Proudfoot case, to which reference has been made by the honourable member for Dalley. The Attorney-General months ago accepted a retainei from ""the South Australian Go1 vernment to give a certain opinion, and that opinion may be the means of obviating the threatened litigation.",29
150,Mr LONSDALE,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"It may have the opposite effect. The honourable member does not know what may be the result ofit. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member for New England is in the same position. It is unfortunate that so many honourable members should be so full of latent superstition, or something else, as to cause them without evidence to jump to certain conclusions. They are prepared to condemn others to the uttermost depths of Hades without any justification whatever. Whilst they attack the Attorney-General",29
151,Mr JOHNSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Why is he not here? Mr KING O'MALLEY - rBecaus e he has to appear in a case in which he was retained probably months ago. If the honourable member had retained the Attorney General before he took office to appear for him in a certain case, and he failed to carry out his agreement, what would he say ?",29
152,Mr JOHNSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Is the discharge of a private duty more important than the fulfilment of a public one? Mr KING O'MALLEY - We must be reasonable. To attempt to reason with a man who possesses no reason is like giving medicine to a dead rat. I do not wish to administer the medicine in this ease, but if honourable members opposite are anxious for it ""they can have it from me. It is much to be regretted that honourable members of the Opposition should be constantly attacking the private characters of others in this House, who 'have made honourable reputations which will live when their antagonists are forgotten. In the Proudfoot case, two honourable gentlemen were retained to appear in Court against the Government. When the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth decides to appearin Court in an action against the Commonwealth Government it will be time enough to attack him, and I may say at once that in such an event I should not hesitate to condemn him.",29
153,Mr JOHNSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"That might happen just as readily as in the case now before the House has occurred. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is the position. The peach is blooming and rosy, but it may be rotten. Are honourable members to be expected to depend solely on the paltry starvation allowance they receive, and to refrain from doing any private business ?",30
154,Mr JOHNSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Does not the General receive a very fair salary? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Why is the leader of the Opposition absent-wh y is he in New South Wales today ?,30
155,Mr CHANTER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,He is away earning fees. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Because he cannot afford to remain day after day in this House.,30
156,Mr JOHNSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,He is not General. Mr KING O'MALLEY - He leader of the Opposition.,30
157,Mr JOHNSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Bu the is not in receipt of a salary as such. He simply has an allowance as a member of the Parliament.,30
158,Mr KING OMALLEY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"He is receivopinion ing ,£""400 a year, just as I am. It is all very well for honourable members opposite to use a boomerang argument, but when they do they must expect it to recoil on them.",30
159,Mr JOHNSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Every honourable member is expected to be in attendance. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Jus t as honourable members of the Labour Party attend from day to day. It is a disgrace that the Commonwealth-whic h was shown by the Treasurer, yesterday to be one of the richest countries in the world-shoul d keep in members in Parliament on starvation wages.",30
160,Mr LONSDALE,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Why does not the honourable member and his party induce the Government to take steps to increase the allowance ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - We cannot force the Government to do anything of the kind. Is the Attorney-General tot stand condemned because he is absent fulfillin g an engagement, which was entered into, perhaps, six months ago ? The attacks that have been made upon him'are unrighteous and unchristianlike. Is the House to be turned into a bear garden ? Is it to become a pugilistic establishment, at which honourable members are to attend and slog each other? That is really what honourable members opposite bave been attempting to do for the last month. The members of the Labour Party sitting here in the corner have lately been acting as umpires. The Opposition and the Government have been slogging each other, whilst we 'have been seeing fair play, and, liftin g up the fallen ones, have placed them on their feet again. I shall vote against the amendment, and I call upon the honourable member for 'Wentworth to show his patriotism by moving that the allowance to honourable Attorney- members be increased by ,£200 per annum. I trust that honourable members will pursue a more reasonable course, so that we mav conclude the business which lies before us by the end of October.",30
161,Mr LONSDALE,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," The question before us is not whether the Attorney-General should now be in attendance at the Law Courts or carry on a private Attorney- practice, but whether he should be retained by the South Australian Government to adis the vise them on a question in which the Commonwealth may become very deeply involved. He was perfectly entitled to accept his retainer at the time when he was merely a private member of this House; but in view of the fact that before his was given, he became a member of a Ministry which has control over the rivers question, matters have become complicated. He has been retained by one of the parties interested in a question in which the interests of three or more States may conflict, and in which the Commonwealth may have to intervene. I contend that when he became Attorney-General, it was his duty to withdraw from his position as counsel for the South Australian Government as soon as the work upon which he was engaged was completed. There should have been no need for the display of heat in this matter, but the House has been flouted by the Attorney-General. Information was conveyed to him that this matter was to be brought forward, and if he had attended this afternoon there is very little doubt that the whole question would have been settled in a few minutes. The Government, however, having a strong majority behind them, or, rather, having umpires who aire prepared, even at the sacrifice of their own opinions, to help the side that is in, have no hesitation about dealing cavalierly with members of the Opposition.",30
162,Mr WATKINS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Why was not this question raised when Senator Sir Josiah Symon held the position of Attorney-General in the Reid Government?,31
163,Mr LONSDALE,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Nothin g was known about the matter. The only knowledge I had upon the subject was conveyed to me by the honourable and learned member for Angas, who told me that he was acting for the South Australian Government, and I was surprised afterwards to hear that Senator Sir Josiah Symon had anything to do with the matter whilst he was Attorney General. If the then Opposition were aware of the facts at that time, they failed in their duty in not calling attention to them. The dual position occupied by the present Attorney-General should not be tolerated, and if this House has any respect for itself, or a proper conception of its dignity, it will insist upon the Attorney-General either resigning his position as counsel for the South Australian Government as soon as his present work is completed, or retiring from the Ministry. He cannot now be in a position to do justice to all parties in the event of the Commonwealth becoming involved. No man should stand as counsel for both sides, and no Court in the world would permit of that being done, and yet this, the highest Court in the land, intends to permit such a state of things. Honourable members opposite know that the present position is an improper one, and yet they do not dare to vote as their consciences direct them. should not have said a word 'against the Attorney-General if he had attended in the House ' and stated that he must complete the work which he had begun, but that when it was finished, he would withdraw entirely from the position.. I should have been perfectly satisfied with that explanation.",31
164,Mr KELLY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Has the Attorney-General been sent for? Mr LONSDALE , - I understand that word was sent to bim that this matter was cobe brought up. If he had even sent a letter explaining the circumstances, I should have been satisfied. However, he has not only abstained from attending in the House, but has. given no reason for his continued absence. The Proudfoot case has been. referred to, and I may mention that in connection with that matter I took the same view that I am expressing today. When a member of Parliament accepts a position as a member of the Ministry, he should at once retire from, every case in which the Government is likely to become interested. I shall certainly vote for the reduction of the vote, in order to show my sense of the treatment to which honourable members have been subjected'.",31
165,Mr CROUCH,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," After the trivialities with which the Committee has been, occupied this afternoon",31
166,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I would ask, Mr Chairman, whether the honourable and learned member is in order in referring to any discussion as being made up of trivialities?",31
167,The CHAIRMAN,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The honourable and learned member is scarcely in order in using that term.,31
168,Mr CROUCH,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"If the honourable and learned member for Werriwa considers that I have been offensive to him personally, I cheerfully withdraw the remark so far as he is concerned - I think the time has arrived when we should deal with matters of national importance, and I therefore propose to direct attention to the case of the Drysdale Post-office. The honourable member for Wentworth has occupied a considerable time in discussing a matter regarding which he acknowledged his ignorance, and I think I shall be justified in speaking upon a subject with which I am thoroughly acquainted. Drysdale, which is the centre of a very large farming district in the constituency of Corio, is situated or* the road to Queenscliff. It is one of the oldest setlements in Victoria, and principally on that account, has had to put up with a post-office which was built many I years ago for the purposes of a private dwelling. The consequence is that the accommodation at present provided is entirely inadequate, and particularly unsuitable. Persons using the telephone inside the wooden building, can be distinctly heard by others standing on the footway, and recently a local clergyman said that he was able to hear tips for the Melbourne Cup .being communicated by persons at D.rys<iale to their friends elsewhere. The present premises are being rented by the Postal Department, and in view of their utter un.suitability, the residents of Drysdale are highly indignant. I trust the Postmaster General will endeavour to meet the desires of the residents. A stone building at present occupied by one of the banks would be suitable for the purposes of a post-office, and I believe the rental would not be very high. If that building cannot be secured, i hope the Postmaster-General will endeavour to provide other suitable accommodation. The late Postmaster-General of Victoria promised that a new post-office should be built.",31
169,Mr TUDOR,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Was it in his electorate?,32
170,Mr CROUCH,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"No ; but he was able to recognise the very proper demand that the residents were making, and a promise made by a State Postmaster-General should be kept by his successor, the Commonwealth Postmaster-General. The district is of great importance, and we are not asking for the expenditure of' a large sum money. I also wish to direct, the attention of the Postmaster-General to the need for placing a clock in the tower of the Geeevent long Post-office. The building was erected ten or twelve years ago, and four vacant spaces are left in the tower for the faces. These are at present boarded in, and are a standing disgrace to the town. There is a section in the Postal Act under which, if local subscriptions are raised for any purpose of this kind, the Postnot master-General is empowered to find the balance needed for the work; and I can make the proposal to the honourable gentleagainst man that, if he will promise to place a - clock in the Geelong Post-office tower, local residents will subscribe .£200 towards the cost. Mr KELLY.'-What would the cost",32
171,Mr CROUCH,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"About £600. I undertorney-General stand that this will be the first occasion which the section to which I refer has given effect to. There are several other matters to which I should like to direct tention, but I feel that it would be unwise to ask too much on this occasion.",32
172,Mr KELLY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND, I am surprised that tlTe honourable and learned member for Corio thinks that the Drysdale office is more worthy of the attention of the House than is the question whether the Attorney-Genera.} owes a certain debt of courtesy to the Chamber. - Mr Wilks - This is a lawyer's way of evading the question.,32
173,Mr KELLY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I understand that the honourable and learned member has tried to raise new issues-suc h as the advisability of importing a clock from England to place in the Geelong post-office tower, although, one might think, such a clock might easily be made in Australia, and the money kept in the country-in order to take our attention from the fact that the Attorney-General has accepted from the State of South Australia what practically amounts to an office of profit. For he has been asked to give an opinion on matters connected with the control of the navigation of the rivers of the Commonwealth; and he will be paid for that opinion in hard, solid coin of the realm. Honourable members of the legal profession always regard questions of fees as of t'he supremest importance. No one's opinion on a legal point is worth more than that of one the Attorney-General; but, inasmuch as that honourable and learned gentleman is of paid in solid cash for advising the Government of the Commonwealth on matters of law, it should not be possible, in the of a conflict arising between the Commonwealth and South Australia, or any other State, for his opinion to be quoted clock against the Commonwealth. For him to occupy two positions in a matter of this kind is not in the best interests of the Commonwealth. It has been stated by the honourable member for New England, and contradicted by Ministers, that the Attorney-General has been sent for to answer the grave charges which have been made him, and there can be only two explanations of his refusal to come. Either the he thinks it safer to stay away and refuse to answer the charge, or he is contemptuous of this House; and we should not stand such contempt or such evasion from be? any servant of the House. The Atis paid, as Attorneyon General, a certain salary-and no one been is better worth it than he-for the discharge of certain services to the Commonatwealth, and when the House demands that he shall attend to explain his actions, he has no right to stay away.",32
174,Sir JOHN FORREST,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The House has not postsaid that he shall attend.,32
175,Mr KELLY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The right honourable gentleman mav not want him to attend, though I am surprised at that, because no one has stuck so devotedly to office, or more loyally to his party-hi s late party-tha n has the Treasurer.",32
176,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,No man sticks to office ter.,33
177,Mr KELLY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Eithe r the Attorneyposition General is flaunting this House, or he has no explanation to make; and it is our duty to keep the discussion going, to give him an opportunity to come here to make his excuses. The fact that he has lucrative employment elsewhere is no proper reason for his absence. I do not contend that should be kept pinned to the Treasury lsench, but when the House wants him, should attend. The honourable member for Darwin told us that the principle man one billet is not intended to apply to members of Parliament, and we have known for a long time past that members of the Labour Party in New South Wales do not so apply it. They used to march under a banner inscribed "" One man one job,"" and they still insist that humbler people shall do so. But personally they take as many jobs as they can lay their hands on.",33
178,Mr CHANTER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,So do other honourable had failed? members.,33
179,Mr KELLY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Yes , but other members do not protest that no man should do more than one thing. Those who sit on the cortrue. ner benches do not care twopence for their catch cries when their own private interests are affected; and they are ready to take two or more jobs if they can obtain inam creased emoluments, in which respect they are only human like the rest of us. But, as to their present attitude, is it to be pected that a party whose members are frantically anxious to become lawyer* should be other than careful not to curtail - I shall not say the prerogatives-bu t the claims of the legal profession? In New South Wales, where there are so many Labour lawyers, there are unions which, though a short time ago immensely wealthy, are now very poor. Will the honourable member for Newcastle tell the House that a union in his district which had a great amount of money to its credit has now much as it had before the Labour lawyers and the Arbitration Court simultaneously made their appearance?",33
180,Mr WATKINS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,They have as much money as ever.,33
181,Mr KELLY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The labour lawyers, or the union ?",33
182,Mr WATKINS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The union.,33
183,Mr KELLY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I think - that if the honnise orable member consults the facts he will see that his statement is open to correction. 'Honourable members who sit on the corner betbenches were at one time bitterly opposed to having lawyers in politics, or in any of responsibility; but lately they have begun to realise the importance of the positions which they may some day fill in the legal world; and, not with a view to shortening procedure in the courts, nor for the benefit of the unions for which they appear, but for their own private advantage, he hope to become lawyers and to obtain, under a self-created class prejudice, the he legal business of the Commonwealth.",33
184,Mr WATKINS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Some men have not of one enough brains to become lawyers.,33
185,Mr KELLY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The honourable member is one of the few men in the party who have not attempted to become a lawyer.,33
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,He set out once.,33
187,Mr WATKINS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"No , never.",33
188,Mr KELLY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"A m I to understand that when he said that some men had not enough brains to become lawyers, he was referring to the fact that he himself had tried, but",33
189,Mr WATKINS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,TTh e honourable member for Parramatta had better withdraw that statement. He must know that it is not,33
190,Mr KELLY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I at once withdraw the horrible charge that the honourable member had any ambition to become a lawyer. I more than glad to see that the Attorney General has at last recognised the responsibility which he owes to this Chamber, but exI deeply regret that immediately upon Kis entry he should deem the present discussion of so little importance that probably professional and private matters can completely claim his attention. _ I can assure him that this is no laughing matter. It is one of which this Committee has taken notice, and of which the country tomorrow will take notice. Members of the Opposition are asking the country whether a gentleman who accepts the high office of Attorney-General owes his first duty_ to this as House and the Government, or to himself and his professional position in this city?",33
191,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Firs t and last, it is a case of self with the Attorney-General.",33
192,Mr KELLY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The Attorney-General is under an obligation to the House, and I deeply regret that he has not recognised that fact any more than he seems to recogthe common courtesy which he owes to this Chamber when devoting itself to his administration. I hope that he will not leave the chamber, because we have been waiting for him patiently since half-past two o'clock. Will he admit that he received a telephone message this afternoon asking him to be present in his place in Parliament ?",33
193,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I did not receive it until fairly late-until I was engaged in Court.,34
194,Mr KELLY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Did the Attorney-General receive that message before 3 o'clock ?,34
195,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Yes ; but I could not then leave the Court.,34
196,Mr KELLY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Coul d not the honourable and learned gentleman 'have "" trusted "" the Court? We have heard a lot of talk recently in that connection. Besides, I presume that in all cases he has the assistance of junior counsel",34
197,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,This is most unreasonable. The honourable member could have mentioned the matter long ago had he wished to do so.,34
198,Mr KELLY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The honourable and learned gentleman states what is incorrect. I had no knowledge that any previous Attorney-General had ever accepted any office of profit under the Crown.,34
199,Mr GROOM,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,To what does the honourable member refer?,34
200,Mr KELLY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I presume the Attorney General will admit that this retainer is being paid. When a man receives a certain sum for performing certain work, I ask any layman in this Chamber whether that work is not one of profit. Although I mav not be fully seized of these legal refinements, I say that the Attorney-General has accepted a certain payment, and that the opinion which he has to give in return may eventually bring the high office which he holds into conflict with a State.",34
201,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Not at all. The question involved is merely one as between States, not as between the Commonwealth and any State.",34

204,Mr KELLY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Exactly . Let us assume that one State locks up a river, or demands for irrigation too great a supply of water to permit of the navigability of the stream, who is eventually to decide the matter in dispute? Is it not the Commonwealth? Will the Attorney-General deny that?",34

206,Mr KELLY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"We are bound to sea that each State observes the right of every other State under the Constitution. The Attorney-General knows that, a'id he knows that the South Australian Governm-int would not ask him for an opinion if they did not afterwards propose to state a case for decision by the High Court. When that case is stated, the matter in dispute will be contested. The Attorney-General's statement is a mere quibble which is unworthy of the honourable and learned gentleman. It is the veriest quibble to declare that the Federal authority will never be brought into the question. I bitterly regret that the Attorney-General has seen lit to place his own professional business before his duty to this House. If he had been present this afternoon to make his explanation, we could have pressed on with what he has been pleased to term "" men's business."" Now that the honourable and learned gentleman is present, I trust that we shall have his explanation forthwith.",34
207,Mr JOHNSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," I have no desire to prolong this debate, but interjections have been made by honourable members concerning what the leader of the Opposition would do in the matter of neglecting his private nractice if he found it more lucrative than attending to his parliamentary duties. I would point out that there is an essential difference between the position of a private member and that of a member of the Government. Private members are not in receipt officially of a salary. Members of the Ministry receive special salaries for the offices which they fill, obviously with the object of enabling them todevote the whole of their time to public business without incurring any personal loss. And there is this to be said in reference to the leader of the Opposition-that whilst in office lie did not attend to his legal practice. He gave it up entirelv. and devoted himself solely to the duties of his position as Prime Minister.",34
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,He is suffering today as the result.,34
209,Mr JOHNSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"When he occupied that distinguished position, the right honourable member for East Svdney resolved that his private interests would have to give way to has public duties. I do not say that the Attorney-General should be expected to abandon the whole of his private practice, even for the emoluments of office, but I do say that in a special case of this ldnd, in which a specific charge was made against him- a charge of a very serious character, and one affecting his position in the Ministry-it was an .act of gross discourtesy on his part not to explain in answer to the telephone message which he received, why he could not attend here, or not to ask to be excused from attendance at the Court for the short period necessary to explain his position.",34
210,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"That was impossible. Mi. JOHNSON - I do not wish to condemn any person unheard. I admit that it is fair to await the Attorney General's explanation for his absence. I can only say that by reason of his absence public business in this Chamber has been - delayed, and to that extent the honourable and learned gentleman must be held responsible. One of the peculiarities of this debate has been the appearance of the Labour Party in a new role. In the past we have, been treated to peculiar exhibitions of their capacity for changing their principles and tactics. Their attitude upon the present occasion, however, constitutes one of the most extraordinary somersaults that we have witnessed. Hitherto, they have always posed as the opponents of practices of the kind which form the subject of the piesent protest from the deputy leader of the Opposition. Now, however, we find them suddenly going back upon all their previous professions, and becoming apologists for the Attorney-General in his position of accepting a retaining fee on behalf of a State which may, as a result of his advice, be brought into conflict with the Commonwealth Government. It will be interesting to watch future developments, and to see the attitude which they adopt under similar circumstances towards any Ministry to which they hereafter are opposed. The present debate will be interest1 ing as a record for future reference in that connection, and honourable members opposite may rest assured that it will not be forgotten. Now that the Attorney-General is present, I trust that we shal!_ hear some satisfactory explanation from him.",35

This is a matter which has before the public for a very considerable time. Certainly it has been before honourable members for some months, and I should have thought that if any honourable member intended to refer to it the least he could have done was to give me timely notice, instead of waiting till I was actually engaged in the transaction of business in Court, it being then utterly impossible for me to leave or, in fact, to do more than I did. What I did was to telephone to the Prime Minister, asking him to make the explanation which I understand he made for me.",35
212,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The honourable and learned gentleman had notice of the intention of the deputy leader of the Opposition to bring this matter forward at 1 o'clock this afternoon.,35
213,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,TK e honourable member must not say that. His statement is not correct.,35
214,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Pardo n me. The Government Whip had the information at 1 o'clock this afternoon.,35
215,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I can only assure the honourable member that I did not receive it until very much later. As soon as I did I put myself in communication with the Prime Minister, with the result that I have mentioned. What is the position? Some months ago I received a retainer from the South Australian Government- a retainer that I was bound to accept as an ordinary practising barrister. It is not for me to choose my clients. I accepted that retainer, and I hold it still. The question which was put before me was one of riparian rights between States, and did not concern the Commonwealth in a single particular. As far as I am able to judge, there is no Commonwealth right involved. The Commonwealth is well protected as regards its powers over navigation. Section 100 of the Constitution Act provides thatThe Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade or commerce, abridge the right of a State or of the residents therein to the reasonable use of the waters of rivers for conservation or irrigation. Under that provision "" States"" and ""residents "" are put upon exactly the same footing, and if I could not accept a retainer for a State I could not hold one for an individual who might complain that his riparian rights had been interfered with. If Commonwealth rights were involved, I can only say that I should instantly retire been from my position as adviser of the South Australian Government. I should not hold that position one moment, if directly or indirectly the rights or in* terests of the Commonwealth as a whole were involved. But untilthat occursand it has not occurred, and I fail to see how it can possibly occur- I am not only justified, but am bound to hold my retainer, and do my duty to my client. '",35
216,Mr LONSDALE,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Until the honourable and learned member has discharged his obligations under the existing retainer.,36
217,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"But the case is one which does not affect the Commonwealth. My predecessor in office, Sir Josiah Symon, held his retainer, in the very same way as I have done, throughout the existence of the Reid-MCLean Government. Why was no complaint then made?",36
218,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,We did not know of it.,36
219,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I have asked three of his colleagues, and they did not know of it. Mr KING O'.MALLEY - The Labour Party knew of it.",36
220,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I shall not venture to contradict the honourable member for Parramatta, but the fact that the late Attorney-General did hold that retainer was absolutely public property, and it is astonishing that any one could have remained ignorant of'it. I hold that my predecessor was absolutely justified in the course he adopted. All that he was required to do was to advise whether New South Wales or Victoria was acting wrongfully to South Australia in regard to the diversion of water. That was the whole question between these States, and it might Have been one raised as between individuals. Such a case might occur between a resident of New South Wales and a resident of South Australia.",36
221,Mr HENRY WILLIS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,But was it not a Federal matter?,36
222,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,No .,36
223,Mr HENRY WILLIS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Not a Federal matter as among the States themselves? Mr .ISAACS - A question as between the States would not be a Federal matter. My honourable friend will pardon me for saying that there is a clear distinction between a right as a Commonwealth right and a right as a State right. There are certain powers retained by the States, and in that regard the question at issue between South Australia and certain other States stands as if there had never been a Federation. It seems to be absolutely absurd, therefore, that any question, should be raised as to my action. I can only say that the whole 'matter rests upon two considerations-firs t of all, that up to the present-and so far as I can see it will be the same in thefuture-n o question affecting the Commonwealth has arisen or can arise.",36

225,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Certainl y not. In the next place I can only say that I shall always do as I did when Attorney-General of Victoria-that the instant my duty to a client conflicts with the interest of the Commonwealth, that instant I shall return mv retainer and have nothing to do with the case. That is the whole position. Mr Wilks' - Why did the honourable member not return his retainer when he took office?",36
226,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Have I not explained that the position in which it would be my duty to do so has not arisen, and is not likely to arise? I venture to say that no lawyer in this House will say that I am not right. - Mr KELLY - Her e we have the union once more.",36

228,Mr ROBINSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The Attorney-Generar is absolutely right.,36

230,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I do not say that he is a better judge of political insinuations, but a lawyer is in this case necessarily cognisant of the line of distinction existing between Federal law and interest and a State's law and interest. I am ready to abide by the decision of the members of the legal profession sitting on the Opposition benches, as well as by that of the legal members on this side of the House, as to the course I have taken.",36
231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," I wholly resent the statement we have just heard that there is one aspect of the judging of affairs of this kind which is peculiar to lawyers, and another that is peculiar to laymen. Looking at the history of like cases, we find that the .judgment of laymen has always proved to be sounder than that of members of the legal profession. I have yet to leam that the laymen in this House are not at least as well able as are the lawyers to judge of political propriety. Supply Bill (No. 2). [REPRESENTATIVES.]",36
232,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Will the honourable member pardon me ?

233,Mr MCCAY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I have not spoken.,37
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"If the honourable and learned member may appeal only to the lawyers of the Chamber to pronounce judgment, he has a very bad case. If he cannot appeal to the sound, solid, common sense of the House, apart from any professional knowledge, his case must rest upon a very poor foundation. I altogether resent the imputation that has been putuipon the laymen of the Chamber by the Attorney General's specific appeal to the professional opinion of the House.",37
235,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I thought that the Attorney-General appealed to the lawyers on the Opposition benches as those most likely to be opposed to him.,37
236,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I have listened to the honourable member's explanation. He says that it has been a matter of publio notoriety for months that the late Attorney General was retained by the South Australian Government while holding office, and that it is surprising that we did not take this action while the Reid-MCLean Government was in office. I can only say that the first that I learned of the honourable and learned member's action in this regard was from the newspaper, whilst on my way home on Friday last. I have asked three of Sir Josiah Symon's late colleagues whether they had any knowledge of his holding a retainer from the South Australian Government, and they all deny that they had.",37
237,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Does not the fact that the late Attorney-General acted as I have done, afford proof to the honourable member that my position is a correct one?",37
238,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Not necessarily. May I remind my honourable and learned friend that two of the present Justices of the High Court defended the legal and constitutional propriety of a similar action taken by them when they were members of the State Parliament of New South Wales.,37
239,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,It was quite a different matter.,37
240,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,A very similar case. Supply Bill (No. 2).,37
241,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,It was quite different. The opinion of the whole Bar at the time was against them.,37
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I repeat that it was a very similar case. Both those honourable gentlemen defended their position, but the State Parliament sent them to the rightabout, and they were deprived of their offices and their seats in the Legislature. This Parliament as a whole is just as well able to judge of what is an act of. political propriety as any individual member of the legal profession in the Chamber. The Attorney-General says that the case in which he has been retained is one which stands as if no Federation existed. I can only imagine that view to be the outcome of a legal mind.",37
243,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Does the honourable member desire an illegal mind?,37
244,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,No . I want a bit of common sense on this matter.,37
245,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The honourable member heeds a great deal of it.,37
246,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I shall not go to the honourable and learned member for any, nor shall I go to him to acquire a sense of what is public propriety and decency. I shall be the judge of my own actions in that regard. Before the honourable and learned member came into the Chamber I quoted from Quick and Garran, upon the very question of the riparian rights of the States,, to show that in the absence of Federal legislation a State might interfere with the navigability of a river, or remove any impediment from it,'in pursuance of what it deemed to be its riparian rights as a State. Surely the honourable and learned member will recognise that Inter-State commerce might be involved in the blocking of a river. If a State chose to interfere with the navigability of a river, in the prosecution of what it believed to be its riparian rights, would he not, as Attornev-General, have to advise the opening of. that river?",37
247,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,But no such question has arisen.,37
248,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The honourable and learned gentleman should not place himself in a position which involves the possibility of such a thing.,37
249,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I quite agree with the honourable member.,37
250,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The honourable and learned member has no right to accept a retainer from a State Government, which makes it possible that he may have to retire from such a position. It is too late to retire when the trouble has been created. I respectfully submit that the very trouble which the. Attorney-General says has not occurred might arise in consequence of an opinion which he submits to one of the States and for which he is paid; his opinion might provoke the very trouble which, as Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, he might subsequently have to correct. The honourable and learned member cannot serve two masters in this respect, and since there is the possibility of conflict always inhering in the relations between a State and the Commonwealth-and to none of those relations more closely and clearly than it does in matters affecting the water rights of,the various States-the honourable and learned member ought not to place 'himself in such a position. The House has the first right to his services. He servant of Parliament, and it should have some voice in determining whether or not he should take up such a position as he has done. It is not a matter of legal interpretation, but one of which Parliament, in its corporate capacity, is the judge. We have had some further statements on the part of the Prime Minister, who has deprecated the passing of judgment in this matter. In my opening remarks, I was extremely careful not to pass judgment on the Attorney-General. I simply said that I regarded his position in this regard as a grave constitutional anomaly, and asked for an explanation. That has been my attitude up to the present moment. The honourable and learned gentleman's intimation to the House that he will continue to hold the retainer from the South Australian Government, until he finds that to do so will be to come into conflict with his Federal duties, is surprising. His position is absolutely untenable. Many a Parliament has visited punishment on those whom it has found taking up such an anomalous attitude. The honourable member for Darwin is the only member of the Labour Party who has spoken in defence of the Attorney-General, and he has certainly given some very strange reasons in support of his contention as to the propriety (of the Attorney-General's action. Among other things he said that the honourable and learned gentleman by taking this action might really be preventing difficulties arising as between the Commonwealth and the States. If the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth is in a position to prevent trouble between the States and the Commonwealth by taking a fee from a State Government, he must also be in a position to create trouble between them, and I , therefore, say that he ought not to be found placing himself within even the possibility of such a contingency. The very fact that his action as between the State and the Commonwealth may prevent trouble, only serves to illustrate the delicacy of the position in which he stands. Suppose that a solicitor for a private railway were engaged by a competing railway --and in this matter the interests of the States and the Commonwealth are possibly of a competing character, or they may so develop-woul d any one say that it would be proper for him to give an opinion upon a question as to which the two companies were fighting, or upon which they might fight ? That is the position here; but the is the doctrine is laid down that there must be one code of legal morality outside, and another code inside this House. I recognise no 'difference /whatever. The Attorney-General ought to be defending the interests of the Commonwealth, and ought best to have nothing whatever to do with an outside body which at any moment mav come into conflict with this Parliament. He is paid to do our work. He has entered into an obligation to do it. As I have already said, he is the legal watchdog of the Commonwealth, and has no right to undertake to act as legal watchdog of any of the States. I regretted exceedingly to hear that he does not intend to discontinue to accept retainers from States Governments, because, if he takes one from the Government of South Australia, there is no reason why he should not accept one from each of the States Governments. He is under a contract to two bodies, which may at any moment come into conflict, and he may be asked to supply each of them with the legal material upon which they may carry on a fight. We ought not to permit any Minister to occupy such a position. I have done what I regard to be my duty in this matter, and I regret that the House does not take a sufficiently serious view of the question. I have seen Parliaments before today treat a matter such as this as one of the gravest concern, but all we can get now from those who ought to be the last to shower it upon us, is contempt for our efforts to preserve a proper constitutional attitude towards the States.",37
251,Mr MCCAY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," I 'did not feel able to say anything in regard to this matter until I had heard the exact facts of the case. I have now learnt them from - the statement of the Attorney-General, and I do not know that I should have said anything, but for the fact that the Minister was good enough to mention my name. Much as I usually agree with my honourable friends' in the questions they raise with regard to the action of Ministers, I am quite unable to understand the exact fault the Attorney-General has committed in connection with this retainer, for which he is being blamed. I say frankly that I agree with those honourable members who have expressed regret that the Attorney General is unable to be here more constantly, because I think it is desirable that he should be in closer attendance at the House. Mr I SAA CS - I am here a great deal.",38
252,Mr MCCAY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Perhaps so, I am only expressing my own opinion in the matter. I may say that, as one of the colleagues of Senator Sir Josiah Symon in the Reid Government, I was not aware that he had a retainer in the case to which reference has been made.",39
253,Mr KING OMALLEY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,We were aware of it in the labour room.,39
254,Mr MCCAY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"If I were in the labour room, I should know a great many things of which I am at present ignorant; a many things that 1 should be glad to know; and, if I were not under a pledge of recy, a great many things 1 should be glad to make known to the public. stand that the Attorney-General has cepted a retainer from one of two suitors a matter which does not concern the ComAustralian monwealth, and which is not likely in itself, to concern the Commonwealth, which may lead to some other piatter which our interference will become necessary. He is retained in this matter only, and holds no general retainer from the South Australian Government in regard to all - suits, some, of which might involve action against the Commonwealth. He has tainer in ai matter involving two individuals, riparian matters. and a case in which the Commonwealth is rot directly concerned. If he were competent to act in such a matter it would 1 j^ot be open to him to accept a retainer from any suitor, because he could not assured that the Commonwealth might not ultimately become involved in the case.",39
255,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I have a general retainer in this subject-matter.,39
256,Mr MCCAY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,That is as I understand it. The Attorney-General holds a general retainer upon the question of the rights of the various States with regard to the waters of streams that flow through more than one State,39
257,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Upon a question in which the States and the Commonwealth stand closely related to each other.,39
258,Mr MCCAY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The general question of riparian rights is undoubtedly one in which the Commonwealth is interested; but it seems to me to 'be impossible for the Commonwealth to become a party to the particular suit referred to. Consequently, it seems to me that we have no concern in this particular matter, or in what an honourable member of this House, who happens to be a barrister, may do outside, so long as his action does not conflict with his duty to the Commonwealth. If the Attorney-General were to accept a retainer from a State in a case to which the Commonwealth might fairly be expected to become a party, that would be a different matter.",39
259,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I would not even give an opinion in a matter to which the Commonwealth might become a party.,39
260,Mr MCCAY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The Attorney-General would act wrongly if , whilst holding his present position, he gave an opinion to another party in a matter that might affect great the Commonwealth. I do not see, however, how this case could affect the Comsecmonwealth. So far as I am able to judge - and I say frankly that I watch carefully I undereverything that is done by the AttorneyacGeneral and his. colleagues- I do not see in how his position, as counsel for the South Government in this particularcase, can affect his judgment as a member but of this Parliament, or of the Ministry. in What he would do, as counsel to the South Australian Government, would be to give an opinion upon, or argue, the law as it is, or the facts as they are, and that would its - not prejudice his opinion as to what the law ought to be in regard to the right of a reinterference of the Commonwealth in It is only fair to the Attorney-General that I should say that it not appears to me that the case in which he is concerned as counsel has nothing to do with the Commonwealth as a matter of litigation, feel and that therefore we cannot fairly take exception to his action in connection with it.",39
261,Mr CULPIN,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Brisbane)' - An interjection made by me during the time that the honourable member for Wentworth was speaking, wa""s replied to by him, with the remark that the Labour Party used to object to lawyers. I may say that same time they also objected to publicans. I think it would have been a' good thing if they had adhered to that line of conduct. I desire to bring under notice a question affecting the interests of my constituents, namely, the proposal to abandon the rifle range at Toowong, which fails to meet present requirements, and to construct a new range at Sandgate. I think that the new range will be much safer and more convenient for the members of rifle clubs, and I trust that its completion will be facilitated as rapidly as possible.",39
262,Mr HENRY WILLIS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," I listened with very great interest to the marks of the Attorney-General, who appeared to attempt to justify his action in flouting this Parliament. He had an insignificant engagement down town which he regarded as of more importance than the necessity of answering the charge made against him by members of the Opposition- a charge which might have involved the very existence of the Government. Not only did the Attorney-General flout this Parliament, but, knowing that a majority was at his back, he said that he would continue to accept retainers from the States Governments. He has been supported by his brother lawyers in this House, who admit that the Commonwealth may become involved in the case in which the Attorney General's advice has been sought, although they do not think it probable that it will be. That admission is quite sufficient to justify the attitude assumed by members of the Opposition. If the Attorney-General were retained as counsel for a State Government, and a suit involving the Commonwealth were entered upon, the Attorney General would be required to give us the benefit of his advice. He practically admitted his guilt when he pointed to the fact that a position similar to that occupied by himself had been filled by Senator Sir Josiah Symon. The late Attorney General was no more iustified than is the present occupant of that office in holding a .brief from the South Australian Government, and although the Government may weather the present storm, they cannot claim that they have achieved any great victory. The Attorney-General has acted most indiscreetly, not only in flouting honourable members, but in expressing his determination to continue to accept retainers such as those which he now holds, whilst he is receiving high fees as the legal adat the viser of the Commonwealth. He has appealed to his brother professionals in this House, and none of them have dared to say that he .has done wrong.",40
263,Mr ROBINSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"We should not be frightened to say so, if we thought so.",40
264,Mr HENRY WILLIS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"As a matter of fact,- that interjection shows that the honourable and learned member, and other honourable and learned members are frightenedThey liave upheld the Attorney-General in working for two masters for the sake of the "" shekels."" Honourable and learned members are subject to intimidation. Even the honourable and learned member for re- Corinella, who was disposed to take the view that the Attorney-General was not justified in retaining his present position, expressed an opposite opinion after he had been taken by the ear by the Attorney General. I am not permitted to say all I know, but the honourable and learned member for Corinella knows that had he been called upon to speak before the Attorney-General had made his explanation, he would have expressed views very different from those which he uttered. It was not until the Attorney-General had taken him by the ear that he came forward and spoke in the subjunctive mood as to what may or may not occur. But it is most unjust that the legal members of the House should band themselves together in support of the Attorney-General instead of speaking on behalf of the interests of the Commonwealth. The honourable and learned gentleman has been called upon to advise one of the States, and he has told us. that he would advise one or all of them against the interests of the Commonwealth.",40
265,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I did not sav that.,40
266,Mr HENRY WILLIS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"If the honourable and learned gentleman advises a State upon a matter affecting the Commonwealth, is he not advising it as to the position which it should take up against the Commonwealth? Would he be called upon to advise for any other reason ? The honourable and learned member for Angas has made himself famous for his advocacy of the rights of his State in regard to the waters; of the Murray River system, and he has 1 stated a case for the opinionof the Attorney-General and Sir Josiah Symon. These gentlemen have given their opinions, for which they have drawn fees.",40
267,Mr ROBINSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Why should they not do so?,40
268,Mr HENRY WILLIS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,It is the shekels that they think of. No one has a higher opinion of the Attorney-General than I have. But I am thoroughly disgusted to hear him reiterate that he will continue to accept retainers and fees from individual States against the interests of the Commonwealth. - Mr ISAACS - I have not said anything of the kind.,41
269,Mr HENRY WILLIS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The honourable and learned gentleman has stated that he will continue to accept retainers to advise individual States in regard to these conflicting interests, which, as the honourable and learned member for Corinella said, may not concern the Commonwealth, thereby admitting that they may concern the Commonwealth. The Attorney General, because he has a majority at his back, has flouted Parliament.",41
270,Mr THOMAS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,He is only flouting certain members of the Opposition.,41
271,Mr HENRY WILLIS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The wires are already at work, and tomorrow the newspapers of the Commonwealth will fire the public with indignation at what has been done. Honourable members may jeer in their fancied security, but were it not for the fact that Senator Sir Josiah Symon has also been culpable, and that the leader of the - Opposition is absent, there would be something like a crisis on this occasion. I am familiar with Constitutional authorities, and I know that Governments have gone down on questions of this character. That I admit was in days when we had in Parliament men who were constitutionalists. They would not have suffered Parliament to be flouted by the Attorney-General, who caused the House to waste hours while he was earning shekels in a Court down the street. The laughter of honourable members does not disconcert me; it only shows how satisfied they are in their ignorance. The country will not stand this kind of thing, and the fact that we who object to it are in a minority in this Chamber should make our opposition all the stronger. Had the Attorney-General been alive to his responsibilities as a Minister of the Crown, he would have thrown up his brief and the fees attached to it , and come here at once to explain matters to Parliament. If he had done that, the debate might have ended in five minutes.",41
272,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"If I were a client, no lawver should treat my brief in that way.",41
273,Mr HENRY WILLIS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"A citizen who sat in the gallery for hours this afternoon commented on the strangeness of the fact that this discussion should go on so long while the Attorney-General wa.s down the street earning fees. The honourable and learned gentleman has appealed to the legal members of the House, as if they were the men best able to judge of his position.",41
274,Mr ROBINSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Any one with a clear head can judge of it .,41
275,Mr HENRY WILLIS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I would not go to the honourable and learned member for clearness of head, notwithstanding his precocity. However, I am well satisfied with the turn the debate has taken. Two or three victories of this character will mean the downfall Of the Ministry. I know that the Attorney-General will not accept another fee of the same character, and to that extent the debate has done good. But he has no justification for allowing Parliament to discuss a matter for hours when it could have been decided in five minutes, if he had not been down the street earning fees.",41
276,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I am not responsible for the conduct of the honourable member in wasting time.,41
277,Mr HENRY WILLIS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The seriousness of the situation appealed to the Prime Minister, who told us that he had rung up the Attorney-General, and said to him, "" You are wanted in Parliament,"" and that his reply was, "" I will come when this case is finished.""",41
278,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,-That is not so.,41
279,Mr HENRY WILLIS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The Prime Minister stated that he had rung up the Attorney-General, who said that he would not come. I am glad to learn that the Attorney-General did not give that reply.",41
280,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,And nobody said that I gave it .,41
281,Mr HENRY WILLIS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The action of the Prime Minister showed that he was alive to the seriousness of the situation. The Attorney-General has flouted his own leader, and the Government, which I thought stood pretty firmly upon a rock, is standing on sand when a Minister can do that. The Labour Party cheer the Government now, but they would cheer us tomorrow if they thought that it was necessary to support us to prevent a dissolution. For their own safety, they support a Government which will bring in measures which will enable this Parliament to spin out its existence as long as possible. I do not usually speak so warmly, or at such length, but this is a serious matter. If the Government continue to ignore the Opposition, they will find that, instead of being on a bed of roses, they will be on a bed of thorns. Their punishment will come from without, rather than from within, as all reforms come. It is only so long as we have the public with us that we can be secure of our positions, and it is because the members of the Opposition feel that the public will be indignant at the advising of the States by the ACtorney-General against the interests of the Commonwealth that we so strongly resent his action.",41
282,Mr MALONEY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," I think that the debate is not altogether a waste of time, because it will show the House how to avoid a similar occurrence in the future. Let us make a change by providing for an elective Ministry, and. requiring that every Minister shall give up private practice.",42
283,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"If I were a Minister, how would the honourable member make me sit in a room with men with whose opinions I was not in accord?",42
284,Mr MALONEY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The honourable and learned member will never be a Minister. As a member of the State Parliament, I always held strongly, and still hold, that there should be elective Ministries and permanent occupancy of portfolios, with the giving up of private business. So long as the game of the ins and the outs continues, any Attorney-General would be foolish to give up his private practice. But if the leader of the Opposition will move for the election of Ministers and require elective Ministers to give up their private practice, I shall vote for the motion. Any one who has seen the large volume of type-written matter upon which the Attorney-General has been called upon to advise, knows that he has not had time since he has been in office to attend to the case, and that the matter is one which has been the subject of his consideration for over a year. He could not afford to give up his private practice under present .ci'rcumstainces., because he may at any time lose his office by reason of a change of Ministry. But if he had security of tenure-and his abilities would warrant him in holding the office for l if e - I have no doubt that he would be willing to give up his private practice. But until that occurs, or until we adopt a common-sense method of electing Ministers, I trust that he will continue to act as he has been doing.",42
285,Mr FULLER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," I agree with a great many of the remarks of the honourable member for Robertson in regard to the time which has been consumed this afternoon as the result of the absence of the Attorney-General from this Chamber. The absence from the House, not only of the Attorney-General, but of Ministers generally, is a matter of public scandal from one end of Australia to the other. If the Attorney-General cannot find it convenient to attend here whilst the Court is sittingi f he prefers to neglect the business of .the country",42
286,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I do not neglect it. I venture to say that I have done even more than my fair share of work.,42
287,Mr FULLER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The Attorney-General has admitted that he received a telephone message before 3 o'clock this afternoon, requesting him to attend in his place in the Chamber. Had he been present, time would not have been wasted in discussing this matter, and money would thus have been saved to the country. To my mind, that circumstance furnishes another strong reason for our removing to the permanent Seat of Government as speedily as possible. The sooner we are all placed upon the same level in the discharge of our legislative functions, the better it will be for Australia as a whole. I know that there are members in this House representing New South Wales constituencies-and in this connection I may mention the right honourable member for East Sydney and the honourable and learned member for Werriwa - wh o have been compelled to sacrifice a large portion of their professional practice since they entered this Parliament. I abandoned my practice the moment I was returned to the Commonwealth Legislature, realizing that I could not attend fo it and at the same time efficiently perform my parliamentary duties. But there are some representatives who are not able to live upon their parliamentary allowance, and who are compelled to seek some additional source of incomeThe sooner the representatives of the other States are placed upon an equality with those of New South Wales, the better will it be for the Commonwealth. I cannot agree with all the remarks of the honourable member for Robertson. I am sure that the Attorney-General has not endeavoured to intimidate any member of the legal profession. Moreover, if any such intimidation were attempted, there is no body of men who would more keenly resent it than would the members of that profession. The members of the Australian Bar are, in all probability, the most independent set of individuals, so far as character and opinions are concerned, to be found from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. I hope that the ear of the honourable member for Corinella has not been very seriously hurt by the pulling which it received from the Attorney-General, according to the description of the honourable member for Robertson. I take a different view from that of my fellow lawyers of this-matter. I regard the position occupied by the present Attorney-General and by his predecessor in office as one which is ofSen to very serious objection. As far as I am personally concerned, I did not know that the question was to be raised until the deputy leader of the Opposition spoke to me about if just before I entered the Chamber; but I recognise that the Attorney General is the legal watchdog of the Commonwealth, and I think that the anomalous position occupied by the honourable and learned member for Indi calls for very serious consideration on the part of the House arid the country. I should like to refer the Attorney-General to page 885 of Quick and Garran's Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth. ""Under the heading of "" Concurrent powers of the States "" appears the following :The navigation power, being part of the and commerce power, is not "" exclusively "" vested in the Parliament of the Commonwealth,"" and, therefore, the concurrent power of the States to deal with Inter-State navigation able waters will continue, subj.ect to be ousted, in part or in whole, by Federal legislation. Lower down on the same page I findAnd a State may not only, in the absence of Federal legislation, improve the navigability of rivers, but may even obstruct navigability. In the present instance, we find that the Attorney-General, according to his own statement, is advising the South Australian Government upon a question affecting the riparian rights of that State and some other States.",42
288,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Not as affecting navigability.,43
289,Mr FULLER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"- A decision as to the rights of the different States to the waters of a river may easily result in a question affecting its navigability. A State may not only improve, but may even obstruct navigability.",43
290,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Will 'the honourable and learned membei permit me to say that the only question involved, so far as I am aware, is as to whether other States have a right to take as .much water from South Australia as they have done.",43
291,Mr FULLER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"A sufficient quantity of water may be diverted from a river to block its navigation, and consequently to interfere with Inter-State commerce, which . is a matter that comes under Federal jurisdiction, and one with wEich the Attorney General would have to deal.",43
292,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"If such a question could possibly arise, in acting on behalf of South Australia and endeavouring to prevent it, I should actually be acting ""in the interests of the Commonwealth.",43
293,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,That does not affect the question of the propriety of the Attorney-General acting as adviser to a State Government.,43
294,Mr FULLER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Exactly . It does not affect the possibility of the Attorney General in his official position advising a State Government as to an obstruction of navigation. I was a member of the New South Wales Parliament when a similar matter was raised affecting the position of two of the present Justices of the High Court. I think that the course followed by the Attorney-General seriously affects him in his official position. I was very sorry to hear him speak in such a confident way, and with so little regard to the strong trade opinions which have been expressed in this House. I regret that he intends to continue to hold a retainer from the ""South and with navig- Australian Government.",43
295,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I did not say that.,43
296,Mr FULLER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I think that the honourable and learned gentleman has been very indiscreet in this matter. I wish that he had been more gracious to the Committee, and to the Opposition in particular. I sincerely trust that in future when great matters of this sort do arise, he will allow his private interests to give way to those of the public.",43
297,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"If I had had any fair intimation at all I should bave been present in the Chamber this afternoon. The honourable member for Parramatta said that he knew of the matter on Friday, and yet I never heard of his intention to take action until today.",43
298,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The whip went away to ring up the honourable and learned"" gentleman at a quarter to 1 o'clock thisrafternoon.",43
299,Mr HUME COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,But the whip did not get him on the telephone.,43
300,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," I coulc? thoroughly sympathize with the honourable member for Robertson in the strong language which he has used, if the facts were .as he represented them to be. It seems to me, however, that they are not. Indeed, I .think that even the honourable member for Parramatta has misunderstood the position. If this were a case in which the Attorney-General, in his official capacity, had undertaken to give an opinion which might conflict with his duties as chief legal .adviser of the Commonwealth, I should have endorsed every condemnatory word which has been uttered regarding his action. Probably I should have said a great deal more. But the honourable and learned gentleman said in effect, "" My case is of such and such a nature, and I appeal to the honourable and learned member for Wannon, the honourable and learned member for Corinella, and the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, as to whether I have not acted rightlv."" I interpreted that statement differently from the honourable member for Parramatta.. I submit that the Attorney-General knew that we were so opposed to him generally, that if he had acted wrongly, we should have been the first to wipe him out. When the honourable member for Robertson suggests that, because we are members of the legal .profession, we would side with him in an iniquitous course, I am absolutely surprised. If the case were as the honourable member represented, I 'should agree with every word that he uttered.",43
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The House is just as able to judge of a matter propriety as is a lawver.,44
302,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I think so, too. I wish that there were a little more political priety and morality in this House. New South Wales would not then be denied Federal Capital, or her ripht to an adthe case. ditional representative. The Attorney General was asked for his opinion by the South Australian Government before he accepted Ministerial office. had conflicted with his present duties, I should have expected him to throw up his retainer at once, and he says that he would right have so acted.",44
303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The ground I take is that he has no right as Attorney-General to put himself in a position is a possibility of that occurring.,44
304,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The honourable member is perfectly right in the position takes up. But the facts are that the South Australian Government wish to know ther they have certain remedies against any moment. Victoria, or New South Wales, or Queensland, if any of these States interfere with certain waters. That applies not only to the States themselves, but to the residents of those States. Surely a lawyer is entitled to give his opinion upon such a question. In my opinion it is better that lawyers should abstain from practice rather than incur the risk of conflict with their duties as members of Parliament. Since I entered the Commonwealth Parliament I have absolutely refused to deal with any cases in which the Crown is concerned, either upon one side or the other. But what does it entail? The sacrifice of the whole of my professional practice. That is why I complain so bitterly",44
305,Mr LONSDALE,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Of the inadequacy of the parliamentary allowance?,44
306,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Quite so. It is absolutely impossible for an honourable member to attend both to his parliamentary a n i professional duties. A barrister who happens to be a member of Parliament is perfectly justified, however, in undertaking any duty in his professional capacity that does not conflict with his position as a representative of the people. The case, as presented to us, is that the Attorney-General has been asked to advise what are the r i parian rights of South Australia as against, not the Commonwealth, but Victoria, New South Wales, or Queensland, which is a very different thing.",44
307,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"It might be against of political the Commonwealth. Mr CONROY"" - Does not the honourable member recognise that that position might proarise in the very near future?",44
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"And , therefore, the the Attorney-General should keep aloof from",44
309,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"It has not yet arisen. The only provision in the Constitution dealing with this question is section 100, which If his opinion provides ""thatThe Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade or commerce, abridge the of a State or of the residents therein, to the' reasonable useof the waters of rivers for conservation or irrigation.",44
310,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,That preserves the rights in which there of the States.,44

313,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"There can be no conflict at present between the States and the Commonwealth. All that the Attorney-General has been asked to do by the South Australian Government is to give an opinion as to the rights of that State in the case of a conflict with, another State.",45
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I hold that, as a General from the House? possible umpire, he should have referred the question fo some one else.",45
315,Mr MCCAY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,He cannot possibly become an umpire.,45
316,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Does not the honourable member for Parramatta see that a different position altogether would be created if such a thing were possible? As a matter of fact, however, the High Court, and not the Parliament, must deal with these questions. It is the decision of the H i g b Court - and not the decision of the Parliamentwhich is vital, so far as the rights of the States in this respect are concerned.",45
317,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The General might have to place before the Court a case in which one State had focked a river, and interfered with trade.",45
318,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"That case would have to come Before the High Court, and not before the Parliament. Mi. JOSEPH COOK - But the obligation is placed on us under the Constitution to preserve the freedom of trade.",45
319,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The moment any law 01 regulation abridging the right of a State to the use of the waters of rivers was passed, the Attorney-General would be able to deal with questions of this kind. He might then have to state a ease for the opinion of the High Court. It the position were, as some honourable members of the Opposition have suggested, there could be no question as to what ought to be done. But the case is very different from what they suggest. When the Attorney-General appealed to the members of the legal profession in the House, 1 had to say, in all fairness, what, in my opinion, was the real position. I should be very glad to turn the whole Ministry out of office, and wish that I could have found some excuse for doing so in the complaint now under discussion; but in justice to the Attorney General I must say that at present, if the facts be as he has stated, I see nothing 5n his conduct in this case that calls for condemnation. While I think it is a matter for regret that he was not in attendance a little earlier in the afternoon, let me tell honourable members that clients will not always allow their counsel to leave a court at a moment's notice",45

322,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"If the position were as suggested by some of my honourable friends of the Opposition, I should say that time had not been unduly occupied in dealing with it. But I feel constrained to say that I think the Attorney-General has not acted improperly.",45
323,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,That it is right for him to retain his retainer?,45
324,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"If the case is one reAttorneylating only to a dispute between States, he certainly Is right ; but if it were a .matter affecting a dispute between a State and the Commonwealth, his position could not be justified.",45
325,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Would it be proper for him to accept a retainer from every State in any matter affecting State rights ?,45
326,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,He could not do that.,45
327,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Why ?,45
328,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Because such a position could arise, only in an action by the States against the Commonwealth. The Attorney-General tells us that he has simply been asked to advise what are the riparian rights of South Australia as against other States.",45
329,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,And the Commonwealth may be dragged at any time into the dispute.,45

I still hold that view. The Attorney-General has declared his intention to continue to accept retainers from the States Governments, and) I think that he is adopting an altogether wrong attitude, because he should be absolutelyfree from anything that would create suspicion in the public mind.",46

I do not know that that is quite the correct view to take. I can imagine a dispute arising owing to the diversion of waters from the rivers by New South Wales and Victoria, and a question being asked in this Parliament with regard to it. The Attorney-General would then he called upon to express his opinion, and - if it were in conflict with the views expressed by the legal advisers of New South Wales and Victoria, it might be suggested that the Minister was influenced 'by his connection with the South Australian Government.",47
358,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The probability is that I should not answer the question, because it would mot be a proper one to ask.",47
359,Mr LONSDALE,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The mere refusal to answer the question might create suspicion - that the Attorney-General was shirking his - alutv, and I think that everything calculated to operate in that direction should be avoided. I clo not wish to set myself up as .a pattern in this respect, but I may say that I have always declined to do anything that might create suspicion in the public mind with regard to my conduct or character as a public man. if do not suggest that the Attorney'General would do anything wrong, .or that ihe would allow his retainer to influence him one way or the other, but I think we should at its very inception express our strong objection to anything that would tend to prejudicially affect the character of Ministers, or suggest a divided allegiance on their part.",47
360,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I quite agree with that.,47
361,Mr LONSDALE,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"It may be urged that the case in question is one of small importance, but it is better for us to take rela- action in the right direction now rather than to wait until some momentous occasion arises. I quite agree that the Proudfoot case in New South Wales stands on a footing entirely different from that which has been under discussion, but I would point out that the complications which arose over that case would never have occurred if objection had been taken at an earlier stage to Ministers acting as counsel for claimants against the Government. Mr Justice Barton, and M». Justice O'Connor would never have accepted briefs in connection with the case referred to, but for the fact that similar action on the part of others had been allowed to pass without ouestion. I would urge upon the Attorney-General that, as a matter of political propriety, he should set a good example for the future, and withdraw from his present position at the very first opportunity. I am sure that he would not be involved in any great loss.",47
362,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"That is not the question. If it were wrong for me to continue to act as counsel for the South Australian Government, I should not hesitate to retire from that position whatever the loss might be.",47
363,Mr LONSDALE,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"That may be so, but I still think that the Attorney-General would consult his own dignity if he were to take the course suggested. I feel very strongly in this matter, and I shall certainly vote in the direction I indicated when I first addressed the House, because I think we should be very careful to avoid the slightest inroad upon the sphere of duty of Ministers.",47
364,Mr MAUG ER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," I wish to direct attention to a matter of considerable importance to a very large section of the community, namely, the prohibition of the importation ,of opium. I had hoped - that the Government would have declared their policy upon that subject, and I trust that it will receive their earliest .'and most careful consideration. Another matter I desire to mention relates to the Department of the Postmaster-General. A very serious accident recently occurred to a workman who was engaged in painting telegraph poles, and I would urge the Postmaster-General to take all the steps in his power to secure the safety of the men occupied in this work by providing them with belts and scaffolding.",47
365,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," Before alluding very briefly to the subject that has occupied most of the .time the Committee this afternoon, I should like to say that so far we are without information as to whether the Government have accepted the Public Service Classification Scheme'. I am surprised that the Government have not announced their intention in regard to the matter. I understand that no provision is made in the Estimates for the increases in the salaries provided for under the Classification. That might be taken as an indication that the Classification had not been accepted, and I think that we are entitled to some announcement on the subject. The Watson Government stated definitely what their attitude was, and I think",48
366,Mr GROOM,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Did the Government with which the honourable member was associated indicate its attitude?,48
367,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"We had not brought the matter forward - We promised that an opportunity would be afforded to discuss the Classification Scheme, and when matters had readied that stage we should most certainly have indicated our attitude. I . stated most distinctly that, so far as I was concerned, I was prepared to accept the scheme, but I am not sure whether the Prime Minister made any definite announcement on the subject. ",48
368,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Certainly , if an opportunity had been afforded to the Government with which I was connected to bring, the matter forward, we should have regarded it our duty todeclare our attitude with regard to it. I do not propose to prolong the debate that has taken place with regard to the propriety of the Attorney General continuing to act as counsel for the South Australian Government in the matter of the Murray waters question. Up to the stage of his announcement that he intends to accept a renewal of the retainer, I agree with those who found no exception to the action of the Attorney-General.. He, with other members of the Parliament, ""when not in office, undertook to give a legal opinion to the State of South Australia:, on the important matter of the rivers question. If [ 8]-2 4 that work had not been completed when he took office, I would not have objected to its completion, especially as during the brief period for which the retainer had to run there was no likelihood of any serious question arising in the matter which would affect the Commonwealth. So far as the honourable and 'learned member for Angas, against whom some reflections were made, is conof cerned, I think that he was right in accepting a retainer. He was, and is, a private member of the House, and I hold that a private member may fight a question, as he has fought that question, in Parliament, out of Parliament, in his State, or constituency, and, if he sees fit, in the law courts of the country.",48
369,Mr TUDOR,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,What about the action of the Attorney-General of the late Administration ?,48
370,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The statement in the newspaper the other day was the first knowledge I had that either the honourable and learned member for Indi or Senator Sir Josiah Symon had been retained by South Australia, though I understood that the honourable and learned member for Angas had been 'so retained. I 1'earnj from what .has' beep stated that 4 Senator Sir Josiah Symon, like the Attorney-General, when a private member accepted a retainer to give a legal opinion to the State of South Australia. How far he did anything for that retainer while a member of the Ministry, I cannot say.",48
371,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,He occupied the same position as I do.,48
372,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I would have no objection to the Attorriey-General acting in this manner until he had completed the task which he undertook, and I have exonerated the honourable and learned member for Angas from any impropriety. But it is another thing for the Attorney General to announce to Parliament his. intention to renew his retainer. An entirelynew situation now arises. I do not say that it is actually wrong for him to do this, but it is getting near the borderland,. and it is highly desirable, in my opinion, 1 so that there may be no cause for suspicion, that he should come to another decision. It is all very well for the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, and other honourable members, to say that the questions arising between the two States concerned are not such as will affect, the Commonwealth. The honourable and learned member for Werriwa stated that the only power given to the Commonwealth in the Constitution in regard to these river matters is contained in section 100, which says thatThe Commonwealth shall not by any law or regulation of trade or commerce, abridge the right of a State or of the residents therein to the reasonable use of the waters of rivers for conservation or irrigation.",48
373,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,That does not give a power; it restricts the power of the Commonwealth.,49
374,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,It implies a power. Quick and Garran say at page 874 of their Annotated ConstitutionThe power to regulate commerce is the basis of the power to regulate navigation and navigable waters and streams. To me it is evident that some of the questions affecting the Commonwealth must come up in any suit that is entered upon between the States with regard to the waters of the Murray.,49
375,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"If a question arose between two citizens of the Commonwealth regarding their riparian rights, would it be improper for' a Minister to accept a brief from one of them ?",49
376,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I do not say so.,49
377,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,That is a similar case.,49
378,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Eve n in such a case, if the Minister knew that under the Constitution questions mightarise in regard to which the powers of the Commonwealth would be brought into consideration, and possibly into action, he should say,, "" I must hand back my retainer.""",49
379,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"If the interests Commonwealth were in any wav involved, directly or indirectlv. it would be my duty, and I would carry it out at once, to return the retainer.",49
380,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"It might be, as often happens in law cases, that the Commonwealth would have to be represented by counsel in the case, and who would direct counsel if the Attorney General were briefed for one of the parties ?",49
381,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,That situation is impossible.,49
382,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,It is not impossible. I hax'e shown what large powers the Constitution gives to the Commonwealth in connection with navigable rivers and streams.,49
383,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The Commonwealth has power to regulate bills of lading. Am I , therefore, not to appear in a dispute between two merchants arising out of a bill of lading?",49
384,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,That is not a case of the same sort. The Commonwealth is not the trustee of the States in that matter.,49
385,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,It is not the trustee of the States in this matter.,49
386,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The Commonwealth must see that there is equality between the States.  have to interfere if there were a dispute about water rights between Victoria and South Australia? Air. DUGALDTHOMSON - It might. The questions raised might trench on the trust of the CommonAvealth, in which case the Commonwealth might have to interfere.",49
387,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,It could not.,49
388,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I think it undesirable that a Minister should be bound to one of the parties of a suit by which Commonwealth interests may be affected - The proper attitude of the Attorney-General is to stand by, ready to interfere at any moment when he sees the rights of the States which have been committed to his trust trenched upon. The honour, of a Minister is to a certain extent his own, but it is also in the possession of Parliament, and xve should be particular to see, not only that it is not smirched, but that there is no appearance of evil. The consideration of this matter should be above party influence, but with all due respect to the Minister, without of the saying a word against him personally, or impugning his motives, I think that he has not come to the wisest tiecision. I do not blame him for undertaking, before he became a Minister, to give an opinion.",49
389,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I have not completed the work yet.',49
390,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The task I know requires much learned research, tremendous labouir, and grave consideration, and if the Attorney-General says, "" I have not completed it , "" I , for one, will not find the slightest fault with him for going on with it until he has brought it to a completion. But, to renew, the retainer is a different thing. The reason for which a retainer is given is that his services may be called upon by the State.",49
391,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,But not against the Commonwealth.,50
392,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"There might be a danger of a decision being given which would be against the interests of the Commonwealth, unless the CommonAvealth intervenes.",50
393,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,That is quite impossible.,50
394,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"It may be improbable, but it is not impossible. Under the circumstances, I think it highly desirable that the Minister should keep his hands free.",50
395,Mr CHANTER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Shoul d not other mem- bers do so, too?",50
396,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I see no - objection to a lawyer, who is a private member, taking a brief against the Commonwealth, if he sees fit.",50
397,Mr ROBINSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Unde r the Constitution, he cannot accept a brief for the Commonwealth.",50
398,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The honourable member for Riverina, who, like myself, is a lavman, has fought questions in this House, and outside, and if he thought right, and had the opportunity and the means, it would be open to him I o pursue the matter in a suit at law.",50
399,Mr CHANTER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Not if my personal i nbers terest were concerned.,50
400,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I am by speaking of matters affecting the interests of constituents. Similarly, a man may cept a brief for his State against the monwealth if he thinks that the Commoning Avealth is exceeding its poA\'ers. But Attorney-General, Avhose business it is look after the interests of the Commonvernment Avealth, especially in regard to legal ters, occupies a different position, and should have his hands perfectly free. He should not be tied to any party in conpreA'ented nexion Will litigation which may affect the CommonAvealth interest.",50
401,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I quite agree as to that.,50
402,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I shall one, not vote for any motion moved in regard this matter, because I do not say that the propriety. honourable and learned member's action absolutely Avrong, but it is near the line. Unless the Minister alters his s on, .we shall have to aAvait later developof tAvo States. : ments ; but the time occupied in this cussion Avill not have been Avasted if it Ministers to exercise care in guarding their actions, so that the interests of their proimpropriety fessions or business may not, in any case, o\'erlap those of the CommonAvealth.",50
403,Mr ROBINSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," My apology for making a few remarks is that my name has been mentioned once or tAvice during the debate. In this matter, I cannot follow the lead of the honourable member for Parramatta. So far as I have been able to gather from the facts which have been stated to the Committee, no blame or impropriety whatever attaches to the Attorney-General. He has merely given an opinion upon certain matters. He has not appeared in any judicial proceeding. He has simply been asked for an opinion in reference to the rights of tAvo States to thewaters of a river which AOAVS through them. The interests of the Commonwealth are not attacked or concerned by the conflict between those two States, and to my mind the Attorney-General is perfectly justified in accepting a retainer from one of them, and if necessary in appearing in court, and arguing upon its behalf. If Ave are to take up the position that he is not to act for any State, simply because upon some future day the CommonAA-ealth may be concerned in a> dispute, Ave shall make the acceptance of Ministerial office a great bar to men capable of filling the position of Attornev-General. If honourable memaccept that doctrine,, there is scarcely a transaction in ordinary business in xvhich a parity of reasoning the CommonAvealth may not be affected. For example, acan auctioneer, if he Avere a member of ComParliament, might be preA-ented from giva valuation of any land, because posthe sibly at some future time that valuation to might come before the Commonwealth Goas a basis of purchase. If that matdoctrine were pressed to its logical conclusion, not only members of the legal profession, but a great many others AA'Ould be from engaging in any occupation Avhilst carrying out their parliamentary duties. I think that the attitude taken up by the Attorney-General is the correct and that it is entirely within the to bounds, not only of legal, but of ordinary The particular ground of is the attack made upon the honourable border and learned gentleman is that he has decigiven an opinion regarding the rights The CommonAvealth. disat any rate, is not yet concerned leads in that dispute. HOAV can any honourable member say that he has been guilty of any in accepting the responsibility of offering an opinion upon that question?",50
404,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Nobod y has gested that.,51
405,Mr ROBINSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Then why has he been attacked? As honourable members are aware, a case as to riparian rights might easily arise, not between two States, but between two individuals. The very same question as would be considered if two States took action would then be debated. Indeed, most of these important cases are decided, not as between States, but as between individuals in two States. If a person in South Australia sought to j ascertain what were his rights in connection with the waters' of the Murray, the At 1 torney-General would be quite justified in 1 accepting a retainer from him, and in ap[ pearing in court upon his behalf. That being so, I hold that the honourable and learned gentleman has acted perfectly within his rights. His position is entirely in accord with professional propriety. Possibly honourable members may overlook the fact that under the Constitution lawyers labour under many disabilities. For instance, they are debarred from accepting any brief on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. ",51
406,Mr ROBINSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"It may - be a good I thing for those who are suing the ComI monwealth, but it deprives the latter of. the services of all the lawyers in the ComI monwealth Parliament, and they include i some of the ablest in Australia. That is a consideration which should not be overlooked.",51
407,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The tution also debars mercantile men from contracting with the Government.,51
408,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,It does not debar them from contracting with the States Governments.,51
409,Mr ROBINSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I should like honourable members to recollect the discussion upon this very question which took place in the House of Commons some years ago. The result of that debate was that the salary of the Attorney-General was raised to j£io,ooo a year, in addition to which' he receives fees upon all Crown briefs. The latter average about ^8,000 a year.",51
410,Mr THOMAS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Does the Attorney-General in England receive a salary of /Tio,ooo a year?",51
411,Mr ROBINSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Yes . Altogether his emoluments run into about ^18,000. All that has been said upon this question has merely confirmed my belief that the Attorneysug- General has not done anything for which he can be blamed. I make that statement asone who has a perfect detestation of the honourable and learned gentleman's political methods. Nevertheless, I am bound to say that he has acted in this case with strict propriety, and if he continues to hold a retainer from the South Australian Government, he will be justified in appearing in Court upon its behalf, so long as the case possesses, its present complexion. We must rely upon his good sense to relinquish that retainer when he thinks that his duties as counsel will clash with the interests of the Commonwealth.",51
412,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Eve n when I thought that there was any possibility of the two thingsclashing, I should relinquish it.",51
413,Mr ROBINSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"if the honourable and learned gentleman does not resign then,, we have the power in our own hands to deal with him. I should be one of the loudest in my denunciation of any Attorney-General who accepted a brief in opposition to the interests of the Commonwealth Government.",51
414,Mr MCCAY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The honourable and learned member will denounce the Attorney-General when the offence has been committed.,51
415,Mr ROBINSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I shall not be a party, to debar any man-irrespectiv e of whether he be in a large or a small way of business - fro m obtaining those rewards to which his ability and his merit entitle him. But while I say this in support of the Attorney General's attitude, there is one matter to which reference has been made, and to which' I desire briefly to address myself. I Constithink that during thepast few weeks, the Attorney-General has not paid honourable members upon this side of the House that courtesy to which they are entitled. Only the other day, we had a very important discussion upon the Trade Marks Bill . Some very subtle and learned criticisms of that measure were indulged in by the honourable and learned member for Angas, and the honourable and learned member for Corinella-criticism s that we had a right to expect the Minister would have listened tocarefully, making notes upon them, and preparing to answer them. The whole of that criticism, however, by gentlemen whose abilities are well known, was delivered ir* the absence of the Attorney-General. I . felt very keenly upon that matter, and I trust that conduct of that sort will not be repeated. If the same thing occurs again I shall assist in whatever steps may be taken to check the practice of which I complain. Upon the main question, however, I see no impropriety in the conduct of the Attorney-General, or in his continuing to act for the South Australian Government until such time as the interests of the Commonwealth may be threatened.",51
416,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Macquarie) I quite agree with the remarks of the honourable member for North Sydney regarding the attitude of the Government with respect to the Public Service Classification scheme. There is no doubt that a promise was made by previous Administrations that nothing would be done in that matter until an opportunity had been afforded this Chamber of discussing it , and of arriving at a definite decision. We all know that it is open to this Parliament to make any suggestions which it may deem desirable, and we may rest assured that those suggestions will receive consideration at the hands of the Public Service Commissioner. I claim, however, that it is due to the House that the Government should come down with some definite statement regarding their views upon that scheme. So far we have not had any intimation from them as to their attitude upon it . As 0 a rule, I think that the Government should be the leaders of the House. In this connection I was very much surprised at the action of the Treasurer last night. In the course of his Budget deliverance, when speaking of quite a number of matters, he failed! to intimate the opinions of the Government upon them, and when pressed for those opinions, he replied that the Cabinet had not had an opportunity of considering the matters referred to.",52
417,Sir JOHN FORREST,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,What were questions to which the honourable member alludes ?,52
418,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I shall deal with them when the Financial Statement is under discussion. /The Government appear to be waiting till they can ascertain what are the views of honourable members before committing themselves to any definite opinions.,52
419,Mr FISHER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,What are the questions to which the honourable member refers?,52
420,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The Public Service classification scheme is one. Then I understand that the Treasurer entertains a certain opinion in regard to the Braddon section of the Constitution. Upon important questions like these we should be told what is the attitude of the Government.,52
421,Sir JOHN FORREST,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,There are a good many years to run yet. It will befive years before the Braddon section expires.,52
422,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The time is rapidly approaching when it will be necessary for us to take some steps in that matter, especially in view of the small surplus in excess' of the three-fourt'hs of the Customs and Excise revenue whioh will be returnable to the States during the current year. As a matter of fact, that amount will be practically absorbed by interest upon the transferred properties, and by the establishment of a sinking fund. I think that the Government should submit some policy to the House upon matters of this sort.",52
423,Sir JOHN FORREST,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Why did not the Government, of which the honourable member was a member, submit a policy last year?",52
424,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Throug h the treachery of my right honourable friend and a few others we were denied an opportunity of so doing. We came into office when most of the money provided for on the Estimates had been spent. Mr DUGALD THOMSON"" - And the appeals against the classification had not been heard.",52
425,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"That is so. Since then the present Government have had an opportunity to consider the report of the Commissioner. The Treasurer knows that he hardly expressed a definite opinion on any one subject with which he dealt in his Budget statement. I have no hesitation in saying that the late Government would have clearly intimated its intention with regard to the Public Service the Classification if it had had an opportunity to do so. These are matters, however, with which I shall deal more full y at a later stage. I am surprised that the Attorney General should have intimated his determination to* continue to advise the Government of South Australia in matters affecting the other States. No one could have taken exception to his holding a retainer for the South Australian Government as a private member, but there is great danger of the in terests of the Commonwealth being neglected when its chief law officer acts as adviser to a State on a question, that may ultimately affect the powers of the Commonwealth.",52
426,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,How could the powers of the Commonwealth be affected by this case ?,52
427,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,That has been fully explained.,53
428,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,No one has yet explained it.,53
429,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"When an honourable member has made up his mind in regard to any matter, it is difficult to bring forward any facts calculated to induce him to take up a different attitude. The honourable member for North Sydney agreed that the Attorney-General had acted rightly up to a certain point, but that his determination to continue to advise the Government of South Australia in certain questions was unwise, as it might result unfairly to the Commonwealth. I endorse that view. I wish it to be clearlv understood that in speaking in this way I am not influenced by any party spirit. The fact that we do not regard the matter from that stand-point is shown by the readiness with which some members of the Opposition have expressed their concurrence with the attitude of the Attorney-General.",53
430,Mr JOHNSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The legal members of the Opposition.,53
431,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Quite so. Although the Attorney-General has merely accepted a retainer to advise the Government of South Australia on certain questions, the acceptance of that retainer may lead to his holding a brief for that State.",53
432,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Not in any matter affecting Commonwealth interests.,53
433,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The Attorney General might advise the State on certain matters, and his advice might be eventually used against the Commonwealth. He ought to keep himself free from complications of this kind. The honourable and learned gentleman has said that if at any time he found that his acceptance of a retainer from the Government of South Australia imperilled the rights of the Commonwealth he would at once give up that retainer. But it might then be too late for him to withdraw. Proceedings might subsequently be taken by the State, on advice tendered by him, with very serious results to the Commonwealth. When I was a member of the State Legislature of New South Wales, two members of the .then Government accepted a brief against the Crown, and the Parliament did not hesitate, notwithstanding that the Government of the day had a majority, to pass a resolution condemning their action. The result was that those members had to retire from office.",53
434,Mr CHANTER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Was not that a very different case from the one under notice?,53
435,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I admit that it was, and have referred to it only to show that there is a danger of a time arising when the Attorney-General may find himself in almost the same position that those members of the State Parliament occupied. As trustees of the people, we are expected to keep ourselves free from anything that may conflict with our duties to the Commonwealth. I do not take exception to an honourable member acting for a State while he is not in office, but as soon as he takes office the position is different.  involved in the case with, which the Attor1 ney-General is connected.",53
436,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The rights of the Commonwealth may become involved at any time. There is a great deal of feeling between the Governments of South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales relative to the waters of the Murray and the uses to which they may be put. The Attorney-General's own constituents are anxious that the rights of Victorians living near the banks of the Murray should be preserved, and yet the honourable member for Maranoa would allow him to continue to advise the South Australian Government, and eventually perhaps to accept a brief on behalf of that State in a case that might give rise to Commonwealth issues and result in great injury to the other States. I hope that even at this late stage the Attorney-General will withdraw from the position he has taken up. I express the hope with no feeling of hostility towards him. I have always held strong views on this question, and took a prominent part in the debate in the New South Wales Parliament relative to the case to which reference has been made.",53
437,Mr THOMAS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Why did not the honourable member call upon the late Attorney General to return his retainer?,53
438,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I was not responsible for his action, and should like to hear what he has to say with regard to the matter. 1 first heard of this case last evening, when the honourable member for Parramatta showed me a newspaper paragraph dealing with it. I do not for one moment impugn the honesty of the Attorney General, but hold that he should withdraw 1 from the case.",53
439,Mr THOMAS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Why did not the honourable member deal in this way with his late colleague f,53
440,Sir JOHN FORREST,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,He What could he have done against his colleague ?,54
441,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I was not aware at the time that he held a retainer from the South Australian Government. The Treasurer says that I could have done nothing against a colleague. It was no doubt a feeling of that kind that led him to remain a member of a former Administration, although, as he has told us, he had to eat a lot of dirt.",54
442,Sir JOHN FORREST,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I never said anything of the kind, and the honourable member ought to withdraw the statement.",54

I have had a long associain tion with him, and I have found that at all times he has had the full courage of his opinions, even to the point of objecting to sign the labour pledge in New South. in Wales. The respect in which the honourable member is held by the working classes; is shown by the fact that he represents Lithgow, one of the strongest labour centres in New South Wales. It must be admitted that those with whom I have been associated in politics have done as much as have the memmembers of the Labour Party for the working classes of New South Wales. We differ frommembers of the Labour Party obas to methods, but we are as anxious as must they are to further the interests of the Macpeople whom we represent. I rose for the purpose of entering my protest against the action of the Attorney-General in continuing to act as counsel for the South Australian Government. I believe that the Minister would best serve his own interests and those of the Commonwealth if he determined to give it the benefit of his best abilities. The Murray River question seriously affects the interests of New South Wales and Victoria, as well as those of South Australia, and the Attorney-General should undoubtedly keep himself entirely free from all connection with any particular State, in order that he may give the Commonwealth the very best advice upon this important matter",54

Every honourable and learned member, except the honourable and learned member for Illawarra, has supfession, ported the position taken up by the Attorliament, ney-General, whereas, with one exception, monwealth. every lay member of the House has constrong demned it. The question as to the position of the Attorney-General has not been raised as the result of any concerted action on part of the Opposition. That has been finitely shown by the divergencies of opinwho ion amongst its members. By introducing this matter, the honourable member for Parramatta has performed a most valuable service to the Commonwealth, because it is important that we should adhere strictly to constitutional practice and procedure, and that the purity and proprieties of public life should be maintained in this Parliament as. in the British Parliament. In England, the Attorney-General has not even a seat in the Cabinet, but is expected to act as the legal adviser of the Crown and the public of England. The Attorney-General of the Commonwealth should occupy a similar position. The honourable member for North Sydney showed that there was great probability of the interests of the State of South Australia and those of the Commonwealth overlapping in connection with the Murray waters question, and urged that the Commonwealth should not be deprived of the advantage of an absolutely unbiased opinion from its principal legal adviser. It seems to me that the Attorney-General cannot, in justice to himself or the Commonwealth, retain his present position. It is important that we should preserve the purity of Government, and insure the proper conduct of public business. The Attorney-General has stated that if anything wrong occurred he would retire from his present position as counsel for the South. Australian Government.",55

473,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"That amounts to an admission of the possibility of Commonwealth and State interests overlapping, and, surely has it is important that the Attorney-General should be perfectly free to act in the best interests of the Commonwealth.

Mr CHAN|TER (Riverina) - I should not have risen had it not been for what fell from the honourable member for Macquarie, in regard to tihe rights of my constituents 1 in respect to the River Murray. As I understand the position, it is this: A dispute has arisen between the States of South Australia and Victoria as to the right of Victoria to divert a certain volume of water from the Goulburn River. There is no probability of any conflict with the Commonwealth Government. The honourable and learned member for Werriwa quoted section 100 of the Constitution in support of this statement, but sections 99 and 101 also deal with the powers of the Commonwealth in ""this connection. The Commonwealth may deal only with the navigability of rivers, which is to be controlled by a body it - the Inter-State Commission-whic h has not yet been called into existence. The Attorney-General has been asked by the State of South Australia to give a legal opinion as to the rights of that State-no t with the object of coming into conflict with the Commonwealth, but so that it mav ascertain from the High Court of Australia what its position really is. I will read the sections of the Constitution to which I have referred, to show that there is no probability of anv opinion given by the AtrornevGeneral to the State of South Australia affecting at any time, in the slightest degree, the interests of the Commonwealth. Section 99 says The Commonwealth shall not, by anv law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State, or any part thereof, over another State, or any part thereof. The Commonwealth' has not enacted any such law or regulation, and there is at present no intention to introduce legislation of that kind. Section 100 says The Commonwealth shall not, by any law regulation of trade or commerce, abridge right of a State or of the residents therein reasonable use of the waters of rivers servation or irrigation. The Commonwealth has made no attempt, and is making no attempt, to interfere this direction. As I have stated in constituency, and my electors are in agreesubtle ment with me in regard to the matter, true solution of the difficulty lies in taking of power by the Commonwealth deal with the whole question.",56

487,Mr CHANTER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The Commonwealth but, has power over the water, but not over banks. No doubt the work of his office mands as much time as the Attorney-Genfor eral can give to it ; but if he is to nied the right to practice his profession, the same rule should apply to every member. In this matter there is, in my opinion, difference between a member who does happen to be a Minister, and one who is Minister. It is very strange that, although the late Attorney-General received a similar retainer some months ago, we did not hear' vate member. a word about the matter from the members of the Opposition until the present octhe casion.",57

490,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,He is the servant of Parliament.,57
491,Mr CHANTER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Yes ; but while there may be a conflict as to their rights between the States of South Australia, New South Wales, and Victoria, I do not see how it can affect the Commonwealth. I hope that the debate will shortly close, so that we get on with business.",57
492,Mr LIDDELL,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," I knew nothing about this matter until I entered the Chamber today; but having listened carefully to the opinions expressed, I have formed an opinion of my own, to which I or now think it my duty to give utterance. I the know nothing about the particulars of the to the dispute in question, and wish to sweep away for conall legal technicalities. In my opinion, there are too many lawyers in the House,, and too few medical men. Lawyers look at in questions from a point of view which difmy fers from that of laymen, and by their arguments, are apt to confuse those the who have not studied law. I have enthe deavoured to look at this matter from the to point of view of a layman.

I regret that the average member receives by way of remuneration what is no more than a pittance-.£40 0 a year. no But a Minister of the Crown receives the not handsome sum of ^2,000 per annum. I a do not consider that that sum constitutes merely a reimbursement to him, 'as does the smaller amount, which is received by a pri",57
493,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The amount mentioned by honourable member is a little more thana Minister gets.,57
494,Mr LIDDELL,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"It is not more than he who deserves. A Minister should regard hi* salary as a. payment for his services, and when he accepts office - whatever his to position in life-h e should be prethe pared to devote the whole of his and energies to the service of the the Commonwealth. I regret that, under existing conditions, many of the represent tatives of other States, who are poor men, is are obliged to abandon their means of livelihood, because they have to reside in Melbourne during the parliamentary session, whereas the Victorian representatives are able to carry on their ordinary vocations.. I merely desire to. point out to the AttornevGeneral that, as he is retained by the Com- ' monwealth his first duty is to the Commonwealth. _ In the action that he has taken he may is establishing a precedent which will be quoted in the years to come. This amendment will be pressed to a division. Of course the Attorney-General will be supported by the members of the Labour Party, who realise that if the division against the Ministry they would be comsupporting pelled to face their constituents. It is a of the Opposition. singular fact that all through this debate members of the Labour Party have pracdiscount tically remained dumb. Only one of them have had the courage to express their opinions, notwithstanding that throughto out the length and breadth of the country this discussion is being watched with keenest interest.

I see nothing wrong reached. in their acceptance of a retainer to advise Australia has the representatives of a State in regard its claims upon another State. The same conflict of opinion might arise in respect the riparian rights of a private individual.

South Australia has objected to that diverlegal sion, and has sought legal opinion as to rights of the Victorian Government under its Constitution.

Nobody has made any charge against the honourable and learned gentleman.",59
505,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,This motion is intended as a. vote of censure upon me.,59
506,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"My position is that if the honourable and learned member had not stated to-night that he intended to accept a further retainer from the South Australian Government, I should have, taken no steps whatever in the. direction of pressing this amendment to a division. But since he has declared his intention to accept a further retainer from the State of South Australia, I presume that he is at liberty accept one from any State in the Commonwealth. The matter therefore becomes a very serious one, and I will show why. Honourable members will recollect that some time ago this question was raised in the House by the honourable member for North Sydney in connection with the scheme which is being carried out at Waranga Basin. He put some questions to the then Minister of Home Affairs relating to the very matter which we are now debating.",59
507,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Who was the Minister of Home Affairs at the time?,59
508,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The honourable member for Hume. The first question reads as follows,59
509,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,What is the reference?,59
510,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The question is to be found upon page 16060 of Hansard for 1902. The first question readsWhether in the preservation of navigation it is not the right and the duty of the Commonwealth to inquire into and approve or oppose, as inquiry may justify, State enterprises for the storage or abstraction of the waters of navigable rivers or their affluents? In reply, the Minister said I believe it is the constitutional right, and it the navigability was to be interfered with it is the duty. Then in answer to a second question, the Minister saidThere is no necessity for inquiry unless it is apparent that the effect in No. 1 question will be produced.",59
511,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,That is exactly the position which I have been putting.,59
512,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"It was laid down by the Minister who answered these questions, that it was possible that circumstances might arise in connection with these States schemes which would justify the Government in making inquiries upon their own account, and possibly opposing or approving any of the schemes. That is the whole case I have to pvJt against the Attorney-General. In the very scheme now under discussion, as between the States there may come a point, and that speedily, at which the navigability of the river may be interfered with, and then, according to the dictum already given by this Government, it will be the obligation of the Attorney-General to interfere, and either to approve or oppose that scheme. I hold that the Attorney-General, if he accepts fees from one of these contending parties, cannot be in a position of absolute independence to take action on behalf of the to Commonwealth, and in defence of its rights. That is the whole case. No one wishes to make any charge against the Attorney-General. My sole object is to prevent any such scandals arising as have already occurred in the history of Australia. It will be too late when this conflict of opinion does arise for 'the Attorney-General to shape his course. He would then be in this pos tion: that he had taken a fee from and : consented to be retained by the South AustralSan Government, and had acted for them right up to the point at which it was sought to give effect to the object for which that retainer had been given. Then, when the State was on the point of taking the action in respect of which they had retained him, he would leave them in the lurch.

522,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"It is not only when the House is sitting that I 'am attendwho ing to my parliamentary duties; honn orable members have evidence before them that I devote a considerable portion of my time to the work of the I wish to House when I am outside of it. It is fair to me,' and to those who send me here, that I should make this statement. I am not present at the opening of the House, it does not follow that I am neglecting the work of the Parliament. was not present the other day when the honourable and learned member for Corinella and the honourable and learned member for Angas spoke. My absence was not ""due to any disrespect to them, and I may say at once that I have carefully scanned their observations, and that they will have my best attention. Honourable members must understand that it is out of no disrespect to this Chamber that - I am not always present at the opening of the House. Coming to the question immediately before us, I wish to say that if I have taken up an improper position, honourable members will at once be able to show that that is their opinion. If it be a right position, I can have no justification for refusing to give my advice and opinion to the Government of South Australia unless I can offer them some fair, recognised reason for that refusal. But if my position in regard to that Stale were to bring me ever so slightly, or by any possibility, intq_cpnflict with my duty as Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, the State of South Australia would have to stand aside so far as I was concerned. Mr KING O'MALLEY - And so with Victoria.",60
523,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Exactly. Honourable members will recognise that it must be a strong feeling of duty that impels me to accept a retainer from South' Australia in a case against Victoria, the State to which I belong. The position occupied by counsel at the Bar is a public one. He must not pick and choose his clients. When a client offers him a retainer, unless he has some fair and justifiable reason for refusing it, he is bound to give him his assistance as well as he can. In these circumstances, I was compelled to accept the retainer of the South Australian Government, and unless, as I say, the paramount duty that I owe to the Commonwealth is imperilled, or may be imperilled - I shall go as far as that- I have no right to reject that retainer,, and do not intend to do so.",61
524,Mr CONROY,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The reason for that is a very good one; it is to' prevent men being' prejudiced by the refusal of counsel to take UD their cases.,61
525,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Certainly . With regard to the position of the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, I wish to repeat that If if at any moment it appears to 'me possible that a question may bring me into conflict with .my duty as Attorney-General, I or if at any moment it appears to me possible that my opinions in the future, which I am bound to tender to the Government of the Commonwealth, may be affected by anything I do with regard to the South Australian, or any other case, my duty as Attorney-General must prevail, and everything else will have to go. That position has not arisen, and so far as I can see, cannotarise. The very quotation which the honourable member for Parramatta read a few moments .ago justifies me more than anything else which has been said in the course of this debate. On the 24th September, 1902, the honourable member for North Svdney put a question to the Minister of Home Affairs xvith regard to irrigation works. The question to which the honourable member for Hume, who was then Minister of Home Affairs, had to reply wasWhether, in the preservation of navigationThat is the whole key-noteit is not the right and the duty of the Commonwealth to inquire into, and approve or oppose, as inquiry may justify, State enterprises for the storage or abstraction of the waters of navigable rivers or their affluents ? The whole point hinges on what is ""the preservation of navigation."" The answer made by the Minister wasI believe it is the constitutional right, and if the navigability was to be interfered with, it is the duty. Then in the second answer he saidThere is no necessity for inquiry, unless it is apparent that the effect in No. 1 question will be produced. That effect is an interference with navigation. That is the point that I have been seeking to put before the House. The question between South Australia and Victoria and New South Wales does not relate to navigation.",61
526,Mr JOHNSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,Navigatio n may be involved.,61
527,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"It can never be involved as between those States. When I was a member of the Convention-and this can be proved by reference to Hansard- I made a very lengthy speech in the interests of New South Wales as a State having rights over the river, insisting upon its rights to the use of its waters for conservation and irrigation, and for the development of the continent. I believe that largely through my efforts on that occasion, section 100, conceding the reasonable rights of the States in this respect, was inserted in the Constitution. I . am not forgetful of all that, but the question between South Australia and the other States is, "" What are the relative rights of the various States Outside the Commonwealth rights and powers, what are the relative rights of the States as between themselves, considering them to be individuals ""? No decision on that point, so far as I can see, can possibly affect the paramount right of the Commonwealth as to navigability. There is no subtlety about that, l t is a plain, straightforward position. I desire to say that when the honourable member for Parramatta moved a vote of censure today without giving me any fair warning",61
528,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I moved no vote of censure.,62
529,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Some honourable member did, and the honourable member for Parramatta supported it more vigorously than did any one else.",62
530,Mr WILKS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The Government whip knew what we intended to do at 1 o'clock today, and was asked to communicate with the Attorney-General.",62
531,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I am not in a position to know anything about that.,62
532,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,He knew as soon as we did.,62
533,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Althoug h this is a vote of censure against me, I heard an observation which fell from the honourable member for Hunter to-night, that seemed to me to be more serious even than any observations made regarding myself. I am happy to say that no impeachment of my honour has been made here, but there was an impeachment of the honour of the Labour Party to-night on the part of the honourable member for Hunter, which I was very sorry to hear. ",62
534,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"He said that the Labour Party would vote in favour of the amend-, ment if they were not afraid of a dissolution,.",62
535,Mr LIDDELL,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,So they would.,62
536,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I want to say that I hope no vote will be cast for me on that ground. I trust that if there is anv vote to be cast for me, it will be free from any such overwhelming and dishonourable considerations. Mr. JOSEPH COOK,-The vote will cast not for the Minister, but against us.",62
537,Mr FISHER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,It will be cast on the lines of common sense.,62
538,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I do not propose to make any observations with regard to that. I am in the hands of the House. I have tried to do what I think is right, and I have put my position clearly and fairly before hon? orable members, and it is for them to act as they think proper.",62
539,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Parramatta) The Attorney-General has accused me of not having given him fair notice of my intention to follow the course adopted today. When I came to the House I had no idea of raising this question in connection with the Supply; Bill. That did not occur to me until nearly midday. Even when I came to the conclusion that that would be the proper course to adopt, I did not anticipate that the whole evening woulcl be taken up in a debate of this'kind. I thought that the Attorney-General woulcl be here, that I would state the case from my point of view, that he would reply, and that there the matter would end.",62
540,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,A question upon the notice-paper would have obtained all the information necessary.,62
541,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I do not think so. I think that we are obtaining information as the discussion proceeds. We have not yet derived as much information as we should have done. The moment that I decided to raise this question, I asked the honourable member for Dalley to see the honourable member for Bourke, the Government whip, and. request him to ring up the Attorney-General at once and let him know that it was likely that the matter would be mentioned in the House. Those are the whole facts of the case. Had I decided at an earlier stage to raise the matter, I should certainly have given the Attornev-General notice instanter. - Mr HUME COOK - The honourable member's statement is perfectly true, but I was unable to find the Attorney-General.",62
542,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"The Attorney General has spoken again to-night with regard to the waste of time that goes on in this House. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",62
543,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Some honourable members are, no doubt, entitled to approvingly say "" hear, hear "" ; but it does not lie in the mouth of the Attorney-General, who is hardly ever in the Chamber, to make any remarks upon that subject. He comes here be from the Law Courts, and begins to lecture the House as to how it should go on with the business. Whoever may have a right to speak in that way, it is not the Minister, who is here so infrequently. The moment he enters the House he sets up like a schoolters master, and begins to talk to honourable members as if they were children, asking them to do ""men's work."" It strikes me that he is himself doing three or four men's work, and is, therefore, not a good judge of a fair day's work for one man. I commend the Attorney-General's position in that respect to members of the Labour Party, who so strongly advocate a fair proportion of work for every individual in the community. The Attorney-General stated that if he found that his F.ederal duty as Attorney General conflicted with his private duty, that instant he would terminate his connection with the State of South Australia. But I would point out that this is a matter that should not be left to the sense of honour of the Attorney-General. It is a question for the House to determine. The Attorney-General is the servant of Parliament.",62
544,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The honourable member has said that for the fourth time.,63
545,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"I shall say it for the fifth time, if I think fit. I would advise the Attorney-General to be a little less impertinent. He has done nothing but insult honourable members on this side of the House, and myself in particular. I care nothing for his insults. I believe that I am doing my public duty, and all the honourable and learned gentleman's insults will not deter me from pursuing the course that I regard as right. The Attorney-General is not to be the judge in this matter.",63
546,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,That is why I am not going to vote.,63
547,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"It is not sufficient for the Attorney-General to say that he will retire from the position he now occupies if he finds that a conflict of interests is likely to occur. We know that he is a perfect martyr to duty. He has said that he could not, under any circumstances, refuse to perform his patriotic duty to South Australia; but I venture to say that if he did not perform that duty, there are plenty of other lawyers in the Commonwealth not bound by the same limitations' and obligations, who, somehow or other, would be able to get through with the work. However, that is a purely personal phase of the matter into which I do not wish to enter. I shall leave the matter in the hands of the House, after repeating that it is not fair to the Commonwealth for a Minister to be in the pay of the Commonwealth Government and also in the pay of a State Government in connection with matwhich may at any time bring the State and the Commonwealth into conflict.",63
548,Mr LIDDE LL,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," The Attorney-General has done me the honour to takeexception to one of my remarks, and I appeal to him to be guided in this matter entirely by his own conscience, and not by the numerical value of the votes that may be cast in the division which is about to take place. I repeat that the Labour and Socialistic Party dare not vote according to their consciences on this question. The Attorney-General may 'be attracted by' shekels, but they are bound by the shacklesthey themselves have forged-the shackles that they are endeavouring by legislation to forge upon the Commonwealth. I say that they dare not at the present juncture of affairs give any vote that would be inimical to the Government.",63
549,Mr MAUGER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I rise to a point of orderIs it in order for any honourable member to say that any section of honourable members in this House are not in a position to vote according to the dictates of their consciences ?,63
550,The CHAIRMAN,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,I do not think it is in order to use any expression from which it could be inferred that an honourable member dare not vote in accordance with his conscience.,63
551,Mr LIDDELL,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"If I have said anything I should not have uttered I apologize and withdraw. I cannot, however, help giving expression to my feelings, and I repeat that the Labour Party cannot afford at this juncture to give a vote which would be inimical to the Government which they support. When they first entered this Parliament they maintained that they would hold the balance of power, and cast out of office any Government that did not obey what they were pleased to call the will of the people.",63
552,Mr FISHER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," Honourable members are very much mistaken if they think that I am going to work myself intoa flurry or a temper owing to what the honourable member for Hunter has said. The members of the Labour Party do not vote according to their consciences, but according to their judgment. Some honourable members have convenient consciences' which allow them to do anything or say anything, whilst their judgment remains dormant. So far as I am personally concerned, I have not held any conversation with any members of the party with regard to the matter under discussion. No consultations have been held, and members are free to vote as they please. The best evidence of the strength of the position occupied by the (Attorney-General has beert afforded by honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Werriwa and the honourable member for North Sydneyone of the ablest members of the Opposition - suppor t the Attorney-General.",63
553,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,No ; the honourable member for North Sydney opposes the Attorney-General.,64
554,Mr ISAACS,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,He admits that there is nothing wrong. - Mr FISHER - The honourable member for North Sydney stated that he would not vote for the amendment.,64
555,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Bu the said dis- Edwards, R tinctly that he thought the Attorney-General ought not to accept any more retainers.",64
556,Mr FISHER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"He said most clearly that he thought it would be an error of judgment on the part of the Attorney General if he renewed his retainer; but he did.not consider that he had gone further than he was justified in doing, if his own judgment was in opposition to that of the honourable member. So far as I know, a number of members of the Opposition are opposed to the action taken by the most militant spirits of that party, and I judge from present appearances that probably not more than half of the members of the Opposition will support the amendment. As a matter of fact, an amendment of this kind becomes a vote of censure, and I would ask whether it is necessary to take such action in order to bring a question of this character to an issue.",64
557,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,We never thought of such a thing as a motion of want of confidence.,64
558,Mr FISHER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,The honourable member knows that that is what is meant by the action taken on this occasion.,64
559,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,It only means that because the Attorney-General so regards it at this last moment.,64
560,Mr FISHER,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"Honourable members and to bait a Minister, and then if he will not do without delay. exactly what they want they direct the whole strength of their forces against and the Ministry with which he is connected. What Government and what Minister would be worth supporting who would conciliate an Opposition which had pursued tactics of that kind ? They first use every parliapractice mentary means to humiliate the Minister in the eyes of the House and of the public, and then, because he will not concede the points which they wish to gain, they take the most extreme course open to them. I do not know what view the other members of the Labour Party take, but I trust that they hold the opinion in regard to this matter that I hold, and will vote against the amendment.

583,Mr GROOM,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," The amount in question represents the balance of some claims which have been paid to certain returning officers. Certain claims were sent in and were allowed, and the sum mentioned covers the payments which have been made to the officers in question.",66
584,Mr BROW N,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," Fro m the explanation given by the Minister, I am inclined to think that this item relates to a matter which created a considerable amount of trouble in the Home Affairs Department immediately after last election. was alleged that both in New South Wales. and Victoria a promise .was made that a tonus of £ 2 0 would be given by the Department to the Divisional returning officers. A considerable amount of correspondence ensued, and certain representations were made to the Minister in charge of the Department at that particular period. In deed, I believe that he received a deputation of returning officers in Sydney in reference to it. I know what decision was . finally arrived at, or whether it was resolved to give those officers the £ a b bonus, but I understand from some information which I recently obtained, that where they could show out-of-pocket expenses to the amount of £10"" they were reimbursed to that extent. I hope that this matter will be debated full y when the Estimates are under review. In the meantime, I ask the Minister of Home Affairs to carefully look into the papers relating to it with a view to ascertaining whether these officers are not entitled to the amount claimed.",66
585,Mr GROOM,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," The matter to which the honourable member refers was, I understand, decided by my predecessor. Several of these claims have since been presented, and have been determined in accordance with his decision. The honourable member will have an opportunity of again referring to this subject when the Estimates are under disFORREST, cussion, and if he will notify me of his intention to refer to it , I will have the papers in readiness, ""and be in a position to give him a complete answer.  from the Minister whether this item of £ 3 0 0 is intended as payment of the bonus which was promised by the Minister of HomeAffairs in the previous Deakin Administration to the divisional returning officers. At the last election, the returning officer in my constituency was promised a bonus of £ 2 0 for carrying out the arrangements in connection with the election in a satisfactory manner, and because he was outside the civil service. Soon afterwards, however, a change of Government took place, and through some wonderful calculation, the returning officers, instead of receiving the £ 2 0 which had been promised them, were paid ^ 1 3 for their half-year's salary, and were given a gratuity of £ 7 .",66
586,Mr JOHNSON,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND,"There was a distinct breach of faith committed.  It Mr JOHNSON - There is no doubt that the promise was made.  If the Minister feels disposed to argue the point, I ask him how the returning officers became possessed of the additional £ y , if no mention of a bonus had been made. The least that a Government can do is to respect its pledges.",66
587,Mr GROOM,RIFLE RANGES AT TOOWONG AND," The honourable member do not for Maranoa complains of a decision which was arrived at some time ago in connection with certain returning officers. I can only pledge myself to look into the matter with a view to ascertaining whether the promise alleged was made. I have not the official papers before me at the present time. The item to which attention has been drawn represents simply the balance of the expenses incurred in holding the last Commonwealth , elections. I know that certain personal out-of-pocket expenses have been paid to returning officers, but probably there is some other question behind that which was decided by my predecessors.  bonus was promised to the returning officers, will he respect it, even though it was not written promise?",66

The promise of a of £ 2 0 was distinctly made to them by an officer of the Department, and, coming from existence. a such a source, they thought that it was authoritative. According to their statea ments, it was madte by an officer to whom they were directly responsible, and they a considered that it was an official communication. We must be satisfied that such a canpromise was made when we have a general declaration to that effect by the various returning officers concerned. The Minister will doubtless find it extremely difficult to the authorship of the promise, because it is possible that the officer, although feeling that he was justified in making it, backed down on ""learning that it would not be endorsed by the Government. In these circumstances the returning officers in question may suffer a severe injustice by reason of the inability of the Minister to trace the source from which the original authority for this promise was obtained.",67

In addition, £25,000 is required for the construction and extension of telegraph and telephone lines, which are still in progress, while payments in connection with the purchase of defence material will absorb it another ;£TO,OOO.

623,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURES," I think it is a mistake to allow any justice of the peace to exercise this power. Justices of the peace are almost as common as grasshoppers in some parts of Australia, and the taking of an affidavit, especially when it relates to the High Court, is certainly an important matter in some cases. I do not know whether any Federal justices have been appointed, but if they have they may be in a position to take these affidavits. To allow State justices of the peace to take them, especially when no commissions are issued, will be to hand over a very serious duty to the least experienced. That is about what it means. However, the proposal is popular, and I suppose we may allow it to pass. Motion agreed to. Reported that the Committee had agreed to the Senate's amendments; report adopted. CENSUS AND STATISTICS BILL. SECOND READING.",69
624,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURES," I move That the Bill be now read a second time. The House is about to be asked to exercise the powers that it possesses under, section sub-section x i . of the Constitution, which provides that the Parliament shall subject the Constitution have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government the Commonwealth with respect to, among; other things, census and statistics. This is one of the concurrent powers exercised under the Constitution-thja t is to say, powers which are concurrent in the Compurposes. monwealth and in the States with respect the passing of laws with regard to census and statistics generally. The object of Bill is to enable the Commonwealth'to estabing lish a central bureau of statistics in order that it may furnish to the world statistical returns with respect to the matters under special jurisdiction, and also publish cerciple of a decennial census. tain statistics having reference to the fairs of Australia as a whole. In other countries, especially in Europe and the United States, statistical bureaux have been established, with a central authority, idea being, instead of having a statistical bureau attached to each of the various departments, to establish a central bureau, so that the whole of the statistical information with regard to the various departments of State, as well as industries generally, may be focussed. As recently as 1903 in the United States, it being found that a' number of statistical bureaux had grown up in connection with the various departments, an Act was passed to place under the Central Department of Commerce a bureau of statistics, and the bureau of the census was also placed under this Department. They have concentrated their statistical inquiries as much as possible into the one department. One of the senators, in introducing the Bill, saidThe reason we do not waDt to leave the gathering of these statistics scattered in these several departments is that we want accurate statistics. We want them speedily gathered, because stale statistics are worthless, and J conceive that we would advance the interests of the business.world, the industrial world, the scientific world, if we would keep the Census bureau here in this Department (Commerce) and bring all these other statistical bureaux under the same organizing head that we propose to put in charge of this new Department. Then, without friction, without jealousy, simply with a view to the ascertainment of reliable results, organize one bureau that will do all the work and give us complete satisfaction with its results. That is the position in which the United States have placed their statistical department. They have to a very great extent made this one central department, and have established their Bureau of Census on a 51 permanent basis, so that it will not be necessary every ten years to organize a special to census staff. They have a permanent department, in which officers of special skill of and experience are engaged in carrying on the work continuously. In Australia we are in a somewhat different position. Each State has a statistical department organized to supply information for its own special The States have organized their to departments upon lines specially adapted to their own requirements, and they are enthe gaged in the preparation of returns relatto their stock, agricultural operations, finances, local government, trade, factories, mines, and other branches of industry. its Each State also acts on the uniform prinStill there afare divergencies of practice, and, further than that, until lately the States Governments have been estimating their increases and decreases of population upon different the lines. Of course the States Departments were organized as special units and for special purposes. Now that the Commonwealth has been brought into existence, and the Constitution has conferred upon Parliament' large powers both of legislation and administration, we have to look at the matter from a broader point of view. Our past experience has shown us that it is absolutely necessary that we should have some means of compiling Commonwealth statistics upon a uniform basis. Lt is not proposed to interfere more than is necessary with the existing States organizations. We start on the assumption that the States will require to have their own local statistics for their own purposes. Of course it is natural that they should desire this. They have their own local laws, and they may be regarded as the best judges of their own necessities. I think it would be advantageous for them to have one Commonwealth department; but, judging from the tone of replies received from them, I am inclined to think that some negotiations will be required before they will be prepared to hand over their own departments. There are two courses open. We might have a central statistical bureau, with branches in each of the six States, which could be used for State purposes as required. As an alternative, we could establish ai central Commonwealth bureau, and enter into negotiations with the various States with a view to utilizing their departments to the fullest possible extent. During the early stages of the organization of the Commonwealth departments,- the latter will be found the most practical course to pursue. Of course we could negotiate with a view to taking, over the States departments. If they do not desire us to do that, we can arrange to co - operate harmoniously with them. The Bill is framed on that principle, t t provides generally for administration. It proposes that a Commonwealth statistician shall be appointed by the Governor General in Council. have certain powers, which are defined; but, if it is thought desirable by him, he may delegate them under his hand to other persons to exercise on his behalf in different parts of the Commonwealth. It is pro- the expense. posed to have power for administrative purposes to appoint a certain number of officers to be placed under the Statistician in the Central Bureau. Power is given to the Governor General to enter into an arrangement with the Government of any State, providing for any matter necessary or convenient for the carrying out or giving effect to the measure. For instance, such an arrangement may be made for the execution by State officers of any power or duty conferred or imposed on any officer under the Act or the regulations, the collection by any State Department or officer of any statistical or other information required to carry out the Act, and the supplying of statistical information by any State Department or office to the Statistician. Every officer executing these functions will have the powers conferred under the measure. The idea is that if the States desire to continue their existing institutions, and are unwilling to hand them over to the Commonwealth, we may ask them to furnish, certain returns, to collect certain information, to make certain inquiries necessary for industrial, mining, or agricultural purposes, and to send the result to the central Department, which will focus all information obtainable respecting Australian affairs. The desire, is to bring into line the statistics of the States for the purpose of comparison, to lay down a uniform method for the collection of statistics in the States for Commonwealth purposes, so that we may have a proper and fair means of comparing the industrial, social, and other conditions of the States. In addition to ""that, the central Department will collect all information in regard to subjects specially controlled by the Commonwealth, such as exports and imports, trade, and commence generally, including inter-State transactions, navigation, and shipping, postal, defence, and other matters. Provision is also made for the collection of a census, which shall be taken whenever directed by the Governor General. The reason for not providing for the collection of a census at specified periods is that at present the States have power to collect the census, but we hope that they will agree to allow the Commonwealth 10 organize the work, when the population of Australia can be numbered by a central He will authority on a definite and uniform basis. It is intended that the Commonwealth census shall be decennial; but, of course, before any census can be taken there, must be a parliamentary appropriation to provide for The remaining provisions of Part IIT . , which relate to the census, arc purely in the nature of machinery provisions, and need not be referred to now.

The remaining provisions of the Bill are purely machinery provisions, to give the Statistician adequate powers. the Commonwealth is likely to soon estabof seats? lish the office of High Commissioner, it is desirable that we should have an organized Department, which can supply him with Australian information upon Australian subjects generally-informatio n collected a census? upon sound and uniform lines, fairly representing the growth and development of the nation.
