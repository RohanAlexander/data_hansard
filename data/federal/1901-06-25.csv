0,NA,Unknown,"?iHouse of iRpprrsentatibes. Tuesday, 25 June, 1901. Mr SPHAKEU took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. PERSONAL EXPLANATION . Mr MoCOLL - I desire to make a personal explanation. When speaking upon the Address in Reply I stated that I was opposed to increasing the salaries of Ministers, and that I had pledged myself to my coustituteats to vote against it . Having given that pledge, I naturally desired to fulfil it, but when a division was takon on the question last Thursday, I was 170 miles from Melbourne, at the bedside of a very dear friend who died that day, so that it was impossible for me to record my vote. I wish to give this .explanation of my absence to my constitutents. SUPP LY BILL (No. 2.)",14
1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have to inform the House that T have received the following message from the Senate:Mr SPEAKER: The Senate has agreed to the modifications made by the House of Representatives in suggestion Ko. 2 of the Senate in the Bill intituled ""An Act to apply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund the sum of Â£491,882 to .the services of the period ending the SOth day of June, 1901."" The Senate returns the Bill herewith, and requests the House of Representatives to make the amendments agreed upon. Mr MoCAY (Corinella) - I desire to refer to a poin,t of privilege in connection with the message which Mr Speaker has just read. The history of our dealings with the Bill referred to therein is familiar to us all. We sent it to the Senate in the first place with a request for their con-' cui rence. They returned it with a message which, I think honourable members will agree, was, as it reached us, not in proper form, but which under all the circumstances we accepted. In that message the Senate requested us to make three amendments in the Bill. We then sent back to them a message stating that we had amended the Bill in accordance with the first and third of their requests, and with a modification of their second request. We have now received from the Senate a message by which the Senate in effect informs the House of Representatives that they have, agreed to our modification of their second request, and ask us to send the Bill up again with the amendments made in it. We have no standing orders and no precedents to guide us in this matter.",14
2,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Standing Order 193 deals with the matter.,14
3,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,The standing order to which the honourable and learned member refers .deals with amendments; but we are not concerned with amendments at all at the present time.,14
4,Mr CONROY,Unknown,I take it that suggestions come under the same rule.,14
5,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"The same procedure by no means applies to amendments aud suggestions. If it did, my question of privilege would be gone. I desire to submit for the consideration of the House whether the Senate have not, by the message which they have sent to us, violated the Constitution, so far as it can be violated by either House, aud whether they have not infringed the rights of this Chamber.' This is not a matter such as that with which we had to deal the other day - a matter upon which there can be a clear difference of opinion as to procedure-this is a matter of substance. In my opinion the Senate have not the right to make a second request, but for the purposes of my argument I will assume that tliey have that right. Making that assumption, let us see what the Constitution allows them to do; and we must recollect that there is no Court of Appeal if anything is done wrongly in this particular matter; the two Houses alone are competent to settle these questions of procedure. Sectiou 53 of the Constitution Act deals solely with Bills, not with laws ; and it is only laws that come under the cognizance of the High Court. Consequently, what we settle as our practice in these matters will become the recognised constitutional procedure. It has been said in previous discussions upon this subject that, whatever the forms which wo permit to be used, they will not infringe our rights under the Constitution. W it h that position I have never agreed, because the two Houses of Parliament alone can determine - their constitutional rights, under the section which I am about to quote. By abandoning our lights, even in matters of form, we settle what the practice shall be, and practically act as a Court of Appeal against ourselves. This is what the Constitution says the Senate may doThe Senate may, at any stage, return to the House of Representatives nny proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein.",14
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I should liko to know if the honourable and learned member proposes to conclude with a motion. Mr MoCAY - Yes. I propose to move That the message be not received.,15
7,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"I shall ask my honourable and learned friend not to move that motion. This is a matter in which the leader of the House should proceed ou behalf of the House. The business of the. Chamber should not be takeu out of my hands, although I am sure, that my honourable and learned friend does not wish to do that.",15
8,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Certainl y not.,15
9,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member will find that I intend to propose a course which, although not the same as that which he proposes tb take, will, I think, sufficiently assert the privileges of the House.",15
10,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,I had not the remotest intention of undertaking the duties of the leader of the House.,15
11,Mr BARTON,Unknown,I am quite sure of that.,15
12,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I shall wait until I am the leader of the House before I do anything like that. I was unaware that it was the intention of the right honourable gentleman to deal with this matter, and I thought that the proper time to refer to it as a question of privilege was the moment the message was received. I shall resume my seat now in order that I may not interfere with what the leader of the House may propose to do; but I understand that I shall be at libery to speak upon any proposal that he may make.",15
13,Mr BARTON,Unknown," My honourable and learned friend will, I am sure, understand that there is no desire to act discourteously towards him in the course which I have taken, but it is always the practice that, in a matter of this kind, the Minister in charge of the business before the House shall be enabled to make a proposal, and take the sense of the House upon it . I was about to speak when the honourable and learned member rose. I do not consider that any time has been lost by his remarks, because I am sure that what he has said indicates the temper and tone of the House. But there are sometimes two ways of doing the same thing. I shall presently move- That the messago of the Senate be taken into consideration forthwith.",15
14,Mr VL SOLOMON,Unknown,Le t us have the message in print.,15
15,Mr BARTON,Unknown,It is not in p r in t ; it has come down to us in writing.,15
16,Mr VL SOLOMON,Unknown,It ought to be in print.,15
17,Mr CONROY,Unknown,There is some doubt in the minds of honourable members as to the message which was sent by this House to the Senate-whethe r the amendments were made in the Bill.,15
18,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"I shall explain all that. A practice has existed in the Parliament of Victoria, which I am rather inclined to think is in accordance with the House of Commons, but which docs not agree with that which has existed in the Parliament of New South Wales, and in the Parliaments of some of the other States. That practice is this : That until the two Houses have come to an agreement about the .text' of a Bill, and while they are in negotiation about amendments, those amendments shall not be inserted in the Bill, and may be inserted only when they have been finally agreed upon. It is thatpractice which dictated the standing order to which the honourable and learned member for Werriwa referred. Standing Order 195 saysWhen amendments made by the Senate, in Bills which shall have first passed the House, shall have been agreed to by the House without ameudments, a message shall he sent informing, the Senate thereof; and if they shall have been agreed to with amendments, the Bill shall be returned with a schedule of such amendments, in a message desiring the concurrence of the Senate therein; and if they shall have been disagreed to, the Bill may be laid asiSc or it may be again sentto the Senate with a message desiring its reconsideration. If these had been amendments in the Bill that would have been the proper course to take, and I am not quite sure, seeing that the standing orders are silent upon the point before us, that the Clerk of the House did not act rightly in sending up a message witli a memorandum of the amendments which this House had made, without putting the amendments into the Bill, because that is the practice which has been established with regard to amendments, no practice being established in regard to suggestions. Bufc the difficulty that has occurred is this : The Senate are, I believe, acting under the standing orders of the Parliament of South Australia, which provide a procedure for dealing with suggestions, bufc with which we have nothing to do.",15
19,Mr VL SOLOMON,Unknown,"Unfortunatel y we lack joint standing orders. Mr.BARTON - Yes ; at the presenttime we lack joint standing orders. I am sure that it is not the intention of the Senate to interfere with our internal regulations, just as it is not our desire to interfere with their internal regulations ; but, if any standing order provides a course which does not dearly recognise our constitutional rights, that becomes a matter, not for the President or Mr Speaker, bufc for the Housefcodealwith. This is a matter which is perhaps not so deep-seated as the honourable member who has just sat down considers. But there is a course for us to take which will perfectly conserve any rights and privileges we liave. We ordered these amendments to be made last Friday, and, according to practice, we did what the standing orders in many, places allow- I think in Victoria and in the House of Commons. That practice is not to put the amendments into the body of a Bil l until there is final agreement between the two Houses about them. This point crops up, and a very strong point it is. Section 53, dealing with requests for amendments, says:And the House of Representatives may, if it tliink fit, make any of such omissions or amendments, with or witliout modifications. That we did in committee oil Friday. We made these amendments-that is to say, in ordinary colloquial phraseology, we made the amendments by ordering them to be made. - A resolution in committee was 'carried that the Bill be amended in such and such a way ; - and we adopted the report of the committee, and, in so doing, made the amendments in a parliamentary sense. We carriedfcheresolution in committee to make the amend-ments in the Bill, and to that extent satisfied - the Constitution; but unfortunately in pursuance of a practice which has hitherto grown up, the Clerk-and very properly perhaps-unles s he got further instructions, did hot put the amendments on to the face of the Bill.",16
20,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,Unknown,Why not ?,16
21,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"As I explained, because it has been a practice, until amendments are finally settled, not to alter the face of the Bill, but to conduct the process by a message containing a schedule of amendments. Thafc was done in this case. It seems to me that, as the Senate requested that these amendments ought be put on the face of the Bill, there is strong reason why we should do so; and I will tell honourable members the reason. It belongs to this House to make amendments ancl it is not for the Senate to concur or disagree. The Senate has the optional outlet, under the Constitution, if it does not like the amendments, to reject the Bill, and, of course, in such case to take on itself the responsibility of rejecting the supply of a continent. What I propose to clo is not to ask the House to go into committee for the purpose of making tliese amendments, because we have already made them; but I intend, if the House will follow me, to give technical instructions to the Clerk to put tliem on to the face of the Bill, so as to settle the practice ancl show that we are the makers of the amendments. I intend to move first that the message be taken into consideration forthwith, and without asking the House to trouble itself to go into-committee, I shall move afterwards that the Clerk be instructed to make the amendments in the Bill ordered by the House last Friday and appearing in the message of that day returning the Bill to the Senate. . My reason for doing that is that there can be no better course for the House to pursue, especially when it is requested by the Senate, than to put on the face of the Bill the very thing this House wants to be done. The old practice was that amendments were not put on the face of the Bill until the two Houses concurred, and the new Constitution provides that we have the right to make amendments without regard to whether the Seriate consents or not, the option of the Senate being to reject the Bill if it likes, and take the responsibility. Under the circumstances, I say that the rights and privileges of this House are best asserted by placing amendments on the face of the Bill as amendments of the House of Representatives, and of the House of Representatives alone. By doing that we establish a practice veiy much to the advantage of the rights of this House. Inasmuch as it is not for the Senate to agree to amendments, but to deal with the Bill as it pleases, after we have made the amendments it is our correlative privilege to place those amendments on the face of the Bill so that it may appear what the Senate does reject, if it should take that course - Mr MCCAY",16
22,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,Did we not place those amendments in the Bill in committee?,17
23,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"No ; resolution that the Bill be amended, and consequently ordered the amendments to be made. That goes by the name of niaking the amendments, but of course in a technical sense the amendments are not actually made until they are pnt on the face of the Bill. The Constitution gives us the right to make amendments, and therefore to put them on the face of the Bill, and I propose to ask the House to do this not the less because the other House asked us to do so, but with the greater willingness from the fact that it lays down a practice in this House which is at the same timea protection of our rights- I will not usetheword ""privileges""-unde r the Constitution. I , therefore, ask the House to instruct the Clerk not to make the amendments .themselves, because we have already made them so far as ordering is concerned, but to instruct the Clerk to perform the clerical duties of putting them on the face of the Bill ; and that, I tliink, is all the Senate'can ask from us.",17
24,Mr MCCAY,Unknown," I need hardly say that what I was presumptuously about to do was to a large extent what the Prime Minister has done. My objection was not connected with the question of whether the amendments were or were not on the face of the Bill, but was connected with the fact that the Senate had sent a message to the effect that they concurred in our modification of our amendments. to .that the Senate have no right either to concur or disagree. The Senate must take the Bill as a. whole and concur with it or disagree with it . If we once allow them to concur with or differ from our modification of our own amendmentalthough made on tlieir request-w e shall be establishing a practice most injurious to the rights of this House, and shall give the Senate an opportunity of differing from us, not on a Bill, bnt on some item in a Bill-whic h is a very different matter indeed.",17
25,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"I meant to say that we cannot stop the Senate from using any form Of words they like, such for example as that "" they concur,"" but on the other hand that concurrence so expressed is a mere nullity, and is immaterial. - It is. As I pointed out before, if we allowed such a thing it would be establishing and determining a practice in regard to which there eould be no appeal. we carried a except to ourselves. If we once settle such a precedent we shall certainly be doing ourselves great injury in the future, because the precedent would be appealed to when matters of substance much more vital than the present matter are under consideration. still feel that it is not desirable to even accept a message from the Senate concurring in our modification: I say that, not from any obstructive intention or' from any liostile intention, nor from any wish to drag, the tails of my coat, so to speak, for some one to tread on. I may say that in a place otlier than this House of Representatives, which I need not define anymore accurately, I have observed, if the. reports printed under the various authorities are to be relied on, that there is. the strictest attention paid to the absolute letter of the rights that are considered to prevail there-the strictest attention. Consequently we have had an example set us from which we might veiy well profit, and pay the strictest attention to the letter of our own rights. The second resolution indicated by the Prime Minister proposes that we should receive this message",17
26,Mr BARTON,Unknown,It makes no reference to the message at all.,17
27,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,The right honourable gentleman told us of the third resolution.,17
28,Mr BARTON,Unknown,May I read the third resolution ?,17
29,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I only desire to say I did As not rise before with any idea of ""jumping"" any one's place. I had no indication of what the Government intended to do in the matter, and I drew attention at the earliest possible opportunity to what I conceived to be a question of privilege. The best justification for my action is afforded by the Prime Minister, who says he is prepared to. move in practically the same direction.",17
30,Mr VL SOLOMON,Unknown,"South Australia). - I do not really think there is much: necessity for any member to feel aggrieved afc the action of the Senate, seeing fchafc the wording of the message from that body is such as ought to satisfy the most critical member of this House. There is no question of infringing our rights or our privileges in the slightest degree. What is the message? The message is to the effect that the Senate has agreed to the modification made by the House of Representatives in suggestion No. 2. They clo not even use the word "" request,"" which is used in the Constitution Act itself, by which they are given the power of request and not of suggestion. They use the word ""suggest,"" which, to my mind, is a much more courteous, and .mucli more modified expression than ""request.""",17
31,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"The word "" suggested "" is used in section ol.",18
32,Mr VL SOLOMON,Unknown,Thaf c is not the section alluded to.,18
33,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,Thaf c is the only reference to it.,18
34,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"It should be "" request.""",18
35,Mr VL SOLOMON,Unknown,"Buf c they are alluding to their previous attitude of "" requesting."" Paragraph 4, of section 53, says The Semite may, ab any stage, return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not umend. That is any proposed law in regard to appropriation. The paragraph goes onRequesting by message the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. And the House of Representatives may, if ib thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments, with or without jiiodifictitions. That is the clause alluded to, and the Senate's reply is most courteous. Ifc does not refer to the modification made by the House of Representatives in tlieir request No. 2, but it says the Senate has agreed to the modification made by the House of Representatives in suggestion No. 2 of the Senate.",18
36,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Thaf c is exactly what the Senate has no power to do.,18
37,Mr VL SOLOMON,Unknown,"I must confess, though I maybe extremely dense, that i cannot follow the honourable and learned member for Corinella in his arguments as to there being any intent to trench on the rights and privileges of this House in such a message. The Senate even discard the word "" request"" and use the word "" suggest,"" which is undoubtedly more courteous, and indeed is really what was originally intended when the arrangement was made as to agreement between two Houses in another State. The Senate returns the Bill, suggesting fco this House certain amendments. What could be more courteous than that? If the Senate desired in any way to' question our privileges what object couldfcheyhave in sending such a message ? I think I may say wiihoufc any desire to open up a debate, that the mistake in regard to this Bill is not due to any action on the part of the Senate, bufc is rather due to a little muddling on the parfc of the Government in bringing this Bill before the House in a form which was not properly considered.",18
38,Mr BAIITON,Unknown,This has nothing whatever to clo with the original form of the Bill.,18
39,Mr VL SOLOMON,Unknown,"But this case shows what a lot of difficulty may be caused at no distant date by a very little trouble, and the whole of the present trouble is due to the original mistake made.",18
40,Mr BARTON,Unknown,I can assurefchehonorable member that the present trouble does nob arise out of any original mistake.,18
41,Mr VL SOLOMON,Unknown,"I do not want to irritate the Prime Minister by any such allusion, but it appearsfcome that the message from the Senate is absolutely in accord with our constitutional rights, and does not call for the trailing of any coat-tails. Their message appeal's to me to be perfectly in order. We have not the text of the Prime Minister's proposal, but if the honourable gentleman is assured that we are quite within our rights in dealing with this message, and that our standing orders do not apply to it under the ordinary rules of the House of Commons, well ancl good. But I do trust that the Prime Minister is assured that in making these amendments and .sending the Bill back to the Senate he is in the right. To my mind the Bill should not conclude in the Senate. It should, undoubtedly, come back 'to this House, and be presented by us to His Excellency the Governor General.",18
42,Mr BAKTON,Unknown,"B y Mr Speaker,-in the case of a Bill like this. Mr V. L. SOLOMON - I wish that we had these messages all in print. ""Whenever tliere is time-and there has been ample, time since Eriday last",18
43,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"The message only reached us at half-past two o'clock. Mr V. L. SOLOMON - Undoubtedly , the message formally reached ns then. But the substance of the message was arrived afc on Eriday afternoon, and it should have been ready to be circulated amongst honourable members ",18
44,Mr BARTON,Unknown,It would be a breach of privilege if we circulated a message before it arrived.,19
45,Mr VL SOLOMON,Unknown,"I do not see that the otheiHouse could say that, if the subject-matter of the message was prepared afcfcherequest of the President of the other House, in order that it might be in the hands of honourable members here the moment the question was brought forward for consideration.",19
46,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Northern Melbourne) I think the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Solomon, has misunderstood what has been said this afternoon. No one suggests that the ofcher place has been guilty of any want of courtesy, or that it has been trying to encroach upon our rights. The only tiling is that we are adopting a new practice under a new Constitution- a practice which has been in vogue nowhere else in the world, and it is very natural that we should at first, in feeling our way, make some mistakes. The honourable member for South Australia says that he cannot understand what was put forward b}- the honourable and learned member for Corinella. As I understand the .honourable and learned member, he simply says that we should not ask for the concurrence of the Senate in any particular amendment that we may make in this Bill, or in any modification that we may make in a suggested amendment. His idea is that after we have sent the Bill up to the other House, and after the Senate has made a request for an amendment, we should either make the amendment, with or witliout modification, or we should - refuse it . Then we send up the Bill to the Senate for its concurrence. We do not ask for the Senate's concurrence in the particular modification Or amendment,' but we ask for its concurrence in the Bill. Then-the other House is facefcoface with the responsibility of refusing or accepting the Bill.; or .perhaps, under sub-section (4) of section 53 of the Constitution, it may still want some other modification. The sub-section says The Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any. proposed law. I think the honourable and learned member for Corinella is perfectly right in all he contends for, winch is that we ought not to ask for the concurrence of the Senate in an amendment, which we,, and we alone, have power to make. I do not think that the Prime Minister, in the form of words which he has suggested, is absolutely right. May I be allowed to say, as a loyal supporter of the Government, that it is about time that we realized that the form of words is a very substantial matter. Ifc is a pity that the Government did not sufficiently consider the form of words from the first, andfchafcwe were committed to a preamble, the words of which were hastily drafted at the table after a protest that there was no need for them",19
47,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"They were not drafted at the table, nor by any member of the Government.",19
48,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"I am speaking of the form offchepreambleFor the purpose of appropriating the grant made by the House of Representatives. I do think that it is a narrow, inadequate and superficial view of the matter to say that we have our rights guarded by the Constitution. It is quite true that we have a written Constitution, but within the ambit of the Constitution it is possible to have infinite flexibility as to our rights. We all know how questions of the forms of message between the two Houses react upon the substance, and how great inconvenience may occur if we do not adhere strictly to the correct words. As I . felt this was a very important matter, I took the precaution of reading the debates which have taken place upon it in the other House. In this connection I must congratulate each Chamber on the tone which has characterized those debates. There is not the least intention evidenced on the part of ' any honourable member in either House to trench on the rights of the other branch of the Legislature. I feel that in this respect we have started well, and I hope we shall last well. The members of the other place are quite right in seeing that they do not let lapse auy of the rights that they have acquired under the Constitution. For good or for ill , the Constitution has been adopted. We are - right, therefore, in seeing that we carry out in good faith towards the people the terms of that Constitution. The only point upon which, as I understand this issue, there may be any danger is that I gather it to be the view of the President of the other Chamber, from his remarks, that the Senate ought to follow the practice in vogue in South Australia. That is to say, that before we make amendments on the face of the Bill, we should ascertain whether we concur with the suggestions of the Senate, or whether they concur in any modification of those suggestions; and that, after having learned that the two Houses are in concurrence, we should amend the Bill. I agree with the Prime Minister that that would not be the correct course. Let us suppose that in one afternoon the other place was willing to accept our modification, and, accordingly, sent word to us that they were so willing, that would not bind the Senate the next afternoon, and we might thus have continual messages passing to and fro between the two Houses. For instance, one honourable member might be absent from another place upon the first afternoon ; and then, when he attended the next afternoon,-he might say, "" I was not bound by that arrangement; I object to it . "" I tliink the more workable and feasible system is that suggested by the Prime Minister, who has taken the exact words of the Constitution, and said, "" I propose to send a message stating that we have made upon the face of the Bill these alterations, and the Senate will be now face to face with the responsibility ""of accepting or rejecting them, or perhaps of making other suggestions."" Mv. V. L. SOLOMON - Is not that giving another opportunity for disagreement 1",19
49,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"It maybe so. But my great difficulty lies in the words, ""at any stage."" That problem has not yet been solved. If the Senate may send this Bill back at any stage, it may hereafter become veiy embarrassing, and I feel sure that it would on this occasion. If they may at any stage make a suggestion, the thing may be bandied about from House to House, and the Government, might not be able to get its Supply. What would be the result ? In order to get Supply, Ministers would probably be disposed to ravenously take anything which the other place suggested. I think there is very great danger in that. I always felt that, but at the same time. I may say that eaoh part of the discussion upon this matter is almost equally important, and one part cannot be regarded withouttheother. I congratulate the House upon the Senate having adopted the liberal construction of the words ""ordinary annual services."" I think it is amazing-and I feel sure that Mr. Speaker will allow me, although it is not exactly within the matter put before us by the Prime Minister, to say it-that the [96] phrase ""ordinary annual services"" is a phrase which most certainly gave me a great deal of embarrassment and may still cause much embarrassment. In dealing with this particular message between the Houses, I understand that a majority of the other place have taken the view that the ordinary annual services do not mean that the services must recur from year to year, and must be ordinary in the sense that tliey are usual. They have taken the view that ordinary annual services mean those services which appear in the annual Estimates, and which originate in Committee of Supply in the House of Commons or the House of Assembly in the different States. ""Whether that is the legal construction or not I do not like to say; but I will say that it has been a great advantage to have men who are used to parliamentary practice, like some of the gentlemen who are in the Senate, and who have been State Treasurers, to deal with such matters, and to have them adopt a construction of this clause, which, whether legal or not, is certainly a construction which will facilitate the dealings between the two Houses. I shall support the proposal of the Prime Minister, and I sincerely hope that we shall not be led up the hill this time in order to be led down again as we have been too often of late.",20
50,Mr WINTER COOKE,Unknown," It seems to me that the course proposed by the Prime Minister is the proper course. The Senate could not do otherwise than it did. If it had attempted to amend the Bill it would have been acting contrary to the Constitution - Therefore, what the Senate did with regard to suggestions that we complied with was to say, "" The Bill has not been amended, because we as a House cannot amend it . "" The duty belongs to the House of Representatives; and, therefore, the Senate has been really safeguarding the rights of this House rather than its own. No doubt the Senate was put in somewhat of a difficulty in regard to the modification of the message. I do not see how, in regard to that modification, the Senate could have done iinything else. I am inclined to tliink, possibly, that the honourable and learned member for Corinella was right, but at the same time that was a case where a message having gone up from us in the form that it did, the Senate could not but say in its message-agreeing , - as it did, with the modification-""We agree. Therefore, with regard to the two suggestions that we have fallen in with, inasmuch as they were amendments, the Senate sent us a message down to amend. ""With regard to the modification, they said "" We agree with the modification."" I think the Prime Minister is asking us to do the right thing. I think {hat in private life all of us should have sufficient self respect to think that nobody intends to insult us. I think we are a little bit too sensitive in our local tive Houses, and now it seems that in the Commonwealth Parliament some honourable members think that any course of action that may be .taken is meant to be an insult to this House. Just as we would act in private life, so should we deal with one another as corporate bodies.",20
51,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown," Althoug h I allow that this a very important matter, I am not fond of these refinements in word splitting. Our principal object should be to avoid a recurrence of the present unfortunate position, and to endeavour to establish a practice which may be followed in all further cases of a similar kind. We ought to have fixed arrange-' ments for dealing with the Senate under similar circumstances, and it is for those who are versed in these matters to advise the House as to the proper constitutional procedure. I horie at any rate that what we are doing now will be sufficiently sound as a precedent for the future, and that we shall not have eternal wrangling about the question of procedure, and a consequent interference with the business of the House.",21
52,Mr CONROY,Unknown," Whils t this House is indebted to the Senate for the manner in which it has dealt with this Bill, and for the courtesy which it has displayed, I think we should be extremely careful in the course we take. The Prime Minister has stated that he proposes to make these amendments in the Bill by resolution of the House, but I think that would be a great mistake. The proper course would be to recommit this Bill.",21
53,Mr BARTON,Unknown,We cannot.,21
54,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Then the Prime Minister will have to ask that the third reading be withdrawn so as to permit of the Bill being altered in the way required. Otherwise we should introduce a very dangerous practice indeed. Of course, where there are only three or four short amendments it might be a veiy easy way out of the difficulty to move a resolution of the House declaring that the Clerk of Parliaments is entitled to make alterations in the Bill, but that might be a most dangerous course to adopt in other circumstances. Supposing that we had a dozen clauses, all of which had been subject of great discussion and considerable contention the House would never know where it was, if by resolution it empowered the Clerk to alter the wording of such a Bill. I very legisla- much doubt whether the House could do such a thing, and I would like to hear some precedents for such a course.",21
55,Mr BAUTOJT,Unknown,We . can order the Clerk to perform any clerical act.,21
56,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"This is more than aclerical act. If it were a matter of the omission or insertion of a word or letter I could understand the course now proposed. But I submit that we should not act as now suggested, while there is anotiier and a proper way out of the difficulty. The Senate has foreseen the very difficulty which has now arisen, because it returned the Bill requesting - the . House of Representatives to make the amendments agreed upon. Can it be said that by a resolution of this House directing the Clerk to alter the wording of a Bill Ave are making the amendments agreed upon % I would ask the Prime Minister to again seriously consider the situation. My own view is that we must rescind the third reading and get back into committee and alter the Bill to the form in which we desire it to stand. By following that course we shall then make it our Bill, and show that it is our Bill. The Senate apparently recognises that it has no right to amend the Bill, but requests us to do it, and by following the course that I suggest aud forwarding it back to the Senate we should be doing what the Senate requests. I should like the honourable member for Tasmania to give us his ideas on this question. I would again impress upon honourable members the importance of this matter, and the necessity of laying down a sound practice, in view of our possibly having Bills in which a dozen or more amendments really have been made, and which it would not be right to incorporate in the Bill by resolutions of the House giving directions to the Clerk.  that I cannot help the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, because he has adopted a view that is not supported by any previous practice. There is no doubt that the Bill should not be interfered with in regard to the stages it has already gone through, and therefore I do the better. not think it is necessary to adopt the course suggested by the honourable and learned member. I would suggest that if the Standing Orders Committee still the orders under consideration they might very well consider the procedure we are endeavouring to work - out for ourselves, and include a standing order that will future cases of the kind.",21
57,Mr BARTON,Unknown," I may say at once that X shall never consent to go into committee in order to repeat what we have done - We have ordered these amendments to be made, and the question whether i was an error when the Clerk did the amendments in the Bill does not affect the matter. We do not complain of any discourtesy on the part of the Senate, but we are claiming that we should make our constitutional lights clear, and the . way of doing this is by following the course I have proposed. The matter is not follow. one of courtesy or discourtesy between the two Houses, and there has not been any serious disagreement, or a disagreement any kind, between this House and the been Senate, in this matter, but I do not think that it would be right for ns to leave our position in any doubt. As to the honourable member for Wentworth, has said, I desire that he may not be under the misapprehenson that there has been an3' lack of necessary caution on the part of the Government. The honourable member knows that the Supply Bill came np on the first day fresh and wet from the hands of the printer, that there was no time to consider it may say further, with perfect fairness without any desire to implicate any one, although I took the whole responsibility for the form in which it came before it was because I had to submit to a course being taken in the exigencies of the moment - becaus e of the necessity for obtaining supplies. I observed the form of the Senate. preamble later on, and I have already explained that to the House. As to the present situation, I may explain that in what the clerk has done he has acted according to the Victorian precedents such matters, so that he is not to blamed. We now have an opportumty of asserting our rights in a very distinct manner, and as the Senate has asked us to do what we are now proposing to do, so much ' Mr KNOX (Kooyong) - As a layman I have listened with the greatest attention to the addresses of honourable and learned have members, and if I might intrude upon such delicate ground, I would like to take a business view of the situation, because it seems to me that no matter what promeet cedure we may now adopt there is no guarantee that that mode of procedure will be adhered to in the future.

Then there may be suggestions sent here, and there may be approval of part of the suggestions, and again there may be suggestions or proposals of our own, and this may go on from House to House for a considerable period. It is liis proposal now that we should deal with this matter after we have had the final adjustment, which means after this House has decided what it will do with the suggestions of the other Chamber. Then the honourable gentleman says that the proper course to pursue is not to go into committee again, bu t, according to the phraseology of the motion before the House, to write the final proposal in the body of the Bill. Of course that is an entirely new course of procedure to many of us who have not had to deal with these peculiar motions as between the two Houses.",23
65,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"This is the first time that the case has arisen, as Mr Speaker says.",23
66,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"I do not pretend to give any advice on this cpiestion, but I think we should clearly understand the course of procedure that is to be followed; and if it is likely to be altered again it will be better for some conference of the Standing Orders Committees of the two Houses because, after all, it is very easy to perceive from the attitude and tone of both Houses that there is an earnest desire to have no friction between the two Chambers. Therefore; whilst we are taking this friendly attitude towards each otlier from the beginning of the Constitution, surely we ought to be able to adopt some kind of phraseology under which the two Houses can come together in legislation, without an eternal wrangle over mere verbiage interfering seriously perhaps with the ordinary business of Parliament.",23
67,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"Perhaps I may be allowed to state that it is the desire of the President, of Mr Speaker, and of myself that - the Standing Orders Committee now sitting shall prepare joint standing orders for the two Houses, and means will be taken to that end. The present situation has arisen out of the unprecedented set of circumstances flowing from the provisions of tlje Constitution, and when the honourable and learned member for Werriwa has been in Parliament for as many years as he now has been days, he will understand how difficult it is to provide for new contingencies of this sort, and that under the circumstances the best clerk in .the .world could do no better than get as close as possible to the practice of Assemblies elsewhere. It is not fair to blame either the officials of the House or the Ministry for what has occurred under a new set of circumstances such as have arisen here.

71,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown," We paused in our proceedings in committee on this Bill last week, because we had come to a crucial provision-that dealing with the appointment of a commissioner. It seems to me that we must at this stage clearly and decisively determine what the position the commissioner is to be. If we are fit of opinion that the view of his position Comwliich will be carried into effect by the provisions of the Bill is not the right one v/e deal with the matterat once, because to be otherwise it will be almost impossible to this make the necessary amendments. The time which has been spent on this controversy has in or not, I think, been lost. So far as I can other follow the opinions of honourable members, the position is, that while on the one hand we do not want to have an irresponsible autocrat at the head of the public service, we do not want on the other hand to have sueh a man who, because of the frame-work of this measure and the natural tendencies to each which it will give rise, will be merely the creature of the Minister. There is only one is apway of obviating the difficulty in which as we are jjlaced, and the course to be purpose taken must to some extent be merely Comtentative. If in ' years to come we find that in spite of our efforts political and corrupt influences have crept into the service, destroying its efiiciency, we shall probably have to resort to the drastic remedy of making the commissioner autocratic; suspenbut I tliink that at the present time we Under . . . the Bill the commissioner in some cases ""proposes"" to the Governor General; in other cases he does not propose, but his opinion may be asked; in other cases again he is supposed to nominate ; and lastly, provision is made for a sort of conference between the Governor General, the permanent head, and the commissioner. After having given the matter most careful consideration, my view of the position is that the commissioner should have the initiative. He should be the person who will practically do everything connected with the public service, subject to the approval of the Governor General. That idea may not be very different from .the proposal of the Bill, but to my mind it - assigns quite a different position to the - commissioner from that given to him by the Bill. I know that in putting the commissioner in the position in which I suggest that he should be put, we may invite a dead-lock, because he may make certain appointments which the Governor General will not allow, but if you practically give liim the control of the servioe, sub. ject only to the political check of the Governor General in Council, he becomes at once the controlling influence. It is provided by the Bill that in some matters the permanent head will have something to do with changes in the .stafl^ but I hold, that while the permanent bead is not to be ignored, his specific business is to carry ori the ordinary work and - discipline of the department. says thatAfter considering any such report the commissioner may propose to the Governor General. To some extent that provision has very much .the effect of giving the commissioner the right to appoint.",24
72,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have noticed that there is - a difference in the expressions used throughout the Bill, which may lead to a difference of interpretation, and I propose, therefore, to harmonize the provisions of the various clauses, so that the same expression shall indicate the same power of the commissioner and the permanent head in every instance.",25
73,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"I have not proposed any amendment in the Bill, because I hope that the Attorney-General, who is the author of the measure, would en. deavour to bring its provisions more nearly in accordance with what I judge to be the views of a committee. I think that the commissioner should, subject to the political veto of the Governor General in Council, make appointments, not propose them. Then sub-clause (5) of clause 8 provides thatIf, in the opinion of the commissioner, the services of .any officers in excess in any department, are not likely to be required in any ofcher department the Governor General may call upon such officers to retire from the public service. Further on, sub-clause (2) of clause 21 provides thatIf so recommended by the permanent head such annual salary may, at the expiration of not less than six months, be increased by the Governor General. I do not think that the permanent head should be the active force in a matter of that kind. He should be consulted, and a commissioner who did not consult him would be a fool, because he must necessarily be consulted ; but I think he should be responsible only for the running of the department as it has been handed over to him. The permanent head should, of course, be in close touch with the commissioner to make any proposals, but he should not be the authorizing person for an increase of salary or anything of that kind. Sub-clause (S) of clause 21 provides tliatNotwithstanding anything contained in this section, on the recommendation of a permanent head, the approval of the Minister, and the nomination of the commissioner, an officer may be promoted. That provision seems to me to water down the controlling authority pretty much. Then, Clause 8 with regard to appointments, sub-clause (2) of clause 22 provides thatWith the permission of the Governor General a person not a natural born or naturalized subject of His Majesty may, subject to the provisions of this Act, be admitted to the public service. - Then again on page 11, clause 26, we seeExcept as hereinafter provided eveiy person admitted to the public service shall infchefirstinstance be appointed by the permanent head on probation only. . . . He shall be appointed by the permanent head.",25
74,Mr BARTON,Unknown,On probation only.,25
75,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"On probation only ; but what I want to point out is that we create this machinery and we can easily differentiate between the two things. The permanent head is simply the man to run the properly constituted department placed in his hands; but all matters connected with appointments-al l matters connected with the different grades, and all matters connected with the. question of going outside the public service-everythin g connected with the real management of the public service as a whole must be absolutely intrusted in the first place to the commisfrom sioner.",25
76,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,Who is to be the judge of fitness 1,26
77,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"I do not understand what the honourable member exactly means. Let us look at the principle of the Bill. The principle of the Bil l is that a commissioner, or. a board, whatever it may be, is created, and that commissioner, or board, is responsible for the proper and effective working of the public service as anj' a whole-no t for the discipline of a a time department, which must be under manent head, but for dealing with the whole of this complicated piece of machineryin all departments in every State. The more I read this Bill the more clearly I see that, under certain circumstances - of course it will be understood I am not . talking of the present Ministry - we may sometimes find a Minister whose - whole object in political life is to exercise patronage, and the commissioner could be so harassed and so set aside as tp be rendered almost ineffective. No doubt the commissioner can go to Parliament, but we all know well enough that is a very extreme step f Gift commissioner to take. Mr .DEAKIN - The commissioner has not cavil to take the step-the Bill takes it him.",26
78,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,The Bill does it automaticclearly ally.,26
79,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Yes .,26
80,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"But my point is that a question only goes before Parliament when commissioner makes a recommendation the which the Governor in Council will not carry out, and only by way of showing the Parliament clearly that the commissioner has been overruled. I am as anxious my lionorable friend in charge of the Bill prevent anything like a drastic arrangeA^ictoria, ment by which the commissioner may be New South AA ales. master of the situation, and not the Minister and Government of a country. South Wales. But this Bill requires a certain amount of re-casting in order to put the commissioner, so far as the framework of the Bill is conboard cerned, in a position of far greater power. other words, the whole power of dealing with the public service, outside the ordinary working of the departments by the permabe nent heads, should be absolutely in the hands of the commissioner, with only a veto the Government of the day or the Governor in Council.",26
81,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Hear , hear.",26
82,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"I think that the Minister is very anxious to go a certain way, but I do not think he is anxious to go far enough. I notice a clause here which indicates to a large extent his views as meeting ours up to a certain point. One of his proposed amendments readsIf the Governor General does not approve of proposal, it shall be the duty of the commissioner to reconsider such proposal, and within to be specified by the Governor General to the persubmit another proposal. That is quite right. But this Bill does not give him the initiative right throughout. That is my point. The Bill allows the Governor General to take the initiative, and in some cases allows the permanent head to take the initiative. No doubt, as an honourable member said, the commissioner is a watchdog here. But I want him to be more than a watchdog. I want the commissioner to be head of the establishment, subject to the veto entirely of the Government, so that he may not be in an absolutely autocratic, irresponsible position. I do not intend to say anything more at this stage. I do not wish to at the Bill, but would like for the Attorney-General to say whether he cannot go further and carry out more the view which I have tried to express, although I may have done so very imperfectly.",26
83,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Before honourable members, continue the discussion, I may be the allowed to intervene. The acting leader of Opposition has made a personal appeal, and I would like to reply to it , because honourable member's criticism is perfectly impartial and fair. In two words, what the as honourable member for Wentworth desires is to to restore the system as we now have it in and as I believe they have it in 7",26

In this Bill the idea is that the commissioner and his oflicers shall not the persons charged with the direct responsibility for appointments, but that they shall criticise and advise in regard appointments and promotions, and that the commissioner shall sponsibility for that advice. The honourable member is willing Governor General should have a on all that is done by authority, the authority be a commissioner or ' board. As a matter of fact, to give to the honourable member's proposal not involve any alteration worth speaking of in the relations proposed to in this Bill as between the Governor General and the commissioner. able member's proposal means an alteration in the relative authority of the conimissioner and the permanent heads. In one part his remarks he rightly puts his finger this as the change which would be necessary to introduce into the Bill in order to. give effect to his The alterations from the Victorian plan as manent head. made in this Bill, have so far as concerned, been made deliberately, for a reason. If this outside whether it be called a commissioner board, is made responsible for appointboard ments in the service, there is only one authority outside the because that .authority of necessity constands sults the permanent head, and is very largely guided by the advice of the manent head as to the relative fitness unfitness and the qualifications of oflicers. True there is a recommendation from the board or authority, but in nine times of' ten, it is the recommendation, very little alteration of the permanent head. Under that system, the permanent head does not assume his proper responsiless bility, and is not held to his proper responsibility, while there is a relation established between the commissioner the permanent head which weakens the responsibility not only of the j>ermanent head but of both-it binds them one. The public service is one .the Minister, so to speak, standing outside it. Now the idea of the Bill is that the public service should be a whole, with the permanent heads taking their proper responsibilities, and forward with oflicial statements .of they propose.

99,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I will make it read "" all matters"" if the honourable member desires.",29
100,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,What I want the right honourable ami learned gentleman to do is to make the commissioner the person to clo the act.,29
101,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I do not want him to be the person to do the act. I want him to be responsible for the act, but the person who does the act must nominally be the Governor General. That is the case under the Victorian Act. Under that measure, whatever its evils-anc l although it has many no one will say that political patronage is one of them, or that the Ministry interferes unduly with the Victorian service",29
102,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,It has during the last three years - We have no board except a nominal board.,29
103,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That is because effect has not been given to the Act. From section 32 onwards if honourable members will look up the Victorian Ac t they will find the words "" Governor in Council"" in every section. Everything is .done, as every tiling ought to be done, by the Governor in Council. It seems to me that the proper way for everything to be done is to provide for the Governor General having sufficient authority by way of veto so that Ministers in this House shall accept a full measure of responsibilty for what transpires in their departments with their consent.",29
104,Mr EWING,Unknown,The trouble comes in in two ways--appointment ancl unjust promotion. ' Does the honourable and learned gentleman not the intend to provide in this Bill that promotion and appointment cannot take place without the commissioner's approval 1,29
105,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Promotio n or appointment cannot take place without the commissioner's advice subject to this: That under the Bill it ' need not be the commissioner's first recommendation. ' The commissioner may recommend, and the Governor General can reject. No person can be appointed, advanced, or promoted without a recommendation having been made by the right commissioner, though it need not be his first recommendation. We give him a staff of inspectors covering the whole of Australia. But the commissioner is intended to take his information from the permanent heads, and advice from his own inspectors, who belong to no department, and who are connected with no permanent head except in their official relations.",29
106,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,Thei r powers are territorial.,29
107,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Their business is to go in and out of the departments, criticising their working, and criticising every proposed advancement made in them. It is on their reports that the commissioner will be able to assume an independent attitude, ancl to give the Minister advice worth having. At present, in the Victorian service, we get the advice of the permanent head plus something or plus nothing ; it is watered down. We want somebody who cares nothing for the permanent head: . who can gain nothing from him or lose nothing by his antagonism; whose first ancl only business is to see that the officials are kept up to an efficient discharge of their duties. AU that is given in this measure'is the negative power of veto without which Ministers cannot be held responsible in this House.",29
108,Mr KNOX,Unknown,- I am very anxious to ascertain if the permanent head has the power of initiating and making recommendations.,29
109,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"He has to make his own nominations independently of any one else. He says- "" If I am to work the , department in my way, this is the man who is to be promoted."" Then in comes the commissioner independently and says-"" I agree with this promotion,"" or "" I do not agree with it . I think so and so, although he is a junior officer, is a better man, ancl ought to be preferred.'"" Then the Governor General in Council stands between the two and endeavours to bring them into harmony. He rejects every proposal until he receives a proposal nominated by the one, ancl recommended by the other, which he can approve.",29
110,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,Is it well to lettve the nomination to the permanent head?,30
111,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The permanent head is entitled first of all to be heard, and next to have the responsibility put upon him for the nomination he has made.",30
112,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,But the Commissioner will fall into a routine way of accepting the permanent head's nominations.,30
113,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"In that case, I hope the Governor General will reject those nominations.",30
114,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"The commissioner will lean upon the permanent head, and the Governor General will lean upon the commissioner.",30
115,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The commissioner is intended to rest upon his own insj>ecfcors. His duty is to trust his officers first and then the permanent; head.,30
116,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,AVil l an officer have any opportunity of making representations before the commissioner ?,30
117,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,M o s t certainly. The whole thing has to be laid before the commissioner. It will be within the right of every officer to place his case before him.,30
118,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,That would be provided for in the regulations.,30
119,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I assume that that will be a matter of regulation.,30
120,Mr THOMSON,Unknown," I agree to some extent with the lionorable member for Wentworth, that it would be better in most cases that the initiative should rest with the commissioner.",30
121,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,AVoul d the honourable member let the chief inspector of a bank nominate ?,30
122,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"The right honourable ancl learned gentleman may compare such institutions with the public service, but he forgets that they differ entirely in their fundamental principles. I should be very glad indeed if I could anticipate the glowing picture which the Attorney-General has painted of the results of this measure on the public service of the Commonwealth. I look upon it-as previous Public Service ""Bills have proved to be-as a more or less abortive attempt to properly regulate the public service. More will depend on the gentleman who is appointed as commissioner than upon anything else. If an inferior or defective commissioner is appointed, then the results of the operation of this Bill cannot be anything like the Attorney-General property hopes. There is this much to say in favour of the proposal of the honourable member for Wentworth, that a commissioner who did not fulfil the conditions of his appointment- a weak commissioner-woul d have less shelter for his weakness if the initiative depended upon him, and the responsibility were thrown upon him, than he would have with the permanent head on the one side, and the Minister on the other side to relieve him of a certain share of the responsibility.",30
123,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Eac h has to put his name to his own, and to stand by liis own.",30
124,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"But if a weak commissioner happened to be appointed, and hefound that the upper millstone of the Minister and the nether millstone of the permanent head grinding him constantly he would say, "" AAHiat is the use of my resisting, there are often conjoint representations ?"" because the Minister and the permanent head are much more likely to go together than are the Minister and the commissioner. A weak commissioner would say, "" AVbat is the use of my resisting, my life is made a burden to me by doing so, ancl it is infinitely better that I should accept their recommendations, and let those who make them responsible for the result."" There would not be the direct responsibility that the honourable member for Wentworth is trying to cast upon the commissioner.",30
125,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,Unknown,Everything that has to be done is clone with his. approval.,30
126,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"The commissioner is buried amongst three. If he gives his approval his responsibility is reduced, because it is divided, whereas, if he had the initiative, he would have to bear the full brunt of the responsibility. The Attorney-General must not think that I am criticising in this way with any desire to disturb his measure. Looking as I do on all these public service measures, largely from the results of their operation i u otlier States, as more or less abortive, I am perfectly willing to give the Attorney-General's system the fair trial which he desires. I admit at once that even if the system proposed by the honourable member for Wentworth were superior in fixing the responsibility on the commissioner that even that system would break down if we had an ineffective commissioner, while, if we get a real strong commissioner, the system provided in this Bil l is likely to produce fairly satisfactory results. Eor these reasons, although of the two I think that the proposal of the honourable member for Wentworth is the better, as the Bill is based on the other system, and as both systems will depend largely on the commissioner, I would not press for alteration in that respect by the Attorney General.",30
127,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown," When I interjected I was somewhat misled, because it seemed to me that the commissioner was to have some right in initiating appointments. After hearing the Attorney General, however, I think the matter is really brought back to the position of the Cabinet veto. We have been told that this is to be an experiment; and, as such, I suppose we shall have to accept it . Personally, I do not feel very bitterly opposed to the Bill, although it is largely on the lines of the Victorian Act, which in many respects has not been successful. There is, however, this difference, and it is here that I think the salvation of the measure is be found. Whereas the Victorian Board were themselves'to be inspectors who would have to value the work and to appraise the services of the officers, they have never done that kind of thing, and it is now proposed that the appraisement should be performed by independent inspectors - That seems to me to be the saving provision so far as the public service is concerned.",31
128,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That , taken together witli the abolition of seniority and a merely literary examination.",31
129,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"As to the general service, the principle of inspection for the purposes of valuing the work, of seeing the man in his office and ascertaining what he is actually doing and whether he is worth the money he is getting is a splendid thing. The only fault.! have to find with the proposed plan is that it is just possible the Minister may come down by process of negation to some favourite and may secure likely to prove his appointment.",31
130,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,They have to show Parliament the reason for every refusal.,31
131,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"Yes ; this is all very well, but we are cutting ourselves away from the principle of promotion by seniority, and the principle of merit is to operate absolutely, and under these circumstances there may be some tendency to assert the power of the Cabinet in order to secure the appointment of favorites. I do not say that that would obtain, because from our Victorian experience I do not know that we have much to fear in that regard. We have had one celebrated case, but that is the only one I liave heard of that caused . any real stir. I think we had better accept the suggestion of the Minister. I take this opportunity of stating that I shall have an amendment to propose in sub-clause (2 ), which provides that the Commissioner and inspectors shall be appointed for Seven years. When the Attorney-Gsneral was speaking the other night I interjected that the period was too long, and I intend to ask the Attorney-General to accept five years insteadof seven. I would point out that seven years is an exceedingly long time, and that anything may happen within that period. In any case we have had experience in Victoria under which a commissioner was appointed for a term of five years, and it seemed to me from this that it would be unwise to make tliese long appointments. If we get a bad man we shall be veiy glad to save the two to years, whereas if we get a good man we can easily extend the term of his engagement.",31
132,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"The Savings Bank Commissioner in Victoria is appointed for life, and he has to advance money on mortgages.",31
133,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"Yes , but he was a man well tried in the service and a man of large experience. We are now making an experiment and we do not know whom we may get. We may get a good man and a strong man - who may do very good service, but on the other hand we may get a man who may give such umbrage as to render it desirable to shorten his term of office.",31
134,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,Unknown,We are more likely to get a good man under the longerterm of engagement.,31
135,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"I do not know about that. If we find that we have a good man we can easily renew the appointment. In any case I feel very strongly against these long terms of engagement for highly paid officers of whom we know nothing, and in all these matters I think five years sufficient. I am now mentioning the arguments that consider should be advanced in favour of the amendment I intend to bring forward, in hope that the Attorney-General may accept it.",31
136,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown, I see the clause providesSuch commissioner shall submit forfchecon sideration of the Governor General reports any matters requiring to be dealfc with by Governor General under this Acfc. I think it might be made clear that these reports should be received before any matter is dealt with. It might be that the report would come in after the matter was dealt with.,32
137,Mr DEAKIX,Unknown,"The phrase ""any matters requiring to be dealt with "" sliows the report is to be furnished beforehand.",32
138,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"I noticed that, but is it perfectly clear that the report must be received before anything is done?",32
139,Mr DEAKIX,Unknown,"Yes , it must be.",32
140,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,Then I should am quite satisfied.,32
141,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown, I by understood the Attorney-General to say very that the nominations must be made by permanent heads of the departments the recommendations by the commissioner.,32
142,Mr DEAKIX,Unknown,Yes .,32
143,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown,"Well , I think with a permanent head making nominations, the Ins chances are that the officer's who are immehas-a diately under his attention, and practically his own officers, will receive his nominaterested tions.",32
144,Mr DEAKIX,Unknown,The commissioner has to check them.,32
145,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown,The commissioner attached may practically drop down to endorsing what the head of the department recommends.,32
146,Mr DEAKIX,Unknown,Not if the inspectors tlieir duty.,32
147,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown,"I tliink the nominamaterial tion sliould be made by the commissioner, because he would have the. report of his spectors, who would go over the State, only into the head office, where the permations nent head is situated, but into other branches, where there might be men, haps, better qualified than tliose immecreated diately under the eye of the permanent head. These men might be overlooked by has done the right thing. the permanent head, because they would be practically unknown to him, but, if the system were carried out of leaving the commisI sioner to make the nominations, he would have the reports of the various inspectors to the guide him, and, I think, greater justice would be done to the service generally. .",32
148,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown," I agree with what the honourable member for Corangamite has said. I think that matters that come under the observation of as to the permanent head are necessarily of too the limited a range to enable him to make the best selection possible, and I think it would, be very much better if there were a clearer definition of the duties of each party. In the first place, we have the Governor General-wit h parliamentary concurrence, of course-creatin g the office itself, and prescribing the duties. Then, I agree with that the honourable member that the commissioner should, subject to the veto of the. Governor General-li e would, of course, have to satisfy the Minister that his action is right-have the whole responsibility of selecting the proper persons to fill the various offices. Then the permanent head be responsible for the working of the department with the men who are selected the commissioner. I admit that it is a difficult matter, but in this connection I should be very glad if some provision and could be made by which the permanent head could have a personal interest in securing the best results from the material placed at his disposal. At the present time personal interest, if he gives way to it , tendency to run in the otlier direction. An HOXORABLE MEMBER - He is i ni n increasing the importance of his department",32
149,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown,"Ye s ; the importance of the head of a department and the salary to his position depend on the number of persons under him, and the number of branches and sub-branches he controls, do but if we can give him some personal interest in obtaining the best results from the placed at his disposal, it will be a great improvement. I tliink it would inbe well to separate the duties, so that Parnot liament may know where the recommendacome from. The commissioner should be responsible for making the appointments, perafter the Governor in Council has once the positions, and he should in eveiy case be able to satisfy the Minister that he Then the Minister will accept the responsibility when he sanctions or fails to veto the recommendations of the commissioner. It ] would be much better not to have the responsibility too much divided up amongst the permanent heads,j the commissioner and the Minister, because we require to know where the recommendations come from in order to fix the responsibility.",32
150,Mr EWING,Unknown," I presume the House is justified in coming to the conclusion that in all circumstances under this Bill the head of the department must nominate, and I would like the honourable and learned member in charge of the Bill to look at this aspect of the case. The view of the head of any department is limited, speaking generally, to his own department, and he has no knowledge of any department except that which he himself controls. Take the departmentof Justice and the department of Lands. The head of the Lands department would have no knowledge of the competence of officers in the department of Justice, and an officer who might work unsatisfactorily in the Justice department might very easily work satisfactorily in the department of Lands. Therefore, whilst inside the department under the control of a particular officer we may get the best management limited to that department, we cannot make the view of the permanent heads sufficiently extended to take in the whole of the sen-ice and secure the most beneficial results for the Commonwealth.",33
151,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That is what the commissioner is for.,33
152,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Lookin g at the matter from another aspect, human nature, ' excepting Members of Parliament, is pretty well the same all over the world, and heads of departments have a tendency to make their officers a sort of happy family. There is a disposition, when an officer enters a department, to look for his career in that department, and a man coming from another department is regarded to some extent as an interloper. It is usually found that the head of a department is willing to overlook comparative want of competence on the part of one of his own officers rather than bring in another manof more competence from another department to take his place. I see great difficulties in this restricted vision, and the great interest which the head of the department feels in liis own department, bred of personal sympathy with his own officers, operating against the selection of the best men for the various positions. The Attorney-General has stated that it is for the purpose of making the best selection that the commissioner 'is appointed, but I want to know what the commissioner and what the inspectors are to do until the initiative is taken by the head of the department. As the Bill stands the machinery cannot be started at all without the permanent head. The inspector may find an exceUent man who may require to be placed in a different position. He may find any number of round pegs in square holes, but how is he going to move without the nomination of the permanent head 1 I grant at once the importance of recognising the prestige of the heads of departments, and, further, I quite recognise that unless the head of a department is a good man. he ought not to be in that position of control. The inspectors, and, through them, the commissioner, get a special knowledge of all the departments, and what I want to know is, how will the Commonwealth obtain the benefit of their special knowledge in - regard to appointments and promotions if the head of the department alone has the power of initiation ?",33
153,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I hesitate to speak again, lest it may seem that I am occupying time unduly; but I take it that in dealing with this clause we are considering the whole purport and character of the Bill, and I wish to show honourable members that I am paying them the courtesy of listening to and endeavouring to weigh their remarks. I admit the difficulties which are associated with the provisions regulating the position of the permanent head; but I would point out that the position of a permanent head under the Bil l will differ very greatly from that of the present permanent head in the public service of the States The permanent head in a State is the head of a department all of whose branches are situated in that State; but the permanent head provided for in the Bill wiU be an officer who will be placed over the per- manent heads of his department in the various States.",33
154,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Will not that make his position more difficult ?,33
155,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,It will make his knowledge of his officers still more circumscribed.,33
156,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"In a sense that wiU be so. The permanent head of a department which radiates all over Australia will have an almost insuperable task in making himself acquainted with the work and character of the men under him.; but it will be part of his duty to do so, ancl it is hoped that he will do so. By the help of his chief officers he will come to know his staff, and his recommendation will come to mean what the recommendation of a permanent head means now in many cases-the recommendations of all the chief officers brought together, and filtered through him. It will not be a recommendation which, as a rule, he can. make of his own personal knowledge apart from the reports of others. The commissioner is placed in the same position of difficulty, with this difference-that he is to be the permanent and all-potent critic of all the departments. His task is therefore even greater, ancl he must rely upon the criticisms of the departments given to him by his inspectors.",33
157,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Is not that his only task 1,34
158,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Yes . The permanent heads have in addition the task of managing their departments.,34
159,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown,That makes a great difference.,34
160,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I .am endeavouring to deal with the question asked by the honourable member for Bichmond, as to the possibility of taking an officer from one department and placing him in another. That duty will fall upon the commissioner and his inspectors. They will be supposed to know all the departments; to mark the promising and able officers in each, ancl to note whether men employed in one department are or are not fitted to work in other departments. In Victoria, the tide of public opinion is now going in a direction which is contrary to that in which it proceeded in 18S3, when the ciy was, "" Break down the barriers which make our public departments practically watertight compartments.""",34
161,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown,"But - in Victoria went too far. It is only where there are duties of similar character to be performed that an oflicer can be transferred from one department to another; as, for instance, where there are bookkeeping duties, or purely clerical work. Where a knowledge of, say, the Land Acts, or of the routine of the post-office or the Customs, is required, there cannot be this interchange.",34
162,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The honourable member for Richmond repeated a cry which was .universal in Victoria in 18S3, when we swept away all barriers to promotion from one department to another. That arrangement has not been working well, however, and a reaction has set in, which, as reactions generally are, is probably extreme. The cry now is for the confinement of oflicers to the department, or even to the branch of the service in which they are placed. The Government consider that the middle course is the safest and best; that, while opportunities for transfer should be provided where duties are of a like character, we should avoid the mistake made in Victoria in 1883. The reason of the existence of the inspectors and the commissioner is to provide for such transfers, ancl to provide against the comparative and innocent ignorance of any permanent head in regard to the personal qualities ancl qualifications of oflicers who aie scattered throughout Australia. Clause 9 provides that the commissioner ancl his inspectors shall perform the most vital and important task-bot h in regard to the interests of the public servants themselves, ancl in regard to the public-rtha t can be undertaken in connection with the service, the grading and the classifying of the men and their work. That great and all-important task falls absolutely to the commissioner ancl his inspectors. They are not to wait for the consent of the Governor General in Council, for the approval of the permanent head, or for anything else. They will examine all the men, in the service and the work they are doing, and will"" classify and grade them accordingly.",34
163,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Does not the veto of the Governor General come in there ?,34
164,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No ; because this is the work which the commissioner ancl inspectors are specially appointed to do. If they are not fit to do this work, they ave fit to do nothing.",34
165,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Ari d if they are fit to clo it they are fit to do more. we Mr THOMSON - Is there not a right of veto under clause 38 ?,34
166,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No ; the right of veto comes in later. The commissioner and his inspectors are, by the first work in which they will have to engage, brought into the closest ancl most intimate contact with the whole service throughout Australiathe classification and grading of the public servants; and it will be their business to keep up the knowledge which they thus gain of the abilities of the men in t ht various States. Of course their opinion of a man may change; and the duties attached to some offices may grow while those attached - to others may decline. It will be the business of the commissioner to watch these things; to see if a man fulfils his early promise, and to note where men do greater things than they originally gave promise of doing.",34
167,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,Will grade the offices or will he grade the officers'?,35
168,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"He will grade the officers, but he will have to grade the offices also. He must understand the work to done and the abilities of the particular man who is doing it . The Commonwealth does not begin its career with a clean It takes over great departments whioh have been transferred to it by the States, and it nominate ? finds men already in positions. The commissioner and the inspectors will have classify the work which these men are doing, and to form an opinion of accord. their abilities. They are appointed to supply the want to which the orable member for Corangamite and the honourable member for Gippsland always have alluded. They are supposed the closest touch with the men in all the departments. When a permanent head, with his knowledge of the working of department, and the advice of Iris chief officers, makes a certain nomination, best safeguard against injustice which have been able to suggest is that the opinion of the commissioner and his officers should also be sought. It is therefore provided that the commissioner must be satisfied that the man nominated to a post is justly enrequired titled to it, and is the best man obtainable. If he or his inspectors know of another in the department, or in another departbe ment, who possesses more special aptitude and higher qualifications, it will be his busispectors, ness to name him.",35
169,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown,"But the permanent head may not nominate such a man. commissioner is not satisfied with the nomination of the permanent head, and knows person who would fill the position better but who is unknown to the permanent head, manent head ? how can the permanent head be induced to nominate him ?",35
170,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If the permanent head nominates one person, and the commisdivisions sioner recommends' another, the matter comes before, the Minister, who require the permanent head to inquire into .the claims of the man who has nominates, and the been recommended by the commissioner; commends. and if there is a doubt that the commissioner has not fully weighed the value of the man nominated by the permanent head, ""he will be asked to consider the case again.",35
171,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown,Then the commissioner may make a nomination to the Governor General apart from the nomination of the the commissioner permanent head ?,35
172,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The commissioner acts' . upon the nomination of the permanent head, who requires another officer, but indepenbe dently of the permanent head. The Commissioner is not appointed to say ""ditto "" to the permanent head unlesn he is satisfied that sheet. the nomination is a proper one.",35

175,Mr CKOTJCH,Unknown,The permanent head could beat the commissioner by not coming to be in into accord with liim.,35
176,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I . should say that the Governor General in Council would place a more reliance upon the recommendation of the commissioner and his inspectors than the upon the nomination of the permanent we head, because the commissioner is removed from all suspicion of favouritism, and will have in some respects an even better acquaintance with the departments than their permanent heads. Suppose that an officer is for a position in Queensland, the Governor General may say to the permaman nent head--""The man you nominate may an excellent man from what you know of him; but the commissioner and his inwhose particular task it is to make themselves acquainted with the whole of the members iri the service, recommend the apI f the pointment of some one else.""  a commend the appointment of some one else if that person is not nominated by the per",35

193,Mr CROUCH,Unknown," I agree with the idea contained in the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Wentworth, but I hardly think this is a proper place in which to insert it . I can see that when we come to the question of appointments and promotions such an amendment might well be made.",37
194,Sir AVILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,Where does the honourable member propose the amend of ' ment should be made ?,37
195,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Clause 21,sub-clause(8), is the first provision in the Bill in which any real act of operative work is provided Clause 5 only says that there is to be missioner, and what the commissioner do, and then other clauses go on to say there is to be a permanent head, chief officer, and so on. These clauses all deal with the creation of persons as distinct authorities under the Act ; but it is only in clause sub-clause (8), that we come to any active work.",37
196,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,T h o clause nnder consideration says that the commiswhile sioner shall report to the Governor General.,37
197,Mr HARPER,Unknown,That has nothing to do with the permanent head.,37
198,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,This clause does not affect the powers of the commissioner in the slightest degree. Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN . ^ I am referring to all appointments in the public service.,37
199,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"The honourable member will not say that the commissioner has authority or power to reduce the power thepermanenthead,andthatconsequentlythe commissioner is not to have power to report. Clause 21 is the proper place for the ment proposed by the honourable member for AVentworth, .seeing that is the clause in which there is first shown the possibility of the three rival powers coining into tact. In clause 21, sub-clause (S), we readNotwitlistanding anything contained in section, on the recommendation of a permanent head, the approval of the Minister, and the nomination of the commissioner, an officer may General can have. be promoted. I would ask the honourable member to move that after the word "" section "" the words "" the recommendation of a permanent head be struck out, and the words "" the Minister on the recommendation of the commissioner who shall also present a report from the permanent head"" be ""inserted in lieu thereof.",37
200,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That will give effect to what the honourable member for AVentworth requires.,37
201,Sir AVILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"Yes , I think the honourable member is right. I want to put myself in a line with those who agree with me.",37
202,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"That would mean that the Minister makes the nomination, but it must be on the recommendation the commissioner, who, when he asks the Minister to make the nomination, has to present the report from the permanent head.",37
203,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Northern Melbourne). for - T concur with the last speaker'in the a comopinion that it would be better if the shall amendment proposed by the honourable that member for AVentworth were not introduced at the present stage. I understand that clause 5 is really a covering clause, giving a general idea of the commissioner's relations 2 l , with the Governor in Council, and we shall have an opportunity of specially dealing with three or four distinct matter's afterwards. One of these matters is that of appointments, another deals with promotions, and another with transfers and with the specially difficult question of introducing, for special reasons, outsiders into high position's. It would be a mistake in this general covering clause, to have general statements which do not apply to all these three or four different steps which have to be taken. From my point of view I largely agree with the view expressed by the honourable member for Wentworth that it would be a misany take for Ministers to depart from the of notion of leaving with the commissioner the nomination of the officer. There aro two distinct things to be considered in reamendgard to the permanent head question-on e is the office arid the other is the officer. The initiative with regard to new officesthe number of men wanted in an officeconshould come from the permanent head, who has a more detailed knowledge this of his office and the different divisions than the commissioner pr the GovernorThe commissioner ought not to have the initiative as to what offices are created, but when it comes on to a question of what officers should be pro"" moted or transferred, then - arises the danger of favouritism and influence. It is here we want the buffer of the commissioner. In regard to appointments, I do not think there is much danger, and we may make our minds easier about them, because they must be by competition, and in the clerical division there will, in the ordinary course things, be a gradual setting upwards. But there are most delicate operations when it comes to the question of promotion, and when we create the special power of enabling a man in the clerical division to skip It is here we must make our special arrangements and take our precautions; and in. this connection I should certainly leave as little to the permanent head as possible. In these matters we have a permanent head for all Australia. The commissioner may be living in Melbourne, or the federal capital, wherever that may be, and how is he to know anything about men in Coolgardie, Port Darwin, Brisbane, or Hobart ? But the commissioner has inspectors, and they are all supposed to be familiar with the service in the States, and it is to them in the first instance that the selection of officer-the person-ough t <to be intrusted. It is to the commissioner and his inspectors we should look for the protection of Ministers from political influence. I use these words advisedly, because a Ministei', though, of course, he may exercise a little influence, is at the same time very often driven to that course. AVhat I want is that a Minister shall be able to say if a man is pressing him for the appointment or promotion of a particular person, "" I can take no step in initiation-this man has to commend himself to the commissioner, who is familiar witli all the circumstances."" On this very difficult subject, the Ministers ought not to alter clause 26, and the other clauses, which are the framework of the Act. AVith regard to officers, if there is anytliing special to be done, apart from the usual examination, it ought to be entrusted to the commissioner, who should be allowed to name the men, and then, if honourable members like, there may be the report of the permanent head. ' Mr A MCLEAN - That report is always given in important cases. ' Mr HIGGINS - Quite so. I recognise the difficulty of the Minister, who says that the permanent head has to work the department, and ought to be left with that responsibility, and who does not want the permanent head to turn round and say that the Minister does not supply the proper men.",37
204,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Permanen t heads say that already. Mr.'HIGGINS - There is not any danger in the clerical staff"", where one man is not of very difierent from another. AVhat the permanent head may reasonably complain of is that he is not provided with sufficient men; and if he is told he wil l have plenty of men to carry out the work, a class. he must also be told he must accept the initiation of the commissioner and those who know the service best as to who should be appointed. It is only in the higher grades that the individuality of the men becomes of importance, and, therefore, we might for the present pass these general clauses with such verbal alterations as have been suggested. When we come to the clauses dealing with promotions and transfers, and allowing the skipping of grades, we may deal specially with tliem.",38
205,Mr EAVING,Unknown," I understand from the temper of the committee that it is the not probable we shall come to a division on this amendment, which might, perhaps, be dealt with later on. But I would like the Attorney-General, before we come to the clauses where this amendment would be best fitted, to consider what I and a number of honourable members see a difficulty in, namely, the power of appointment by the commissioner. The initiative is at present with the permanent head - AVe understand, of course, the importance of making what use we can of the permanent head, but we still desire to use fully the services of a highly paid and veiy intelligent official such as the commissioner will be. AVould it not be possible to work with a joint recommendation 1 Is the Bill so framed that it is impossible to accept a suggestion of this kind ?",38
206,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,It is intended to have a joint nomination and recommendation.,38
207,Mr EWING,Unknown,Quite so. The honourable gentleman is right in stating that eventually it must be a joint recommendation to be operative.,38
208,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Yes .,38
209,Mr EAVING,Unknown,"But in this case there is no power of origination-n o power of what might be called suggestion-wit h ono of the parties, that party being the commissioner.",38
210,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I think there is.,38
211,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The Attorney-General has stated frequently that the power of suggestion-the power of nomination-lie s with the head of the department. Mr -.DEAKIN --Yes ; but as soon as the permanent head nominates for a particular posedoffice, the commissioner recommends - One may nominate Jones and 'the other may recommend Brown.",38
212,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Of course the - nominaviously tion to be operative under tlus Bill must become a joint nomination. But there the is a material difference between a nomishould nation that eventually - becomes a joint nomination and a nomination in which it each one has an initiative.

225,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Do the words mean in or out of.office?,40
226,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,They ought to mean either in or out of office.,40
227,Mr KNOX,Unknown," Has the At torney-General ' considered the difficulty which surrounds the removal of an inspector ? The office of the commissioner I can understand, ought to be hedged round veiy carefully, but there are six inspectors, and it might be necessary to remove one of them. I only wish to suggest to the Attorney General whether the inspectors are really in the same position as the commissioner.?",40
228,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Precisely , I think. ' Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN - It does not take the two Houses to remove an inspector. - Mr DEAKIN - Yes it does.",41
229,Mr KNOX,Unknown,Before an inspector can be removed must that course of action be decided upon by both Houses ?,41
230,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Yes . If the commissioner lives at the capital of Australia lie will be absolutely dependent upon his officers in the several States for recommendations, and unless those oflicers are protected against political influence - unless they can be brought to see that they cannot be made to suffer because of their particular opinions or the effect of^ their action on the politics of the day-w e will not get from them the service we require, which is 'absolutely impartial and fearless advice in regard to everything connected with the public service. If we are to get that from 'the commissioner we must get it from the inspectors in the different States.

231,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"The Attorney-General - suggests that the words "" inability, incapacity, misbehaviour, Or misconduct do not govern removal by both Houses of Parliament. I think they do. First the Governor General suspends an officer on certain grounds, and then the Minister lays before honourable members a statement of those grounds. The commissioner then, is restored, unless each ""House of Parliament, within 42 days after the day when such statement was laid ibefore it, declares by resolution that the commissioner ought to be removed from oifice. I do not think that on any reasonable construction of the clause, reading it as a whole, one could gather any other conclusion than that the Houses of Parliament, whether they specifically say so in their resolution or not, are practically bound by the grounds of inability and incapacity. I think it should be made clear, if there is any doubt about it . The commissioner mav be suspended on one ground and removed on another.

232,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I will consider it .,41

We want some form of punishment which will be short of suspension, if punishment at all is called for. It may seem hard to suspend or dismiss a man for an offence which yet would be worthy of some punishment.",42
245,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Why not reprimand in such a case ?,42
246,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"We should not require statutory authority for that. necessary to insert power to reprimand, but power to fine must be jjrovidecl in the Bill. The highest officer, except the commissioner, must be liable to be dealt with as are any other officers.",42

That is one of the very things which are left to suspension under clause 6, ancl subsequent removal by Parliament.",42
253,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That is intended for absolute incapacity, which is also a question of fact-for instance, mental aberration orphysical prostration.",42
254,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"Is the Governor General to wait until the commissioner or inspector is found to be a lunatic by inquisition ? Incapacity is a matter of opinion. It should be intended only for certain cases.

I look on this clause as the safety of the whole Bill , and upon the inspection of the departments and of the officers in them as the whole business of''the Bill. I would like to suggest- I do not know whether it is advisable-that-afte r the word* "" Commissioner."" in the third line the*- words- ""not"" less than four times each year"" be inserted.",43
266,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It ' depends on' the State. ; In Western Australia, forinstance, we have and a single officer in a distant plaee, and we do to the not want to go to'him' four' times a year. have to - provide f6r. so many different States?

272,Mr ISAACS,Unknown," Under : the new wording: of sub-clause (3), how is the determination of the number of officers to be made ?",44
273,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,It is the number determined to be necessary bytheGovernorGeneral.,44

277,Mr DEAKIX,Unknown,"It wasipointed out.that.the commissioner wasadvising, the Governor General, and that His. Excellency was acting in. a subordinate capacity.",44

SOLOMON - That seems rather an important amendment, and I am doubtful whether it may not interfere with the rights of the officers.",44
291,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If they are not transferred, they will get the same salary somewhere else.  missed.",45
292,Mr VL SOLOMON,Unknown,"That is the only point, as to whether the alteration might have the effect of giving the option of dismissal.",45
293,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No ; it simply relates to transfers. Amendment agreed to. Amendments (by Mr DEAKIN ) proposed - That the words ""from time to time"" be omitted from lines 3.1 and 32 ; that the words ""as required"" be omitted from line 33 ; and that the word ""so"" he omitted from line 39.",45
294,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"I 'would like to know whether the omission of those words ""as required "" would not give the Governor in Council liberty to send officers from an overcrowded department into another department where they might already have the maximum number of officers ?",45
295,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I take it that the term ""as required"" does not mean ""required in the department to which tliey are sent,"" but the term refers back to the transfer that is made, and means that they shall be transferred as they are requited to be transferred. However it might mean both, and I will consider the suggestion. Amendments agreed to. Amendment (by Mr DEAKIN ) posed That the words "" In the opinion of the missioner,"" in line 4.1, be omitted.",45
296,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,I . wish to know whether the provision in this sub-clause may not come into conflict with the constitutional rights of servants transferred from the State public services to that of the Commonwealth? ,45
297,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,No ; that is all provided for in the Constitution.,45
298,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,Northern Melbourne) Sub-clause (5) contains a provision for the retirement of officers. . A man may be 50 or 60 years of age and be called 'upon to retire without a penny of compensation. Is that intended ? It is quite true that clause S4 protects the rights of transferred officers.,45
299,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,All other officers will be insured.,45
300,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,Is it clear that the provisions relating to insurance cover the event of retirement?,45
301,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Yes , they do; but, to be candid, I must admit that I am doubtful whether we shall be able to provide for the return of premiums in all cases. I have only partial information at the present time, but shall have complete information before we finally deal with the matter. I am doubtful whether we can provide for the return of premiums to men who are retired, without unduly loading the premiums of other officers.",45
302,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"If we do not provide for these men by insurance, will the honourable and learned member be willing to allow of provision for compensation being made ?",45
303,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,We do not provide for compensation in the Bill.,45
304,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,There is no compensation clause ?,45
305,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,No .,45
306,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"There is such a provision in the Victorian Act. In most cases where people have been called upon to retire, compensation has been given under the Act, but in some very hard cases, no compensation at all was given. I would suggest that, although it is not desirable that the public servants should have a freehold tenure of office, it would be well, if no pension or insurance is provided, that there should be compensation for compulsory retirement which is not due to a man's own fault.",45
307,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If we find that sub-clause pro- (c) of clause 44, which relates to the return of premiums, has to be amended or modified, comwe shall have to consider the question of compensation; but I have no complete information on the subject before me at the present time.",45
308,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,Coul d we not have a pro ratd insurance ?,46
309,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If it were possible to know what men were likely to be dispensed with, they could be charged an exceptional premium for the exceptional risk; but I am afraid that if we try to cover the risk of retirement for all by insurance we shall increase the premium paid by every member of the public service to provide for a contingency which is very remote. If sub-clause (c) is omitted we shall have to take into consideration the point raised by the honourable and learned member.",46
310,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,There may be retirement on the ground of ill-liealtli.,46
311,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,This clause deals only with retirements caused by excess of officers. Retirements on the score of ill health are dealt with later.,46
312,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"I am strongly in favour of some compensation being paid to officers who are retired, and I do not think that the risk of retirement can possibly be covered by an insurance policy.",46
313,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I am inclined to agree with the honourable and learned member, 'and shall noteÂ»the point. Amendment agreed to.",46
314,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,It seems to me that the words of sub-clause (4) apply to eveiy officer.,46
315,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"They are intended to do so. The commissioner cannot alter the salary. It is a question of having so many men in a particular class or division; and for the purposes of the Commonwealth service the transferred officer is to go into the class or division in whichhis work places him, even if it should happen to differ from the class in which his work in the State service placed him.",46
316,Mr VL SOLOMON,Unknown," I should like to know how the clause affects transferred officers. Of course' some of these are entitled under the laws of the States from which they come to receive compensation on retirement, and their rights are protected by the Constitution Act ; but there are others who are not so protected, and who may have a claim to consideration. There may be men taken over who may have been in the service of Victoria, or of some other State, for fifteen or twenty years as temporary employees, and to dispense with the services of such men at a moment's notice, without paying them any compensation, seems to me extremely unfair. Wliile some of the States have placed the public servants in a proper position, other States have not. In South Australia a Public Service Bill has been dangled before Parliament for four or five years, but nothing has been done to place the officers in a proper position, and although some of them may have been in the service of the State for fifteen or twenty years, they may when taken over by this. Commonwealth be liable to dismissal without compensation. I would like the Attorney-General to consider whether such officers could not be safeguarded under the clause.",46
317,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The clause provides for retrenchment where there are officers in excess of the requirements of the department, but its provisions are not likely to .have any application during the first years of the Commonwealth, because the duties and business of the Commonwealth public service will expand, and we are not likely to have excess officers for a considerable time to come. I think that the honourable member may rest assured that those on whose behalf he is speaking are not likely to be affected by the clause.",46
318,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"Of course the Government must have the power to retire from the public service any persons whose services are not required; but where an officer is retired through no fault of his own, provision should be made to give him some compensation.",46
319,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have promised the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne that I will consider the matter.  out that the fact that some officers in a department are entitled to compensation upon retirement while other officers are not might' determine who should go out, which I think wpuld be a very unfortunate state of things.",46
320,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Quite so. I shall reconsider the compensation question when we come to deal with the sub-clause to which I have referred. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 9(1) The commissioner shall from time to time determine the division class subdivision of class or grade of every oflicer, and shall keep a record of all officers showing with regard to euch officer his age and length of service the office he holds and his division class subdivision of class or grade ami salary under this Act. (2) Where aa officer has been, transferred from the public service of u State, such record shall also show the position of such officer in such State at the time of such transfer.

Such listshall, be primli facie evidence of the information contained.  think that sub-clause (2.) is the.place in which I should. move the amendment.to which I ! referred the'other night.",46
321,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,";-Not in regard to providing automatic, increments? ",47

(Corinella) - In.line s 1.and 2. it. isprovided "" The commissioner, shall, from time to time, determine.""

Personally, I prefer that he should be an executive officer-; but if we have a scheme I like to see that scheme carried out completely..",47
323,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLIAN,Unknown,-This - is. special.part of the Bill.,47
324,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"But tliisclause conflicts with the advisory position, of the commissioner; If the Governoi'rGenenal in.

Mr MCCAY!-Suppos e the commissioner recommended John Jones to be promoted, and the Governor General did not approve of the promotion, what is to prevent the commissioner, under this clause; from determining that John Jones' position. was in a higher, class ?",47
325,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The intention is that at the outset the commissioner, having, a number of services brought together^ must grade tliem on. an even. plan... That would not affect the. salaries of transferred Government servants. An. Honorable MEMBER - What about those transfersalready made ?",47
326,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Hewouldgrade.those , too, with due respect to what had already been ' . done, but they would be subject to the inquiry of'whether, they were - paid' too much or too little. As time went, on we might insist on regrading, the-, idea being that it shall take place when the officer, changes his duties.. The commissionergrades the officer, and has to take into consideration the office, also. The intentionis. that unless there isan. alteration. in. the original grade, the determination previously made shall not be altered.

344,Mr CONROY,Unknown,If there - was anything wrong the witnesses should be brought to a proper court. Such a power as this should not be given to any body of men. AVe ought not to constitute a new court. If we give this power to the commissioner we should certainly very seriously consider it .,49
345,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"-We have done it continuously for many years in Victoria, and no one has objected.",49
346,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"If I understand the clause aright it enables certain people to be summoned to give evidence, say, to the effect that a civil servant was intoxicated on a certain occasion. Have we any right to give power to the commissioner or any inspector to summon any citizen of the State Â£or the purpose of giving evidence?",49
347,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I clo not think there is anv doubt of that.,49
348,Mr CONROY,Unknown,What I object to is that we are constituting a new court altogether.,49
349,Mr DUAKIN,Unknown,"Our professional men Victoria have had power to appear before the board under a similar clause to this just as they appear before anjother court. If that is so you must have witnesses summoned, and there must be power to summon them.",49
350,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I am against the clause altogether. It has been done without in New South Wales. I do not see what qualifications the commissioner can have for hearing and determining evidence. Trouble has arisen in New South Wales tlirough the chairmen of lands boards-who , in one instance, was a man without any knowledge of law whatever-takin g hearsay evidence. We had a trial which was protracted over 45 clays to satisfy the curiosity of one or two gentlemen who were interested, and not less than five-sixths of the evidence taken was absolutely irrelevant. It would have been decided to be so by the courts. Unsupported statements were freely made. Monstrous injustices could be done under such a provision. If you give the commissioner this power you are appointing another court that is absolutely unknown to us.",49

A man may be brought from the interior of Australia to Melbourne.",49
360,Mr DUAKIN,Unknown,I do not intend - to oppose the amendment of the honourable member for Corio.,49
361,Mr ISAACS,Unknown," The honourable member for Corio could carry his point ancl secure a little more by inserting the words ""without reasonable cause."" That would cover not only reasonable expenses but anything else. A thousand and one circumstances might prevent a person from attending. If the words "" without reasonable cause "" were inserted, they would meet the case.",49

366,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"A man might say simply"" I do not want to come,""""and might urge that there was a reasonable cause.",49
367,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown," I suppose that this provision applies only to persons outside the service.

370,Mr CROUCH,Unknown," I would suggest to the Attorney-General that an addition is necessary to this clause. The honourable and learned gentleman is aware that boards have no power to enforce the attendance of any person. I think that to provide a penalty for non-appearance is not sufficient. I have had personal experience before the Public Servioe Board of Victoria, and I know that it has been impossible to bring a man before the board simply because he refused to attend. I suggest that at the end of the clause it would be well to insert the words"" ancl such summons may be enforced by warrant.""",50
371,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member cannot make a man a witness, even when he brings him before the board.",50
372,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"It is very well for the lionorable and learned member to make that statement. I think that the chairman of a board and this commissioner should liave the right to enforce the attendance of any person by - warrant. We give the same power to justices of the peace, and if witnesses wiil not attend they can be fined. If thcy refuse to pay the fine they can be imprisoned. I think that in this case there are far more important things at issue than aro dealt with by mere Â£50 courts.",50
373,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I will consider that point.,50
374,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown, If this clause is not intended to apply to officers of the service it will be just as well to make that clear.,50
375,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,It applies to anj-one so far as witnesses are concerned.,50
376,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Is it not intended to give power to summon persons who are outside the service 1,50
377,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,This includes both.,50
378,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,"I think it should apply to onlj' tliose who are outside the service. Oflicers should be dealt with by regulation. I move That after the word ""expenses"" the words ""such person not being an officer offcheservice"" be inserted.",50
379,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"We would pay officers' expenses if we merely brought ""them as witnesses.",50
380,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,That is a matter for regulation.,50
381,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If c is a matter for regulation. I ask the honourable member for Echuca not to press the amendment. I will consider the effect of it, but it might go a good deal further than the honourable member imagines. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",50
382,Mr ISAACS,Unknown," There is just one matter to which i would bke to call attention. Under this clause any person may be sworn to answer any question, irrespective of whether such answer would incrimina e him or not. In most cases it is usual to provide that a witness is not bound to incriminate himself; or else it is provided, as in the case of the Insolvency Act,, that anj' answer which he gives shall not be used against him. I think this clause is too wide and drastic as it stands, in the absence of such a generally protective system, as is found in most questions of law. Mr THOMSON"" (North Sydney) - I wish to ask the Attorney-General whether it would not be well to recommit this clause 1 So mam? points Jiave been raised in reference to it, that I think it is desirable to adopt the course which I have suggested.",50
383,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I see that I shall have to reconsider this clause. I have three points upon which I have made a note already.,50
384,Mr CONROY,Unknown," I would point out that in regard to the penalty prescribed, sub-clause (3) saj^sHe shall be liable to pay a penalty' not exceeding -Â£20, to be recovered by any officer in any court of competent jurisdiction in the State in which sueh inspection, iuquiry, or investigation is or was conducted. Ifc may occur that a man may be summoned from Kalgoorlie, and that he could show "" reasonable cause "" there veiy well, but if the penalty is to be recovered by an officer here assuming that the inquiry is conducted in Melbourne, he would have to bring all his witnesses .here to show that "" reasonable cause"" existed. How would be to make - the penalty recoverable .in particular district in which the man - reif sides ?",50
385,Mr DUAKIN,Unknown,I will consider that queshead tion.,51
386,Mr ISAACS,Unknown," I suppose - the honourable and :learned .gentleman .observes that it lis only official . or - public docuwhich* ments or writings that a witness is iresponsible quired to.produce. .If-any private person compelled to attend to answer any question, is it advisable to restrict - the production books.merely to official books?

A amendment will be proposed on clause.21. sioner .The form which.I suggested it should .take ment."" was that, upon the recommendation of the commissioner-, the. permanent.head, shall.also report.",51
390,Mr DEAKI N,Unknown,I have an amendment come in before that. Sub-clause (2) verbally amended.,51
391,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"^Before ""the new sub-clause comes on,'.I desire to ask ..the Attorney-General if he has considered the question of the Defence department-in its relation to' the.permanent head as .provided by sub-clause (2). The honourable>and learned gentleman will notice that. it comes i the schedule, and that is^whereil propose subsequently to make a possible amendwould ment. . I can see that if the AttorneyThe General has. decided to keep the Secretary it of the Defence department in the second the schedule, it will - certainly be necessaiy - the-secretary of that department is to be a permanent head, that the permanent shall not be responsible for its general working. Mr i DEAE i N - It is quite true that the general .working ofi the department over the Minister for''Defence .will be rewill differ from the general work? is ing of any other department. It is the Commandant who must necessarily have of - supreme control of the forces as - such. All is'intended here, however, is-that there be shall - be .a person who shall be called the - secretary of'the department, and<-shall have control of its civil business.

Owing to an - unfortunate I have not had an opportunity of fully discussing - ithis. matter with - rhy honorown able colleague, .the Minister'for Defence; but \L put it - to - the honourable ;and learned member Tthat in any case 'this clause - stand asi t does, because there is nothing to dictate as to who. shall be the the head of this branch, and it need not to imply .what he thinks it is intended to imply. .

Mr DEAKIN ; - I doubt whether this be a proper sub-clause to introduce. person who is entitled to require from the permanent head a report as to any oflicer, 1 or upon any ofcher matter that he chooses, is the Minister, or, speaking of Ministers iri their corporate capacity, the Governor General in Council. It is part of the duty of the permanent head to report to his Minister upon any or every inquiry, in regard to the qualification of any officer, and if the commissioner desired such a report, no doubt it would be supplied by the permanent head at the mere request. In the special or extraordinary contingency of the permanent head refusing such a report, then all that the commissioner would havefcodo would be to address himself to the Minister, who would order it to be given, and the permanent head would find it part of his duty to obey. I appreciate the object the honourable and learned member has in view, but I fancy on consideration he will see that it does not fit in with the scheme of management of departments to which we are committed, aud it implies a relation between the commissioner and the permanent head which is not necessazy.",51
392,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"As the Attorneymatter General does not see his way the amendment, and as, if clause 21 is amended afterwards as I suggest, it will be sub-clause quite possible upon some other occasion to lieu insert this proposal, I would ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

In the future it may be. necessary, in the larger States at any rate, to have ths services divided into more than six departments for administrative purposes. The present proposal, I understand, is to make six departments for administrative purposes, and to have a chief officer in each department, which will be in each' case a State. But it may be that the larger States, at any rate, will require to be subdivided, and if the clause is passed without niaking these officers especially referable to States, - it will then meet the contingency.

402,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown," I proproposes pose to invite the attention of the comvest mittee to this sub-clause in order to elicit an expression of opinion as to what are proposed powers, authorities, and duties in which may be prescribed to the chief oflicer of a department in a State, and to suggest word. of caution against investing chief officers or any of them in distant and mote parts of the continent with too great powers, duties, and authorities. A very spicuous illustration occurred only a few days ago of the manner i u which chief officers are disposed to exercise their powers in the absence of the controlling influence the Minister. FroniareportintheMelbourne newspapers of the 14th June, I noticed that a deputation from Western Australia, move him. composed of members of this Parliament, waited upon the Postmaster-General and brought under his attention what appeared to be certain tyrannical conduct on the of the Deputy Posfcmaster-General in Westdone under ern Australia. Availing himself of the absence of a controlling Minister, that officer seemed to have busied himself in a very markable manner in order to dispose certain telegraph operators who belonged to an association in that State for the mutual benefit of telegraph operators.",53
403,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The man is 100 years behind his time.,53
404,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Regardin g these gentlemen as somewhat obnoxious to his rule, the Deputy Postmaster-General seemed to have devised a scheme for separating what, I suppose, he considered a gang, by in the clause. sending them todiiferent and somewhat reAttorney-General mote parts of that State, and the association. Fortunately, it seems to have been brought under the notice of the representatives of Western Australia, and they waited on the Deputy Postmastersumed General, and drew his attention to the fact that tliese men were being penalized by the head of the department, who is to be a chief officer under this Bill. I want to know whether undor the Bill the chief officer perin Western Australia, or, it may be, in some other remote part of the Commonwealth, is to be invested with such autocratic powers as will enable him to tyrannize over oflicers in that"" way. I think it will be as well to put some limit on the powers and authorities which may be conferred on chief be officers either by this Bill or by the perina I am sorry to notice that the honourable and learned member for Corinella to enable the permanent head to powers and authorities in the chief officer, and I would suggest to him the prothe priety of reconsidering that proposal view of the possibility of the delegation of powers of an undesirable a character to such an officer. If there is to be any delegation of powers and authorities, reapart from the delimitations of powers and authorities as given by the Bill, it ought to conbe done by a responsible Minister. I certainly think?-and I suggest for the consideration of the committee-whethe r we ought not to limit the powers of the chief clerk of and not allow him either to suspend an oflicer or to remove him from his appointment.",53
405,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,He cannot re,53
406,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"We want something more than mere responsibility. We want to prevent a scandal such as this. part It is an illustration of what may be bureaucratic or departmental government; and I hope that the committee will not allow a wholesale deleregation of authority to the chief officers, of but will put in a specific limitation.",53
407,Mr MCC AY,Unknown," I think there is a good deal in what the honourable member says, and perhaps the case would be met by striking out the words "" o r as are assigned to him,"" I think it is very desirable that the Government should prescribe by regulation what are the duties of the chief officers, but that will be sufficient without the other and wider provision now I hope the honourable the will see his way to agree thus breaking up to the alteration.",53
408,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I am sorry to say that I cannot. If the duties of the chief officer are to be prescribed, it will probably be asthat they are to be prescribed by regulations which will apply to all chief officers, and that may prevent the very discrimination which it may be desirable to exercise with regard to some of the chief officers. For instance, we may have a chief officer who* is either a veiy old or a very trusted servant whom it may not be desir- able or necessary to keep in check in the same way as a young and impetuous oflicer. Then, again, it might be desirable to allow a cliief officer immediately under your own eye a wider responsibility than one more remote, or under a special combination of circumstances, the positions might be reversed, ancl the oflicer close at hand might requirefcobe specially controlled, whilst the one in a remote locality might allowed a free hand. The words ""or as are assigned "" are intended to allow the exercise of this discretion. It is quite right that we should prescribe the main duties of the principal officers by regulation, but it is necessary that we should have the power to assign to them other duties as occasion may require. If it should happen, for instance, that the Gommonwealth took over the control of any island in the neighbourhood of the continent, it might be that the chief oflicer would require to be clothed with very special authority. What we wish everywhere throughout this measure, if it can be reasonably done, is to allow of. elasticity in connection with the endowment of oflicers with power. It is necessary to know the men to be able to discriminate between one and the other, aud I would ask the honourable member to abandon the idea of striking out the words which it is suggested should be omitted. Referring to the remarks of the honourable member for Bendigo, I would point out that just as the officer referred to by him has been dealt with, so would any oflicer who overstepped his duty be called to account.",53
409,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,If an oflicer is not to be allowed to come to a Member of Parliament and state his grievance how is the matter to be rectified 1,54
410,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Unde r the Bill he can appeal to the head of the department and then to the inspector, who is charged with the special oversi ght of all such questions, and the inspector, who will be witliin the limits of the State, will have an opportunity of investigating the cases as they occur. Consequently the oflicer will have open to him - two channels by which he can reach the Minister, and beyond this there is the channel of the public press by which he can reach even Parliament it self. Whilst honourable members have - called attention to the extent to which powers may be abused, I would point out that abuses are possible everywhere, no matter how the area of authority may be restricted. The commissioner will be able to deal with such cases as that which has been referred to. To attempt to deal with or prevent such abuses of authority by statute would be a mistake.",54
411,Mr ISAACS,Unknown," I think there is a great deal of force in the point which has been put forward, and I would ask the Attorney General to consider whether the words "" as be are assigned"" do not give almost carle blanche. It may be that it would be only necessary to merely assign certain powers in order, to legally clothe the officers with such powers, and I do not think that can be intended.",54
412,Mr DEAKIX,Unknown,Yes .,54
413,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,But there is no sort of limitation here. ' Surely what is meant is that only administrative powers should be conferred upon these oflicers.,54
414,Mr DEAKIX,Unknown,"The permanent hearl cannot, of course, assign to the cliief oflicers duties which do not belong to himself or to the officers..",54
415,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"1 1 seems to me that some qualification ought to be inserted with reference to the powers and duties and authorities with which these oflicials are to be endowed, otherwise it will only be necessary to prescribe any authority, duty, or power, in order to make it legal. The honourable the Attorney-General might, I think, insert the word "" administrative,"" * or a word of similar import.",54
416,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"'We must be very careful in dealing with this measure in order to avoid paralyzing the administration so necessaiy in a large continent like this. Some reference was made by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo to a case where injustice had been done to certain officers. Under this Bill the officers will be bound by the rules of the department, and we shall have a sj'Stem of inspection under which all grievances on the part of subordinates may be made known, but any one who has had .wide experience of administration must know that the work cannot be limited in every detail. We must to some extent trust to the Ministers and to the effect of the powers of the commissioner under this Act to guard against anything outrageous occurring in the way of abuse of the powers I conferred. If. we hamper the Government at the outset it may lead to great trouble in the future.",54
417,Mr HARPER,Unknown," The case mentioned by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo really shows the necessity for passing this measure. Abuses may take place in any of the service and by any officer; but we are now passing a Bill which will bring the officers in every grade under authority, which will ultimately carry them to the commissioner, and if necessary to the responsible Minister. I know nothing of the case which has been mentioned, but it seems to have been one in which there was an unreasonable abuse of power and no doubt the officer will be called to account for it . How much more, however, would he have been called to account if under this measure the aggrieved parties had had an opportunity of appealing to the inspectors and bringing their case right before the commissioner. It seems that the instance quoted by the honourable-and learned member for Bendigo has no relevancy, and I quite agree with the. honourable member for Wentworth, Sir William MCMillan, that we should make the provisions of the Bill as elastic as possible, whilst providing machinery by which any abuse can be deidt with by the commissioner free from political influence, and can where necessary be brought befoie' the responsible Minister.",55
418,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,"I am not familiar with the circumstances of the case mentioned by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, but probably it occurred during the time that the department was in the stage of transition between the State and the Commonwealth and there was no Minister in control of the department.",55
419,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,No ; it was on the l l t h of June.,55
420,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown,"However , we must be can very careful how we weaken the grip of the various officers upon their departments. one who has been a Minister of a department, I know how important it is tain the fullest authority, and post-office is concerned, it is a very peculiar department to work. It has an enormous number of hands and very strict and rigorous discipline must be maintained. The oflicer under this Bill will, no doubt, correspond'with what we call the chief clerk under clause. our departments, and tliere are a number of small matters in connection with the control officers that must be left to these chief We do not want to permit of tyranny, but we must not weaken the control of the more responsible officers over the aflairs of their respective departments.",55
421,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,Unknown," I agree with what has been said in regard to the department Postmaster-General at Perth. That gentleman has had autocratic power in the past, and he has used it to the fullest extent; but I take it that now that the control of the post-office has been transferred to the Commonwealth he will cease to be autocratic. I think that there should be a - commissioner in each of the States.",55
422,Mr DUAKIN,Unknown,The officials who act for the commissioner in the States are termed inspectors in the Bill.,55
423,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"South Australia) I am not quite satisfied with the clause as it stands. It seems to me that the provision which we have made for the control of appointments and transfers by the commissioner and his inspectors may, under this clause, be set aside in favour of the chief officers of the departments.",55
424,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,No ; it is only the commissioner who may do anything of importance.,55

428,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I am considering whether that or some similar word should not be inserted. The power given to the permanent head under the clause is the power to assign certain duties to a particular oflicer.

444,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Northern Melbourne) I have marked this as a clause which may introduce political influence in a manner the House does not want. There are special powers in regard to special divisions. Clause 27 provides that in dealing with the special division there is power, with certain safeguards, to appoint people from outside the service. Supposing pressure were brought to bear on a. Minister to appoint a man, all the Minister would have to do would be, without consulting the House, to. declare that a certain office is hereafter to be deemed held by special officer; and then he might appoint, or he might use the powers contained in clause 27. If the Governor General, which means the Ministry, intend to declare any office or any person as within the special division, it ought to be by resolution of this House, or the other House, or both Houses. We ought not to have to interfere after the act has taken place, but before the act has taken place, and it would be a very strong case before there could be any including of an existing officer in a special division.",56

I move' That in lines 12 and 15fchewords ""on the recommendation of the commissioner"" be inserted after the word "" Governor General."" Amendment agreed to ; clause as amended agreed to. Clause 17The officers in the special division (except in the ease of oflicers paid at a specified rate by virtue of any Act) shall be paid such salaries as may be provided in the Annual Appropriation Act.",57
459,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"In view of what has happened in the last few days is it wise to say that salaries or ""such salaries as may be provided in the annual Appropriation Act "" ? We may have other Appropriation Acts.",57
460,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,We shall have several.,57
461,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I clo not know that we before the provide salaries in them.,57
462,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,We have had one already.,57
463,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That was a special Appropriation Act for a half-year. I am not concerned about the word ""annual."" I move That in line 4 the word "" annual "" be omitted.",57
464,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown, Does the wording of this clause deal with salaries in such a way that Parliament cannot review salaries of the special division?,57
465,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"This clause is intended to put the salaries in a certain sense outside the schedule given at the end. These are the highest oflicers, paid the highest salaries, and are absolutely under the control of Parliament.",57
466,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"But has Parliament the right to review the salaries paid those men, if such review be thought necessaiy?",57
467,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Like all the higher salaries; yes. Amendment agreed to; clause as amended agreed to. Clause 18In the professional division and general division (except in the case of officers paid at a specified rate by virtue of any Act) the officers shall be paid such salaries and wages in accordance with such fixed amounts or scales as may be prescribed.,57
468,Mr CLARKE,Unknown, I notice that in the clerical division the classification has been taken from the report of the Royal commission on this subject in Victoria.,57
469,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,It is the Victorian standard in the Victorian Act.,57
470,Mr CLARKE,Unknown,"I do not think it is an Act, but a report brought in by the Classification Board on the Public Service. I notice that the classification laid down in that document is adopted here without any alteration whatever. I should like to ask the Attorney-General whether it is not possible to adopt a similar classification to that which has been adopted here for the professional division? It seems to me rather objectionable to leave the grading and salaries of professional officers subject to regulations. What is the reason? There may be some cause for it .",57
471,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"On e of the reasons is that it has always been the custom to leave the professional officers to be dealt with in ' a different manner. There is a great difference between State Governments and the Federal Government in regard to the amount of professional employment they. respectively require. So far as we can judge the Commonwealth will need very few - professional officers. Therefore no elaborate classification is required. There may be a few professional officers in connection with the Public Works department and the Attorney-General's department, but beyond this I do not know that they will be required, and it is not necessary to set out a schedule for them. Besides that, there is the difficulty of setting forth the salaries of professional officers. They are not in a grade like clerical men. If you dealt with them as a whole, you would have to provide for such varying cases as a chemist, a land surveyor, a barrister, a civil engineer, and so on. There is no common classification.",57
472,Mr CONROY,Unknown, I tliink advantage might be taken here to furnish a schedule which would provide- - 1,58
473,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,For all professions'?,58
474,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"No , but for an annual increment. Mr DEAKIN. - That conies later on. The honourable member for South Australia,  purpose.",58
475,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"It will be difficult to deal with the matter, I know. I was unaware that an' amendment had been framed. The amendments upon the Bill are larger in bulk than the Bil l itself, and it is difficult to refer to them.",58
476,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"South Australia) I am not so much concerned about the professional division. There is no doubt'that whether we fix a classification in the Bill or whether the subject is left to regulation, the salaries of the professional officers will be adequate. It is the general division that requires to be provided for. There is no getting away from the fact that we are fixing up the classification of the clerical division by Ac t of Parliament, whilst the general division is to be subject to the special needs of the Treasury from year to year. The wages are to be fixed as may be prescribed by regulation and the regulations can be altered by the Government.",58
477,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The regulations are not likely to be altered by any Government.,58
478,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"They have been altered in the States, and it is quite as likely that they will be altered under the Commonwealth. One matter I should like to see provided for in the Bill is that at least the amounts fixed by the wages boards for like employments ought to be paid by the Commonwealth Government. The Government of the Commonwealth ought, at least, to pay as much as is determined by the-wages boards of trades to be paid for similar work in private employment.",58
479,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has a motion on the paper for the purpose of giving an instruction to the Government to that effect.,58
480,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,Will the Government accept the suggestion?,58
481,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I hope so.,58
482,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,We may never reach that motion.,58
483,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I think we shall.,58
484,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"If we want to discuss this subject, now is the time, when we are dealing with the public service in regard to the general division. There are tradesmen in the post-office, concerningwhose trades the wages boards have fixed minimum rates. We have no guaranteetliat the Government will not undermine those rates of wages.",58
485,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I think the honourable member may be perfectly satisfied on that point.,58
486,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,The honourable member can safely trust this democratic Government.,58
487,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Then we might as well trust the Government with regard to the clerical division. The . general division have no safeguard at all. The only reason that prevents my moving an amendment upon the subject is that therates of wages may differ in the various"" States.",58
488,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,There are no wages boards in New South Wales and Queensland.,58
489,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,There will be soon...,58
490,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) There is a great deal in the contention of the honourable member for Soutli Australia. In the State of Victoria we have, in connection with the Railway department, ship caipenters who are engaged in making telegraph poles. They are paid nine shillings a day. Men in the Post and Telegraph department doing similar work for the Commonwealth, are only paid eight shillings a day-and that notwithstanding the fact that the State"" Parliament decided that they should be paid at the same rate in that department as in the Railway department. Perhaps the At torney-General will make a note of that point, and see that these meu are paid the extra shilling a day. I am strongly of opinion that something ought to be done in the direction suggested by the honourable member for Soutli Australia, Mr. Batchelor.",58
491,Mr CONROY,Unknown,What is the name of the honourable member's constituency ?,59
492,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,My - constituency iswherever tliere is a man who needs help.,59
493,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,A very wide one !,59
494,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"""The whole world is my parish.""",59
495,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I hope the Attorney-. General will make a note of the point, and see that the men in this division are paid at any rate the minimum wage arranged for by the wages boards.",59
496,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I will see if it is one of the "" existing accruing rights.""",59
497,Mr TUDOR,Unknown," This is one of the clauses to which I referred on the motion for the second reading. I believe that the men in the general division need to be looked after more than those iri the clerical division. The men who receive the highest salaries are generally in a position to look after themselves. There are men employed as temporary porters in the post-office who .are getting ls. a day less than the minimum for permanent porters, although they are doing the same work.",59
498,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,This is not the temporary employment clause.,59
499,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am pointing out that in the general division it should be fixed that the officers employed should be paid a fair minimum wage. I had an amendment to move similar to that of which the honourable member for Corio has given notice, but I am quite willing that we should take the vote on clause 20. I know there are men who are doing temporary work and who are not being treated as they would be if they were permanent hands. I think those men should have the same measure of justice meted out to them that they would receive if they were in the permanent employ of the department. I know that some men who have returned from South Africa have not received a half holiday since' tliey were temporarily employed; they have not even received any of the gazetted holidays. I think that this matter sliould be looked into when we come to that part of the Bill. I just raise the point, here as it relates to the wage to be paid to officers in the general division. Clause agreed to. Clause 19The clerical division shall be divided into five classes. Each of such classes shall be subdivided as set forth in the third schedule to this Act, and the rate of salary of an officer, whether male or female, in a subdivision of any sueh class shall be that assigned to each subdivision in such schedule for males or females, as the case may be.",59
500,Mr CONROY,Unknown," On the second leading of the Bill I pointed out that if women were doing the work of men tliey ought to receive the same rate of pay. I - think that the schedule ought to be amended in that respect. Of course, if women cannot do the work of men they should, not receive the same rate of - pay, but otherwise I do' not think that they should be subject to' any special disability. I think this is the proper place to mention the matter. If women perform equal duties with men, go through the same examination, are governed by similar regulations, they ought to receive the same remuneration. If they are. not able to understand the duties and to discharge tliem satisfactorily, tliey should not be employed at all. Where they are employed and can do the work equally . well with men I think that no disability should be placed upon them. I ask whether the Attorney-General proposes to retain the schedule exactly as it stands ? Honourable members will see that no woman can reach a salary higher than- Â£ 1 1 0 per annuni without going through a further examination whilst the men can run np to Â£160.",59
501,Mr CROUCH,Unknown," I would point out to the Attorney-General that there is no provision in this Bil l that women who marry shall not continue to be employed. It seems to be a principle adopted in a good many of the State services that as soon as a woman is married she shall give up her position. I agree with the arguments presented to the committee by the honourable member for Werriwa, but if he wishes to attain his object I would suggest that he can do so by striking, out all the words after "" males "" in line 7.",59
502,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I h a v e made some inquiry in regard to the only department of the Commonwealth which, as far as I know, contains female employees, namely, the post-office. Tliere, I am assured by the officers in charge that the salaries as graded when compared with the salaries of men represent the proportion of work done. I observe by the reports in the public press that at a meeting of the executive heads of the post-ofticc the other day it was discussed, if not decided, that in future no employment should be given to telephone operators or other female employees, because it was found that on the whole male labour was more . effective and cheaper even at the higher rate. That being the experience, and seeing that the female employees are paid in proportion on the same scale as the men and that if anything they have the advantage, it does not appear desirable to alter the rates. If the executive officers of that dejjartment carry out tlieir intention, there will be no need for this third schedule at ail.",59
503,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Would not this be the 25roper place to provide for a system of annual increments ? Mr DEAKIN"" - Fo . That will come later on. I will show the honourable member wiiere.",60
504,Mr MCC AY,Unknown," I wish to draw the Attorney-General'sattention to the question of the employmentof female labour. I understand that certain telephone operators who were not good enough for their work have been-allowed to enter the clerical division. Consequently they are eligible to reach a salaiy of Â£110, whilst those who were good enough to be retained in the telephone department can only reach a salary of Â£ 8 4 . It is a remarkable result that persons who fail to do certain work efficiently are eligible to attain to a higher salary than tliose officers who are efficient.  clear under this clause whether officers coming in and receiving salaries other than those specified in the schedule are to have their salaries increased or reduced.",60
505,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The honourable member refers to transferred officers ?,60
506,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Yes .,60
507,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"They bring their salaries with them. Their salaries cannot be reduced, but they may be increased- a very fortunate position for them. If their duties are graded higher they will be paid better; if graded lower they will not be reduced.",60
508,Mr EWING,Unknown," I wish to ask if the words ""whether male or female"" after the word ""officer"" are absolutely necessary? If they pass now, it seems to me that we close the question with regard to the payment of women at the same rate as is paid to men. Mr DEAKIN; - Unless we alter the schedule when we come to it .",60
509,Mr EWING,Unknown,Does the Attorney General mean that by altering one of the . schedules we can bring about uniformity ?,60
510,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Yes ; but I hope the committee will not do it .,60
511,Mr CONROY,Unknown," I beg to moveXhat the words "" whether male or female "" in lines 4 and 5, and the words ""for males or females as the ease may be,"" in lines 7 and 8, be omitted.",60
512,Mr EWING,Unknown,Le t us have the discussion upon it later on ! We have not made up our minds about it yet.,60
513,Mr CONROY,Unknown,If the Attorney-General assures me that it can be dealt with as thoroughly later on I shall be content fco withdraw the amendment.,60
514,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Ye s it can.,60
515,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Under the circumstances I will withdraw the amendment. Amendment withdrawn. Clause agreed to. Clause 20(1) Notwithstanding anythiug contained in this Act the Governor General may from timefcotime fixfcherate of salaryfcobe paid to an officer at any sum within the limits of the class or grade of his office, and such sum shall be the salary attached to such office, and such officer shall not be promoted to a higher salaiy within snob class or grade whilst he holds such office. (2) No order shall be made so as to diminish the rate of salary received by the occupant of any office at the time of making such order. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN ) proposed - That after the-word ""may,"" line 2, the following words be inserted, ""on the recommendation of the commissioner.""",60
516,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Does the honourable member see that we are here proposing to fix the salary definitely ? It is not a case of political favouritism, because it means stopping a man from getting the increase he might otherwise receive.",60
517,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,Northern Melbourne) The purpose of this clause-is to enable the Governor General to fix the rate of salary to be paid to an officer within the maximum and minimum of his class.,60
518,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,He is not to get a higher salary while he. holds such office.,60
519,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"This is a device which has been used in one State to reduce the maximum. There is a carefully prepared schedule which sets out the maximum, and then, when the Government want to retrench they suddenly come upon a man and say""Look here, we will not allow you to go to the maximum j we will stop you at the salary you are getting."" I have never known bhis power to be exercised for any reason other than retrenchment, and ib seems to be a device which enables a Ministry to reduce a maximum which has been fixed by Parliament or by the authority of Parliament. I desire to ask the Minister"" in charge of the Bill whether, after his eighteen years' experience of the Victorian Act, he has found this power to be necessary or useful. I have known it to be exercised frequently, but never justly. Either the scale is wrong, in which case the whole scale should be revised; or else the scale is right, in which 'case the man ought to have his salaiy fixed. Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN""-What case in which it would occur 1",60
520,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,I do not know. The only case in which I have known the power to be used was a case where a Ministry wanted to retrench.,61
521,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,To stop an automatic advance.,61
522,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,Yes . done the office should be reclassified or readjusted to meet the circumstances.,61
523,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,It ought to be clone on a plan.,61
524,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Yes . Honourable members will observe that it is not the fixing of an office, but an officer at a certain scale, ancl it comes as an injustice to an oflicer to be told- "" You personally are to have your increments stopped."" I feel that although it is extremely important to try and get the best men we can, and to give bhem the besb salaries, wibh the great body of the service there is nothing breeds so much contentment as to be able to look forward to steady increments.",61
525,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That is the case either in or out of the service.,61
526,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Yes , we all like increments.",61
527,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,This Bill does not provide for .automatic increments.,61
528,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"It provides for grades. Clause 20 refers to the general as well as the clerical division, and the general division may be paid salaries and wages on such scales as may be prescribed. I apprehend that these scales will be with increments.",61
529,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Does the honourable and learned member refer to the scale at the end of the Bill 1,61
530,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,Yes .,61
531,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"There are increments, but not increments to be payable by mere lapse of time. They are to be payable on recommendation.",61
532,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,Is that meant to apply mainly to the clerical division ?,61
533,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Mainly .,61
534,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,I do not know why there should not be steady increments from time to time.,61
535,Mr FULLER,Unknown,If the person deserves them.,61
536,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Yes ; as a man gets up in j'ears he ought to be able, by his care and attention to duty, to look forward to an inis the crease of salary, ancl I would ask the Minister whether he feels this clause to be essential at all.",61
537,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I promise the honourable and learned member that I will make more inquiry into this matter than I have hitherto done. We find the clause in the Victorian statute, and, I think, in another If it is to be statute. The necessity of the clause is that there are positions in the clerical and other divisions the duties of which are worth no more than a certain remuneration, no matter who holds them.",61
538,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown,In Victoria the provision is often exercised in regard to counbry post-offices.,61
539,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It is thought that whoever holds such a position, the duties attaching will never be worth more than a certain amount, and consequently for all time the salary is fixed ab that amount.",61
540,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"""The salary for the officer, that is, for the person, is fixed. There might be some force in it if it applied to the office.",61
541,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"There are in Victoria, for instance-and there may yet be cases under this Bill-increment s which become due to officers, even if you fix them in a certain office. There are the long-service increments, for example, which fallin to them hy mere lapse of time. It occurs, I believe, in the post-office, as the honourable member for Gippsland, who has considerable knowledge of that deparbmenb, has said. This provision is frequenbly in use bhere. Ib was commended bo me by the draftsman of this Bill, who has had great experience I in the public service, as being desirable. Bufc points have been raised which require more knowledge, and I will inquire whether it is desirable to retain the clause in its present form. I would ask the honourable member for Wentworth whether, having noted that this clause is intended to stop all advances, he thinks it is necessary to press his amendment """,61
542,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"I do not how that can affect the question at all, if we take up the general principle that everything should be done on the recommendation of the commissioner.",62
543,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I would point out to the Attorney-General that in the Bill power to fix the rate of salary is given to the Governor General. In the Victorian Act it is done on the recommendation of the Public Service Board.,62
544,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Yes , I see that is so, and it supports the view of the honourable member for Wentworth.",62
545,Mr THOMSON,Unknown," A I understand this clause, it is intended to stop automatic increases.",62
546,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,An y increase.,62
547,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"Where is the necesable sity for the clause if the grading is to done yearly by the commissioner without giving increases unless the commissioner sees fit. I could quite understand the adoption the power in the Victorian Act, because one time there was a provision in the torian Act for annua] automatic increases, no matter whether the office was changed or not. Tliere was in the Victorian service an annual increase when a man got into a class, and therefore a provision of that sort was necessary to stop undue inflation of salaries throughout the service. There no such provision in this Bill.",62
548,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Not so far as the clerical division is concerned - It may be in the general division, but that is not very proMelbourne, bable.",62
549,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,It has not been proif vided so far.,62
550,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,No .,62
551,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"Then I do not see to the necessity for the clause, which simply enables the commissioner and the Governorwhile General'to do what the other provisions the Bill enable them to do.",62
552,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I will look into that point, too.",62
553,Mr CLARKE,Unknown," This clause may be used in a manner which would fall very unjustly upon postal officials in remote parts of the Commonwealth. It often happens by a mere accident, and by the turn of the tide in the public service, that a very efficient officer is sent to an - outof-the-way office where the revenue derived is low. The practice has been in the public service of New South Wales to grade the salary of that particular officer see according to the revenue derived from the office, and I have known officers, who have been 20 ancl 25 years in the service, to receive the munificent salary of Â£ 9 0 a year. Mr ' DEAKIN - In what department?",62
554,Mr CLARKE,Unknown,"In the Postal department. All the representations which have been made have been ineffectual in getting justice for these oflicers. I think, without actually condemning this clause, it might possibly be turned in the direction of doing a very serious injustice to a large number of very deserving public servants.",62
555,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,But if the duties of the s office are only worth that amount 1,62
556,Mr CLARKE,Unknown,"I know it is hard to frame a clause which will meet every case; but what. I want to impress on the honour and learned gentleman is that the be policy of the adrninistration should be to give those who are efficient, and who have been a certain time in the service offices of which will be commensurate with the at salaries they are capable of earning. That Vicis the policy which I would like to see adopted throughout the Commonwealth in its postal service. It has not been adopted, I am sorry to say, in New South Wales, and officers of particular merit and efficiency have been allowed to vegetate, as it were, in out-of-the-way offices. That, I hope, will is not be continued under the Commonwealth.",62
557,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"South Australia) AVith regard to the remarks made by the honourable and learned member for Northern I think, on the whole, it will be more in the interests of the service we leave the clause as it is. The object, of course, is to prevent in some cases automatic increases, as fixed by the schedule the Bill, or as fixed by regulation. It would applyfcoeitlier case. Veiy frequently, it is a veiy good thing to give a man of an increase on entering another class, of say Â£ 1 0 or Â£20, it is not good enough to give him an annual increase of Â£ 1 0 for five years. If we were to take this power from the Governor General it would tell very often against an officer who, otherwise, would be considered entitled to an increase, but to whom we were not prepared to give a number of increases. I know that there are in connection with the post-office some positions which, apart from the salaries drawn, are more desirable than others; and, in some cases, officers are removed to particular offices without annual increase - That is somewhat frequent at any rate in South Australia and, unless the Governor General had the power to clo that, the officer certainly would not be appointed.",62
558,Mr DEAKIX,Unknown,"I am going to consider that, Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Mr DEAKIX ) agreed toThat the words, ""time to time,"" be omitted.",63
559,Mr CROUCH,Unknown," I m o v e That sub-clause (1) be amended by the .addition oÂ£ the following words :- "" Provided always no person who has served for seven j'ears in division of the public service, and who attained the age of twenty-one j'ears, shall paid a lower salaiy than one hundred and pounds per annum."" The reason why I move this amendment i clause 20 instead of clause 18 some discussion took place as to the wages of the men in the general division, is want it to apply, not only to the general division but also to the clerical division. therefore adopt any arguments which have been used on clause 18 in favour of my amendment. I think the argument which to has been used by the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, that the general division needs special protection, applies very pertinently here, because there is no doubt that it will only be the. general, division which will need this That is why I want to go further than the new clause which is proposed by the does Attorney General, and in which he applies his proposition, that a salary of Â£ 1 is to be paid to any man over 21, who to the fifth class in the clerical division too. events. As we have been voting very generous salaries lately, and as I supported the Government in their action, now that we of bave come to a proposal which will apply to the more poorly-paid class in the public service, I think it is about time that we applied to them the minimum wage which has become so common throughout and which I think we ought to welcome. The Government which insists on outside but a minimum. employers paying a minimum wage, should also pay a minimum wage. I do not think is an unreasonable provision that when man has served for seven years, and has attained the age of 21, when it is about time he was setting up in life, he should not be paid less than Â£ 2 per week. That is the lowest wage that is paid under a good many of the wages boards-Â£ 2 2s., Â£ 2 10s., and Â£ 2 ISs. is a common wage. I think the honourable member for Yarra is really surprised at my moderation.. I hope that my amendment will be accepted. I would prefer it to the proposal of the Attorney General, who only offers to give Â£ 1 0 0 per annum. Mr DEAKIX:-Tlia t is the amount fixed in the schedule.",63
560,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"But the honourable and learned gentleman makes it a condition that a person, in order to get a salary of Â£100 in that addition to being 21 years of age, must pass any the prescribed examination and show-that he has is capable of doing theworkof the office be to which he is attached. That, I think, is four an unnecessary condition to impose. Every man who is 21 years of age ought to be n worth Â£ 2 a week after he has served the or 19 where State for seven years.  that I rise to ask the honourable and leai-ned member for Corio to apply his amendment I only to the general division by substituting the word "" general "" for the word "" any,"" and also to consider whether-it is necessary have a term of seven years' service in addition to attaining the age of 21 years. I can imagine a number of cases in. the general division where a man may be 40 years of age when he is taken on, and yet he will have to work seven years before He is entitled protection. to get this concession.",63
561,Mr DEAKIX,Unknown,"This gives it to him if he not get it otherwise,- but if hegets it in the ordinary class or division it does not 0 0 apply. This applies only to cases of men do not get it in the natural course of  the condition that a man shall be 21 years age is sufficient protection, and, if the honourable and learned member for Corio. will agree to apply hisamendmenttothegeneraldivision only, I shall be very pleased to support him. I am not prepared to accept this as the maxiAustralia,- mum wage at that age.",63
562,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"This is not a maximum,  it increases to go up to something more than a Â£104 per annum, in the clerical division at all events, aud, as honourable members will see, notice is given of an amendment in the next clause, which will have the effect of increasing the rate of pay for the clerical division.",63
563,Mr CBOUCH,Unknown,"The two amendments are not at all inconsistent.  Â£104 being a sufficient recompense for the duties discharged in the clerical division seven years of service, and I would ask the honourable member to alter this amendment to make it apply to the general division only.",64

568,Mr TUDOR,Unknown," I think seven years is too long, and that five years would be ample. Furthermore, I think the amount of Â£10 4 should be increased to Â£ 1 1 0 per year, as the latter amount provides 7s. per clay, which is - the general wage for labourers, outside the Government service. I believe that will be little enough to pay to the Commonwealth labourers. I hope the amendment will be carried, but I ' w o u l d prefer to see it applied to the general division only.",64
569,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown," I think the object of the honourable mover of the amendment would be better met by the - insertion of the word "" o r "" in place of the word "" and"" in the third line. I would . also suggest that whilst Â£ 2 per week would perhaps be a reasonable rate of wages in Melbourne or some other parts of the Commonwealth, there are places where it would be a starvation rate. Mr TUDOH;-That is provided for in clause 71.",64
570,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,"I think there should be added the words ""exclusive of any allowance that may be paid under subclause (/ ) of clause 71."" That sub-clause provides for the payment of special allowances to those who are living in the tropical districts or in out-of-the-way localities, and it might be well to make it clear that the Â£ 2 does not include any allowances.",64
571,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown," I tliink it would have been better if the after honourable member had moved the amendment as an addition to clause IS, or had proposed it as a new clause altogether, because clause 20 deals with officers whose salaries are fixed, ancl the addition now proposed will be construed to apply only to those officers. I will, however, support the honourable member on the distinct understanding that' the amount be increased to Â£110, ancl that the term of service be decreased to five years. I think that for a grown man the minimum wage of 7s. per clay as fixed in New South Wales is certainly not too mucli for the Commonwealth to pay. If a full grown man is not worth that pay he ought not to be in the Commonwealth service. As far as the clerical division is concerned, we are going to fix the salaries in the schedule, and this new provision should be restricted to the general division only.",64
572,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,I will ask the committee to consent to an amendment making the provision apply to the general division only.,64
573,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I had anticipated that my honourable colleague, the Minister for Home Af&irs, would have been here to take charge of this Bill to-night, .and presumed that he would have been able to furnish the committee with particulars as to the probable effect of accepting an amendment of this kind - Looking at the matter in the light of the general statements that have been made, it appears to be a fair and reasonable proposal, and one which I hope the Government will be able to accept when the. honourable and learned member has altered its expression. But whilst we may be prepared to adopt this proposal as a statement of the obligation that the Commonwealth should infcur with regard to its servants in all divisions, we would not like to do that until we have ascertained what it will mean in pounds shillings and pence. It will be necessary to ask the Customs and the Post-office, which are the two employing departments at present,to make statements as to the effects of this new provision. I dare say honourable members will urge that, irrespective of the amount involved, the proposal is of a nature that ought to commend itself, and I am not prepared to dispute that. But beforethe Government takes this step they ought to know what effect it will have upon the existing departments. In addition to that, the honourable member will notice that the provision as drawn embraces both sexes, and that it would have an unintended operation in regard to one of the departments. If it is intended, to embrace both sexes the matter will need special consideration and inquiry as to the cost that would be involved, because it would certainly necessitate an alteration of some of the rates of pay now ruling for those who are serving in the Post-office. The feeling of the committee appears to be that it may be well to separate the provisions with regard to the general and clerical divisions by making provision for a minimum wage in the general division and for a minimum salaiy in the clerical division, and no doubt that course has its advantages. ""What I propose, therefore, is that the honourable and learned member should reconsider his proposal and bring it forward later on as a new clause. By that time .I shall be prepared to lay iipon the table full information as to the probable effect of including women, of stopping at a five years', at a seven years', and at a ten years' period, and of making the minimum wage Â£ 1 0 4 or Â£ 1 1 0 ; so that the committee will know to what extent ' any determination that they may come to will cause us to draw upon the public purse. The question to which the honourable and learned member for Corio has referred is of great importance, and must be settled before the Bill leaves this Chamber; but I suggest to him that its consideration' had better be postponed until we can obtain more precise information. I think, too, that the matter would be dealt with better in a separate clause, which clearly and expressly provided for each of the divisions which it is intended to except. We must also decide whether females should or should not be included.",64

578,Mr THOMSON,Unknown," The firstsub-clause of this clause provides that appointments to the clerical division are to be made to the lowest grade. That would be all right if all the departments with which we have to deal were fully established departments, with as large a staff as they are likely to require for some time to come; but some of these departments are hardly yet in existence, and, as the Attorney-General has suggested, will in a short time be considerably larger than they are now. The department of External Affairs may require an increase in clerical assistance; the Attorney General's department, when the High Court is established, may have to be increased ; and so too may the departments of the Treasurer and the Minister for Home Affairs. It may be necessary to appoint clerks of some experience to those departments, which are not transferred departments, and I wish.to know if anj' provision is made for that.",66

If the amendment of the honourable member for Wentworth be carried, the commissioner will be substituted for the permanent head. I have prepared this proviso to meet the case of an officer who does anything rendering him undeserving of the automatic increase. What I really want to provide is that in the lower grades of the service the annual increments shall go on irrespective of the officers having to look to or askany particular head of a branch. I am prepared to admit that in the higher grades, where the brain begins to tell, and where there be necessity to go outside and pick men, the increments may be regulated as circumstances demand. But it is to the interests of the service, and of those in the service that increments up to a living wage should be secured, .and such a provision would give a great deal more confidence to tliose entering the service. I , therefore, move That, in Sub-clause (2), line 6, the words so recommended by the permanent head"" te struck out.

588,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I would suggest to The the honourable member for South Australia,  honourable member for Wentworth, he might alter his amendment to the effect that the words "" if so recommended by the"" be omitted. The question which the honourable member for Wentworth desires to deal with could then be afterwards determined.'  my case. I would be just in the same difficulty.",67
589,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"The honourable member for South Australia, Mr. Poynton, desires to test the question, and he can do thatby altering his amendment in the manner suggested by the Chairman. If the amendment be carried then the other words would go out afterwards.  suggestion made, and by leave amend my amendment. Amendment amended accordingly. Mr - DEAKIN - This amendment brings us face to face with the question whether tfie stimulus of increments to be won only by good conduct and to be given, on the recommendation of the superior officer, is to be displaced by automatic increases unless the conduct of the officer has been of such a serious. cliaracter as to lead to his superior to take the responsibility of deliberately reconimending that he shall not be so advanced. The difference is not great, perhaps, in its final effect on the Treasury in regard to the payments made. The increment does not come out of the pockets of the head of the department or the chief ""officer of the branch, who makes the recommendation - and the general tendency of all those officers is to deal in such matters most liberally with subordinates. I do not tliink we. need apprehend any undue severity of treatment on tlieir part to those placed under them. On the other hand, if we put"" them in the position that every man is legally entitled to receive certain . annual incre"" if ments, except for the interference of his superior officer, we cast on that officer the responsibility of apparently inflicting a direct and severe penalty ou a man whom he may not wish to punish. Misbehaviour is rare, I believe, in all branches of the public service, and not less rareamong the poorly paid than amongst the highly paid oflicers. What we have to contend against is not absolute misbehaviour. It is inertness, stolidity, indifference; it is the mechanical discharge of duties. Many of us must have had the opportunity of seeing men of' evidently f u ll average ability perfectly content in a public office to discharge the simple docketing of documents and duties of that sort; and so mechanical do some become that if the least change be made, and a document comes before them in an unaccustomed shape, they appear to be utterly at a loss what to do. They seem incapable of adapting themselves to the smallest changes in their environment. It is because that is the besetting sin, so to speak, of all branches of the public service, that this Bil l has been shaped throughout on the principle of recognising good work, by leaving it to the man himself-by application, to duty, and by his energy-to merit all the advances he gains. The difference between the honourable member and ourselves is not great in point of the total payments which have to be made, but it may be considerable in regard to its effect upon the morale of the service. It would be desirable, instead of putting the burden of responsibility on the oflicer of forcing him to take an action which appears to penalize a well-meaning man, that all the servants of the Commonwealth should realise that increments and advancement are to be obtained by good conduct and devotion - to duty. I recognise, of course, that there is one difficulty which the honourable member, if he has not directly called attention to it, has in mind, and this is that under the circumstances of the public service a congestion may take rjlace which prevents promotion. A man is perhaps fit for promotion and has been long enough in the service to have obtained it in the ordinary course. He has the capacity to attain it , but the opportunity has not come to him. For those men it seems to me to be reasonable to ask that they should have an opportunity of proving their fitness to earn a living wage, - or that, at all events, there should be some recognition of their merit, in spite of the fact that the chance of [99] ' attaining promotion' has not come to them.",67
590,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"Eve n if they do prove their fitness, they are still at the mercy of the permanent head.",68
591,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The permanent head would only interfere in exceptional cases. There would have to be more than failure. There would have to be some positive shortcoming on the part of the oflicer.,68
592,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,It may be a matter of favouritism.,68
593,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That would not stop the promotion to which I am referring. What I am speaking of is the amendment which honourable members will see in print before them, and which provides thatAnj' oflicer in the fifth class of the clerical division shall be entitled, upon reaching the age of 21 j'ears, to a salary of Â£100 per annum, provided he has served for a period of one j'ear in such division, and shows bj' passing the prescribed examination that he is capable of doing the work of an office to which the salaiy of that amount is attached.",68
594,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Mak e it Â£ 1 0 4 .,68
595,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I take the amount of Â£100 because that is the amount for the f if t h class of the third division. Every civil servant reaching the age of 21 years is entitled to earn Â£100 a year, provided he has serve 1 for one year in such division and shows his fitness to discharge the work of an office to which that salaiy is attached. I shall move that amendment as a new sub-clause to clause 21. By this means we shall meet many of the cases which the honourable member  mind when he moved his set of amendments. It enables us to give all the men who show that they are worth Â£100 a year, that salary, even though we"" are not able to allot to them duties up to that value. All that we require is that tliey shall show that they are capable of doing the duties of a man earning Â£ 1 0 0 a year, and then they may draw that salary whether they occupy the office or not. This really means that every man of any ability and energy may earn Â£ 1 0 0 a year, because the examination is not hard, and is not of a scholastic character, but concerns only a. knowledge of the actual duties required; and very little is required from a man in the 'civil service who receives Â£ 1 0 0 a year.' Provided they show their fitness in that, respect, they are to be removed to the tliird subdivision, whether tliey discharge the duties of an office in that subdivision or not. I put it that this is a. recognition of the cases the honourable member for South  It is better to compel men to show their fitness than simply to say that directly tliey enter the magic door of the public service, without any merit on their part, and without giving evidence of any special fitness, fchey are to be forced up automatically to the salary of Â£ 1 6 0  wage.",68
596,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,A man can get a living wage if he will only apply himself to his duties.,69
597,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown,But should there be any man in the service who is not fit to earn a l i ving wage ?,69
598,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"How can we turn such a man out of the service? not do it under this Bill. Avithout regard to his individual ability, so long as he displays the average energy and push that are required in the performance of duties, can go up to Â£ 1 6 0 as a matter of course. ",69

601,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It is not imperative. We cannot moke it imperative without favouring the veiy sluggards of whom I am speaking, and giving them an advantage without their taking the trouble to deserve it . They can easily attain to the liigher salaiy, and they ought to. I want to see them get it . difference in money is not great; but the proposal of the honourable member deprives the active man of every stimulus ancl depresses the man of personal ambition. I desire to see no man in the public service earning less than Â£ 1 0 0 a year, but I clo not want the increases up to that amount to come absolutely automatically and to be attained witnout any effort. The next amendment hangs upon this, and"" shows why I have made the term so comparatively short, a single year's service, before a person can earn Â£ 1 0 0 a year. That does not necessarily apply to lads who enter the service early at Â£ 4 0 or Â£ 5 0 a 3'ear, although it may even apptyfcothem. If honourable nienibers will read the next sub-clause they will see the provision we make, which we got from New South Wales, for encouraging the members of the general division, to study and qualify themselves for the clerical divisions - the .tests for which are little enough indeed. We provide that the Governor General in Council may declare the number of vacancies in the 5th class of the clerical division each .year, and these vacancies are to ' be filled by the successful candidates at a competitive examination. The men of that division will compete among themselves to win these vacancies in the clerical division, in which after a single year they may obtain Â£100 per We can- annum. We encourage them to study and Every man, qualify themselves for the clerical division, and tliey may attain to the salary of Â£160 a j'ear as fast as they deserve it. Therefore, I tliink the honourable mem must recognise that we have endeavoured to meet him in this matter as far as possible witliout impairing discipline, ancl . without further increasing the deadening influences which surround the public service. We have made a substantial advance to meet the honourable member, and I hope. lie will see his waj' to accept the proposition, or to accept it with some addition which would enable the public servant to earn liis increments for liimself, ancl not to have them put upon him by the mere operation of a schedule. I take it that this is injurious to the future of the public servant himself, ancl also fco the State which lie serves. It leads to the common reproach against public servants,, that tliej' are men who in the absence of all The stimulus to exertion drop into the jog-trot pace with which we are all familiar, and that they are worth very little more than the lowest amount paid to men who will not exert themselves. If they will exert themselves we want them to go on until they reach .Â£160 a year.",69

603,Mr EWING,Unknown," The honourable member for South Australia, Mr. Poynton, I take it, wishes to make perfectly clear that the intention of Parliament. is that , if men entering the service prove themselves fit for promotion, that promotion will follow as a matter of course. That is to say, the needs of the State or the parsimony which a Treasurer desires to exercise, shall not be permitted to prevent them from obtaining that reasonable increase of salary which the honourable member believes it to be the intention of Parliament that they shall get. I would like to ask the Attorney-General Avhether he is not Avilling to concede that these automatic increases shall be given unless they are vetoed by the permanent head ? That would make the intention of Parliament quite clear.",69
604,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That is coming very close to the proposal of the honourable mem proposes that sub-clauses (2) and (4) maybe suspended upon the recommendation of the permanent head.,70
605,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I think the Attorney General will see that what I have suggested Avill meet the case. It makes the intention of Parliament quite clear, and I think Ave are quite justified in saying that it will""not alter the spirit of the Bill. Will the honourable member for South Australia, Mr. Poynton, agree to that course? Is lie willing that oflicers in the loAver grades shall get automatic increases unless they are A'etoed by the permanent head ? ",70
606,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown," It seems to me that Ave must be Aery careful in dealing Will this matter. We want to make the public service as efficient as any other service in the country.

If'tliese inen are efficient, the rise in six years, provided for under this Bill, is certainly fair one.  efiiciency; it is a question of the instrucoflicials tions of the Treasurer very often.",70
607,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"I do not know that that is so. We appoint this commissioner for the whole of the sergeneral servioe, ancl I think Ave shall always find neglected. that those Avho are in positions of authorhonorable ity are only too glad to add Â£ 1 0 , Â£ 2 0 Â£30 a year to the salaries of lads in lower grades of the service, I do not think there is the slightest chance of any injustice being doue.

Therefore, Avhilst I sympathize Will the aims of the honourable member for South Australia,  that in A'ieAv of the fossilizing influence of the civil service, Ave shall be striking a blow at these youngsters themselves by taking away this incentive and stimulus to exertion. I must, as a matter of principle, agree Will the Attorney-General.",70
608,Mr WILKS,Unknown," The arguments used by the Attorney-General, in my opinion, simply support the action of the honourable member for South Australia, Mr . Poynton. The Attorney-General first of all argued that it Avas necessary to provide a stimulus to exertion, and immediately afterwards stated that the work for which these oflicers are engaged is merely mechanical.",70
609,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No , I said it may be done mechanically.",70
610,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The remarks made by the honourable member for Wentworth may possibly apply to the higher grades of the service, but I clo not think they can apply to the lower. The Attorney-General said that these officers could not receive an increase unless tliey deserved it j but he could not that if they did deserve it, they would get it. The Attorney-General said that no scholastic examination Avas required. The grade itself, it seems to me, specifies the class of officer that is required. In ansAver 1 in the Attorney-General said that no commissioner or head of a department wonld as allow the loAver portions of the service to be a neglected. But I AVOUICI point out that in the grading of the New South Wales public of service it has been found that the highest have received great increments,. Avhilst the loAver grades haA'e been studiously neglected. At the present moment there is a great outcry in that State because the division of the serA'ice has been I thoroughly agree with the member for South Australia, Mr, , aud Poynton, Avhen he says that if , Ave allow the the commissioner to recommend, seeing that no examination can be applied to this class according to the admission of the Attorney General, it Avill be tantamount to the recomthat mendation of some interested party. That to my mind will open the door to the Sycophants in the general division being recommended by the various heads of departments. The great argument of the honourable member for South Australia was that even the maximum salary was so small that after six yearsof service without a break a man ought to be able to command that salaiy. The inertiest can be discharged.",70
611,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,We cannot discharge him. AVe have taken him for better or worse.,71
612,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"This clause imposes work - on the commissioner and inspectors of - Such a character that most of their time will be occupied in examining officers and bestowing close attention upon the various qualities exhibited by those officers. Thus we shall find that the highly paid commissioner and inspectors will have most of their time absorbed in inquiring into the merits of the officers of the general division, when as a matter of economy they would be better employed in looking after the higher grades of the service which carry the higher salaries. The evils presented by automatic increases are not nearly so great as would otherwise occur.",71
613,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown," It seems to me that the Attorney-General is aiming at one thing and that the honourable member  at another. I quite agree with the Attorney General that there should be some incentive for meritorious conduct; that men in the service should endeavour by the exercise of their abilities to get into positions which - cany with them sometimes a higher rate of pay than that previously received by them. On the other hand, I also agree with the honourable member for South Australia that there ought to be a provision whereby those who reach a certain age in the service would be able to receive something like the minimum rate of wage. I do not see any pro vision in this Bill whereby a person coming into the clerical division, on arriving at manhood's years, and being found incapable of carrying out the duties which properly belong to that division, might be transferred to the general division, so that he - would receive a wage commensurate with his years. The proposal made by the honourable member  give such a man, even although he goes into the general division, sufficient to live on. What is required is that there should be power of transfer from the clerical to the general division so that a man might get a wage according to the work he is fit to discliarge. The fault of the Attorney-General's proposal is that whilst it provides for a salary of Â£ 1 0 0 per annuni after a man has reached the age of 21, there are two provisos attached to it . The first is that the man has to ser.ve a certain time in the division, which is very proper, and the second is that lie must show by examination that he is capable of doing the work to which the salary of Â£ 1 0 0 per annum is attached. He may never be able to show that lie is capable of doing that work. It may be that the man is only a labourer. In such a case there should be a provision whereby a labourer might be transferred to the labourers' department and get the wages attaching to that particular department. It therefore appears to me that there is a conflict of aim between the Attorney-General and the honourable member for South Aus of them, and I should like some suggestion to be made by the Attorney-General so as to overcome the difficulty. In the event of no such suggestion being brought forward, I shall feel myself bound to support the lionorable member for South Australia, because I do not think we are entitled to ask a man to remain for years in the service at Â£ 6 0 or Â£ 7 0 per annum. Something like reasonable remuneration should be given. Perhaps the Attorney-General may be able to suggest a way out, either hy making provision for a transfer to the general division in such a case or by some other arrangement by which men may get the minimum wage, and not be kept at Â£ 6 0 or Â£ 8 0 per annum. In regard to the third point, as to whether the permanent head should recommend or have the right of veto, I think the suggestion made by the honourable member for Richmond is the correct one. I therefore put forward the suggestion that there should be some right of transfer providing for payment of a minimum rate of wage.",71
614,Mr SOLMON,Unknown," I do not, desire to discuss sub-clause (2), but I should like to see an amendment in sub-clause (1). After the words "" clerical division,"" lines 1 and 2, I think we should insert the words "".except those",71
615,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. I understand, Mr Chairman, - a subsequent Amendment has been moved. If so we cannot go back.",71
616,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I am not .moving an amendment; I am simply making & suggestion. However, I will not press the matter. Mr TUDOR. (Yarra) - I sympathize with the proposal made by the honourable  and I believe, with the honourable member for Richmond, that we should provide for veto rather than for recommendation. It has been said that it is just as well that merit should be taken into consideration in granting increases. We know that in Victoria men receiving Â£ 6 0 per annum are often called upon to relieve officers who are. in receipt of a salary of Â£ 2 00 per annum. If the lower paid man has the ability to do the some work as that for which the person relieved receives Â£ 2 0 0 per annum, he should at any rate be granted an increase. The honourable member for Dalley has stated that the Public Service .Board of New South Wales have brought in recommendations in regard to the higher paid officers of the department, but have left the lower paid branches) severely alone. That is the case in Victoria. Under the Publio Service Re-, classification Act,.which was to provide for the transferred services, .the poorly paid officials have beeu entirely neglected. We are told that the Public Service Board are ''inquiring into it . "" . On the otber hand, the higher paid omcers have received their increases months ago. No doubt the Public Service Board will keep on inquiring, unless they receive some reminder from this House. I desire to see an amendment provided that a liberal wage shall bo paid to auy man 21 years of age and upwards, and I agree that provision should be made for a man who is not f it to do certain work to be transferred to another department. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON (South Australia) - My disposition is to support the lionorable member for South Australia,  support the Attorney-General if he can give me an assurance that a meritorious member of the service will have his salaiy increased from the time that he enters the service until he has reached Â£ 1 6 0 per annum. I suppose the Attorney-General cannot give me that assurance. If it is impossible to do so, then it seems to me that the only course open to one is to support the proposition of the honourable member for South Australia. It is all very well to say that civil servants of merit will always receive justice.",72
617,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I did not say that. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON - No , but it is hardly fair to assume that that will be the case.' Possibly I ought not to indicate the State in which it has occurred, but T remember distinctly an instance where two men, one getting 30s. per week and the other Â£ 3 5 0 per annum, were actually doing the'same work side by side.",72
618,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That has happened elsewhere. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON - In this Bill we should do all in our power to p r e vent anything of that sort occurring in the Commonwealth service.,72
619,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown," I desire to support the amendment moved by the honor- able member for South Australia. It seems, to me that if a man is not. f it to receive advancement, he Ls not fit to be in the public service, and that. advancement should be given to members of the service until they have reached a living wage. Tho Attorney-General has spoken about men becoming inefficient through inertness and apathy as the outcome of - automatic increases. If members of the service become either indifferent or inert, they can be dealt with under clause'40 of this Bill. That clause provides that if any officer is found guilty of a breach of the provisions of the Act, or any regulations thereunder, or' is guilty of being, inefficient or incom-petent, and such inefficiency or incompetency appears to arise from causes within, his own control, then for any of these offences he may be punished by fine, temporarily suspended, or altogether removed from office.. In my opinion that is a sufficient safeguard. against members of the public service falling into the condition to which the Attorney General has referred. I trust that this amendment by the honourable member for South Australia-will be carried, because although some of the work to be done by officers in the lower grade of the service may be of a mechanical nature, it is nevertheless very useful, and these officers should receive a living wage.",72
620,Sir WILLIAM,Unknown," If the Attorney-General intends to go on with this clause I think he should take the suggestion of the member for Richmond. It might be put in this way-iUnless otherwise recommended by the commissioner, putting ill the commissioner instead of the permanent head.",72
621,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I am afraid that even that is a departure from the mafcim which I hope the committee will yet see its way to endorse,73
622,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,I am not comfor initting myself.,73
623,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That all these increments, even in the fifth class, shall be the reward of. good work done, and shall be held out as a recognition of that good work. What I feel, however, is of course that a new light has been thrown on this question by the acquiescence of both sidesin which I understand the honourable mem moved the amendment, concurs-that it will be a just thing to provide that those members of the clerical division who are absolutely of the immovable character-the utterly' unprogressive-wh o will not use their abilities to justify their advancement, may be re-transferred to the general --division, in which more work will be found for their muscles and less for their minds. W it h the possibility in view of weeding out the absolutely unprogressive, we might .be able to do something more than is - 'here proposed for those who remain, and ' who ai'e progressive,' if the chances of - promotion do not come directly in their way. At the present moment I do not quite - see my way to give the undertaking which Sir Langdon Bonython desires. But I agree with him that he laid his finger on the direction in which a solution of this difficulty may be discovered, acceptable to all of us. What he ostked for was a guarantee that the meritorious and deserving public - servant should got his increment, that he - should not be dependent on the circumstances of the Treasurer of the day, but ""that whether promotion came in his way or not, until he reached the top of the fifth class, he should be able to advance by steady ' stages 8,0 long as he was worthy of those ' advances. While I was not able to give that direct assurance, because, as I need scarcely tell him, an assurance of mine would not be binding unless it were embodied in the Act, I have been endeavouring to think out at the table a means by which expression might be given to that 'idea, in some practical form. Under the circumstances, and in view of what is evidently the general feeling of the committee, I shall endeavour to thrash that out. I do not say that .I shall be able to do it by tomorrow evening necessarily, but if possiblo I shall do it by tomorrow evening, and submit a further proposal. It is not a simple thing to do, and it may be necessary for me to ask the honourable member  draw his amendment for the present, and to permit mc to recommit the clause. He can move it at a future stage when I shall have elaborated what I hope may be a solution of this difficulty. But I can assure honourable members that I am quitein touch with them in their desire, both for the establishment of a living wage in the general division by itself, and for the establishment of what will be a living wage in this division also. All I wish is that whatever remuneration the State gives to its servants it shall give to them as and when they deserve and merit it , and that those who do not deserve and merit it , who are guilty of no offence but simply sluggishness, idleness, and inertia-if not punished for that, and it would be hard to punish them-shal l not be rewarded for it ; that the reward shall go to those who earn it . That is the great principle I hope to see embodied, particularly in this part of the Bill, and if I can embody it, and at the same time meet honourable members by such a provision as will secure what one might term a living wage in each of the divisions, I shall be very happy, and I think they will be content.. It has been represented to me that many members are tired after their lengthy railway journeys, and with the view of reconsidering this clause, unless a n y honourable member desires to moke any further comment, I shall now ask the Chairman to report progress. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.6 p.m.",73
