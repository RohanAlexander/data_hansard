Mr Mauger (Melbourne Ports) - I desire to make a personal explanation bearing 'upon some remarks utlered by me during the course of my address on the motion of want of confidence, when I stated that it was the policy of the party with which I have been allied to sit in the Ministerial corner, and act towards the Watson Administration as the Labour Party had acted towards the Barton and Deakin A d ministrations. The Argus, in commenting upon that statement, saidMr Deakin, instead of bearing Mr Mauger out, gave the statement a flat contradiction. "" Never, never, not even discussed,"" he said emphatically. Mr Mauger ""understood"" that was the object of the Deakin party., but' not even his faithful backer, Mr Hume Cook, came to his rescue. Sir John Forrest and M i . Chapman denied Mr Mauger's statement. To bear out my statement, and to show that the matter was publicly discussed between the honourable and learned mernber for Ballarat and myself, I wish to quote an extract from the columns of the Melbourne Herald of the 22nd August. Mr L1DDEI.L - What have we to do with this?",12
1,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"When a man's word is - doubted, he has a right to make the facts clear.",13
2,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Send the correction to the Argus.,13
3,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I am going to make the correction here. On the 22 nd August, during a public discussion of the matter with the honourable and learned member for Ballarat many weeks agOj I made the following statement:Further, I knew it to be the policy of the Protectionist Party to sit in the corner and support the Ministry that was to succeed' the Deakin Ministry, in order to prevent the free-trade leader securing the Treasury benches. I have no knowledge as to who is responsible for the change in that policy. To that change, however, is to be attributed any trouble in the Protectionist Party that has subsequently arisen. I have since spoken with the honourable and learned member, and he now admits that the conversation did take place. policy was, had the right honourable member for Adelaide been sent for, to sit in the Ministerialcorner, and actively support him wliile negatively opposing the Reid party ; but, if the right. honourable member for East Sydney were sent for, to sit in the Opposition corner, ifor the purpose- !of opposing him. The only difference between the honourable and learned member for Ballarat and myself is-^",13
4,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,That one was right and - the other was wrong-.,13
5,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,-The fact is that the proposal to sit in the corner was discussed.,13
6,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,B y whom ?,13
7,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,B y the honourable and learned member for Ballarat and myself.,13
8,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The honourable member was not the party. Mr - MAUGER - The fact that the matter had been discussed was denied, and the Argus is trying to make out that my statement was a fiction, and that the con(versation did not take place. The only point of difference between the honourable and learned member for Ballarat and myself was that, if the honourable member for Bland had been sent for, it was his policy to-sit in the Opposition corner to keep his party together, and to keep the Free-trade Party out of office. That is all I have to say; but I think that honourable members will acknowledge that there was every warrant for my statement. NA CONFIDENCE. Debate resumed from 6th October (vide page 5345), on motion by Mr WATSON That the present Administration does not possess the confidence of this House.",13
9,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANTO F," When the House rose last night, I was about to investigate the cause of the new-born zeal of the. Prime Minister in the interests of the farmers.",13
10,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANTO F,He has always been a friend of the farmers.,13
11,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANTO F,Yes . The honourable member for Riverina knows - what he ' did for them in New South Wales.,13
12,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The only political friends which the New South Wales farmers have had were the protectionists, who sheltered them from the unfair competition of the world, and raised the. price of wheat by is. a bag without making bread any dearer than it was in Victoria. The His Prime Minister was never a friend of the farmers. He was their worse enemy, and at one of the largest meetings which he has addressed in the Town H all in Melbourne, he told the farmers and stock fatteners of Victoria that if he had the opportunity he would expose them to the cold' southerly winds of the world's competition. Did he not know at the time of the great disadvantages under which the farmers in the interior suffer? How, for instance, could the wheat-growers in the Mallee districts of Victoria compete with the wheat-growers of California ? When the right honourable gentleman removed the New South Wales duties on grain, ship-load after ship-load of wheat was poured into Sydney, at a freightage of 10s. a ton all charges paid, whereas it would cost the Mallee farmers twice that amount to send their wheat by train to Melbourne.",13
13,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANTO F,Does not the honourable members know that Mark-lane rules the prices of the world ?,14
14,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I know more of farming than does the honourable member, because I have been a practical farmer, and for thirty years have lived on the Victorian and New South Wales border, Where I have had an object-lesson as to the advantages of protection. The farmers of New South Wales without protection never got to within 3d. or 4d. a bushel as much for their as the protected farmers of Victoria got; but the duties imposed by the Dibbs Government broke up the ring of shippers and millers in Sydney, who would not go into the interior to buy wheat, because they could import it at a freight of 10s. per ton. The farmers never had a worse political enemy 'than the right honourable gentle.man.",14
15,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANTO F,They never had a better friend.,14
16,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANTO F,Can the honourable member point to. one thing that the right honourable gentleman has ever done for the farmers ?,14
17,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WANTO F,He cheapened their implements.,14
18,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The honourable member says that the right honourable gentleman assisted the farmers by enabling them to secure implements at cheaper prices. would ask what was done by the farmers during the time that they were exposed to t'he cold southerly winds of the world's petition at the instance of the right honourable gentleman? Where did they go to buy their implements? Into the protected State of Victoria, where they could obtain what they required more cheaply than from abroad. Moreover, the implements made in Victoria were better adapted to their requirements, and were infinitely preferable to the imported shoddy.",14
19,Mr FULLER,MOTION OF WANTO F,And our farmers obtained them at prices lower than those at which they were sold to the farmers of Victoria.,14
20,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Eve n in the district represented by the honourable and learned member for Illawarra, the farmers, who were only a few miles from the ship's side, 8 z2 preferred to send to Victoria for what they required. The present Tariff has already had injurious effects upon the implementmaking industry of the Commonwealth and these would be intensified if the Prime Minister had his way. One of the best machines ever invented, which is now being copied iii all parts of the world, was brought into existence under protection in Victoria. I refer to the Sunshine harvester, which is manufactured by the MCKay Harvester Manufacturing Co. of Ballarat. Before the protective policy was introduced in Victoria the farmers had to buy implements, in many cases utterly unsuitable to their' requirements, sent to them from other parts of the world. The ploughs would fly in pieces the first time a root was struck, and other implements were found to be wheat equally defective. The protective policy adopted in Victoria resulted in the growth of a sturdy class of manufacturers, who sent their agents throughout the country in order to find out exactly what was required. They made improvement after improvement in their implements, and today they are manufacturing all that the farmer requires. If the Prime Minister had his way he would sweep away all our protective duties and expose our manufacturers to the cold southerly winds of the world's competition. I ask, is this the policy that would be adopted by a statesman? With what class of farmers has the right honourable gentleman allied himself? There are farmers and farmers. The class with whom the right honourable gentleman has thrown in his lot are the large landed proprietors of the squatter class, whereas the farmers of whom I am speaking are the men who I hold a few acres of land, and have to work very hard in order to make a living. These are the men who have some claim to com- be protected from outside competition. The stock fatteners are not farmers, but squatters who hold large areas of land. What was .my opponent at the last election ? He called himself a farmer, but I should be very glad to be a farmer such as he is. He is reported to own 118,000 acres of freehold land, which, if placed upon the market, woulcl realise about a quarter of a million. Is the Prime Minister aware that even under the present Tariff our stock-growers' are being brought into competition with the outside world? A ship-load of hides from China has been landed in Melbourne with a view to ascertain whether they can successfully compete with the locally-produced article The Prime Minister is telling the farmers that he is ""the chap to save the country,"" and will study their interests; but if they look back at the history of the protectionist movement they will see that it has enabled them to build"" up their homes, and that they could not have done without it. The farmers have never received any benefits at the hands of the right honourable gentleman, and they have nothing to look to from him in the future, because, under his policy, they would be left to take care of themselves.",14
21,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The Minister for Trade and Customs will look after also that. Mr .CHANTER - He represents only one-half of the Ministry, and I desire see in power a wholly protectionist A ministration. I do not wish to say one word against the Minister of Trade and Labour Party. Customs, because I know that in his heart he agrees with everything I have said. How can we express confidence in an honland ? orable gentleman who tells the farmers that he will sweep away all the benefits they at present enjoy, and at the same endeavours to persuade them that he is their true champion.?",15
22,Mr SALMON,MOTION OF WANTO F,There was nothing in the Ministerial statement with regard that matter.,15
23,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"There is no Minisone terial statement; I am waiting for an nouncement of the policy of the Governsions ment. I have heard only the false cry Socialism-that the Labour Party are cialists and in favour of land confiscafrom those who have grasped it . tion. The Prime Minister has peatedly addressed meetings of farmers in terms such as I have indicated. main thime at the Kyneton meeting was what he chose to term ""Socialism."" and One or two honourable members, including the honourable and learned member for Angas, have given us definitions of Socialpeople ism, but the class of Socialism which the Prime Minister endeavoured to fasten upon the Labour Part};,- when addressing the farmers at Kvneton, was not that which any member of the party desires to see into practice. Members of the Labour Party are neither anarchists, communists, nor confiscators. There are honourable members sitting upon the other side of the farmer. House, protectionists, who, in years past, joined withme in a tacit alliance with Labour Party for the purpose of land for the settlement of small farmers, and of taking it from those who had monoquestion polized it under the world's free competition which the Prime Minister advocates. Did the right honourable gentleman tell the Kyneton farmers that he would deprive them of the privilege of having their produce conveyed to the metropolitan markets upon the ground, that the control of the railways by the State was a socialistic enterprise, and because some of the lines were not paying, and were not likely to pay ? No. He made no allusion to that. Did he inform them that the Post and Telegraph offices and the State public schools for the education of their children were socialistic institutions? ""No. Instead, he assured them, again and again, that if the Labour Party came into power, every to man who possessed an acre of land would d - have it taken away from him. I say that such a statement was a slander upon the",15
24,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,Do not the Labour Party believe in the nationalization of,15
25,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANTO F,Because one or two irresponsible individuals make certain time statements in addressing the people,15
26,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The honourable member's allies in this House say that they, believe in it. They do not deny it. They to are honest enough to admit it.",15
27,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I have never heard of them admit that he is in favour anof land confiscation. Upon many occaI have endeavoured, with the assistof ance of the leader of the Labour Party, to Soobtain land for the small farmers, and I have renever heard any member of the Labour Party attempt to persuade the public that His that party desires the confiscation of land. They would doubtless acquire it by fair honourable means-by enacting legislation which would have the effect of bursting up large estates in order that the might gain access to them. In Victoria, have we not evidence of this ? What is the object of the Closer Settlement Bill ? What did the present Prime Minister do in New South Wales in this conput nexion? He never made any legitimate effort to secure land for closer settlement. He has always been antagonistic to the small farmer, and in favour of the large",15
28,Mr FULLER,MOTION OF WANTO F,How ' is it that so many the honourable members have been returned to securing this House to support him?,15
29,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I anticipated that from the honourable and learned member. The Prime Minister's support is obtained from the Sydney Domain farmers. Surely the honourable and learned member does not regard the tenant farmers upon the south coast, who are within a stone's throw of the capital, as the real farmers of New South Wales? Are the men who are compelled to go cap in hand to the large capitalists, and to say"" Please will you allow me to enter upon your land, and your rent shall be one-half of the produce that I obtain from it"" - the real producers of Australia?",15
30,Mr FULLER,MOTION OF WANTO F,Where does that take place ?,16
31,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"All over New South Wales, and especially in the southern and western districts. Does the honourable and learned member know anything about the halving system?",16
32,Mr FULLER,MOTION OF WANTO F,There is none of that in mv district.,16
33,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"What the Labour Party desire is the creation of a class of sturdy yeomen, who have a right to the land upon which they live-no t a class of rack-rented tenants. During the whole course of his political career, the Prime Minister has never assisted the small farmer. His policy-as can be groved by reference to the Statistical Register of New South Wales'-ha s always been diametrically opposed to the interests of the producers. The latter have to study many things, and they have always been connected with the Liberal movement, particularly in New South Wales and South Australia. They desire that their home market shall be conserved to them, but that result cannot be accomplished by exposing them to the "" cold southerly winds of the world's competition."" Does not the farmer realise that the home market is his best market? Does he not rely upon, it? Most assuredly he does. He wishes to secure as large and profitable a home market as he can. He is also intimately connected with the manufacturing industries of the Commonwealth. He purchases his machinery from them, and, in return, they take their food from him. Thus the circulation of capital is confined to the realm in which it was earned. The Prime Minister has evidenced his desire to assist the farmers of New South Wales by removing a protective duty which put into their pockets one shilling for every bag of wheat they produced, and then taxing their land. Even his land-taxation scheme is anything but equitable, and requires adjustment at the earliest possible moment. Under its operation the owner of 200 acres is placed in exactly the same category as the individual who possesses 200,000 acres.",16
34,Mr FULLER,MOTION OF WANTO F,Is the honourable member in favour of a Federal land tax.,16
35,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I am in favour of a different class of land-tax from that which operates' in Victoria and New South Wales. I am not in favour of penalizing the men who have the heart and courage to go on the land and endeavour to build up homes, while large property-holders in the metropolitan areas escape taxation.",16
36,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WANTO F,That has not been the policy in New South Wales.,16
37,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"That has always been the policy in New South Wales, the politics of which are dominated by the two leading newspapers, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Daily Telegraph, against the dictates of which no politician has yet had the. courage to rebel. The policypursued in New South Wales has been for the benefit of Sydney and suburbs, and not for the benefit of the State generally.",16
38,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,Why did not the honourable member alter that state of affairs when he was a member of the Government of New South Wales. ?,16
39,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Because I had not time. One of the allies of the present Prime Minister was guilty of another unprecedented action, when, immediately after the election at that time, he absolutely caused supplies to be refused to the Government. That trick, however, was not successful, because the late Sir George Dibbs had the courage to pay the salaries of the public servants on the Governor's warrant. Honourable members on both sides of this House know that from the time. I entered the Parliament of New South Wales I raised my voice week after week, and year after year, in the interests of the farmer, in order to enable him to make a living for those depending on him. That was my history in the politics of New South Wales, and it will be my history in this Parliament; and I hope this question will be seriously taken in hand by the Commonwealth Government. We are here to legislate for the commonweal of the States, and the matter I am now discussing is a very simple one. The Commonwealth should take control of the revenue and expenditure, and return a certain amount to the States, taking care that the burden of taxation is placed on the shoulders of those best able to bear it. What has the right honourable member done for the workers of New South Wales, other class with whom I have .strong symonly pathy? Can any honourable member supporting the Prime Minister point to one legitimate act on his part in the terests of the workers?",16
40,Mr FULLER,MOTION OF WANTO F,He removed taxation from their shoulders.,17
41,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,And gave them a tea tax!,17

The right honourable gentletells us that he will enter into negotiations with the States; but in the meanhe time many old people are dying. A case came under my notice only yesterday of a preman who has been fifty years in Australia. the He is a Hanoverian by birth, but under the laws of the land of his nativity he has to be a Hanoverian subject, and he not a British subject. He is eighty years age, and was in receipt of an old-age He pension for two years, but immediately it was found that he was not a British subthe ject the pension was taken from him, and he has been left to starve.

86,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"It has been suggested that the honourable and learned member for Indi has drawn up several programmes, but I have seen only one. I quoted from it last night, and it is now the same as when it was first submitted to me. One - of the planks of that programme is to make immediate provision for old-age pensions. It must be patent to every member of the If House that these old pioneers of Austrasay lia, though they may not have resided for twenty-five years in any one State, should not be allowed to die without a helping hand. The Commonwealth should rapidly bring into force a law to grant immediate relief without reference to the wishes of the States. How easy would it be for the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, who is entitled to retain 5s. out of every J £ I collected from customs and excise duties, to deduct from the returns of Victoria and New South Wales the amounts spent in those States upon old-age pensions! On behalf of those who position of the House today? sent me here, I have to consider what duty is in regard to this Government. When I am asked whether I have confidence the Government, I can only answer in negative. Let them inspire that confidence which I do not now possess. Now that the tension has been relaxed, and there is parently to be no immediate appeal to people, let the Government declare policy, and show whether the protectionist half dominates the free-trade half, or versa. I shall be always true to the programme of the alliance into which I have entered, but, at the same time, if the Government propose any legislation which will tend to maintain existing industries tablish others, provide work for workers, and raise the prosperity of the people Australia, they shall have my support. let them bring in this liberal legislation quickly as possible, and not seek to get the haven of recess-and no doubt it will of long duration-in order to arrange a programme.

120,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The honourable member for Riverina had a much closer run than I should like to have. He has told us that the right honourable member for East Sydney gets no support except from the loafers ""in the Sydney Domain, and from the tenant farmers who have to crawl to their landlords. The figures which I have read disprove those statements. the Werriwa district the Reidites polled 19,000, while the next three polled only 6,000 votes. Taking the voting for the whole State, the three Reidites who were elected senators polled 189,000, 188,000,'and 185,000 votes, while the candidate next on the list polled only 107,000 votes. Still honourable members opposite have the audacity to say that the Prime Minister is not trusted by the people of New South Wales. Then, if we take the representation of the next great State in the Commonwealth, Victoria, we find that, including the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne amongst the labour members, the alliance has four Victorian labour representatives and four Victorian protectionists, while the Government are supported by fifteen representatives of that State.",23
121,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANTO F,There are only three Victorian labour representatives in this House.,23

They talk about the coalition on this side, but there has never been such bare-faced audacity displayed before in any Parliament as that of honourable members sitting in the Opposition corner.  should go to Queensland if he wants to find instances of bare-faced audacity.",23
127,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"If there is more bare-faced audacity in Queensland than here, I * do not wonder that my honourable friend preferred to come into this' Parliament.  In the electors chose to send me.",23
128,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"And they made an exceedingly good choice, with which I do not in any way quarrel. The speech delivered by the late Prime Minister was one respectively of negatives. He submitted a grab-all motion, but made absolutely no charge against the Government. I did not hear his speech, but I have gone carefully through the report in Hansard, and, so far as I can see, his indictment against the' Government was summed up in the complaint that they had not announced any policy for next session. The honourable member for Hume, who was then sub-leader of the Opposition-bu t who, I am afraid, has been jockeyed out of his position-the n rose and made an affirmative speech. He put forward a very distinct programme, and a fair one, too. He said, "" We are going to challenge the Government because they will not give us more protection,"" and almost before the sound of his voice - had faded away, honourable members sitting in association with him said that they would be no parties to increasing the duties under the Tariff. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat expressed his dissatisfaction with the solely on the ground that they held out no hope to the protectionists, asked him whether protection was the policy of the alliance, and I understood him to say that it was. I have asked several members of the Labour Party if they are prepared to support a protectionist policy, and they have replied in the negative. There is only one labour representative in the House at the present moment who is a free-trader; I refer to the honourable member for Maranoa. I asked him if he subscribed to protection, and he gave me his authority to say that he did not. What has the honourable member for Riverina to say to that? It is perfectly farcical for honourable members belonging to the alliance to say that they intend to go to the country upon a protective policy in order to save our industries from being strangled, whilst some of the men with whom they are allied are far stronger free-traders than I am. As honourable members are doubtless aware, I do not hold such pronounced free-trade views as do some other honourable members.  for one moment suppose that I was going to the country as a protectionist?",23
129,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I did not. There is no honourable member in this House in whose honesty I have greater faith than in that of the honourable member. When he tells the House that he regards all bonuses as bare-faced robberies, I believe him.",24
130,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,He did not oppose the sugar bonus.,24
131,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANTO F,"And the honourable member did not object to the"" subsidy for the mail service between Melbourne and Launceston.",24
132,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"No , I was not this House, but I should have done so, because I object to all subsidies and bonuses. I hope that I shall not be a protectionist for my own State and a free-trader in regard to other States. Although some of my personal friends are interested in the proposed iron bonus, I have announced my intention to vote against it. I shall not countenance any proposal which will result un the people being robbed, whether it be by the State or by private individuals. We have no more right to give bonuses for the encouragement of the iron industry than tc offer them for the assistance of those engaged in wheat growing, in the timber industry, or in any other enterprise. When some honourable members tell us that they are going to the country upon a distinct Government policy, whilst honourable members wlith whom .they are allied, and with whom they I profess to. be fighting shoulder to shoulder, tell us that that policy involves robbery of the people, the hollowness of their pretensions is exposed. I regard the honourable members who are sitting in the Liberal Alliance corner as having left their, party. Their position reminds me of that of the Scotchman who always had the misfortune to sit on a jury with eleven obstinate men. Here we have four, five, or six members blaming some fifteen or sixteen others for having deserted them. If majority rule is to be accepted as a sound principle, one would think that those who were in the majority should decide the fate of the party.",24
133,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANTO F,But the majority ignored the terms of their own resolution.,24
134,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I should like to know under what flag the members of the alliance will fight if the motion now before us is carried. Will the honourable member for Hume and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports appeal to the electors as advocates of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill and a protective policy, whilsi other members sitting in alliance with'them are telling the electors that protection amounts to bare-faced robbery ?",24
135,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I suppose that the Prime Minister will defend the present Tariff? Mr MCWILLIAMS "" - I hope sincerely that the Prime Minister will abide by the agreement into which he has entered.",24
136,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANTO F,What agreement?,24
137,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The agreement that the Tariff shall be allowed to remain intact during the life of the present Parliament. Although' I hold that there are in many anomalies in the present Tariff, I told my constituents- I dad not enter into a specific pledge-that I thought the Tariff should be left alone for the lif e of the present Parliament. Whilst the late Government were in office not one word was said as to the necessity for an immediate revision of the Tariff. When four protectionists and three free-traders sat on the Treasury bench as members of the Watson Ministry, not a voice was raised by members in the Liberal corner in favour of ejecting the Ministry from office because they would not revive the fiscal issue. They had no excuse for saying that they did not understand the position of the Ministry, because in his speech on the Address-inReply the honourable member for Bland stated with perfect clearness that in his view there could be no revival of the Tariff question during the life of the present Par- Victoria. liament. Further, when he addressed his constituents at Wagga only a few days before he retired from office, he made a similar statement. Why was not a protest entered at that time? How is it* that it has dawned upon honourable members only within the last few days that a revision of the Tariff is necessary ?",24
138,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANTO F,It certainly is necessary.,25
139,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"We know too well the object of the proposal. It is only a sham and a farce- a bare-faced scramble for office. That is what it means. Have not a great majority of those who have spoken made the Prime Minister a sort of King Charles' head ? If any individual, other than the right honourable gentleman, were leader of the Government they would follow hiim, I suppose?",25
140,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WANTO F,What woulcl financial position of Tasmania under free trade ?,25
141,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"What Tasmania is suffering from at the present time ous loss of revenue, caused by importations from the other States. We are very largely importing from Victoria articles upon which we formerly levied revenue-producing duties ranging from 12J to 20 per cent. For example, the market for the rougher kind of boots-workmen' s boots-ha s practically been captured by the Victorian manufacturers.",25
142,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANTO F,We know that.,25
143,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"And in Tasmania we know it to our cost, because whilst the boots are no cheaper to the consumer, that State is losing the revenue which it formerly collected upon them. That is one of the ramifications of the Tariff which will require to be carefully considered whenever its revision may be undertaken.",25
144,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANTO F,How does the honourable member account for that condition of affairs? Is it due to the fact that Victoria possesses better machinery ?,25
145,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I think that it is due to the larger turnover in Victoria. This States possesses very much larger'manufactories than does Tasmania. As a result, their output is larger, and, with their higher class of machinery, they could put better value into the cheaper class of boots, than can the small factories of Tasmania, other things being equal.",25
146,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANTO F,There is no duty upon the importation of Tasmanian boots into,25
147,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I repeat that because of the larger Victorian factories and their greater turnover, the latter manufacturers can produce boots cheaper than can those of Tasmania. Prior to Federation, Tasmanian factories were doing only a limited trade for a limited number of people. Consequently the establishments themselves were limited. In Victoria, however, the Melbourne manufacturers had a larger population to work upon, and with the assistance of a prohibitive duty upon boots, were able to monopolize practically the whole of the local trade. When the markets of the smaller States were thrown open to them, they were naturally in a better position than were the local manufacturers. I do not grudge them their success for a moment. I am merely stating the facts, so far as the falling off of the Tasmanian revenue is concerned. Whereas be the formerly we were accustomed to receive 20 per cent, upbn all the heavier class of boots imported into that State, we now collect no duty whatever. That is one of the condiis a seritions which we foresaw",25
148,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MOTION OF WANTO F,The same remark applies to hats.,25
149,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Exactly. It applies to all those! goods in which the Victorian manufacturers have a larger turnover. The Tasmanian revenue is suffering today not so much on account of the operation of a high Tariff or a low Tariff, but by reason of the fact that we are excluding goods from other parts of' the world, and importing them from the manufacturing centres of Victoria absolutely free of duty. We are thus losing the revenue which we formerly obtained from that source. I was one of those who opposed Federation, because I believed that Australia was not ripe for the large scheme of union into which we have entered. I was defeated upon the question, and of course accepted the result with good grace, but I make bold to say that the proceedings of this Parliament during the present session have gone far to prove that the judgment of those who held my views was correct. There has never been a Parliament in Australia which has put up such a bad record as has the Commonwealth Parliament general election. during the current session.",25

167,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANTO F,Who was the Minister of Home Affairs at the time of the last elec,26
168,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANTO F,That gentleman is now rolls sitting on the same side as the honourable perfect chaos. member for Franklin.,26
169,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The honourable it member for Wide Bay, in giving credit to the late Government for what they had done, pointed especially to the enormous improvement made in the Defence Forces. In Tasmania the cost of the Defence Forces ""is 50 per cent, to 100 per cent, than when under the State, but they Departare in a state of chaos. South of Oatnor lands there is practically no defence injury force, and in the north the force My is in a very unsatisfactory conditiona condition that should not be permitted to continue a day longer than can be helped. I have to thank the Minister of Defence for an,assurance that, if the Government get into recess, he will visit we Tasmania and make inquiries. A personal visit of that kind will, I am .sure, convince the Minister of the absolute necessity for, at least, putting the Defence Forces in that State on a sounder footing. There is one important question as to which I find myself very much in accord with some honourable members on the other side-that is the question of preferential trade, if , of course, their idea of preferential trade is the same as my own. I am an out-and-out supporter of preferential trade within the British Empire. Nothing could tend to bind the Empire closer, and nothing could be better for the producers, and all classes of the community in Australia, than n preferential trade arrangement with the rest of the Empire. But the preference must be an honest one. To place duties on English goods and practically shut them out of the market, and then to impose duties 20 or 25 per cent, higher on foreign goods, is a shaim. I am prepared to support a preferential trade, under which the duties on British goods shall be reduced 5 or 10 per cent., as the Tariff will allow, and a corresponding increase of 5 or 10 per cent, duty imposed on goods from other countries.",26
170,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"What would the honourable member take off the duty of 12^ per cent, on machinery ?",27
171,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"As regards manyclasses of machinery, I should take the whole 12$ per cent. off.",27
172,Mr STORRER,MOTION OF WANTO F,Tasmania would then lose almost all her revenue.,27
173,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The people of Tasmania would, I believe, be willing to bear the loss of the 12 J per cent, duty at present levied on . agricultural . machinery. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports asked me a fair question; and, in reply, I have to say that I am not prepared to place a heavy duty on many articles used in the primary industries. If the States want revenue, I am prepared to support a revenue Tariff of 10 or 12\ per cent.; but I cannot support a Tariff which would completely destroy the revenue of States which do not produce the dutiable articles-and all for the sake of improving the industries of some other State.",27
174,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANTO F,I am afraid that the honourable member is not very Federal in spirit.,27
175,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The honourable member for Bass asked what the effect on the Tasmanian revenue would be, if the duty of 12J per cent.' on machinery were removed. But where would the revenue be if the duty were so high as to shut out all British and American goods, and force the people to obtain the whole of their machinery from Victoria ? There would be no revenue then.",27
176,Mr STORRER,MOTION OF WANTO F,That is another question.,27
177,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,It is a question we have to face.,27
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANTO F,It is the question.,27
179,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"It is a great mis- fortune that in dealing with Customs matters in Tasmania we are compelled to have regard to considerations of revenue. The honourable member for Denison, with his long .experience in the Tasmanian Parliament, will bear me out when I say that in all our dealings with the Tariff in Tasmania, the revenue has had to be kept in view. Nearly all the revisions of the Tasmanian Tariff were in the direction of securing more revenue.",27
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The duties in Tasmania averaged about 20 per cent., I think.",27
181,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The average was, I believe, less than 20 per cent.",27
182,Mr STORRER,MOTION OF WANTO F,About 15 per cent.,27
183,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,That is a fairly high revenue Tariff.,27
184,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"It was; and it gave Tasmania nearly ^100,000 a year more than that State now receives. - Mr WATKINS - Such a Tariff would be called high protection in New South Wales.",27
185,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANTO F,And free-trade in Victoria.,27
186,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The honourable member for Bland is a protectionist in New South Wales, but in Victoria he is a free trader, or worse-h e is regarded as a "" strangler ' ' of industries. That honourable member's idea of protection contemplates, I think, duties of 15 or 20 per cent. While we in Tasmania have to consider the question of revenue, I think the people of that State are prepared to make some 'little further sacrifice to assist in a small wayand, necessarily, it must be in a small way - to secure preferential trade within the Empire. Such reforms cannot be obtained without some little sacrifice. Before I conclude I should like to make some reference to the conduct of business within this Parliament. The honourable member for Coolgardie has said that we ought not to foul our own nest by speaking disparagingly of the work we have done here. I cannot help saying, however, that the present session is not one of which any honourable member can possibly be proud; and it is my intention, before the session closes, to test the feeling of the House on the question of restricting the length of speeches. If honourable members, who occupy four or five hours in their deliverances, were to sub-edit their speeches-or , what would be much better, get some friend to do so-the y would better secure the attention of the House, would speak with greater effect, and would save inordinate expense. If we are to have a general election every twelve months, and sit in Melbourne for the balance of the year, it means that the legislative work will d r if t into the hands of two classes-the absolutely wealthy, who have nothing to do, and adopt politics as a hobby, and the unemployed who are glad to Jive on the parliamentary allowance. This is a very serious matter to men who are not prepared to become absolutely professional politicians. It is serious to men who are not prepared to spend-or , indeed, waste-So great a time in the Federal Parliament House. Honourable members who live in Melbourne are not so much concerned. They may devote their attention to private business during a great portion of the day, and saunter up to Parliament House when their own offices are closed. But to members from the other States, who have to give the whole of their time to Parliament during the session, the inordinate, useless length of the session-if the present session is to be a standard for future sessions-is of serious importance.",27
187,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,What does the honourable member propose as a remedy ?,28
188,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,The same remedy as has been adopted in some of the States of America-that there should be an absolute time limit of the speeches of honourable members.,28
189,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANTO F,Can the honourable member explain why it is that the long speeches all come from New South Wales members ?,28
190,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"No , I cannot. After the views which I have expressed, I suppose it is needless for me to say that it is my intention to vote against the motion of the leader of the Opposition. But I will add that the condition of parties in this House is not Satisfactory. I say deliberately that I arri not satisfied with the position that was revealed last night. T am not satisfied that the Government should carry on with a majority of one. I should like to see the electoral rolls put thoroughly in order during the recess. The Government, in recess, should prepare a well thought out and clearly defined programme. Let them plaice it before Parliament, and let us have a vote upon it. If we are to have a dissolution, let us go to the country either for the Government policy or against it. Let us know exactly what we are doing. That is the only way in which a straight-out issue can be placed before the Commonwealth. In view of the unsatisfactory condition of parties, I think that it is the duty of the Prime Minister to follow thai; course, and not to introduce new measures at present. The right honourable gentleman should endeavour to get through the session as quickly as possible, get into recess, and then pre'pare- I repeat it- a definite and proper programme to place before the country.",28
191,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANTO F,Did he not have a policy when he appealed to the electors at the last election?,28
192,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"A great many honourable members had policies, and they are now endeavouring to get away from them. The policy chiefly advocated in Victoria was one of fiscal peace during the life of the present Parliament.",28
193,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANTO F,I did not advocate that.,28
194,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The honourable member is not Victoria, though he is a very able representative of that State. I do not desire to see a scramble at the next election; I do not wish to see the 1 honourable and learned member for Ind i standing on the policy of absolute protection, while Mr Tom Mann-wh o is allied with his party-advocate s a land nationalization, scheme. I have had opportunities of hearing Mr Tom Mann on several occasions, and I admire him for his ability. So far as I can see, he is going to be a prominent figure, if he enters the Parliamentary Labour Party. But take the position of the honourable and learned member for Indi. It is generally understood that Mr. Tom Mann is to oppose the honourable and learned member for Ballarat at the next election. We all know that when persons are fighting side by side, they are, in elections, apt to exchange programmes. Let us imagine the honourable and learned member for Indi taking Mr Tom Mann up into an agricultural electorate to advocate land nationalization.",28
195,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANTO F,He would not take Mr. Tom Mann up-h e would take him down !,28
196,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"It would require a much smarter man than the honourable and learned' member for Indi to take down Mr. Tom Mann. We have heard a good deal about the press in the course of this debate. As an old pressman, I must say that I have never known the press to be so intensely honored as it has been in this Parliament. I feel quite proud of the fact that I am an old quilldriver, when I see the deference that is paid to it. I am now going to give honourable members a little extract from a newspaper which was issued today. The Tocsin is, I believe, the recognised organ of the Labour Party in Victoria.",28
197,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANTO F,Is it?,29
198,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I know that honourable members opposite are exceedingly non-committal, but I think that they will not venture to deny that the Tocsin is the recognised organ of the Labour Party in this State. The issue of the journal this morning contains an interesting little. cut with the letterpress :Senator MCGregor's famous satiiical lecture, entitled ""Good as a labour man,"" has been hastily withdrawn, pending further instructions from the managers of the alliance. It is rather a good cut of the senator who, presumably because of the suppression of that exceedingly able lecture of his, does not look happy. The Tocsin also contains a leading article on the subject of the alliance.",29
199,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANTO F,Does the honourable member wish to get the extracts into Hansard?',29
200,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"-The worse feature of associating with a certain class of individuals is that they will persist in judging every one by their own standards. The honourable member for Yarra yesterday wished to get some exceedingly long extracts into Hansard, and he thinks that other people are actuated by the same desire. I am not so proud of my speeches in Hansard as the honourable member is of his. I do not take so much interest in them.",29
201,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANTO F,The honourable member has made ten speeches for every one that I have made this session.,29
202,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The article is headed "" The Alliance Reviewed."" This organ of the Labour Party reviews the alliance that has just been formed between the Labour Party and the piotectionist wing of the Opposition. After some introductory remarks, the article proceeds :The controlling authority, which alone can be regarded as voicing the opinion of Victorian labour, did not denounce the alliance; it did not censure its own representatives for having entered into unforeseen obligations without first consulting their constituents. It simply declared that Barrett. its action would be in no way affected by an agreement to which it was no party, and that its several branches would act as if such irregular compact pledge. had never existed. The article proceeds a little further downThe defeat of the Barton Administration led to a party advance, as did also the overthrow of Mr Deakin; so, too, would the ejectment of Mr. Isaacs, if he held office.",29
203,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,Will the honourable member tell us what some of the papers have said about the coalition on the other side?,29
204,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Perhaps the honourable member will allow me to play mvown innings. I am giving honourable members now what the masters of the Labour Party outside are going to say at the next election. We see the honourable member for Bourke looking pleadingly to the front Opposition bench, and asking his friends there not to oppose him at the next election, but we know that not .one of them dare get on to the honourable member's platform and say a word for him if a labour man is run against him. Why? Because I believe they will keep their pledge. I think it will be admitted that they pledge themselves not to oppose the selected candidate. If a selected candidate is run against the honourable member for Bourke, there is not a member of the Federal Labour Party who can mount the platform and say a word for him without violating his written pledge. And yet honourable members opposite talk of an alliance. The masters of the Federal Labour Party are those who intend to select the candidates for the next election. No honourable member sitting on the opposite side knows at the present moment whether he will be a candidate for the Labour Party or not.",29
205,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANTO F,We are selected already.,29
206,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,Does the honourable member know that he will be a candidate ?,29
207,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I know that I am in a position to defy any little clique, and to appeal straight to - the electors. The honourable member cannot do that. He has first of all to put in his nomination and to have it decided whether he shall be the selected candidate of his league before he can go to the electors for support. I am not in that position.",29
208,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANTO F,Does the honourable member know of any man who has been true to the platform and pledge who has not been selected ?,29
209,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,MOTION OF WANTO F,Ex-Senato r,29
210,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANTO F,He was not true to the,29
211,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANTO F,Senato r Trenwith.,29
212,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANTO F,Senato r Trenwith never signed the pledge.,30
213,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Senato r Trenwith was a better representative of the labour classes than the honourable member for Yarra is ever likely to be, and he did more for the working people of Victoria than all the honourable members sitting on the other side, and yet the members of the party turned on him, and butchered him at the last moment. Why, Senator Trenwith is a Tasmanian !",30
214,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANTO F,What is his opinion of honourable members on the Government side?,30
215,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,Le t me read further from this article in the Tocsin. Honourable members may see that the copy I have in my hand is yet wet from the press. This is not ancient history.,30
216,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"It is wet with tears of distress, I think.",30
217,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"There are more than tears of distress in this article. This is what is said of the men whom the Federal Labour Party has taken to itself ; and is to help at the next election. This is what the masters of the Victorian members of the party sayPublic servants were excluded from the Bill which labour members have agreed to pass "" as nearly as possible"" in its original form. On 21st August the House divided on the question whether the Bill should include State servants. Of the ten "" L i be r a l "" This word "" Liberal"" is quoted, and this is a nasty jar which a newspaper man gets in when he wished to be particularly severeOf the ten "" Liberal"" members of the House of Representatives-Si r Langdon Bonython, Sir William Lyne, Messrs. Hume Cook, Groom, Isaacs, Storrer., and Wilkinson, voted against the proposal. These are now "" at liberty to adhere to their votes already given."" Now listen to thisAnd the railway servants of Victoria are handed over, gagged and shackled, to Thomas Bent. This is, what is published in the organ of the party to which the honourable member for Yarra belongs. I invite him at the next pleasant Sunday afternoon at which Mr Anstey is present, to denounce this newspaper. If the honourable member agrees to do so, I shall endeavour to be there. I think that when the terms of the alliance were read out the honourable and learned member for Indi displayed modesty, and, at the same time, a little pride in its composition. This newspaper, under which the honourable and learned member is going to fight the next election, refers to several of its clauses in this waySo much is flapdoodle and padding.",30
218,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"As an old' pressman will the honourable member say what ""flapdoodle "" means?",30
219,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I believe that when children hear a story in which they do not quite believe they say "" skittles."" I should think that ""flapdoodle"" has very much the same meaning. It means a farce, nonsense, a mockery, a sham. That is exactly what we think of the alliance agreement, and it is exactly what the newspaper the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is going to fight under next time, though he did not fight under it last time, also thinks of it. That is what the leader of the Victorian representatives of the Labour Party says. The article from which I have quoted further saysStrictly construed, the agreement releases every labour member from his Federal pledge on the most important issues. ' Each pledged himself "" to vote as a majority of the parliamentary party may decide at a duly constituted caucus meeting."" Is that a true interpretation of the pledge? And the parliamentary party has decided that "" any member of either party . . . . may decide for himself."" Labour members will not regard their pledge as dissolved, but they cannot close their eyes to the fact that they have not pledged any one else to amend the conditions of labour. Branches of the Parliamentary Labour Council may well hesitate to countenance, even by an inoperative resolution, an alliance with men who refuse to give any satisfactory assurance of their assistance to secure fair conditions of labour, and seven-tenths of whom are admittedly opposed to extending to State servants the benefits of Arbitration. I think I am quite fair in saying-that the Tocsin is the representative of the Labour Party in Victoria. It describes the alliance with the Liberal-Protectionists as a sham. It charges the men 'whom the Labour Party has taken under its wing with having handed over, gagged and bound, the railway servants to the tender mercies of Mr Bent. In labour circles no greater condemnation than that could be uttered. If a labour man wished to send a railway servant into a place ,bn this earth that was bad, I think that he would say "" I'll hand you over to Mr Bent."" And yet we are now asked to fight the elections on the propaganda of this alliance.",30
220,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,Was the honourable member in favour of the inclusion of the railway servants?,30
221,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,No .,31
222,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,The honourable member is now supporting their inclusion.,31
223,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I am not. The honourable member is not quite fair. An interjection was made yesterday that I was one of those who voted to defeat the Deakin Government. I did not. Although I was then practically in the party now occupying this side of the House, I announced my intention of voting with the Deakin Government, because I did not believe that the railway servants should be included in the Bill. Can any honourable member say that the present Prime Minister used his influence with, or coerced his followers into voting against the Deakin Government simply for the purpose of defeating them? I give the House my solemn assurance that, although he knew well that I was going to vote with the Deakin Government, never by word or by implication was I asked to vote against them.",31
224,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Hear , hear, and the same with many others.",31
225,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"And the same with many others. I did vote against the proposal, as I shall do whenever it comes up, because I believe that the States should control their railway servants.",31
226,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANTO F,Why did not the honourable member oppose the third reading of the Bill?,31
227,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I recognised that the party was beaten in a fair and square division. It may suit some honourable members to pose before their electors and say, ""Look at what I did."" But when a wise man has made his fight in a House of Parliament, and is beaten, he ceases to become an obstacle in the path. He savs, "" No, I am beaten, let the decision stand."" That was my position.",31
228,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,The honourable learned member for Ballarat did not do that.,31
229,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I am not responsible for the honourable and learned member, who is quite competent and able to answer for himself.",31
230,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MOTION OF WANTO F,Honourable members on the Opposition side are very ready to try to stab the honourable and learned member now.,31
231,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I think that these constant little stabs come with bad grace from men who were once very glad to get the assistance of the honourable and learned member. Honourable members on the other side have poured out their venom upon the Prime Minister, but they did not condemn him at the last election, when they were glad to get his assistance to win votes on their behalf. The regrettable features of this debate have been the slanders and the low tone which have been introduced, chiefly by the honourable member for Hume, in his reckless attempts to degrade the Prime Minister in the eyes of this Parliament and of Australia. I hope that the motion of no-confidence will be lost, and that the Government will take an early opportunity to get. a clear and w^ell defined issue between the two sides. And when we do go to the country let us go on that well defined issue, so that the men who are fighting under each leader can fight for one' policy. We do not want an advocacy of Socialism in one electorate, anti-Socialism in another electorate, the Manufactures Encouragement Bill in another electorate, or protection in another electorate. We do not want to see men on either side supporting a leader while denouncing his policy. If it would clearly define, once and for all, the position of parties in the House I should be glad to see this motion carried.  member think they should bo-Reidite s and Labourites?",31
232,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,I think that the Labour Party should occupy either the Ministerial or the Opposition benches.  - Mr MCWILLIAMS - No ; the honourable member knows that he is allied with men who talk of going to the country on a policy which he would honestly oppose on every possible occasion. ,31
233,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"No ; but ' the and Labour Party can help being allied with men who are voting to put out the Government, because they want to go to the country on a policy of protection. Very nearly one-half the members of the Labour Party are honest and able advocates of an entirely opposite policy. If we went to the country tomorrow, and the Reid Party came back in a minority of one or two. what policy would we see put before the House? Should we get an iron bonus policy, or a high Tariff policy? The honourable member for Maranoa, who intends to follow me, knows that he would not be prepared to support a policy which he regards as bare-faced robbery. Because I think that this motion of no-confidence is merely a bid for office; because I believe that if the House were dissolved, there would be a personal scramble, a kind of save-your-skin election, and that parties would come back as hopelessly confused as they are now, because I believe that the majority of the people of Australia do not want a dissolution ",31
234,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Because I am quite confident that the honourable member and myself, and I think an overwhelming majority of this House do not want a dissolution, I shall vote against the motion.",32
235,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F," I think, that no self-respecting Government, after listening to the last speech, and to one 01 two other speeches which have proceeded from the other side of the House, would attempt to carry on the business of the country. I do not propose in my remarks to refer to the political history of leading men from the various States, because I can hardly see what relevance that can have to the present position in Federal politics. The so-called replies which have come from the Government side nave largely been a condemnation of the action of the Labour Party in forming an alliance with certain honourable members. Not one word have we yet had in defence of the want of policy of the occupants of the Treasury bench. We have had the miserable excuse put forward that, on account of the length of the session, it is desirable that Ministers should bring forward one or two little non-contentious measures, and then get into recess, with a view, as is said, of developing a policy which might be acceptable to this House; but, as I think, to add to their majority, if , indeed, they possess one. do not undervalue the strain which has been imposed upon those honourable members who have come here from distant States. On the other hand, the position of Australia today is such that we cannot afford to sit idle and do nothing. There are too many persons out of employment for us to go into recess without having accomplished something.",32
236,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WANTO F,How can we give them employment ?,32
237,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I have my ideas on the subject, as the honourable member probably has his. We could at least attempt to do something. In my opinion, we might complete the Federal Tariff. Any one who says that that Tariff was completed by the first Parliament says what is incorrect, because part of it was postponed, and has been allowed to remain unfinished.",32
238,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANTO F,No .,32
239,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,In the honourable member's electorate there are industries of which any State might be proud.,32
240,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"They are in a worse con-; dition now than they were in before the Federal Tariff was imposed. Mr WATKINS.:-That is because they have in the past depended on work obtained from the State Government, or the chance of a ship meeting with an accident. At the present time they are appealing to the State Government for more orders. If the members of the Government are satisfied with the present situation, they are entitled to my sympathy, rather than to anything else. A Government which could stand the withering condemnation which this Government received from one of its supporters last night would stand anything. He told them plainly that he does not believe in their inactivity, and that they should come down with something in the nature of a policy. If they think that they have a majority on which they can depend, and proceed, I am surprised. Honourable members opposite, and even the honourable member for Dalley himself, have admitted that the present state of parties in this House makes progress impossible. Yet they are going to vote for the Government, in order that this state of things may continue. To my mind, that is neither consistent nor honest. I ask honourable members to listen to what the Government organ in New South Wales, a newspaper which has supported the Prime Minister throughout his political career, has said on this subject. On the 22nd August last, the following statement appeared in I the Sydney Daily Telegraph:It is instructive to be told that the statement issued by the new Federal Prime Minister is a manifesto. That information was much needed ; for most persons, on reading the document, find themselves sorely at a loss for a word to describe it. Mr Reid is nothing if not bold; and the lengths of yes-no-ism, to which his boldness has been known to carry him, quite account for the extra amount of it which he has shown in issuing the manifesto under notice. He starts out by informing the people of Australia that they must contain themselves in patience until he has had time to incubate something in the way of a policy. He excuses this tardy incubation on the ground that he has not yet had time to consult with his colleagues.' Of all limp excuses, this is perhaps the limpest. Mr Reid formed this Ministry; and before he could form it, he had to consult every individual who became a member of it. Are we to suppose that his colleagues simply bolted the bait of office, without so much as inquiring the intention of the angler?",32
241,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WANTO F,That was published before the Prime Minister made his statement of policy in this House..,33
242,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,Thos e who heard the right honourable gentleman know that he did not add much to the statement published in the press.,33
243,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Every measure previously mentioned was outlined, and some others were referred to.",33
244,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The programme of the Government is merely to pass the Trade Marks Bill and the Papua Bill, and then, as the honourable member for Wilmot said last night, to go to sleep for some months, preparatory to maturing a further policy. In my opinion, no Government can pass any practical legislation in the existing position of Federal parties, and that, I think, is known to honourable members generally. An appeal to the people is the only solution of the difficulty - We have been told that the electoral rolls are not in a satisfactory state; but we were told that prior to the last elections, and since then, the Department is supposed to have amplified and corrected them. No doubt we shall always hear statements of this kind on the eve of a dissolution. I wish now to make a further quotation from the Sydney Daily Telegraph, . the official organ, of the Ministry. In speaking of the manifesto issued by the Prime Minister, the Telegraph saysBoiled down, this alleged manifesto consists a laborious essay on majority rule, as represented by Mr Reid and his new following, and minority rule as represented by all those who are not included in his fold . It has been stated that the Deakin Administration were ousted from office by the Labour Party, who are responsible for the present position of affairs. I would point out, however, that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat resigned office owing to an adverse vote upon the question of including public servants within the scope of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. He was opposed on that occasion by members other than those belonging to the Labour Party. The question was one upon which the Government had. appealed to the people, and the verdict went against them. My own feeling is that when the honourable and learned member met the House after the elections, he should have recognised that he was in a minority, and have tendered his resignation. I contend, further, that he should have adhered to the position which he assumed at the outset. He claimed that the question upon which he resigned office was one of high principle-as I believe it was. The Prime Minister should at all times be prepared to carry out the wishes of the people as expressed by the will of the majority, or relinquish office. The honourable and learned member took the view that the provision to which he objected would be unconstitutional, and he would not listen to the suggestion that the High Court should be left to decide that point. He has now consented to accept the Bill which embraces the objectionable provision, and is willing to allow the High Court to decide as to its constitutionality. What a lot of trouble we would have been saved if the honourable and learned member had taken up that position from the first? What is a good thing today should be equally good six months ago. I do not. wish to say anything with regard to the split which has occurred in the Protectionist Party. Some honourable members have been blamed for joining hands with the Labour Party, and they may be left to make their own replies. . I have yet to learn, however, that the Prime Minister has the sole right to enter into coalitions. The leaders of the coalition on the Government side are apparently prepared to swallow all the provisions in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, to which they formerly expressed their objection. Their sole object, apparently, is to establish themselves securely in ciffice. If the provision relating to the public serof ' vants of the States was unconstitutional six months ago it should be open to the same objection today, but honourable members opposite are prepared to ignore every consideration but that of retaining their hold of office. We have been told that the Labour Ministry were very much put out at having to resign office, and that they desired to regain their positions on the Treasury bench at any cost. I would, however, direct attention to the fact that when they resigned, both the Prime Minister and the? honourable and learned member for Ballarat gave them credit for the way in which they had conducted the affairs of the Commonwealth, and for relinquishing office upon a question of principle. Why should they be told now that they desire to regain the Treasury bench at any cost? I should be quite content to leave the country to judge as to the - respective merits of the programmes put forward by the Government and the alliance. I do not know that any honourable members desire to remove the present Government from office with a view to securing an increase of Customs duties. The main charges against the Ministry are, first, that they secured their present position by the adoption of unfair methods, and, secondly, that have no policy worth speaking of. I wish now to deal with the so-called polia tical machine which it is said members of this House. No doubt that machine has been successful, possibly to dissatisfaction of honourable members oppothis site. Indeed, so successful has it been, at the last general election the great freetime trade party,.every member of which is supview posed to be free and unfettered, actually emulated the methods of the Labour Party, tinuesand notwithstanding the fiscal peace to which its members are committed, they are prepared to again employ those the next election. We have been assured that they are committed to a fiscal truce, but they are careful to say that it is merely for the life of the present Parliament.",33
245,Mr CARPENTER,MOTION OF WANTO F,Onl y whilst they are beaten.,34
246,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Yes . I shall deal While with that aspect of the matter presently. repeat that at the next election it will be open to the Free-trade Party to renew the fiscal fight. If we desire any evidence of ing that, we shall find it in the statements plied by the joint secretaries of that party a representative of the press. For instance, upon being interviewed by an Argus reporter any last month, the honourable member for Lang furnished a comprehensive statement regardwork ing the methods adopted by the Free-trade Party at the last election. He pointed out for that, in conjunction with the present Postmaster-General, he acted as secretary to that body, and amongst other things he stated- . In the nomination of candidates to carry banner, we left the selection, as much as possible, to the local branches of the league. Where there was no difference of opinion the central executive endorsed the local nomination. Even where were no local branches, and the central executive made a selection, the opinion herents of our cause in the electorate was sought, and it was always with their approval that the selection was made. Speaking generally, loyalty to party selection was shown both by candidates and electors. The result was that in eighteen contested seats we won sixteen seats. These methods are a copy of those' which the Labour Party has so successfully employed in the past.",34
247,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WANTO F,What about the pledge in relation to another organization which candidates had to sign ?,34
248,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Who were the ""influential adherents"" in the local centres to whom reference is made ? Were they ""influential"" in a political sense, or were they not the leaders of all the "" isms "" who could be induced to take the free-trade side? The they honourable member continuedWe are preparing now a new constitution, with view to thorough organization of the electorates governs some and sustained effort. Honourable members opposite who have had the so much to say regarding the alliance upon side of the House, should understand that that the Free-trade Party at the present is framing a new constitution, with a to renewed and sustained effort at the next general election. The interview conWe hope in this way to form a permanent fight-' ing force, which may be used with effect when methods at election day comes round. That statement is fully corroborated by a telegram from Sydney, which is dated the 30th August of the present year, and which readsThere are signs that the protectionists will shortly have cause to regret having entered into even a temporary truce with the free-trade party. Mr Reid is giving every assurance that I he and his party were bound to respect the compact entered into with certain of his fiscal opponents the Australian Free-trade League is makvigorous efforts to strengthen and unite the free-trade party in every electorate. The council supheld a meeting in Sydney today, and came to to the conclusion that no reliance could be placed on the pledges of the protectionist party, and that suspension of propaganda or organizing work would be most dangerous. It was resolved, therefore, that the present situation made the of the league doubly important, and that arrangements should be entered into forthwith the purpose of strengthening the free-trade party throughout Australia.",34
249,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANTO F,That is a six potters yarn.,34
250,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"It is the statement of our the secretary of the Free-trade Party. If it be admitted that we cannot believe him in this particular, I trust that we shall hear no more approving ""hear, hear's"" when he there is affording information to this House. The of influential adtelegram addsA manifesto is being prepared, and after submission to the league, it will be issued throughout the Commonwealth. I think that honourable members occupying that positionshould be the last to accuse other parties in this House of a want of honour. If it be fair and honourable for them to'enter into a coalition for the purpose of combating Socialism, surely others may enter into an alliance from equally honourable motives. We have been told that the coalition was formed, not because the party which previously occupied the Treasury bench had done any wrong. or because their programme was of a reactionary character, but because of the advance which would take place in a socialistic direction if they were permitted to remain there. All I have to say is, that if , as we believe, State Socialism is growing every day, and if the movement will afford a large measure of relief to the producers, irrespective of whether they produce with their brains or their hands, we should certainly aim at accelerating its progress. Honourable members opposite never object to Socialism so long as it is confined to a section of the community. When the States of Australia were suffering financial - stress, who were the people to first ask the States Governments to stand by the financial institutions?",34
251,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,W as not . the interests of the community ?,35
252,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"That is all we claim for the Socialism we advocate. ference between honourable members opposite and honourable members on this side is that, while the former believe in Socialism for a section of the people, we believe in it for the whole people. Honourable members opposite say that the State control of railways and of the Post and .Telegraph Department is State commercialism. No matter what name is applied, we regard that control as State Socialism; and it is certain that honourable members opposite would not dare to vote for the railways or the post and telegraph systems being handed over to the control of private individuals. We have no right to say that those two particular undertakings only should be brought under State control. In England and America the railways are privately owned; and if railways may be taken under State control, so may any other large monopoly. Ask any retail tobacconist what have been the results of the tobacco monopoly in Australia. Are tobacconists free to do today all that they were free to do before that monopoly was created? It has been asserted that the policy of the Labour Party will lead to the ruin of the Commonwealth-that we propose to 'take away the liberty of the individual, and to confiscate land and all industries. Whether honourable members who make these statements - actually believe them is no concern of ours, but no intelligent man in Australia places any reliance whatever on assertions of the kind. In New Zealand there has been considerable legislation of the class which the Labour Party of Australia desire to see passed. In New Zealand prosperity is shown on every hand,. and no one in that country complains of the socialistic measures which have been put in force. v",35
253,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"If New Zealand is all right, why is a Labour Party being organized there?",35
254,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"There was. a Labour Party in New Zealand before there was a Labour Party in Australia; and, moreover, New Zealand was, so to speak, in a state of insolvency before any socialistic measures had been passed. The honourable and learned member for Angas, in his splendid address on the ethics of Socialism, said he believed in socializing monopolies. The honourable and learned member expressed the opinion that that in electrical and other similar power should be owned by the State-in short, he believes in municipal Socialism, such as has The dif- been carried out by the County Councils of England, and the Corporation of Glasgow. If the honourable and learned member believes in municipal Socialism, he ought to know that in Glasgow there are municipal laundries and municipal lodging-houses, and that out of the public funds workmen's dwellings have been erected in the place of the squalid rookeries of the past. The scheme, which is being carried out by the Glasgow Corporation will, in fifty years, make that city entirely free from local taxation. Is the honourable and learned member for Angas prepared to support Socialism to that extent? T care not what a man's political opinions may be, if he is a conservative, let him be an avowed and consistent conservative. On the other hand, if he believes in the policy of the Labour Party, let him vote according to his convictions, and not speak one way and vote another. An honourable member ought not to tell the electors, in his speeches here, that he believes in the principle of Socialism, and then record his vote in favour of those who are averse to any experiments of the kind. The honourable and learned member for Angas holds that we ought to experiment in that direction, and yet on this motion he intends to vote with the party whose avowed object is to prevent any such policy being carried into force. If anv undertaking under State control shows a financial loss for the first one or two years, that is seized upon as proof of failure. But in how many cases do large private investments absolutely fail? One safeguard is that when the State makes a mistake, it is speedily found out, and the matter put right. Would honourable members, for instance, abolish the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, which in four years and eight months has made a profit on stock and sheep amounting, to ,£28,223? that good or bad for the State of Victoria? Again, the Melbourne Cityi Council has landed property from which it derives a revenue of £ 8 , 0 0 0 per annum. These are examples of municipal and State Socialism. Honourable members opposite, in decrying and condemning Socialism, are careful enough to point to cases of faiilure where State-owned concerns have been politically managed. I do not agree with political management in State concerns. There is a vast difference between the State controlling an industry; and political management. The Governments of the States own the railways, but they are managed on commercial principles. So it ought to be wherever the Government attempts to regulate an industry for the benefit of the people. A great deal has been said about preference to unionists, and perhaps there is very little that is fresh to be! added, that question has been raised as a bugbear to frighten, so to speak, the electors against some innovation which it is held will secure to the few rights which they ought not to possess. But all the large trade union organizations - in Australia had secured preference for their members before we had any conciliation 1 and arbitration legislation. The granting of preference is no innovation. unions have gained preference by their own power, it would not be just to take from them that right by means of legislation which we profess to pass for their benefit. Honourable members opposite wish to rob unionists by legislation of that which they have already, and at the same time to bind them to work on conditions prescribed by an Arbitration Court, no matter what its verdicts may be. The Prime Minister himself condemned the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella in unmeasured terms when it was first proposed. He pointed out that 1 it would ruin the clause to which it was attached, and that it would be impossible for a majority of workers to, be obtained where a dispute extended over the whole length and breadth of Australia. But though he condemned it then, he endeavouredby means of it, to supplant the late Government, and now he is trying to carry the Bill through, embodying a clause which he knows to be unworkable. I come, by way of conclusion, to the dramatic speech delivered last night by the honourable member for Wilmot. Without wishing in any way to Is offend honourable members opposite, I say that they have no reason to feel proud that they are likely to win. by one vote - During the whole of my political experience, I have never witnessed a more degrading situation than the present one. The vote of the honourable member will make the result rather a defeat than a victory for the Ministry. It is humiliating for them to know that they are kept in office by the vote of a man who told them plainly that they ought not to be on the Treasury bench, and who intimated that, although he intends to vote with them on this occasion, they cannot depend upon him for twenty-four hours. Is this the majority rule that the Prime' Minister was to establish? Is this the majority rule bymeans of which progressive legislation was to be carried, and responsible government restored? Let us examine the position. i'ut We have the honourable and learned member for Bendigo telling us that although he will vote with the Government on the present occasion, he does not know what he will do next session if they do not bring down a progressive policy.",35
255,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Hear , hear; I am right with him, too.",36
256,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Then we have two honourable members who expect from the As the present Government a progressive policy, though the honourable member for Wilmot said last night that he would not vote with them if they did not undo the democratic legislation which some honourable members opposite assisted to pass.",36
257,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MOTION OF WANTO F,Le t them try it on.,36
258,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"He r e is an absolute admission that if next session the Government meet the House with a progressive policy they will absolutely be in a minority. I sympathize with the Government. It must be galling to them' to think that one who has supported their party through thick and thin, should have degraded himself in a political sense as the honourable member for Wilmot must appear to them to have done.",36
259,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANTO F,It shows how free honourable members are on this side to speak and vote as they like.,36
260,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"-The Minister of Trade and Customs tells us through this morning's newspapers that the Government propose to carry on if they secure the anticipated majority of two, because that is the position which' they occupied when they first took possession of the Treasury bench. I say that the position will be entirely different. When they took possession of the Treasury bench they had a clear majority of two, but, according to the speech which was made by the honourable member for Wilmot last night, that majority has been reduced' until now it is not more than a majority of one-and-a-half. The Ministry propose to retain office by the support of an honourable member who, referring to the Prime Minister, saidHe brought forward a policy which is practically the same as that which the Labour Government had proposed. But he says, "" Only let me get into recess-let me have one of those sleeps lor which I am so famous-and I will come down next session and astonish you."" That is practically what it amounts to, and nothing else. when the leader of the Opposition brings forward a motion of no-confidence, the Prime Minister, in his own defence, says, "" If I had the power I would repeal a certain section in the Post and Telegraph Act, and also a certain section in the Immigration Restriction Act j but I have not the power."" Well, if he has not the power, what right has he to be there? The Government are kept in office by the vote of an honourable member, who says they have no right to be there, and that he will assist to keep them there only if they will consent to do that which more than three-fourths of their supporters will not agree to. Will the honourable member for Dalley record a vote in favour of either the amendment or repeal of the Alien Immigration Restriction Act? Will any honourable member on the opposite side do so? If we are to believe press reports of the honourable member's statements, he said a fortnight ago that he proposed' to vote in such a way as to bring about a dissolution. At that time it appears the honourable member did not care what condition the rolls were in, and whether the Labour Party was organized or not. The honororable membersubsequently paid a visit to his electorate, and we now find that his only reason for recording his vote in the way he announced last night, is that he is afraid to go to the people. Honourable members on the other side talk much of majority rule, and their respect for the verdict of the people; but the honourable member for Wilmot has admitted that he is afraid to go before the people, and he has candidly confessed' his belief that if the party opposite were to go to the country at the present time, the people might decide Mr Watkins. against them. After speaking of the results of two or three recent elections which have been in favour of honourable members on this side, the honourable member for Wilmot, referring to the Labour Party as the ""unionists,"" saidFurther, I know that the unionists are thoroughly organized. I know, on the contrary, that the liberal-conservatives,I really do not know what party that can be with whom I have been associated so long, and the liberals themselves are not thoroughly organized. In the interests of fair r>lay, and with a strong desire to see the best side win when the fight takes place, I shall vote on this occasion with the Government. That is the honourable member's bald excuse for his conduct during the last two or three weeks. He thought of voting for a dissolution a week or two ago, but he is Then, now afraid to trust the people. I have shown that the party opposite has been organizing in just the same way as the Labour Party, and its members are as prepared as are those of any other party in this House. It is therefore a miserable subterfuge fot the honourable member for Wilmot to say that he will not give a vote to bring about an appeal to the country until parties are on ah equal footing in this regard. The honourable member is prepared to risk the passing-of legislation to which he is deadly opposed, to see the Commonwealth ruined, and to witness our downfall in any direction so long as by delay he thinks he will be able to bring about a state of affairs in which he and his party would be likely to win. I wonder whether the news flashed to us by ' the cables this morning, that already there is a gentleman Waiting to contest his electorate with him has had anything to do with the determination to which the honourable member has come? The present Administration is living absolutely by virtue of a minority on questions of general policy. It is not sufficient to say that they should be allowed to go into recess in order to mature a policy for next session. The free-traders in the party opposite possessed their own policy, and they now have also the policy of those with whom they have combined, and I say, therefore, that the object is not that they may go into recess for the purpose of maturing a policy to bring down next session, but simply that in the lapse of time they may gain strength to enable them to carry on with their do-nothing policy. That being the position, I trust that if the motion is defeated, the Government, without attempting to get into recess, will come down, as they have often promised, with some legislation, which will be for the benefit of the people.",36
261,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,Robertson) The honourable member for Newcastle has closed a very excellent speech by saying that he hopes that the Government will come down with good legislation during next session. I am inclined to think that the motion of want of confidence has given honourable members an opportunity to speak to their electors at very considerable length. I have no objection to their doing so.,38
262,Mr DAVID THOMSON,MOTION OF WANTO F,The honourable member is going to do so himself.,38
263,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"As the honourable member says, I propose doing so myself. Every honourable member, I suppose, speaks on behalf of his constituents when he is addressing the House. He is speaking to the people as well as endeavouring to carry out the legislation which he was sent here to pass.",38
264,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WANTO F,"But honourable members on the other side say that we represent only unions, and not the people.",38
265,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I am quite certain that that is what the members of the Labour Party do represent. If the honourable member is familiar with the literature published by the Socialist Party in England, on the Continent, and in Australia he will know that their advice is to always use the Labour unions for the purpose of advancing Socialism. That is the main plank of the Socialist movement. The Labour Party has now come out into the open and declared itself for Socialism; but it is only during the last few years that its members have announced themselves as. the extreme socialistic revolutionaries they are now known to be. When the honourable member for Boothby first entered the House, he was not looked upon as a Socialist of the deepest dye. He was known to be a reasonable man, and I suppose that he owed his election and his great popularity to the fact that he was known to be a reasonable man who was not prepared to go the same length as the honourable member for Kennedy- a Socialist of the Karl Marx brand. This discussion has been remarkable not only for the fact of honourable members speaking to the electors with a view to a general election, but also for the fact that the war has been carried into the camp of the enemy. From the beginning to the end the Opposition Party has been on the defensive. Its members are apologising for their policy. If they believe in. their policy, why should they offer an apology? Why do they not go into the highways and by-ways and bring in all those labourers who are not unionists, and tell them what a good thing their policy is?",38
266,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WANTO F,So we do.,38
267,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The members of the Labour Party are going into the highways and by-ways to bring in those who are not unionists, so that, having the unions in the hollow of their hands, they may be able to use those men for political purposes. The position I took up originally was that the members of the Labour Party were the mouth-pieces of the unions.",38
268,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANTO F,Evidentl y the honourable member has a very low opinion of the working man.,38
269,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I have a very high opinion of every working man. To a very great extent, however, the working man is quite unfamiliar with the policy of the Opposition, and the honourable member who speaks so much about Socialism actually denounced Mr Tom Mann.",38
270,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANTO F,I never did.,38
271,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,In the two speeches which the honourable member delivered he repudiated Mr Tom Mann.,38
272,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I did not, I said that we accepted him.",38
273,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The honourable member for Kennedy came to the honourable member's rescue, and said, as Hansard shows, that Mr Tom Mann was doing a good work.",38
274,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The honourable member will find from Hansard that I said I accepted what Mr Tom Mann said, and supported him.",38
275,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Mr Tom Mann is the mouth-piece of the Labour Party, and receives their emoluments for his services, and I hope that he will not be repudiated after the exposition he has given of their ultimate aims.",38
276,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WANTO F,"We stand by him, and honourable members opposite stand by Mr. Walpole.",38
277,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Accordin g to their own statement the members of the Labour Party are in the stocks. They feel that they have committed an offence, and I believe that the offence is that of not telling their constituents what their socialistic aims were, merely posing as representatives of labour-fro m the washerwoman. I think, up to the man in the counting house. We know very well that the first,act of Labour members when they came here was to denounce non-unionists by such epithets as "" black-legs."" But if . their election had depended upon the votes of only the unionists of Australia, they would not have been able to make those denunciations here.",38
278,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WANTO F,We admit that.,39
279,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The members of the Labour Party have used the unions, as M i . Tom Mann has stated, as a means to an end, and that is, to get into Parliament, and to so legislate as to give preference to their members.",39
280,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I was returned as Socialist the first time. I ever stood for Parliament, and that was twelve years ago.",39
281,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The honourable member has never denounced Socialism. He has always been ready to uphold its adoption. He is one of the most extreme men in the Labour Party, and another member who would go to the same length, is the honourable member for Barrier, a recent convert. I am rather grateful for these interjections, because they are of very great assistance when one is trying to nail down to the counter the counterfeits who. pose as representing the people and not being extremists, but who really are extremists, as far as they are able to understand the subject of Socialism. The leader of the Opposition said that this debata woulcl be a means of clearing the atmos-' phere. I have no objection to the tabling of this motion of no-confidence. very necessary, I think, that we should know where honourable members sit, and what their convictions are, so that we might obtain some satisfactory legislation, and honourable members might be depended upon to support their party. When I came into the House last evening, at the close of an address delivered by the honourable member for Wilmot, I looked round to see if he had made an announcement. I thought I might get an inkling of the nature of it from the faces of honourable members, but they were all smiling. turned out that he had announced that he would vote in favour of the Government, and yet today he is denounced on all sides. Including myself, not one honourable member, I think, desires a dissolution at the present moment, and for this reason, that while the organizations of the Labour Party are at work, our organizations throughout Australia are not active. I was very pleased however, to hear that they are active in New South Wales. While I sit on the cross-benches I am prepared to support generally the legislation of the coalition, but I am not prepared to swallow anything and everything which may be brought forward.",39
282,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WANTO F,Oh !,39
283,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I am sent here for a purpose, and that is to legislate for the good of the whole people, and if there is any tinge of conservatism in the legislation which is proposed I certainly should not support this Government, and an appeal to the country I hope would be the result. In my opinion, that appeal should not come a until there is a quarrel with another place, and we could have a double dissolution, so that the parties might be better able to carry on in another place, as we hope they will be able to carry on here. The Labour Party is organizing in all directions. In some of the States the protectionists and the free-traders are well organized, but in other States they are not, because a number of honourable members on the other side are pledged democrats. ""Democrat"" is a word upon which I think most politicians gain support in South Australia. These honourable members, by the pledges they have given, have obtained support from friends of mine who, I am certain, would not. go the full length of their policy. Therefore, I say, let us organize in all directions, and prepare ourselves for a fight. Then, if the Labour or Socialist Party obtains a majority, let the majority It was rule. But I think that when the people of the country know that the aim of the Labour Party is to make the Commonwealth a socialistic State, the working men, and the community generally, will rise up, and denounce the tactics of those who have obtained seals by a pretence. Honourable members will be nailed down to the convictions which they have expressed here-to statements such as that of the honourable member for Barrier, who said that he is a full-blown Socialist. Honourable members opposite have advanced ideas, and, as Mr. It Tom Mann says, they would go further, but for the fact that they find they are not supported by the workers. That is a severe charge to make against them. They regulate their movements by the amount of support which they obtain from their constituents. He says that he knows them to be honourable men, who are firm in their convictions, and that they would go as far as the revolutionary Socialists on the Continent if they were supported. The alliance between the Labour Party and a section of the Protectionist Party is one of which I heartily approve, because it has broken up the strongbody of extreme protectionists in this House. Those! protectionists would even have gone the length of voting for prohibition, but the Labour Party has introduced itself like a wedge, and split them in two. Now that they are divided, I hope that we shall be able to defeat them in sections. But while there are protectionists in the alliance, I think that they are supporting the Labour Party, not to obtain assistance in furtherance of the objects of protection, but to protect themselves from the opposition of Labour candidates. members like the honourable and learned member for Indi, and the honourable members for Melbourne Ports and Bourke should, when they go to the poll, declare themselves as labour members. ",39
284,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"We would not have them; they are opposed to us, and are fighting against our cause. Whilst they have allied themselves with the Labour Party, there is a savour of insincerity about their action. I hope that if they do not offer themselves as labour candidates they may be defeated.",40
285,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The honourable member's leader said that he would accept assistance from any one, even from Old Nick himself.",40
286,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"If the honourable members to whom I refer are returned as labour representatives, they will be honestly entitled to their seats; but I think that .the Labour Party will come back in a minority.",40
287,Mr DAVID THOMSON,MOTION OF WANTO F,They are going to turn the honourable member out.,40
288,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I have no fear on that score. At my first election, I fought one of the leading labour men and Socialists, one of the ablest men in the public life of the State of New South Wales, and a man of great influence in the electorate.",40
289,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WANTO F,Who was that?,40
290,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Mr J. D. Fitzranks of the Opposition. gerald/ He was a labourite and a State Socialist, and stood well with the tionist Party. It would be send a stronger man against me, and I beat him. Prior to the last election, three or four candidates were sent to my constituto ency, but they left in despair. One man, who knew every corner of Robertson, against me, and I beat him by nearly 3,000 votes. Nothing delights me more than to fight an election, and if honourable members opposite will send a good man my majority will be increased, because unfriends will rally round me in greater numbers than before. It seems to me that the protectionist members of the alliance are between the devil and the deep sea, .and do not know which way to turn. They are afraid to go before their constituents as protectionists, and the Labour Party outside will not countenance them. The manifesto of the alliance shows that the protectionists who joined it stuck out for one thing only, and that was that they should not be opHonorable posed by labour candidates. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They did not ask for that; we put it in the programme out of good, Christian, brotherly love.",40
291,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"If they are labourites, they should label themselves as such. It appears to me, however, that the alliance is only a tentative one, and will last only so long as it suits the Labour Party, which will be until this debate closes. It is known now that there will be a majority for the Government. The Labour Party has crouched for a spring. Having tasted the sweets of office, it has tried to again get possession of the Ministerial benches, with the assistance of some of the protectionists. The honourable member for Perth has stated clearly that he has no sympathy with the alliance, because if the Labour Party came into power with the assistance of the protectionists, it would have to make concessions to them, and. therefore, could not carry out its full programme. The honourable member is a Socialist, and if he cannot carry out his full programme he is willing to wait for an opportunity to do so.",40
292,Mr RONALD,MOTION OF WANTO F,He is a free-trader,40
293,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"How is it possible for a man to be a Socialist, and not be a free-trader?",40
294,Mr RONALD,MOTION OF WANTO F,Is it possible to be a free-trader w-ithout also being a Socialist ?,40
295,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Thes e atre some of the anomalies that we find in the The alliance manifesto is worthy of some attention. The Protecthird clause of the alliance programme impossible to reads as follows: Each party to use its influence individually and collectively with its organizations and supporters secure support for and immunity from opposition to members of the other party during th;; stood currency of the alliance. That appears to be the chief concession made by the members of the Labour Party to their protectionist allies. The alliance lows :agree to pass the Conciliation and Arbilration Bill as nearly as possible in accordance with the original Bill , as introduced by the Deakin Government, but any member is at liberty to adhere to his votes alreadv given. The Bill as introduced by the honourable and learned member for Ballatat embraced many provisions which have since been excised. Yet the Labour Party, for the sake of office, threw over the original Bill, which provided for preference to unionists, and also for the inclusion within the scope of the Bill of the agricultural industry and domestic servants. That measure was drafted by the right honourable member for Adelaide, a democrat of democrats, and a Socialist of the most pronounced type. He made provision for everything that the Labour Party demanded, and yet the measure was sacrificed by them. This shows that those honourable members have not been faithful to the trust reposed in them by the electors who sent them here.",40
296,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WANTO F,Were they not pledged to support a provision for including railway servants within the scope of the Bill?,41
297,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,Were they not also pledged to support preference to unionists ?,41
298,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WANTO F,Yes .,41
299,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Is not the question of preference to unionists regarded as far more vital than that' of including railway servants within the scope of the Bill? The extension of the provisions of the Bill to railway servants involves a constitutional question, and it is just possible that it might have been decided that under clause 62 they would be entitled to the same rights as were conferred upon other citizens. Honourable members have sacrificed the main principles of the Bill which their masters desired them to uphold. They were required to secure preference for members of unions.",41
300,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"How can the honourable member say that we sacrificed that principle in view of the fact that the Watson Government relinquished office rather than give wav upon it? Mr HENRY WILLIS.^-The Bill,' as amended, gave a preference to a majority in a trade or calling, but the Watson Government desired a preference for a minority. I should like at this stage to refer to an article published in the Age of 27th July, and which reads as folPreference to unionists must mean the dismissal of non-unionists; and this must take place on a very extensive scale if the principle of preference is to be applied in anything like the way proposed by the Watson Government. According to this, non-unionists are to be thrown out of employment in order to make room for unionists, and yet the members of the Labour Party claim to represent all classes of the workers. The article continuesExtreme State Socialists, who are concerned in the working of the Political Labour Councils, are acting quite logically in setting great store by the preference clause. A Trades Hall Council, bitting in judgment to determine who was to be thrust out of employment in favour of its nominees, would be almost an exact counterpart of the socialistic rulers whom such theorists as Marx and Lasalle would have installed in absolute control of the universal State industry. But the more this kind of scheme is realized in actual life, or in proposals which have been advocated in t h : arena of practical politics, the less it commends itself to common-sense people who retain their ordinary notions of justice and humanity. That is very strong language, and affords evidence that the Age is alive to the fact that the Labour Party are following upon the lines of trie policy laid down by that great writer Karl Marx, and are also largely guided by the writings of Morris on the tendency of State Socialism. The men. in authority at the Trades Hall are those upon whom Marx and Morris would confer the power to so regulate affairs that their ideals might. ultimately be realized. The Age, in a leading article published on 12th August, says furtherNothing could be imagined more repugnant to the spirit of British liberty and toleration than to permit any kind of labour organization to use a Court of law as the instrument for offering to those who differ from it the alternative of joining or being dismissed. Would it not be shameful if the Labour Party were empowered to place men in such a position that they would be forced to join unions or give up their employment? The honourable member for Southern Melbourne shakes his head. I am quite satisfied that he has no faith in such a policy, and that if he did himself justice he would leave the ranks of the party with which he is now associated. The article proceedsThe more formidable and insidious attack on all outside the unions will have the effect of alienating the sympathies of many thousands of electors. That is the day to which I am looking forward-whe n the electors will wake up and tell honourable members opposite that they have deceived them; that they have been using them as tools in order to attain their own political ends, and as a means of securing positions in Parliament in order that they may the more effectively act as emissaries of the Continental revolutionaries, whose mouth-piece in Australia is Tom Mann-on e who prides himself upon having been expelled from the principal countries of Europe, because he was a malcontent and stirrer up of discord who would possibly cause a revolution. The Age further remarksThere are a very large number of men who compelled 10 vary their employment, and cannot possibly belong to a union for each class of work which they must take up. That is one of the strongest reasons why the proposal for granting preference to unionists should be combated. who is a non-unionist might travel from place to place and be unable to secure job because he was not a member of a particular union. He might not have Parliament. the money necessary to pay his entrancefee into the union connected with the calling in which he was seeking work. He would be condemned to. it? walk along the highways and starve, and his wife and little ones would be deprived of their means of sustenance because their those Acts in themselves. bread-winner could not find the money necessary to enable him to become unionist.",41
301,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WANTO F,The honourable member talking absolute rot.,42
302,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WANTO F,Honourable members oppoParty site do not like it.,42
303,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Of course not, because is not correct. Mr HENRY WILLIS' - That is the kind of legislation upon which honourable members opposite pride themselves. lieve that when the constituencies are ganized and the people realise that those who are outside of trade unions are ostracised and deprived of their means earning a livelihood, they will exclaim, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, "" Rot I ' 1",42
304,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WANTO F,And the Labour Adminisfor tration relinquished office because they not able to enforce their demands.,42
305,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,Exactly . When they face the electors they will be frankly to avow that they are the representatives of trade unionists only.,42
306,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WANTO F,Onl y the cowardice of an honourable member upon the other side of the House prevents us from appealing to the people. ',42
307,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"It struck me when I entered the chamber last evening that honourable members opposite were very desirous of keeping away from the electors. They were simply beaming with pleasure in their knowledge that a dissolution had been averted. In regard to the White Australia legislation, the aim of the alliance is to maintain existing Acts in their integrity and to effectively support their, intention by faithful administration. In his speech the other day, the honourable member for Darare ling declared that everything depended upon who the manner in which those Acts were administered. I agree that a very great deal depends upon it. That is one of the reasons why I am prepared to sit behind the joint leadership of the present Prime MiniA man ster and the Minister of Trade and Customs. I believe that under them we shall a secure honest administration of the legislation enacted by the first Commonwealth",42
308,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WANTO F,Notwithstandin g that the Prime Minister does not believe in some of,42
309,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The Prime Minister has urged no complaint against His complaint has had reference to the administration a of them. Now that he is at the head of affairs, I trust that his administration will is be such as will admit of no cavil. Whilst I claim that the members of the Labour represent only the Trades Hall, I credit them with a' desire for extreme it legislation. It is true that they were able .to drive the Deakin Government whilst they held the balance of power, and as a result they obtained very I bemuch more in the nature of concessions orthan they otherwise would have done. We know that the first Prime Minister of the to be Commonwealth, Sir Edmund Barton, adof ministered these statutes in a way .that with was acceptable to the Trades Hall. It is notorious that the members of that body ran round Melbourne with the six hatters 'the purpose of .gaining information were from them. Those men were imprisoned and prevented from landing upon our shores, until they had obtained the permiscompelled sion of the then Prime Minister. . Mr RONALD - He simply administered the law.",42
310,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"If a man comes to Australia under contract the law declares that that contract shall be null and'void upon his arrival. In the case of the six hatters the contract into which they had entered in England was null and void when they arrived here. Under such circumstances, what right had Sir Edmund Barton to imprison them? Mr Anderson, the gentleman who engaged them, personally assured me, within the precincts of this House, that the agreement under which they were brought here was void, and that fresh contracts were drawn up and signed with a full knowledge of the condition of the trade in Sydney, and of the existing law. What we want is honest administration of the Act.",43
311,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WANTO F,That is exactly what we cannot get.,43
312,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I claim that when the Labour Party ceases to dominate Parliament we shall secure honest administration. I find that the alliance programme embodies the following aims :- "" Preferential trade legislation, including the Tariff revision shown to be necessary to develop Australian, resources, to preserve, encourage, and benefit Australian industries, primary and secondary. A Royal Commission is to be at once appointed to inquire into the necessity for a revision of the Tariff. Its personnel is to be approved by Parliament, and the Commission is to report in sufficient time to enable any. desired legislation to be introduced next session."" In this connection I would point out that at the last general election the Deakin Government announced that the issues upon which it appealed to the people were fiscal peace and preferential trade. They were successful at the polls, and the verdict of the people was accepted by the respective leaders of the three parties in this House. In support of my statement, I would point out that immediately after Parliament opened, the then Prime Minister saidThe fiscal issue is dead and buried during this Parliament at all events. Thereupon the right honourable member for East Sydney interjectedI recognise that that is the verdict of the constituencies. Similarly, the honourable member for Bland, speaking upon the Address-in-Repl v, said I share the gratification of the Prime Minister tli.it, with the last election, the issue, as free-trade and protection, has disappeared for some time to come, at any rate, so far as the Tariff is concerned. Later on he saidThe fiscal issue is dead, at any rate, so far as this Parliament is concerned. At Albury the honourable member for. Hume also announced that the fiscal question should not have been raised"" during the last election, and that it must be sunk until the expiration, of the Braddon section of the Constitution. Yet we find that some of the protectionists who followed the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, and some of the free-traders who supported the present Prime Minister, have now gone back upon that understanding, and formed an alliance for the purpose of re-opening the Tariff. They claim that certain industries should be specifically referred to the proposed Commission for consideration, and when that consideration has been extended to them, legislation is to be enacted to prevent their destruction. I maintain that there is nothing to warrant the insertion of such a clause in the compact into which they have entered. I would further point out that they propose that this Tariff legislation shall be brought forward next session. Should they achieve all that they desire, what is to prevent any honourable member from proposing that a larger measure of protection ""shall be given to any industry if he is of opinion that it ought to receive it? In all probability, those industries, which have hitherto been considered finally settled in relation to the Tariff, would occupy the attention of the House, and we should have another prolonged discussion.",43
313,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WANTO F,Bot h the honourable member's leaders are agreeable to a Royal Commission.,43
314,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The honourable member for Bourke bases his chief argument on the importation of fleshing machines, which are, however, very little used in the trade.",43
315,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANTO F,There is only one man in the Commonwealth who produces those machines.,43
316,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"And I can confidently say that very few are used. But if they were in general use, and were of great advantage to the tanner, would that not enable the latter to produce leather more cheaply ? And would the competition not reduce the price of the leather to the manufacturer of boots and shoes, thus conbetween ferring an advantage on the consumer? But honourable members opposite contend that protection should be universal; and if protection could be given to every industry and every individual in the community in equal measure, there would be no objection to the policy. But it is because protection cannot be regulated so as to give every man the same measure of advantage that we free traders advocate making exchange as easy as possible, so that raw material may be obtained at the lowest possible cost. And that would be the result, so far as the boot manufacturers are concerned, if fleshing machines were introduced moie extensively. It appears that a large order for cement has recently been placed in Melbourne. Cement can be produced at the Commonwealth Cement Works, New South Wales, at a lower cost than it can be produced in Victoria. The Fedeial spirit, however, appears to be dead in the. latter State, where there is a willingness to pay more money to a local manufacturer for cement, rather than purchase it in New South Wales. The Commonwealth Cement Works Company of New South Wales had invested £250,000 before Federation was established; and I believe that they had to pay duty on a large shipment of machinery, which did not arrive in time to escape the Federal Tariff. At these works there is the most up-to-date machinery, which in the opinion of those who believe in free-trade, is of great advantage, not only to the manufacturer, but to the consumer. machinery is in operation in Victoria, and the manufacturers are unable to compete with the Commonwealth Cement Works in New South Wales. To the credit of the business men of Melbourne, it ought to be said that the tender from the latter works was ultimately accepted.",43
317,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WANTO F,The Age does not like that.,44
318,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The proprietors of the cement works in Victoria simply ask for more protection, whereas the manufacturers in New South Wales, who can supply at a cheaper rate, desire that the exchange shall be as free as possible.",44
319,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANTO F,The New South Wales manufacturers are pleading hard for protection.,44
320,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,The New South Wales manufacturers believe that there should be a unified Tariff-that there should be no barriers between one State and another.,44
321,Mr RONALD,MOTION OF WANTO F,"They are asking for protection, anyhow.",44
322,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"It is stated that the Denton Hat Mills Company are asking for more protection. The manager of .those. pany. 9A mills, on the 21st July, 1892, gave evidence before the Tariff Commission of Victoria, and said that an increase of one shilling in the duty on hats would be sufficient protection, and that a duty amounting to 50 per cent, would be prohibitive. I wish to emphasize that statement that a. duty of 50 per cent, would be prohibitive.",44
323,Mr RONALD,MOTION OF WANTO F,That is ancient history.,44
324,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The duty on hats was increased to 3s. a hat, or an average of 75 per cent. The half-yearly meeting of the shareholders of the company took place on the 27th - January following, and the chairman, in moving the adoption of the report, pointed out that the company had made a profit of £2,000.",44
325,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Marvellous , is it not?",44
326,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The chairman went on to say that the wages list had been reduced from £9,380 to £7,443> as compared with the same period of the previous year. This is the industry to which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports desires to give greater protection.",44
327,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANTO F,It is the best industry in Australia; every man and woman engaged in it is a unionist.,44
328,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"That is the Obsolete company which sent its representative round with the six hatters in' order to gain information with a view to preventing those men' being allowed to enter the Commonwealth, because they were to be employed in a factory which would compete with the Denton Mills.",44

342,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,I thought thai the action which the honourable member took - in connection with the hat industry when the Tariff was under discussion was simply disgusting.,45

351,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I had no intention to suggest that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports had any pecuniary interest in the Denton Hat Mills. Indeed, the Denton Hat Mills Company, which is a very close corporation, composed of not so many men as I have fingers, will take good care that the honourable member has no share in such a ""good thing."" Moreover, if the honourable member for Melbourne Ports deals with the company, they will see that he sells no hats but those they manufacture, because that is their plan amongst their customers. If the honourable member were known to be in favour of introducing competition in this particular industry the company would take away his opportunity to sell their hats. As they had a monopoly of that industry until the Tariff came into operation, in all probability the honourable member would: have to shift his place of by business from No. 66 Bourke-street.",45

Why are manufacturers be taking their business to Sydney ? It sense is because of the natural facilities for which Sydney offers. There they can have water, tight up to their places of business, a plentiful supply of coal at low rates, and all the advantages in connection. with manufacture and exchange to a greater degree than elsewhere. These advantages must tell against the other States, and in favour of New South Wales. If the people of Victoria thought that in consequence of their high protective Tariff, before the Commonwealth was established, they would continue after Federation to do the trade of New South Wales as they did previously, they were bound to be disillusioned.",45

I also hope that - we shall soon get into recess, so that honourable members may have an opportunity to follow their ordinary avocations, instead of being kept lounging about Parliament House for months together.

I remember a declaration that was made by Sir Edmund Barton when he 9 A2 returned from England after the Coronation Conference, in which he said that a certain understanding had been arrived at between the delegates to Downing-street, and Mr Chamberlain. The honourable member for Hume then declared himself to be opposed to preferential trade. But I have no objection to his moving in favour of it, and shall be happy to discuss it with him.",46
363,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANTO F,"It is out of order to discuss it now, as there is a motion upon the paper.",46
364,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"It is a proposal that will receive the attention of the House. The manifesto of the alliance contains the item, "" Preferential trade to be discussed by the joint parties at an early date."" I intend to discuss it at this date. On the 6th of this month, exactly a year had passed since Mr Chamberlain delivered his famous speech at Glasgow.",46
365,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANTO F,Is not the honourable member out of order in discussing a matter concerning which a motion appears upon the notice-paper?,46
366,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"The honourable member for Melbourne Ports is quite correct. I was .looking up the notice-paper when he rose, and was about to call the attention of the honourable member for Robertson to it. If he looks at page 352 of the notice-paper, he will see that there is a contingent notice of motion standing in the name of the honourable member for Hume. That notice precludes any detailed discussion of the same question. As other honourable members have, ^however, referred to the subject, the honourable member for - Robertson can allude to it incidentally, but not in detail. Mr HENRY .WILLIS - I shall bow to your Tuling, sir, - and shall refer to the subject only incidentally. It is part of the indictment against the Government that they have not brought forward a policy of preferential trade. It is said that the Deakin Government had declared itself in favour of that policy, and that the constituencies supported it. In his Glasgow speech, Mr. Chamberlain pointed out that the industries of Great Britain were languishing, and that trade had fallen off to the extent of some £46,000,000, in-consequence of the lack of [protection to British industries. He said that Great Britain's Colonies were better customers than the whole of the European nations put together,; that he had initiated his .new policy in order that by making arrangements with .Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, and the other British Possessions, the trade of England might be resuscitated; and that while £40,000,000 represented the trade at present done with Great Britain, that trade could be increased very considerably by a compact with the Australian people through their representatives in Parliament. At the Conference held during the Coronation period, Mr Chamberlain h-ad certain admissions from Colonial Prime Ministers to the effect that they were prepared to make concessions to Great Britain in the way of preference. He says that the necessity for it comes now, that the opportunity, if allowed to pass, will not occur again, and that in twenty years it will be too late. The United States of America, he adds, is practically self-contained, and has a trade of not more than 6s. per head of her population, and that state of things may become the rule in Canada and in British North America. In order to prevent the establishment of new industries, a compact should be arrived at With Australia and other British Possessions, so that this trade for the future should be retained for Great Britain, for, while the population is now not more than 11,000,000, in the course of years it will amount to 40,000,000, and the trade will equal in volume that of the United States. So he says that a great opportunity presents itself - at this moment. We must remember that Australia will not always be a onehorse country with a single industry, and no diversity of employment; so we should say to the Australian people, "" Do not increase your Tariff walls against us, but pull them down where that is necessary to the success of this policy, to which you are committed."" Every industry established in Australia is to remain as it is. We are not to increase our Tariff walls, nor are we to establish any new industries. We are to allow our tin-plate and' iron industries remain in abeyance, so that our trade with Great Britain shall be in the products of those industries, and of others which have not yet been established here.",46
367,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANTO F,Mr Chamberlain corrected that afterwards.,47
368,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Jus t as the United States of America has covered all the ground of the primarv and secondary industries, so in Canada they have covered all the ground of the primary industries and a great deal of the ground of the secondary industries. But in Australia, while we have covered some of the ground in the primary industries, we have so far covered very little of the ground of the secondary industries; and therefore Mr. Chamberlain would say to Australia, ""You should stop; you should raise your Tariff no higher.""",47
369,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANTO F,""" Against us "" ?",47
370,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Exactly; against Great Britain. His contention is that we should allow our industries to remain as they are, and should establish no new industries.",47
371,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANTO F,He corrected that afterwards.,47
372,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"If the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has read the compilation of speeches. delivered by Mr Chamberlain to which I am referring, he will find that that statement has never been denied or corrected in any way.",47
373,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I beg the honourable member's pardon, it has.",47
374,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I give honourable members my word of honour that I have looked for such a correction in vain, because I knew that protectionists when they were driven into a coiner would say that Mr Chamberlain had changed his mind. Looking through this compilation of his speeches, I cannot find that Mr. Chamberlain has ever said anything contrary to what I have stated.",47
375,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Does the honourable member assume that because he has not seen a correction of the statement, no such correction has ever been made?",47
376,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I may tell the honourable member that there is a preface by Mr Chamberlain himself to this comto pilation of speeches, in which he says that he has corrected them all, and yet there is no correction of the statement to which I have referred.",47
377,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANTO F,He has made the correction in a later speech.,47
378,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"Mr Chamberlain further says :- "" Do this as kinsmenwithout regard to your important interests."" ""This,"" he says, ""is the parting of the ways."" In twenty years' time it will be too late, and if no action is taken Canada will fall to the level of the United States of America, and Australia and South Africa will ultimately follow. He says that in return for moderate preference the Colonies will gfve Great Britain substantial advantages. This is his statement, made from one end of England to the other, and he has no intention that Australia should raise her Tariff against Great Britain, or establish any industry which she has not already established.",47
379,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANTO F,Utte r rubbish.,48
380,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"He says, furtherThey will not arrange for Tariffs in future to start industries in competition with those are in existence in the mother country. He agrees that they will maintain their existing industries, but says that they will not establish others. What, then, becomes of this profession of belief in preferential trade by honourable members led by the honourable and learned member for Indi?",48
381,Mr ISAACS,MOTION OF WANTO F,Does the honourable member ' for Robertson oppose preferential trade ?,48
382,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I shall tell the honourable and learned member for Indi what I am in favour of at a later stage. Just now I desire to say something about what the honourable and learned member is himself in favour of. Mr. Chamberlain further says that, according to the Board of Trade, what he proposes will result in the employment in England of 166,000 men at 30s. a week. How are more men to be employed unless there are more manufactures? Does this not mean that there should be increased employment in industry? Honourable members will read in today's newspapers that in Bedfordshire, Mr Chamberlain, on the 6th October, repeated the very same argument. He inquires what it is that the Colonies ask for, and he says that Great Britain cannot give them a preference on raw material. This is common-sense on Mr. Chamberlain's part. When he is dealing with protection he is not so foolish as to propose to tax raw material required by the manufacturer. A few days ago, I met a manufacturer in Sydney, who was talking free-trade, and I said to him, "" I thought you were a protectionist."" ""Oh, yes,"" he replied, "" we get 12it per cent, under the Tariff, but I find that I could do much better under free-trade."" This gentleman is Mr Wearne, whose industry is the manufacture of fireproof safes, and ""he has found that owing to the duties imposed, the increased cost of the material he uses in the manufacture of his safes more than balances the protection he is given on the manufactured article. It is foolish of protectionists to try to protect everybody, because it is impossible to give every man protection without doing injustice to some. Every man is protected when commerce is untrammelled. It appears to me that Mr Wearne's industry will be stamped out by the taxation which has been imposed on the raw materials he uses. Mr Chamberlain proposes to increase the duties on importations of flour in order to re-establish which the milling industry in Great Britain. So that our milling industry must suffer under this policy of preferential trade, because Mr Chamberlain desires to retain the manufacture of flour for Great Britainan industry that has gone very largely out of existence, because of the importations to that country.",48
383,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANTO F,Flou r is not exported now-whea t is.,48
384,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,Exactly ; but from other parts of the Empire which do supply breadstuffs it is quite possible that flour might find its way into Great Britain.,48
385,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANTO F,It does now.,48
386,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"However , in investigating the matter, Mr Chamberlain finds that it would be necessary to stipulate that there should be a duty on flour, so as to re-establish the milling industry. But under his scheme, the bacon industry would receive no consideration. There would be a preference given to Colonial wines. It is shown that the wine indus?ry of Australia does not amount to £200,000 per year, so that the preference to Australian wine would not be great. Mr Chamberlain expects to receive about £^9,000,000 on manufactures from foreign countries, but my chief consideration at this moment is to show who would have to pay for this preference given to the Colonies, and that Australia would not benefit to any great extent; indeed, she would lose,' and would be detrimentally affected in every way under his proposals. The duty on foreign manufactures is nor to exceed an average of 10 per cent, ad valorem, and presumably Colonial manufactures are to be .admitted free: The fallacies of the scheme are exposed in the Daily News of 8th October by Mr: Chiozza-Money. Taking food alone the imports in 1892 from self-governing Colonies were:-Fro m Canada, £13,381,000; from Australia, £3,011,000; from New Zealand, £4,839,000; and from South Africa nothing. It is clear, therefore, that Mr Chamberlain's scheme would do nothing for South Africa, and chiefly concerns Canada. Taking the corn tax of 2 s. per quarter, the Treasury would receive 6d. per cwt. on the foreign supply, representing a sum of only £31300,000; and the consumer would pay 6d. per cwt. on the whole supply, representing £8,175,000; but the Colonies would get only £875,000, Australia getting less than one-seventh. Taking the meat tax of 5 per cent., the Treasury would receive 5 per cent, on the foreign supply only, equal to £1,350,000; and the masses of the people would pay on the whole importation £3,975,000; but the Colonies would get only £375»°°°",48
387,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANTO F,I am afraid that the honourable member is. entering rather into detail.,49
388,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"It is necessary to give so much detail, because I intend to show presently what all these sums amount to. Taking the dairy produce tax of 5 per cent., the Tieasury would receive 5 per cent, on the foreign supply only, amounting to £1,300,000; and the consumer would pay on the whole importation £4,150,000; but the Colonies would get only £350,000. To sum up in a sentence, the consumer would pay £16,300,000 to give the Treasury only £5,950,000 and British Colonies only £1,500,000. To put it in another way, the British people would have to pay £ 1 1 to put £ 1 into colonial pockets, or more truly, into Canadian pockets, as Australians would receive but 2s. 6d. of this sum. This is the amount of taxation' upon the foodstuffs of Great Britain for the benefit of the Colonies. In the course of his remarks, Mr Chamberlain went on lo show that in Great Britain, where breadstuffs are raised to the extent of one-half of the consumption, the proposal would give to the land-owners the opportunity of gaining a larger amount of rent for their holdings, and it might to some extent be the means of putting larger areas under cultivation. But he says further that while the tax would be paid on all foreign imports, the duty would be paid by the foreigner. That fallacy, of course, is exploded. If the foreigner is to pay the duty on these breadstuffs, does it not go to show that the Australian people would get no higher price for their goods. The whole scheme has broken down under its own weight, and the people of Great Britain are not likely to grant to the Colonies a concession of such a character as would penalize the masses of the people of Great Britain to the extent of depriving the poorest of them of their daily bread - Karl Marx, the great apostle whom the labour members follow, says that when free-trade came in in Great Britain, between the forties and the sixties, it was found that, in the trade union centies, where the artisans of the highest class were employed, the men were not receiving sufficient nourishment from the food they were able to procure with their earnings; in fact, they were getting even less than sufficient to prevent diseases caused by hunger. We are asked to put back the clock. After their great fight, the repealers of the corn laws put away their battle-axes, and disbanded their union. For a second time the union has had to be brought into existence for the purpose of preventing the people of Great Britain from losing the privilege of gaining their daily bread at the lowest possible cost, so that their wages might be relatively raised. Let honourable members listen to a protest recently cabled to the honourable member for Bland by the trade unionists of England, and published in the press here under the headings- "" Preferential trade. Appeal by British workers to their Australian brethren. Higher ' motives than Tariffs. Chamberlainism refuted. The feeling of mutual kinship. Is it based on sordid considerations?"" It is as follows: In connection with the attitude of the Australian Labour Party towards preferential trade* Mr John Burns (Radical member in the House .of Commons for Battersea), has cabled as follows to Mr J. C. Watson, ex-Prime Minister of Australia, and leader of the Australian Labour Party :- "" I adhere to the facts and the appeal set forth in the manifesto issued by the British labour representatives in the House of Commons in August, 1903, to the labour representatives in. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Mr. Chamberlain's proposals for preferential Tariffs,' whatever their application to Australian products, would undoubtedly mean a rise in the price of foodstuffs for British workers."" Yet honourable members of this Parliament who claim to represent the masses, are pledging themselves in favour of preferential trade proposals which will put j£i6,000,000 of taxation on the people of Great Britain, or, if the remission of the tea and sugar duties suggested by Mr. Chamberlain - takes place, a taxation of £9,009,000. Mr Burns goes on .to sayI still believe that the Australasian workers will not ask for anything, imposing this disability upon the workers of the mother land. I appeal to them to seriously bear this in mind when considering fiscal proposals of any .description. Is the appeal of this great leader to be in vain ? Are honourable members greater than their leaders? Mr Burns continuesI do not share Mr Chamberlain's assumption that preferential Tariffs provide the only system which will keep the Empire together. I would fee surprised to near that the kindly feelings which Australians entertain towards the mother land were based on such sordid considerations. Those are the sordid considerations of the party in alliance with the honourable and learned member for In d iA feeling of mutual kinship, when it does come, must spring from higher motives than Tariffs can ever possibly supply. Then Mr Richard Bell, M.P,* and chairman of the Leeds Trades Union Congress, cablesI feel sure that the Austratian Labour Party does not desire to adopt anything which, while it might offer some little advantage to tbem, rould entail tremendous sacrifices upon British workers and their families. I believe that labour, both in the Colonies and in the mother land, does hot desire to gain any advantage for itself, in each instance at great expense io the other. These men speak on behalf of the masses of England - They speak for many who are practically in a state of starvation, because the number of deaths from starvation in England today is 'appalling. Mr Bell continuesI appeal to Australian workers to respect the feelings of their British comrades, so emphatically expressed at the Congress, where representatives of all sections of British labour unanimously, declared against any system of preference. These leaders of the working people of Great Britain say to the honourable member for Bland and his party, "" You either do not understand the facts, or you are insincere."" In their cablegrams 'to. their Australian comrades ",49
389,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I have been listening for some time past to the honourable member's remarks, to seei f he wis referring only incidentally to this question; hut as it appears to me that he is discussing it very fully, I cannot, in view of the fact that there is upon the business paper a notice of motion dealing with the question, allow him to proceed further on his present line of .argument.",50
390,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MOTION OF WANTO F,"I ask leave, Mr Speaker, to continue my remarks on the.next day of sitting. Leave granted; debate adjourned. House adjourned at 4.18 p.m.",50
