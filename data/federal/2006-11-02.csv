2,Ms JULIE BISHOP,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Curtin-Minister for Education, Science and Training and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women's Issues) (9.01 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005 to provide for the return of a volunteer site to its traditional owners should such a site be forthcoming and ultimately selected for the Commonwealth radioactive waste management facility. Existing provisions of the act allow a land council to nominate Aboriginal land within the area of the land council as a potential for the facility. Australian regulatory requirements require radioactive waste facilities not be sited where land ownership rights or control could compromise retention of long-term secure management of the facility. It is for this reason that the act allows the Commonwealth to acquire all rights and interests in a volunteer site. However, the Australian government also recognises that Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory fought hard for the right to own their land. Honourable members will know that the original Northern Territory land rights legislation was passed in this parliament under a coalition government. Through this bill, the Australian government seeks to ensure, should a volunteer site be selected for the facility, that there is a mechanism for the land to be returned to its original owners or successors when the site 2006 is no longer required for the facility. We will not be returning a dirty or polluted site. The bill provides that the return may not be effected unless the independent regulator, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, has released the facility from regulatory control. Further, the traditional owners must consent to the return of the site. However, in the extremely unlikely event that contamination occurs as the result of use of the land for the facility, the traditional owners will be indemnified by the Commonwealth against any resultant claims. A related purpose of this bill is to amend both the act and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to prevent politically motivated challenges to a land council nomination. Honourable members may have seen speculation in the media that Aboriginal land site in the Northern Territory may be nominated for the facility. It is no secret that the Northern Land Council has been supportive of provisions in the current act that allow Aboriginal landholders to consider nominating their land. I welcome the Northern Land Council's positive and constructive assistance in providing factual information and facilitating discussions with Aboriginal groups about the government's plans for a Commonwealth radioactive waste management facility. It is an indication of the strength and relevance of the council that, in the face of ideologically driven opposition, it is prepared to actively support communities in their wish to improve the opportunities for themselves and their children. The bill addresses issues that the Northern Land Council has indicated are of particular sensitivity for Aboriginal groups that may be considering putting forward their land for nomination. After claiming that the Australian government was imposing a radioactive waste facility on the Northern Territory against community wishes, I assumed that opponents of such a facility would welcome the construction of the facility on a site volunteered by the local landholders. Instead, opponents of the facility have indicated that they are prepared to oppose the facility on a volunteer site as well. Current provisions of the act set down a number of criteria that should be met if a land council decides to make a nomination. Importantly, these criteria include that the owners of the land in question have understood the proposal and have consented to the nomination, and that other Aboriginal communities with an interest in the land have also been consulted. I can assure the House that, should a nomination be made, I will only accept it if satisfied that these criteria have been met. What the government will not accept is speculative legal challenges against the land council or me, as minister, that are designed not to ensure that Aboriginal people have given informed consent to a land nomination but to frustrate and delay establishment of the facility. Those members who are in favour of safe and responsible management of radioactive waste, and those members who are in favour of Aboriginal people being able to make their own decisions about infrastructure developments on their own land, should support these amendments. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2006 MEASURES No. 6) BILL 2006 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Dutton. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
3,Mr DUTTON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Dickson-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (9.07 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 6) Bill 2006 bill amends various taxation laws to implement changes and improvements to Australia's taxation system. Schedule 1 amends the list of deductible gift recipients in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Deductible gift recipient status will assist the listed organisations to attract public support for their activities. The organisations being assisted under this measure include the Don Chipp Foundation Ltd from 27 June 2006, the Lingiari Policy Centre from 26 July 2006, Non Profit Australia Ltd from 29 June 2006 until 28 June 2009, Playgroup SA Inc. from 6 August 2006, Point Nepean Community Trust from 27 June 2006 until 10 June 2009, St Mary's Cathedral Restoration Appeal Inc. from 27 April 2006 until 26 April 2007 and the Ranfurly Library Service Inc. from 3 May 2006. In addition, this measure extends the GGR listing of the Bowral Vietnam Memorial War Trust Inc. until 15 August 2006, Dun Lewis Youth Development Foundation Ltd until 31 December 2006, the St Paul's Cathedral Restoration Fund until 22 April 2008 and Yachad Accelerated Learning Project Ltd until 30 June 2008. This is a significant commitment by this government to those organisations and I take the opportunity to acknowledge the wonderful work by each of them. Schedule 2 makes a number of technical corrections, amendments and general improvements to the taxation laws. These amendments include fixing duplicated definitions, missing asterisks from defined terms and incorrect numbering. The most significant of the amendments formalises the transfer of the power to appoint acting commissioners of taxation during periods of absence from office, from the Prime Minister to the Treasurer. While not implementing any new policy, these amendments are part of the government's ongoing commitment to improve the quality of the taxation laws. Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned. NA Approval of Proposal",20
4,Mr BILSON,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"Dunkley-Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence) (9.09 am)-On behalf of the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, I move: That, in accordance with section 5 of the liament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for work in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 30 October 2006, namely: Reconciliation Place artworks. The National Capital Authority, in consultation with the Office of Indigenous Coordination, has developed a design proposal for three new artworks at Reconciliation Place. The proposed artworks focus on the themes of the Torres Strait Islands, fire and water, and art within the context of reconciliation. The proposed artworks are to be located on the western promenade of Reconciliation Place adjacent to Questacon. The placement and configuration of the artwork allows for a variety of interpretive experiences and all artworks will incorporate in-ground lighting. The proposed artworks will complement existing art located on the western promenade of Reconciliation Place, including the separation, strength, service and sacrifice and Ngunnawal artworks. The National Capital Authority also proposes to install a single post with a top mounted light to the north-west existing Gatjil Djerrkura stone artwork. The National Capital Authority has advised that it is prepared to grant works approval to the proposal pursuant to section 12(1)(b) of the Australian Capital Territory Planning and Land Management Act 1988. The approval of both houses is sought under section 5(1) of the Parliament Act 1974 for the three proposed Reconciliation Place artworks and the post light. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. NA Public Works Committee Reference",21
5,Mr BILSON,COMMITTEES,"Dunkley-Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence) (9.11 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the ParPublic Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Redevelopment of the propellant manufacturing facility at Mulwala, NSW. The Department of Defence proposes to redevelop the gun propellant capability of the Mulwala Propellant and High Explosives Production Facility at Mulwala, New South Wales. The works now proposed are needed to overcome plant obsolescence, improve safety and meet environmental regulations. The main components comprise new nitrocellulose, propellant and solvent production facilities, a new ballistics laboratory and a confined burn facility to eliminate open burning of energetic waste. The estimated out-turn cost of the proposal is $338.7 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, the works will be committed by mid-2007 with the objective of having them completed by the end of 2011. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to.

Report-by leave-adopted. MEDIBANK PRIVATE SALE BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 1 November, on motion by Mr Nairn: That this bill be now read a second time.",22
8,Mrs ELLIOT,COMMITTEES,"I continue speaking today about my very strong opposition to the Medibank Private Sale Bill 2006 and the sale of Medibank Private. I very strongly oppose the sale for a variety of reasons, but my main concern is that premiums will undoubtedly rise once the sale goes through. That is a concern that many locals have expressed to me, particularly the many pensioners who live in the electorate of Richmond. As I have already said, as a precursor to the sale of Medibank Private we saw the closure of the Medibank Private office at the Centro Tweed Shopping Centre, Tweed Heads, just before Christmas. The distress that caused throughout the community was Reference quite extreme. I would like to give just one (9.13 example: Mr Derek Andrews, who is 77 years old and is a local from Kingscliff, was doubly disappointed when he tried to pay his Medibank Private premium at the Tweed Heads office. He went there and found that not only had the health fund office closed down but the nearest office was on the Gold Coast and that that office does not accept cash. So Mr Andrews, a pensioner, had to battle through the traffic to get to the Medibank Private office at the Pines Shopping Centre, Elanora, in Queensland. He was then forced to convert his annual premium of Report $1,575.60, which is a lot of money, from cash to two money orders. So there we have it: Mr Andrews goes to the Medibank Private office at Tweed Heads, finds that it is closed, battles through the traffic to get to the Gold Coast and is then told that it is a cashless office. He then had to get money orders, which meant he had to find the nearest post office and then had to spend another $6 on top of the premium to get the money orders. This has caused huge distress to Mr Andrews and to many other people who were not aware that this office was to be closed. What is most annoying is that, between the Gold Coast and Lismore, there is no Medibank Private office, and we are certainly going to see a lot more closures right across Australia when it is sold. The closure of the Tweed Heads office was certainly an indication that Medibank Private was going to be up for sale. It is unfair, particularly to the people in the electorate of Richmond, because we now have four Medibank Private offices on the Gold Coast and one down in Lismore. But for a very large number of pensioners it will be very difficult, particularly for Mr Andrews. It is not just this side of the House that opposed to the sale of Medibank Private; it is not just the Labor Party. We are hearing from the Independents, the Greens and the Democrats as well. But there are many others in the community who have declared their opposition to the sale, and the list includes the Doctors Reform Society, the Community and Public Sector Union, the Health Services Union and the Save Medibank Alliance, a group that includes Professor John Deeble, one of the founders of the original Medibank, and Ray Williams, a former general manager of Medibank Private. Even the Australian Medical Association is opposed to the sale. So all these different groups are telling the government that it should not proceed with the sale of Medibank Private. The Australian Medical Association made a submission to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on the proposed sale of Medibank Private. They raised serious concerns about higher premiums for Medibank Private customers and reduced competition in the private insurance sector. The President of the AMA said that higher premiums would be inevitable as the new owners sought to maximise returns to shareholders. He went on to say: There is also a chance of flow-on higher premiums across the whole private health sector because of reduced competition. But the extent of the rises would depend on whether the new owner is a new or an existing player in the sector. Of course, the AMA is looking at this from the proper perspective-that is, the health care interests of the people of this nation, and the health care interests of the members of Medibank Private particularly. Even Mr Russell Schneider, from the Australian Health Insurance Association, who represents private health insurance funds other than Medibank Private, has raised concerns about the proposed sale. He does not accept this government's view that the sale will be good for is the private health insurance sector. He said: Health funds need to be concerned for the well-being of their members, not their shareholders. And that is the change we will see when Medibank Private is sold: the focus will be on the shareholders. He further said: It is certainly not in the interests of the members, nor is it in the interests of health care for the people of this nation to sell Medibank Private. Two main arguments in favour of the sale have been put forward by the government. The first relates to competition and the second relates to a conflict of interest from being an owner and a regulator. I will look firstly at the competition argument put forth by the government. The Parliamentary Library research brief examining the government's competition based arguments for the sale found that there was: ... little evidence to support assertions that a privatised Medibank Private would be more efficient, competitive and less expensive for consumers. So a publicly listed Medibank Private would not have any more freedom under the act and regulations than it has under its current ownership arrangements. In its 1996 submission to the Productivity Commission's inquiry into private health insurance, Medibank Private said: A situation where a for-profit ‘middleman' (health insurers) is also involved [in addition to private for-profit healthcare providers] will unnecessarily escalate the premium (price) for private health insurance. The government says that a privately owned Medibank Private would have lower management expenses than it achieves under the current ownership arrangements. The thing is, there is nothing that a privatised Medibank Private could do to achieve such efficiencies that it cannot do under its current ownership status. In any case, if we are looking at a reduction in management expenses, whether that be rent, staff, salaries or marketing costs, that will ultimately mean a reduction in the number of offices and the number of staff. So we will see services fall as premiums rise. This is undoubtedly what everyone is aware of. As I say, locals whom I speak to are aware of that and we are hearing from many different medical associations and other bodies that are aware of that it seems that everyone in the community is aware of what the reality of the sale of Medibank Private will mean except for those in the Howard government who are not prepared to listen to what people are saying about this. The other argument made by the government is that selling Medibank Private will remove the government's conflict of interest in being both industry regulator and owner of the main health fund. Medibank Private receives no obvious regulatory advantage over other health benefits organisations. Indeed Medibank Private was separated off from the Health Insurance Commission by this government in 1997. The health minister at that time said in his second reading speech: ... the separation of Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission, HIC, and the creation of a new Medibank Private corporation. Through the separation, the government will ensure that Medibank Private cannot be perceived to have any competitive advantage over other private health funds through its association with Medicare or other government program functions of the HIC. It reinforces the government's commitment to the principle of competitive neutrality. Yet, we have heard from the government that Medibank Private has to be sold because it has an unfair competitive advantage. In 2003, the government sufficiently addressed the conflict of interest issue when it decided to make the Minister for Finance and Administration the sole Commonwealth shareholder of Medibank Private. This, according to a joint press release issued by the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Minister for Finance and Administration on 17 June 2003, was to ‘provide a clear distinction between the Commonwealth's roles as industry regulator and business owner'. There is also a question of legality. No doubt the House is very aware that the Parliamentary Library has produced a research brief which has raised serious issues about the proposed sale of Medibank Private. The government got some legal advice but, to the absolute credit of the Parliamentary Library team, the Bills Digest did not shy away from their research findings and raised some very serious concerns about the accuracy of the legal advice the government has received on this matter. As expressed in the research brief, it is arguable that members of Medibank Private would be entitled to compensation if the terms of the sale do not adequately account for their right to the benefit of fund assets. Whilst denying that the warnings contained in the research brief were credible in respect of compensation to members of Medibank Private, the government simultaneously took steps to protect itself against just such an event occurring. The bill contains a provision to ensure that the fund, not the Commonwealth, is liable for any compensation claims that arise from the sale. The bill allows for pre-privatisation profits ‘surpluses' to be re-distributed to shareholders following privatisation. It also acknowledges the prospect of a legal challenge to the sale and has included a clause which makes Medibank Private rather than the Commonwealth liable for any compensation which might arise from such action. It seems that law and justice are not always the same thing and, indeed, nor are legality and morality on many occasions. It seems absurd that the government is moving the onus onto Medibank Private, obviously aware that some major legal issues will come about from the sale of Medibank Private. The last issue I want to raise concerning this ideologically driven legislation-and I believe it is a very important issue is that the bill now contains safeguards directed at securing the Australian character of Medibank Private and at ensuring diversified ownership. It should be noted, however, that these provisions will expire five years after Medibank Private is sold. In five years time, there will be no limit on how much of Medibank Private can be owned, controlled and operated by one person or company. Further, after five years there will be no restrictions on foreign ownership of Medibank Private. After five years there will be no requirement that central management and control is exercised in Australia, no requirement that there is a substantial business and operational presence in Australia and no requirement that directors are Australian or that Medibank Private remains incorporated in Australia. This means, yet again, that one more of Australia's national companies can be owned and controlled by foreign investors. This part of the legislation distresses ple. Everyone can see exactly where the sale is leading. We will see premiums rise, services fall and, after five years, Medibank Private being taken over by a foreign company. It is of particular concern to many locals in my area that this is a foregone concluof sion, that this will be the end result should the sale of Medibank Private go through. The government decision to sell Medibank Private is based upon an ideologically driven privatisation agenda and without regard for the implications of this sale on the affordability of private health insurance for Medibank members right across the nation. The government is totally disregarding the arguments put forward about the sale. The government has not provided any evidence that members of Medibank Private or, indeed, private health insurance holders generally will be any better off as a result of this sale. The reality is that they will not be better to raise- off; they will be worse off. The government obviously does not care about the thousands of people in the Richmond electorate who will be adversely affected, particularly many elderly residentsthose on pensions and fixed incomes-who are very distressed about this. They will not be able to afford the increases in premiums. This sale does not just affect people in Richmond; it affects people right across Australia. Three million members of Medibank Private will be adversely affected. The reality will be that premiums will rise and services will fall. We will see more closures of Medibank Private offices. We saw the closure of an office in Tweed Heads as a precursor to this proposed sale. Obviously the government do not care about that either because they are hell-bent on flogging off our national assets. The stark reality of doing that is to make things harder for Australian families and workers who are already under peohuge pressure. We have seen a massive increase in the cost of living, with increases in interest rates and speculation about further interest rate rises. In my electorate this causes great distress to families, particularly pensioners who are on fixed incomes. On top all of this, we are going to see increases in premiums for private health insurance. This government just walks away from Australian families and the demands placed upon them, because it does not care. It is not interested in helping them out. Everyday it seems that there is another struggle. As I said, we are seeing the cost of living going up and prices going through the roof. This is causing great concern to people. But the government is hell-bent on flogging off whatever it can and on driving its own ideological agenda. It is doing its own thing and not listening to the concerns of anyone who is struggling. (Time expired)",22
9,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,COMMITTEES,"It was Norman Lindsay who popularised the expression ‘the magic pudding' with his book of the same name. Medibank Private is a magic pudding which would make Norman Lindsay proud. The government says: ‘We'll sell it. It would be a fine thing to buy it.' In the next few years it intends to spend $52 million of taxpayers' money to increase consumer awareness of the incentives and benefits associated with private health insurance. This will include a general marketing campaign, jointly funded with industry, to provide consumers with relevant information about private health care and its associated insurance products. So, again, we have more taxpayers' dollars in the form of government advertising to suggest that it will be a fine thing for shareholders to be buying into Medibank Private. But then it says, ‘But premiums won't go up, so the fund members will be okay.' Let us see: premiums will not go up, but it will be a good buy for investors-truly a magic pudding. Norman Lindsay would be mightily impressed. Senator Minchin says the government is not doing this for the money. He says that a privatised Medibank Private will perform better. It will be more efficient. Freed of the constraints of government ownership, public ownership, it will be a better outfit. If the government is not doing it for the money, why doesn't it just hand it over to the fund members? Frankly, it is all about the money, and most privatisations are all about the money. They are about this government-or, if you want to take the broader view, this generation-getting its hands on the money. It is a bit like kids who ask their parents for their inheritance in advance. Frankly, it is a fraud on the work of previous generations, in this case those who built up Medibank Private, and it is a fraud on future generations, as this generation grabs the inheritance and effectively spends it now. Those opposite in the Liberal Party talk a lot about debt as a fraud on future generations, placing burdens on our children and grandchildren, but asset sales and privatisations are exactly of the same character: taking the money, taking the asset, and spending it now. Medibank Private was created in 1976 by the Fraser government. It was said to contribute to an efficient, competitive and viable private health insurance industry. There are three million Medibank Private members, which is almost 30 per cent of the entire private health insurance market-a very large slice indeed. Labor oppose the sale of Medibank Private. We do not accept the primary argument from the Howard government that selling Medibank Private will increase competition in the private health insurance sector and therefore put, as Senator Minchin said, less upward pressure on premiums. The day after Medibank Private is sold, there will be exactly the same number of private health insurers in Australia. There will be no increase in competition. The AMA, the Australian Medical Association, has warned that premiums will increase if Medibank Private is sold. The economic commentator Terry MCCrann, no fan of this side of politics, has said that premiums will go up because Medibank Private shareholders will expect a dividend on their investment. Indeed. And we have a Minister for Health and Ageing who has expressed a predisposition to rubber-stamp premium increase requests from the private health insurance industry. As recently as 9 September this year, he said, ‘I certainly won't hesitate sation. to approve increases.' The government has raised expectations that it will give Medibank Private members some special rights in the float, but there is no clear commitment as to how they are going to be treated. So, in debating the Medibank Private Sale Bill 2006, we in this House are in the dark on a fundamental matter: how the existing fund members of Medibank Private are going to be treated. I would not support the legislation in any event, because I have a clear view about the virtue of having a government player in this private health insurance field. But other members, who might not necessarily share that view, are nevertheless put in the invidious position that they are expected to vote on this bill without knowing what the government has in mind in relation to the treatment of existing Medibank Private fund members. Quite a lot of reference has been made to the work of the Parliamentary Library in commenting on some of the legal aspects of the proposed sale, and I intend to also draw extensively from their material in some of my remarks on this bill. On 1 September, the Parliamentary Library released the research brief titled The proposed sale of Medibank Private: historical, legal and policy perspectives. One of the issues that that paper canvassed was of members' rights in the Medibank Private fund. One conclusion the paper reached was that it was arguable that members had the right to the benefit of the existof ing surplus assets of the fund and that a sale of Medibank Private, if it were to adversely affect those rights, could give rise to a against the Commonwealth for compensation. The research brief did not suggest that the members owned the fund or that they could in some way block the sale, but it suggested that members might be able to mount an action in the form of a claim for compenThis of course raised questions about whether the Commonwealth was the sole owner or Medibank Private's 2.8 million members also had ownership rights. From a moral rather than a legal perspective, concerns were also expressed by the Australian Medical Association, which called for the fund to be mutualised. The AMA said it doubted: ... the morality of the sale given that much of the value of Medibank Private is in its financial reserves which were not contributed by the government but rather, extracted from the members in compliance with regulatory requirements. The AMA said it was not implying any criticism of the regulatory requirements: it is the case that reserves are necessary for proper prudential management of private health funds. It said that, if the government does not wish to be involved any longer as the operator of a private health fund, ‘there is a strong case for mutualising Medibank Private and retaining the equity with sthose who have contributed to it, namely the members'. In response to this, the government said, ‘We have advice from the law firm Blake Dawson Waldron which contradicts the conclusions of the Parliamentary Library paper.' The Blake Dawson Waldron advice rejected any suggestion that the members of Medibank Private could be entitled to compensation on sale or that the members have rights in excess of those of, for instance, purchasers car or house insurance. Notwithstanding that position, the government has now committed itself to including some entitlements claim for existing members in the eventual sale plan. This may be in the form of a special entitlement to or discount on shares in the initial public offering. The government appears to recognise that these expressed legal conclusions may not be absolute, and it has also put in the bill a number of safety net clauses, including one which allows an express right to compensation for members in the event that, effectively, the Blake Dawson Waldron advice is wrong. So the issue of members' rights remains a live one. In essence, the problem with the position that has been adopted by the government is that it is conceptualising the issues narrowly. It characterises the status of members of Medibank Private as equivalent to those of purchasers of contracts of insurance. This approach overlooks aspects of the legislative regime which support a different view. Successive parliaments have fostered a regime for private health insurance in Australia that gives to members of private health insurance funds a status higher than that acknowledged by the Blake Dawson Waldron advice. According to their advice, membership of Medibank Private gives a member a contractual relationship which can be terminated on two months notice at the discretion of Medibank Private Ltd. It is worth thinking about exactly what this proposition means. If you have been a member of Medibank Private for many years, paid your contributions as they became due and acted within the rules of Medibank Private, according to the Blake Dawson Waldron advice you could have your membership terminated arbitrarily on a couple of months notice, provided they give a reason for doing so. This proposition is alarming for members of Medibank Private, and it certainly calls up the issue of the integrity of the government's Lifetime Health Cover program. Medibank Private's own website says: This Federal Government initiative rewards those who take out hospital cover early in life and maintain it, by allowing them to pay lower premiums throughout their life compared with others who take out hospital cover when they're older, or who allow their cover to lapse for long If what Blake Dawson Waldron is saying is true then Medibank Private members could effectively have their membership terminated on a whim. They would have no continuity of membership, and lifetime health cover would be rendered meaningless. The fact is that, as a condition of their registration, private health insurers are subject to a number of requirements. Included amongst those is the principle of community rating. That principle has been described by many people, including coalition health ministers, as a keystone of the Australian private health insurance system. It means that an organisation must ensure that its constitution, rules and actions are at all times consistent with the principles of community rating. That means that you cannot discriminate against any fund member or applicant for fund membership on the basis that they are suffering from a chronic disease, illness or other medical condition or from a disease, illness or medical condition of a particular kind and that you cannot discriminate on the basis of gender, race, sexual orientation, religious belief and so on. The clear intent of community rating is to ensure free, fair and continuing access to health insurance. It is difficult to conceive of a situation in which a private health insurance company like Medibank Private, purporting to terminate membership without good reason, could convince an arbiter that it was not in breach of the community rating principle. So, far from being liable to have their memberships terminated on two months notice at Medibank Private's discretion, members of this fund are entitled to retain their status as long as they pay their dues and comply with the law and the lawful fund rules. As the Parliamentary Library suggests, the Medibank Private rule concerning two months notice would be likely to be read periods. down to mean that members who were not financial be given two months to remedy the situation, as is required under the act. As to Medibank Private's present not-forprofit status, the Blake Dawson Waldron advice suggests that all you need to do is to have Medibank Private Ltd change the provisions in its constitution and everything would be fine: it could move from being a not-for-profit company to being a for-profit company. Again, the idea that a not-for-profit company which is being managed in the interests of members and which establishes reserves on that basis over a period of years can, without reference to members, unilaterally change its status and freely distribute its reserves as profit, in my book undermines the purposes of the act. To say the least, I think the position is far more complex than the Blake Dawson Waldron advice contends. On the current wording of the act it is arguable that an organisation established as a not-for-profit organisation could alter that status by changing its constitution, but it would be in breach of the act if it distributed profits. A change of status could only come about by winding up the organisation and establishing a new organisation that was for profit-and that would hardly be a surprising result, given the ethical considerations involved. Another area of the Blake Dawson Waldron advice which the Parliamentary Library has contested is the idea that the rights of members are not enforceable, apart from the right to be paid health benefits under the rules. Blake Dawson Waldron suggested that there is no procedure under which a member could compel Medibank Private to apply any fund assets in a particular way and that therefore they could simply sit on any surplus and contributors would have no recourse. The library says: These conclusions are, to say the least, debatable. If Medibank Private Limited indefinitely ‘sat on' surplus profits, it would almost certainly be in breach of the requirement in section 73AAC of the National Health Act that priority be given to the members' interests in the management of fund assets ... So it cannot be said with any certainty that members could not enforce their rights under this section of the act. These are very significant conclusions and they certainly cast a great deal of doubt over the Blake Dawson Waldron advice and over the government's belief that, legally, it is entitled to do a deal with Medibank Private however it pleases. It is worth pointing out to the House as well that the plans of the government for Medibank Private are sharply at odds with the way in which it dealt with the privatisation of the Australian Wheat Board-AWB. After the election of the Howard government in 1996, it decided that AWB needed to be privatised, but it came up with a new twist to privatisation, which was effectively handing it over to wheat growers. In the case of the Wheat Board, they gave grain growers power over the public utility and effectively gave them that public utility. In July 1999, they gave the 67,500 grain grower members of the wheat industry fund A-class and B-class shares. The 67,500 members were given 241 million shares, which represented 90 per cent of the control of AWB, and they were given shares in a government authority on the basis of the size of their holdings. This turned out to be worth some $800 million to them. So Medibank Private fund members ought to be taking note of this. If the Howard government really believes that a privatised Medibank Private will perform better, and is not doing it for the money, why does it not hand over Medibank Private to the fund members the way it did with AWB? Labor's position on this is clear. Our position is that we do not want Medibank Private sold. This is something we will be campaigning on up to the next election. We think the government's claims to be a friend of Medibank Private and a friend of the health interests of Australians are laughable. They make this claim in the parliament but they laugh behind their hands when they are doing it. We know that Medibank Private is a dominant force in Australia's private health insurance market and that the risks are that this sale will lead to increased premiums and be to the disadvantage of Medibank Private fund members and to the disadvantage of Australians generally. We will be campaigning strongly on this issue. Senator Minchin claims he has a new study on the legalities. He does not trust it enough to put it out in the public domain. We note that premiums have gone up almost 40 per cent since 2001 when the government said it was going to crack down on premiums. We are concerned that this legislation will not be in the best interests of Australians and we will vote against it. (Time expired)",26
10,Mr HATTON,COMMITTEES,"I have got a question for you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Do you trust the advice of the Parliamentary Library or do you trust the advice bought by the federal government from a private legal firm? That is the fundamental question with regard to the Medibank Private Sale Bill 2006. The answer to the first part of the question is probably yes, and the commonality among other members of this House would be to trust the advice given by the library on an independent basis rather than to trust advice that was sought for a particular end and therefore tailored to that direct end, like the advice from Blake Dawson Waldron. Why would they have been asked to do it otherwise? The government want to sell off Medibank Private. They have asked for this particular advice. They have gone off to ask for some more now that the Parliamentary Library has strongly rebutted that advice. It is a simple question: who do you trust? Do you trust an independent library source or do you trust the federal government of Australia in the guise of John Howard, the member for Bennelong, given their past sorry record for more than 10 long drab years? My answer to that would have to be that I trust the Parliamentary Library. I trust it today, as I trusted it yesterday. It is not without sin. It is not the case that it is impossible for it to make mistakes, but the fundamental driving force of the Parliamentary Library from its inception has been its independence. Despite the fact that this government has attempted to trammel that independence, to ride it and smash it into the ground, we still have an independent library, thankfully, for all members-members of the government as well as members of the opposition; members of the major parties as well as members of the smaller parties-and it is a resource for the Australian people as a whole. I congratulate the people who gave this advice, who stood up for the advice that they gave in the legislative brief and who then had the courage to back it up after the full weight of the government was backing the private lawyers. Jerome Davidson in the Laws and Bills Digest Section and Luke Buckmaster in the Social Policy Section had the courage to back their independent advice. I am interested in the fact that they were willing to do that because it often does take courage to do these things against a government that will willingly crush institutions that it has control of, as it has fundamentally changed the approach in the Australian Public Service, where people are extremely wary of the arguments that they put forward. We know the disgraceful way in which the government have dealt in the past with the members of the Australian defence forces and the way in which they compromise them in undertaking their role and the damage done to the relationship between government and those forces. We know the damage that has been done in a variety of government departments because the government have acted in a way that no other government of the Commonwealth of Australia has had the hide to do. The government demand partisanship of the Australian Public Service and silence of our library. Thankfully, these two officers of the Parliamentary Library have stood up for their original advice. They stood up for it not only for all those people in parliament who would want to defend Medibank Private but also for all the owners of Medibank Private. And they have stood up for something else: the principle that it is right to fight for a truthful position come what may. As a member of the Australian Labor in this parliament and as a fund member, I am utterly opposed to the sale of Medibank Private. I am a member of Medibank Private for one single fundamental reason: it has the name ‘Medibank' at the start of it. And guess what? The vast majority of Australians in our biggest private health fund are in that fund because it has ‘Medibank' in front of it. The reason they are still there relates fundamentally to an attachment to the fact that a government had the courage to bring in the original Medibank to provide medical services and medical insurance to the Australian people as a whole to cover what had not been covered before. There is still an absolute guarantee within the word ‘Medibank' in the hearts and minds of the Australian people that this is about being given a fair go in cess to health. Given that it is a private health fund, it is still controlled ernment at this point in time. A lot of people maintain their position, firstly, because of emotional attachment to it and, secondly, because of a recognition of the fact that it the institution that started out as the full Medibank before it was split into Medicare and Medibank Private. There is another fundamental thing: they know that health insurance undergirded by government regulation and government ownership is not about to do them down, or should not be about to do them down. But with this heinous government running the show you know that you have to be extremely careful about such feelings. What are we facing here? As a member of Medibank Private and also as a member of this this parliament, I know that we are facing one of the greatest betrayals in Australia's history, because this fund serves an absolute purpose. This is not about flogging off a bank, and it is not about flogging off an airline; this is about health, which is one of the core concerns of the Commonwealth government of Australia. Our health insurance system is the underpinning of certainty for Australians in terms of their access to our hospitals beyond free access to Medicare. In terms of private access-paying more yourself for particular referrals-this is the guarantee. The larger guarantee is this: Medibank Private is the greatest and most popular of the funds because of its association in the past with Medibank and also because of its Labor continuing government ownership and the guarantee thereby that it is the ballast in the system. If you have a ship at sea and you want it to be seaworthy, you fill it full of ballast so that it will be able to run on those seas and not be blown over by the merest gale or the merest whiff of wind. It can survive difficult times and circumstances, high seas and achigh winds. If Medibank Private is sold, that ballast gets completely washed out of the by the govAustralian health system. We have a bit of an idea of what might an have happened here. The first thing is that people in the library originally provided the is legislative brief about this matter-and they did it well, to the best of their ability. The government have deliberately gone out and bought advice to try to undermine that and to try to scurrilously put them in a position of having to argue not just about their capacity but about their whole view of this matter. The rebuttal here is a case of great courage; it is also a case of being absolutely right. In terms of this part of the argument, I conclude by referring to the question I asked you at the beginning, Mr Deputy Speaker, which was: would you trust the library or would you trust the advice given by a paid group of legal informants, where the government set out the parameters of what they wanted? I think it is conclusive, at least for those members on our side, and I think it should be conclusive for everyone who has access to the Parliamentary Library, given the fact that it has acted in an independent manner and can still do so. You would trust the library before you would ever trust the government or the advice they had bought on condition that it served their purposes. That is item 1. I now turn to item 2. Let us look at gument that the government have put about the benefits arising from this potential sale. What we have here in this sale bill is how to set up Medibank Private in order for it to be sold in the future. How do you take a government owned entity and transpose it into something that is not as it is now but something that could be structured in such a way that down the track you can flog it off? There are a range of measures in this bill to achieve that: the foreign ownership and Australian identity restrictions on directors and the national office for a period of five years, the change of the fund from not-for-profit to forprofit and allowing preprivatisation profits to be redistributed to shareholders following the privatisation, and ensuring the fund is liable for any compensation claims that arise from the sale, not the Commonwealth. What are the last two points in this bill about? They are about the government trying to cover themselves for the fact that they have so pilloried the Parliamentary Library in terms of the advice they have given-they actually know the library is right. With whatever advice Senator Minchin has come up with, the bill tries to cover off the legal advice given by the Parliamentary Library. I will move on to the transition from a not-for-profit organisation to a for-profit organisation. Given the beneficial interest that members have in Medibank Privatebecause they have continued to contribute; they have forgone getting a dividend because it is a not-for-profit organisation-the core of the Blake Dawson Waldron advice was that they did not have continuing membership because it could be terminated at two months notice. The library has quite brilliantly dealt with this and the fact that this is completely wrong. The members do have a continuing interest in it. And that continuing interest goes to what happens if the government is successful in changing the way in which this the aris constructed-and then, after they have done that, whether or not people could benefit in a particular way. The library arguedand they have been largely pilloried by the government, which has quite deliberately misinterpreted what was said-that members could not stop the sale. The library also said that members cannot just extract a beneficial interest directly, but the likelihood is that there could be action for compensation with regard to it. The best example I can think of, in my practical experience, given that I was a member of the NRMA, is the NRMA and their move to demutualisation. The government is not dealing here with a mutualised entity. There has been an argument-and I think it is quite right-about the move out of government control and ownership of Medibank Private: that there is a way of doing it without flogging it off in a private sale and taking a partial monopoly situation and turning that into a completely private monopoly with other companies being able to buy it up and incorporate it, which would then result in losing the ballast in the system. There is a fundamental proposition here in terms of what the members face. There is no proposal from the government to mutualise the fund and say that the existing members, who have contributed to it voluntarily, should then become effective part-owners of it. There is a danger, even if you took that approach, that the government could then say, ‘We'll now do what the NRMA diddemutualise and make it a private company.' In either case, going for a direct sale or through the mutualisation route, the end product is pretty simple. NRMA members were made a series of promises over a significant period that, if they gave up the nature of the NRMA as a mutual fund and if they allowed the executive of the organisation to change its mutual character and turn the company into something else, their effective investment would be protected; they would still get the services they had enjoyed and they would be protected from increases in costs. There would be a division between the insurance group and the road services group but both would be able to continue to run-and continue to run effectively. When the shares were distributed, based on how long people had been members, some people kept their shares and other people sold them. Some of those who sold them-including me-did so on the basis of a simple proposition: they knew that the cost of the road service was going to increase dramatically. And it has increased well beyond the level of inflation. The cost to direct poses. members has skyrocketed. Every single person in the NRMA in New South Wales knows that the demutualisation led to dramatically increased costs. Yet, what is the government arguing about the sale of Medibank Private? Against all of the evidence, it has the absolute temerity to say, ‘If we sell this we'll be able to ensure that there'll be a downward pressure on costs.' Where have you heard this before? Where has the government come up with the argument that there would be downward pressure on costs? It has come up with that argument in just about every step it has taken in the medical insurance area. When the government introduced a 30 per cent rebate it said there would be downward pressure on medical costs. What has happened in the interim? Anyone who is paying the premiums for Medibank Private or other funds knows that the cost of premiums has continued to rise, despite the fact that the 30 per cent kickback to people has been put into place. It has not properly addressed the aspect of cost. If you take Medibank Privatethe great government ballast, regulated and controlled by government-out of this system then there will be no effective control in private health insurance in Australia, and the experience of the NRMA will be the experience of everybody who is a member of Medibank Private. So as a federal member of parliament and member of the Labor Party, and as a member of Medibank Private-on those two grounds-I strongly oppose this bill and the fact that this rotten government would go and dud every single one of those members without compensation. Members of this government are without the merest recourse to a partial sense of conscience about what they are doing. It is an ideologically driven show and they are driven for their own private purThe government will achieve one other great single goal that they announced in 1996 in their National Commission of Audit. The National Commission of Audit, like Black Dawson Waldron, was commissioned by the government to produce a document to particular effect. It was given a set of riding structions and told to produce some results. The results produced by the National Commission of Audit were very simple. The fundamental line was that the Commonwealth government of Australia should not provide a single direct service to any Australian person. The only activity that was valid was that the Commonwealth government should audit and benchmark programs provided by others. Guess what: if they flog off Medibank Private, they will not have a government service delivered to millions of Australians to worry about anymore. They will not only get the money for it but also achieve one of their other fundamental goals: to get out of the job of being in government at all. If that is the case, and I think it is true, why don't they just get out of the way and let us take over and run the place? What they have done is run away from their responsibilities for more than 10 full years. The rejoinders that we have had from members of the government are that Labor sold the Commonwealth Bank, Labor sold Qantas and Labor did all of these things. There have only been two areas that Labor has said are not insignificant areas but significant ones in terms of the good of the Commonwealth that Labor not only draws a line in the sand on but actually digs an extraordinarily deep trench around. There are only two. One is Telstra, which this government has successfully flogged 49 per cent of and is now in the process of selling off the other 51 per cent of, part of it into a holding pattern until it can flog the rest and part of already in the T3 sale. This is a complete and utter disgrace. It turns a government monopoly into a completely private monopoly and destroys our capacity to deliver to the Australian people the infrastructure we need. The other thing we have dug a giant ditch on is the sale of Medibank Private, because in- we will not betray all of those members who have invested in that organisation and who trust that a Commonwealth government owned, run and regulated private insurer will ensure that there is a fundamental ballast in this system, that the ship of state will continue to ride the seas whether they are low or high and that the ship of state will guide them to their safe harbour in health affairs. This government would scuttle that ship of state by scuttling Medibank Private. I am utterly opposed to the effect of this bill. (Time expired)",30
11,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMITTEES,"I rise to oppose the Medibank Private Sale Bill 2006 and I declare immediately an interest: I am a policyholder with Medibank Private and, like every other one of us 3½ million, I stand to lose a very great deal by the passage of this bill and the subsequent sale. So, given that all 3½ million of us, me being one, stand to lose a very great deal, we had better make absolutely clear our personal interest in this as well as our policy interest in seeing this bill and this sale defeated. There is no doubt at all that this government will proceed after the next election, if they win it, to sell Medibank Private. That is their intention. They have made it clear, and this is one of those rare occasions when you can actually believe it. They have given this undertaking and it will be a core promise. It will be done. And that will be very much to the detriment of people like me, who happen to be policyholders, but more particularly to it all Australians who benefit from the fact that with Medibank Private in its current situation there is at least a degree of downward pressure on premiums. We do know this: that the majority of the Australian people are against the sale of Medibank Private-and with very good reason. They know that morally Medibank Private belongs to its members and they know that, as sure as night follows day, premiums will rise. Who are the Medibank Private members? They are not an elite club of Australians. They are Middle Australia. Medibank Private members represent Middle Australia, the working mums and dads of Australia who take out private health insurance for peace of mind, to make sure they can provide for and protect themselves and their children when illness strikes or accidents happen; Middle Australia, who year after year fork out ever increasing amounts to make sure they are covered in the hope that they never actually have to spend time in hospital. But Middle Australia has had enough of this out-of-touch government. The thing making Middle Australia sick is premium increase after premium increase, everwidening gaps and an out-of-touch health minister who has no understanding of their health needs, who sits and nods when private health insurers annually propose a premium increase. That is why Australians are now taking a stand and saying no to the privatisation of Medibank Private-because the privatisation of Medibank Private will push up premiums and place more pressure on Middle Australia. Following the Telstra sale debacle, we should not be forced to endure another incompetent sell-off from the Howard government. The Howard government is out of touch and hell-bent on selling Medibank Private, whatever the consequences for policyholders, the health system and Middle Australia. So here is a rolled gold promise that you can take to the bank after the next election, when we win it: we will not sell Medibank Private. I know that there is nothing more important to Australian families than their health care. I understand the struggle families that are trying to make ends meet, juggling the bills, accommodating interest rate rise after interest rate rise, and in the back of their mind they are wondering if their jobs and incomes are secure. You have to ask yourself: with a majority of Australians opposed to the sale of Medibank Private and the government claiming that our economy is stronger than ever before, why is the Prime Minister trying to sell off this Australian asset? The float of Medibank Private will not commence until 2008. This government has its foot on the accelerator, ramming this legislation through the parliament in the face of controversy, in the face of conflicting legal advice, hidden scoping studies, concern expressed by the majority of Australians and concern from the Australian Medical Association. Why the rush? The answer is ideology. It is ideology getting in the way of the national and the public interest yet again. This ideologically driven government have attempted to argue the case for the privatisation of Medibank Private on three fronts, but on each they have failed dismally. They have argued that privatisation will result in greater competition in the industry, thereby putting downward pressure on premiums; that it will enable Medibank Private to operate more efficiently; and that it will remove the government's perceived conflict of interest by being both the regulator and the owner. They are wrong on every count. On the first line of argument, this government has form. No-one can forget the 2001 promise by the Prime Minister that his election policies would ‘lead to reduced premiums'. No-one can forget that, since this promise was made, premiums have increased by almost 40 per cent. It is not rocket science. Floating Medibank Private on the share market will not introduce a single new health of insurer in Australia-not one. There will be zero increase in competition. The only pressure that Medibank Private will be feeling is pressure to make a profit for its shareholders and, if anything, that will put upward pressure on premiums. The Australian Medical Association agrees with us. On 5 September this year, AMA President Dr Mukesh Haikerwal said: ... higher premiums would be inevitable as the new owner sought to maximise returns to shareholders. “There is also a chance of flow-on higher ums across the whole private health sector because of reduced competition” ... Let me now turn to the government's argument on efficiency. Currently, Medibank Private is the biggest private health insurer in this country, with some three million members. According to the government, publicly owned companies are inefficient, but where is the evidence for that? The government insists that a scoping study undertaken by Carnegie Wylie shows that privatisation will enable Medibank Private to improve efficiency by lowering management expenses and allowing diversification of their business. The truth is this: the details of negie Wylie scoping study are yet to see the light of day. One would think that, if it came out with those sorts of conclusions, there would be no problem at all in this government producing at least an expurgated version of it, but it does not. Under current arrangements, Medibank Private has lower administrative costs than its major competitors. Privatisation will have no impact on the fund's current ability to expand into other insurance markets. For example, the fund already offers Medibank Private travel insurance. If you want to look at the other services, just go and have a look at their website. On the subject of a conflict of interest, hear the same tired line from a tired government-the claim that there is a conflict of interest on the government's behalf by being both the regulator and owner of Medibank Private. This, I might say, would also permit the government to sell the ABC, CSIRO and Australia Post. One cannot see any particular differential in any argument on conflict of interest as you look at those three bodies; perhaps that is what the government has in mind if it wins the next election. The truth is-and this is different from the situation that applies at least to Australia Post-that premithe government does not currently receive dividends from Medibank Private, so there is no direct financial incentive for the government as the regulator to provide itself with any advantage over other health insurers. It has it the wrong way around. The conflict of interest arises in the event of the sale of Medibank Private. The government is currently in a position to regulate the sector so as to maximise the share price for Medibank Private at the time of sale. Make no mistake-the only driver for this privatisation is extreme Howard government ideology. The government is so obsessed with privatisation that it is fast becoming a national joke. What the Carnext-Australia Post, the CSIRO or the ABC? Australians with private health insurance cannot afford for this government to make decisions about their health fund based on ideology. They require reform, but the truth is that this government has failed to deliver where it counts. It has failed to deal with the real cost pressures in the private health insurance sector. Private health insurers regularly report that one of the greatest pressures on insurance premiums is the increasing cost of new medical technologies. The Productivity Commission recommends a systematic assessment of cost and clinical effectiveness of new technologies to ensure we get the we right technologies at the best price. But such changes would spell reform. We know that these Liberals do not do reform. They do not do benchmarking. They do not do target setting. They do not do accountability. They govern for themselves and their ideology-they do not govern for the national interest. The longer they are in office, the more and more obvious their basic tendencies become. They do not care at all for health outcomes and lower premiums for Australian families who depend on private health insurance for peace of mind. If they did, then in the last 10 years they would have reformed the health system to ease upward pressure on health insurance premiums. But not this government-they have no eye for reform, no vision for Australia and no regard for the little guy and his family. They are just governing for themselves and not for the country. The sale of Medibank Private is bad news for Medibank Private policy holders and bad news for Middle Australia. I would like to address one other important aspect of this debate, which highlights the arrogance of the Howard government. It is a government that is willing to push ahead with this legislation despite conflicting legal advice on an issue as fundamental as the rights of Medibank Private members-the rights of Middle Australia. The bill seeks to ensure that profits surpluses gained prior to privatisation are redistributed to the shareholders following privatisation. According to Medibank Private's 2005 annual report, these profits are worth $653 million. Government lawyers insist that the privatisation of Medibank Private does not confer any rights to members. The government accepts this legal advice, but it will take all care and no responsibility. Should there be the prospect of a legal challenge to the sale, a clause has been included which makes Medibank Private rather than the government liable for any compensation. Contemplate this: the government are recklessly-against at least some advice being given to them-taking advantage of the opportunity to stock their coffers with the product of this sale. If, however, the advice on which they have operated is found to be faulty, they will not carry the penalty of it, according to this legislation; Medibank Private will. In other words, Medibank Private, if they are to carry a penalty, will find that not only will they be obliged, in the way in which they charge their premiums, to make a return for the shareholders to justify that particular sale; they will also have to make sufficient to ensure that they are invulnerable financially to a successful class action against them as the result of the deprivation of members arising from this sale. It is quite an extraordinarily irresponsible position. It will be one of the major reasons why this government will need to be defeated at the next election. They are giving us plenty of ice to skate on in the arguments that we will be able to raise on that. It is all care and no responsibility, and the rights of three million policyholders simply become a distant memory-myself, as I said, among them. Experts in the Australian Parliamentary Library have a different opinion to that of the government's lawyers. Quite frankly, I am not concerned about who has the finer legal mind; I am concerned about Middle Australia. Middle Australia is not sitting around the kitchen table and wondering whether Blake Dawson Waldron is providing accurate legal advice. Middle Australians who are Medibank Private policyholders just expect that they come first, not ideology. Over three million Australians chose the publicly owned Medibank Private as their provider of health insurance because they thought they could trust the government to look after their interests rather than their own political interests. I suggest this is a tease for the government, which hate government: they hate the theory of government; they hate the idea of acting responsibly or accountably; they think it is all wrong that there ought to be government at all. They are natural anarchists. The simple fact of the matter is that a large number of people had an expectation when they went into Medibank Private that they were being protected by their willingness both to take out private health insurance and to go with a government based provider. They joined with the knowledge that Medibank Private was a not-for-profit organisation, operated by the government to serve the interests of its members-millions of Aussies, not just a few at the top. Sadly, they were wrong. Three million policyholders will be bitterly disappointed with an out-of-touch Howard government that has used its majority in this parliament to pursue its extreme ideology. The sale of Medibank Private is a massive breach of trust. Not-for-profit status means that all funds that are not immediately required for payment to members are credited to the fund and not distributed as profits. A not-for-profit model means that members come first in dealings with fund assets. This bill will change that conduct to a for-profit basis. Make no mistake: the sale will be all about profit. Just how far does the ideological obsession extend? The bill seeks to amend the National Health Act so that Medibank Private can change its status with no obstructionno questions, no checks, no balances. The bill proposes to exclude the requirement for a notification process to be undertaken when Medibank Private chooses to change to forprofit status. It also seeks to do away with a review by the minister for health that would otherwise assess the impact of such a change on the members of the fund, including the impact on premiums and a public interest test. If you have clauses like that in the bill, how can you have the hide to stand up and say that you are going to effect downward pressure on premiums? This undermines the effect of restrictions on not-for-profits and undermines the rights of members. John Howard has changed. He no longer governs for the people who put him in the Lodge. For John Howard it is profits that come first, members last. The sale of Medibank Private is a massive breach of trust. The Prime Minister might be hoping that this debacle, once it has passed through this parliament, will be fixed and forgotten by next year. It will not be forgotten-we will make dead certain of that. Middle Australia will remember the upward pressure John Howard has placed on health insurance premiums. They will remember the day that another public asset went private and they were slugged with greater fees for less service. Health is about the future, and we are all about the future. That is why there are so many differences between our two parties on health. We will make a fair dinkum commitment to Indigenous health; they will not. We will set great national goals for the health of our kids; they will not. We will reform the complex and inefficient funding of the health system related to our hospitals; they will not. We will keep Medibank Private in public hands, because we are the party of middle Australia. We are the party of Middle Australia and we are the party of the future for Middle Australia. John Howard has changed. He has forgotten all about that. The longer he has been in office, the more that hubris has grown, the more he has decided that he and his ministers have entitlements-they can do what they like, whenever they like and they can thumb their noses at the electorate. There is a certain amount of arrogance about the way this has been presented. They know the three million members hate it. They are not going to privatise it before the election; they are going to do it afterwards. It is as though they are mocking and laughing at the Medibank Private policyholders. The Medibank Private policyholders are going to have the last laugh here. They are going to inflict some truly awful punishment on this government, and we will be overjoyed at the opportunity of seeing this legislation repealed.",34
12,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,COMMITTEES,"I begin my comments by noting with some irony the arrogance of this government and the level of importance that it puts on this debate. There is not one government speaker listed to participate in this debate today-not one government member's name appears on the speakers list. We think this is a pretty important debate-in fact, we think it has a high level of importance. We have had the Leader of the Opposition come in and join in this debate, and we have not one name of a government member on the speakers list. That in itself says a lot about rogance of this government in terms of its attitude towards its proposed sale of Medibank Private. It is my privilege to rise today to speak on the Medibank Private Sale Bill 2006. Medibank Private is the biggest private health insurer in Australia, with almost three million members and a market share of almost 30 per cent. The bill will amend the National Health Act to allow the government to sell its shares in Medibank Private. The bill puts in place foreign ownership and Australian identity restrictions on directors and its national office, but only for a period of five years. After five years Medibank Private could go offshore. That would be a sad day indeed. The bill changes the status of Medibank Private from not-for-profit to for-profit. It allows the preprivatisation profits to be redistributed to shareholders following that privatisation. That means the profits it has accumulated as a not-for-profit organisation will suddenly become real profits for shareholders. It is extremely interesting that this bill includes provisions for compensation for which the fund might be liable in the event that any legal action is taken against the sale. I will come back to this issue during the course of my speech in this debate. The one thing we need to keep in mind when debating this issue is that the Prime Minister has always wanted to sell Medibank Private. When the government came into office, one of the first things it did was to remove Medibank Private offices from their collocation with Medicare offices. What justification was there for that? We never heard any. It could only be to put financial pressure on Medibank Private and start preparing for its eventual sale. The government has been commissioning scoping studies on the potential sale of Medibank Private since it came into office. The Prime Minister has always the arwanted to sell Medibank Private and, frankly, I truly believe he has always wanted to dismantle Medicare. Let us not forget that the Prime Minister voted against the creation of Medibank, the first universal health insurance system in Australia, and he voted against the creation of Medicare. No matter what he says about the government being the best friend Medicare has ever had, we the Australian community have everything to fear from the attitude of this government and the Prime Minister to health insurance in this country and the Prime Minister's history on it. Now the government has come clean and announced that it will sell Medibank Private if it wins the next election. The government is trying to convince the public that there are good reasons for selling Medibank Private. There is little evidence to back up any of those arguments-and I would like to discuss those now. The government argues that the sale will reduce premiums. There is absolutely no evidence of this. Premiums are principally driven by health costs. The government claims that the sale will make Medibank Private more competitive. Again, there is no evidence for this. In fact, expert advice from the Parliamentary Library, through its Bills Digest, highlights the lack of evidence. It states: The Government argues that the sale of Medibank Private will lead to reduced management costs and allow the fund to pursue new areas of business but it is unclear how these improvements will be realised. The proposition is based on the conclusions of a scoping study undertaken by Carnegie Wiley, however detailed information from the study has not been provided. This means that there is very little publicly available tion to support such claims. There would appear to be nothing, from a regulatory point of view (apart from being able to distribute profits to shareholders), to show that the ‘new' Medibank Private will be able to do to improve its operations that the current organisation cannot. A privatised Medibank Private would be free from the governance burden that applies to GBEs but it is not clear whether this would significantly reduce the organisation's management expenses. A publicly listed Medibank Private could potentially improve operational efficiency through the use of additional capital to invest in improved information technology systems or organisational restructuring. However, it is not clear that any reduction in management costs would be greater than the potential increase in costs associated with Medibank Private's new responsibility to distribute profits to shareholders. There is no evidence that changing Medibank Private from a publicly owned, not-forprofit organisation to a shareholder, for-profit organisation would automatically make it more competitive in the market. The government say their claim about Medibank Private being more competitive if it were sold is based on modelling conducted as part of the scoping study. Yesterday the minister finally released the CRA International paper. It suggests that private health insurance premiums will go up as a result of the ageing of the Australian population, the increasing cost per day of hospital care and the increase in the number and value of ancillary claims. CRA notes that there are a number of ways in which a privatised Medibank Private could achieve lower premiums. However, it states that all the opportunities open to Medibank Private to achieve available efficiency improvements are already available. In other words, a publicly owned Medibank Private could easily pursue any of the efficiency improvements suggested in the report. The day after Medibank is sold there will be the same number of private health insurinformaers. Medibank Private is currently as competitive as all other private insurers in terms of management costs and efficiencies. So why would the sale of Medibank Private automatically put downward pressure on premiums? Clearly, the government's argument is flawed. I now turn to another claim made by the government, which is that, if the sale goes ahead, the three million members of the fund will not have to be compensated. Once again, the Parliamentary Library, which is an independent and authoritative voice, has examined this issue. In early September the library stated that there were legal doubts about the ability of the government to sell Medibank Private without compensating members. Only a few days later the Minister for Finance and Administration stated he had legal advice that the library was wrong. The Parliamentary Library has now examined this issue further and has provided a complete rebuttal of the government's legal advice. The Parliamentary Library states that the issues are extremely complex but that members of Medibank Private could be entitled to compensation if the terms of any sale do not adequately account for their right to the benefit of fund assets. In fact, the government must not trust its own legal advice, because it has committed itself to including some entitlement for existing members in the eventual sale plan. On one hand the government is saying that members will not have to be compensated, yet on the other hand it is including compensation in the bill. It just goes to show how untrustworthy this government is and how much we have to doubt the very word of this government. The Australian Medical Association also has something to say about the morality of this issue. It says in a media release of 5 September: - The AMA, while not wishing to comment on the legality of the situation, doubts the morality of the sale given that much of Medibank Private is in its financial reserves which were not contributed by the government but rather, extracted from the members in compliance with regulatory requirements. This does not imply any criticism of the regulatory requirements. Reserves are necessary for proper prudential management of private health funds. - If the Government no longer wishes to be involved as an operator of a private health fund, there is a strong case for mutualising Medibank Private and retaining the equity with those who have contributed it, namely the members. I could not agree more. I believe it is extremely unethical to allow the current profits made by members to be turned over to shareholders. I am one of those members. I am, as I am sure everybody in this country has been at some point in history, an original Medicare member. I was an original Medibank member before that and I am a policyholder with Medibank Private. So I am one of those people, along with the Leader of the Opposition and many others, who have a personal slant on this as well as a public policy slant. The arguments that I have outlined clearly show that there is no evidence to support the claims made by the government about the sale of Medibank Private. The government is driven to sell it off by its ideological obsession with privatisation. The government is not interested at all in the best interests of Medibank Private members, or of any other private health insurance members for that matter. It just wants to sell it off with any other asset it can find, such as Telstra. I am very pleased to be on the side of the House that strongly opposes this bill. We oppose it absolutely. Over the past 10 years the government has shown that it cannot be trusted on these issues. It will say anything it can to achieve the outcome of privatisation of the value in this particular instance. I conclude my comments where I began. I am extremely disappointed, but I do not know why I should be as we have seen it happen before. This is a really important debate. This is a fundamental debate about health issues in this country, about private health insurance and about the future of Medibank Private; yet, as I have said, while today's speakers list, which I have in my hand, has quite a number of names of people on this side of the House who wish and need to make their point on behalf of their communities, not one government member's name appears on this sheet. That in itself, I believe, says a great deal about government members' arrogant attitude. They do not believe they need to come in here and debate this issue, justify their actions and outline their belief in this on behalf of every voter and every Medibank Private member in their electorates-not one word. I think that tells the story. In the meantime we are taking our responsibilities very seriously. On behalf of all my community, I very strongly oppose this sale; I very strongly oppose the government's attitude towards it. Let us hope that maybe one day we might see some common sense from the government-but we wouldn't want to be holding our breath, would we?",39
13,Mr MURPHY,COMMITTEES,"I begin by congratulating the member for Canberra on her very erudite and incisive contribution to the debate on this very important bill, the Medibank Private Sale Bill 2006. I want to join all my colleagues in rejecting the sale-and I use the word ‘sale' in its broadest possible sense-of Medibank Private. This is not a sale of shares. It is both public and private theft. I say private theft that the entire moneys and cash reserves raised in the current fund of Medibank Private are the private property of Medibank Private members. I say public theft in that the sale of Medibank Private undermines the legislative provisions of not-for-profit organisations through the unilateral demutualisation of an entity established with the sole and substantial intent of operating under statutory and other restrictions as a not-forprofit organisation. The government is saying today to the people of Australia that any not-for-profit organisation may be demutualised-turned by the stroke of a pen from a not-for-profit entity into a for-profit entity. What a disgrace! One theme runs constantly through this government's agenda: that mere legalism is all that is required to make what is illegal legal. At the stroke of a pen, it is licit to change a body corporate's fundamental tenet of existence from a not-for-profit entity to a for-profit entity-just change the material laws, and it is thereby legal! Well, I say that is wrong, wrong, wrong. The name of the entity being demutualised today is Medibank Private. What does the word ‘private' mean to the members of this House? What does the government understand by the word ‘private' in the context of this entity? Clearly, the Howard government has no insight into the foundations of its own Health Insurance Commission laws, particularly those governing the fundamental policy rationale that Australian citizens who can afford it should be encouraged and indeed required to take out long-term health insurance coverage early in life by allowing them to take out lower premiums spread over a longer period of time. Equally, the government has yet again engaged in selective amnesia when it forgets a basic tenet of public health insurance policy: that the Australian taxpayer is the private in contributor to the funds. You cannot sell what you do not own. Medibank Private's money belongs to its members, not to the Howard government. I repeat: the money and the other assets of Medibank Private belong to its members, not to the Howard government nor to anyone else. Incredibly, this government is completely conned and swayed by the so-called legal opinion of the so-called law firm Blake Dawson Waldron, which has advised the government that is a simple case of changing Medibank Private's constitution to make it a for-profit company. I say ‘so-called law firm' because it is abundantly clear that the rank positivism expressed by such an audacious opinion as that expressed by Blake Dawson Waldron does not deserve the title ‘legal opinion'. I say this in light of the clear absence of any policy analysis outside of the most reductionist and narrow of legal interpretations. This so-called opinion pays no regard to the other legal and policy ramifications. Equally, this government has committed the ultimate act of bastardry by deliberately reducing the debate to a mere legality of the most perfunctory nature. Debate and what can only be loosely described as ‘analysis' in its most primitive sense have been totally sacrificed for a shameless and naked grab for money. In grabbing this money, this government has done nothing but commit public and private theft against the members of Medibank Private and the people of Australia. There was a time not long ago when public assets were sold and the citizens of this country understood the reasons why. Now anything remotely connected with the government that is actually private property is also being sold as if it were a government asset. At this rate the government will be selling our own residential homes back to us, saying that the land, too, is really a public asset and that we are nothing more than tenants of the Crown who never really own our land. As ridiculous and preposterous as that sounds, it is not too far from the reality unfolding here today before us with the public and private theft of Medibank Private. It is necessary to remind ourselves of why private property is so important. I cite the encyclical Mater et Magistra, which at paragraphs 19 and 20 states: Private ownership of property, including that of productive goods, is a natural right which the state cannot suppress, but it naturally entails a social obligation as well. It is a right which must be exercised not only for one's own personal benefit but also for the benefit of others. As for the state, its whole raison d'etre is the realisation of the common good in the temporal order. It cannot therefore hold aloof from economic matters. On the contrary, it must do all in its power to promote the production of a sufficient supply of material goods, the use of which is necessary for the practice of virtue. It has also the duty to protect the rights of its people and particularly of its weaker members, the workers, women and children. It can never be right for the state to shirk obligation of working actively for the betterment of the condition of the working man. I could not put it better than that. The quotation that I have just cited enshrines the inviolability of private property-property we see today being violated by the public and private theft of assets belonging to Medibank Private members, not to the Howard government. I condemn the government today in the passage of this bill for violating one of the fundamental tenets of our democracy: the principle of subsidiarity. It is subsidiarity that asserts that the state serves its people, not that people serve the state. It is the state that is here first establishing a rule that people who can afford private health care do so early in life, paying lower premiums and thus benefiting themselves by having privately funded health insurance for the term of their natural lives. Perhaps more importantly, the public policy latent in the existence of Medibank Private is that this accumulation of reserves benefits the common good of society in that this reserve of money facilitates access to funds for medical needs for all of its members, thus taking critical pressure off the public health system. All this good and well-founded policy is so reprehensibly being torn apart today by the demutualisation of Medibank Private. The treatment of Medibank Private in this way does all of the following. First, it undermines the common good of a privately funded health insurance system. Second, it undermines the principle duty of subsidiarity, which every government is bound to follow. Third, it undermines pre-existing and well-founded health insurance policies based upon the notion of long-term and early entry into private health insurance as one of the few ways to average out premiums. Fourth, it undermines the current statutory law, founded upon policy, that treats not-for-profit and for-profit its entities as obviously very different entities. This distinction was obvious-until now. Fifth, it demutualises an entity that was never meant to be demutualised. I say all this in the context of a prevailing ethic that is not even a thinly veiled attack on the most primitive and essential tenets of democracy and social justice-that is, private property must be allowed to exist for the benefit of the individual property owner and for the benefit of the common good. If these two benefits are denied, then truly it is the end of social justice and the end of social order. I say again: what is next? Where is the thinking of this government going to go next? What else will it attempt to flog off in its sheer hunger for cash? Today's bill clearly indicates that there is no boundary that this government is not prepared to cross. Indeed, the conduct of this government is truly not government at all, for it has committed the ultimate act of bastardry, as I said earlier, against the most basic obligations of subsidiarity for the benefit of its own people. Under the principle of subsidiarity, the government is supposed to perform public functions only so long as the people cannot do such themselves. It is right and proper for the government to implement a regime of public health insurance. Equally it is right and proper for the government to implement a regime that encourages those in society who can afford private health insurance to take it out early and over a long period in order to average premiums, thus reducing the premium cost of cover for the members. It is the act of accumulating reserves as assets today to pay for the future health insurance costs tomorrow. That is good governance. It is obvious and logical to make provision whilst times are good to pay for when times are bad and sickness befalls us, as it inevitably does. It is madness, in my view, to encourage an entire nation to contribute to a Medibank Private fund under rules of mutualisation and then to demutualise it. It is simply unthinkable to do so. The action is a governmental disaster, and this is exactly what we are expected to be voting in favour of today. For these reasons, I agree with the shadow minister for health and the shadow minister for finance, who note that this bill flagrantly disregards the impact of the sale on existing members-to say nothing of the broader policy implications. I say all this against the background of the widespread condemnation of this bill by peak health and other organisations, such as the Australian Medical Association-which rightly describes this proposed public and private theft as immoral. This bill will permit quite literally robbery to occur. This bill will only send one message to the public: that there is nothing sacred any longer. The real policy impact will be that the public will trust nothing and no-one. We will have banks that are not banks; not-for-profit organisations that can be, and are, changed by the stroke of a pen; and insurance companies that are not insurance companies. The list of how far the government will go in using its power over its four terms to undermine the very foundations of government and democracy is endless. I urge every member of this House to reconsider their position, and I am obviously referring to the government members and to those in the other house. I condemn the government for this flagrant disregard of the needs of consumers on an endless spectrum of matters. We had the unedifying experience here a couple of weeks ago of witnessing the government appeasing Australia's richest man and consumers being left as an afterthought in the Howard government's unconscionable destruction of Australia's cross-media ownership laws. Whilst satisfying the needs of free-to-air television owners in that instance, consumers have been left as an afterthought in the Howard government's nonsensical digital TV policy and refusal to issue a fourth free-to-air television licence. Everywhere you look, the government is looking after the big end of town. Whilst looking after big business through its refusal to strengthen the Trade Practices Act or to give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission more powers and funding, the needs of consumers have, disgracefully, been left by the wayside. Of course, the Howard government, particularly Treasurer Peter Costello, would love nothing more than to see the ACCC become a toothless tiger. Despite touching on many facets of life and different policy areas, we can see a common trend here that the government's disdain for ordinary consumers knows no bounds. We see that in this disgraceful legislation before the House. The Howard government loves nothing more than the pursuit of radical ideological goals and happy to destroy anything that lies in its path to achieve them, including the needs of consumers. I say today: that has to stop. Families in my electorate of Lowe in Sydney's inner west have a right to be provided with every detail about why the government in selling one of its few remaining public assets: Medibank Private. It smacks of poor policy to sell public assets in an attempt to superficially boosts the budget bottom line. The sale of Medibank Private, along with the sale of Telstra, will provide a bottomless pit of funds for a government heading into an election year next year. It has already curried favour with Australia's richest man and principal media proprietor, and now we have the issue of the sale of Medibank Private. It should not be seen as a river of gold to flow into the government's war chest in the leadup to an election. We can continue to live in hope that, at some point in the future, the government will act in the public interest rather than out of political expediency or, dare I say it, self-interest. Families in my electorate of Lowe have a right to be given a guarantee that the costs private health insurance will be kept down after the sale of Medibank Private. We all know that, once something is flogged off, the only way is up for prices and premiums. Naturally the government will not give that guarantee, because it cannot. It knows only too well that the sale of Medibank Private is going to result in increased health insurance premiums. Blind Freddie can see that. A publicly owned Medibank Private has acted as the conscience of the health insurance industry, as a guard at the gate between immeasurable profits and the interests of the wider community. This is a conscience or a gatekeeper that will be lost forever following privatisation-when the profit imperative understandably and inexorably takes over. The company's new shareholders will natuis rally want a large return on their investment. We saw fees skyrocket following the privatisation of Sydney airport and will see a rise following the privatisation of Medibank Private. In relation to Sydney airport, I draw attention to my questions on today's Notice Paper and my contribution in the Main Committee earlier today. The breaches of security going on at the airport are a disgrace. Returning to this bill, the government faces a choice: sell Medibank Private but warn the buying public that the organisation is going to deliver below-average returns indefinitely or tell the public that premiums are likely to increase as a result of the new organisation's drive to return big dividends and capital gains to its new shareholders. That is the duty of the government: to tell the truth to those people who are going to invest in the new Medibank Private after it is privatised-to tell them that they are going to get less return for their investment in the area of health insurance-or to tell the poor, longsuffering contributors that premiums are going to go through the roof. Is this a choice the government will of make? Not likely. There are 600,000 families in my electorate of Lowe covered by health funds who will face the prospect of premium increases when they simply cannot afford them. I urge those opposite to think again: to fight the sale of Medibank Private every step of the way for families, including those in the inner west of Sydney and right across the country from Sydney to Perth, who have had a gutful of interest rate rises and health insurance premium increases. This bill is a disgrace. As I have said in my contribution, there is just no end to which the government will not go to privatise anything to put its hand on a bit more dirty money in the run-up to the next election. I think the tide is turning. I have an informed, intelligent and educated electorate, like the member for Wills has. I think people understand that eventually you run out of luck when you start telling tales about children overboard and weapons of mass destruction and when you deny any knowledge of the bribes that were paid by the Australian Wheat Board to Saddam Hussein. I think people are waking up to that. I think they understand that last fortnight our democracy was handed over to, principally, Mr Packer-and that is a disgrace. I am sure that the good sense of the electors of Australia will take a baseball bat to this government when the election is held this time next year. (Time expired)",41
14,Mr GIBBONS,COMMITTEES,"Bendigo) (11.01 am)Before I start my contribution, I would like to indicate that I am a policy holder with Medibank Private. The purpose of the Medibank Private Sale Bill 2006 is to amend the National Health Act to allow the government to sell its shares in Medibank Private. The bill also puts into place foreign ownership and Australian identity restrictions on Medibank's directors and national office for a period of five years. It changes the status of fund from not-for-profit to for-profit, allows preprivatisation profits to be redistributed to shareholders following the privatisation and ensures the fund, not the Commonwealth, is liable for any compensation claims that arise from the sale. Labor opposes the bill on the basis that the government's decision to sell Medibank Private is based purely on an ideological agenda-an ideology that leads to a blinding belief that private ownership is better, that the free market is more efficient and that it will act in the community's best interests even when there is conclusive evidence to the contrary; an ideology that means that government is unable or unwilling to see that the sale of Medibank will have adverse implications for existing members and for the affordability of private health insurance. So, despite concerns being expressed publicly by health economists, former health insurance commissioners, business commentators, the AMA and the majority of the public, the government continues to push ahead because, to quote the Minister for Health and Ageing, ‘The government is instinctively in favour of privatisation.' Clearly the general public does not swallow the government's shallow arguments for selling Medibank. A Fairfax ACNielsen poll published in early September demonstrated that 63 per cent of those polled opposed the sale while just 17 per cent supported the government's plan. Even 46 per cent of coalition voters do not support it. As for the government's special adviser on various important policy issues, Mr Alan Jones, he described the sale on his radio program on 4 September as ‘financially unjust' and ‘politically reckless'. The government says that the sale will allow Medibank to be more competitive, therefore putting downward pressure on premiums. The economic modelling that supposthe edly supports this argument and was carried out as part of a scoping study has not been made available for public scrutiny. While a number of economists and business commentators have publicly debunked the government's assertion, there appear to be no objective measures available to back the government's claim. For example, Professor Jeff Richardson, director of the Centre of Health Economics at Monash University, said on the ABC's AM program earlier this year that ownership does not determine the cost of membership. Asked if he would expect Medibank Private to be more efficient if it were sold off, he responded: No, there's no evidence of that either. It really almost totally irrelevant. Their expenses are comparable with the expenses of other health funds. The Parliamentary Library research brief also found that there is little evidence to support assertions that a privatised Medibank Private would be more efficient, more competitive and less expensive for consumers. There is, in fact, a very logical argument that suggests the change from a non-profit to a for-profit organisation would add a cost or profit impost that will add to premium charges. The management of Medibank Private itself expressed it best to a 1996 Productivity Commission inquiry when it admitted that the interests of members are best served when the funds view their members as shareholders for whom the delivery of lower prices is a dividend. The reality is that for-profit insurers need to provide a profit for investors. While it may be the intention of the government to encourage policy holders to become shareholders, many will not. We only need to look at what the effect on premiums has been as the government has fattened the cow in preparing Medibank Private for sale. In order to increase Medibank's profit from $10 million in 2003 to $130 million in 2005, premiums were increased by 8.9 per cent in 2004 and by 7.94 per cent in 2005-over twice the rate of CPI increases. A further reason Labor opposes this bill is that the legislative changes proposed by the government provide no assurance or protection for Medibank Private members against further significant premium increases. Premiums have increased by more than 40 per cent over the past five years-a rate double that of the consumer price index, higher than wages growth and higher than the indexation of grants to help fund services under the Commonwealth-state health care agreements. Respected economic commentator is Terry MCCrann rightfully asked in his Melbourne Herald Sun article of 6 October: Why should we hand this sort of moneygeneration to the private sector? Should heath insurance make lush profits anyway? Aren't they supposed to be non-profit? And if Medibank is privatised, who would then keep the (private) bastards honest? As Medibank is claiming its higher profit came with a reduction in premium rate growth? Terry MCCrann, who is not renowned for his radical views, is asking these questions of this government's proposal. Medibank Private is Australia's largest non-profit and only national private health insurer. It is the only private health fund to have a significant market share in every state and territory. Because of its size and market position, Medibank Private has been able to put downward pressure on costs by negotiating with private hospital owners and passing on these savings to its members. There are at least three other factors which are likely to contribute to premium increases under the government's proposal to privatise Medibank. Firstly, while there is no evidence to support the government's assertion of downward pressure on premiums, let us look at one market-driven outcome which appears to be common to government-owned enterprises that have been privatised. The Australian Wheat Board-which could be a good or bad example-soon after privatisation moved to paying its various executive staff market based salaries and performance bonuses. The result was that, by 2005, the salary packages for AWB executives had rapidly adjusted to the market and ranged from $450,000 to $1.5 million per year. There are numerous other examples, including Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank and, of course, not forgetting Telstra's $10 million man. That was a case even the Treasurer had difficulty defending-a case where there was clearly no evidence of the correlation between exorbitant salaries for executives and returns to shareholders, let alone customer value. The second factor is that the government has argued that privatisation will lead to creased competition. Should privatisation proceed, on the day following privatisation, there will be exactly the same number of private health funds, which currently stands at 38. There is a real possibility, however, that the exact opposite will occur. As noted in the Parliamentary Library's research brief, ratings agency Standard & Poor's have recently argued that any sale of Medibank Private is likely to materially affect the competitive dynamics of the industry. While Standard & Poor's did not specify the precise nature of the effect on competitive dynamics, it appears to see the main impetus for change in the possibility that the sale may lead to rationalisation and greater concentration within the industry. That is exactly a resounding endorsement of the government's increased competition argument. The third factor is that the government's proposal will change Medibank Private's objectives essentially from working in the best interests of the members to working in the best interests of the shareholders. very nature, this cannot be in the best intermoval, ests of the members. I have already acknowledged that, while there may be an overlap of membership and shareholders, they are different. There has been public speculation that Medibank Private has a market value of somewhere between $1.5 billion and $3 billion. Assuming the market would demand a return on investment of seven per cent, this would translate into an annual dividend payment of between $105 million and $210 million. Not only does this dividend payment have a potential impact on premiums; it also represents a huge amount of money that would be funnelled out to shareholders rather than be used to improve services or maintain premiums at a low level. The proposed change in favour of shareinholders over members also has implications for older Australians and those with chronic illnesses. While regulations will remain to protect against discrimination, how long will it take for a privatised Medibank to identify those who represent the greatest risk and therefore the greatest cost? This concern is clearly reflected in comments from former Health Insurance Commissioner Ray Williams, Professor John Deeble and Dr Robert Maher released on 5 September. In addition to calling the sale ‘irrational' they warned that, as soon as a large share of the market is held by private shareholders, there will be pressure on the government to deregulate the industry or remove government price control or to reduce or eradicate the community ratnot ing obligation. The government will attempt to dismiss this as preposterous. But let us look for a moment at Telstra, which is not yet fully privatised and also subject to government service regulations. Telstra has clearly become much more focused on what is and what is not profitable. For example, thousands of public telephones By its have been removed or earmarked for renot because they are not needed but because they are not profitable. We need to look at the rights of existing Medibank Private members. There has been considerable debate about the rights and entitlements of existing members in relation to the proceeds of the proposed sale of Medibank Private. Public comments, again, include those of economics commentator Terry MCCrann on 6 October 2006: I suggest there are two components to the value of Medibank and that the government clearly owns only one of them. And further: … but there is at least an argument that the and its sale multiple are owned by the members who have overpaid for their health insurance. Other parties, including the Australian Medical Association, argue the case for members' rights from a moral perspective rather than a legal perspective. The AMA, while not wishing to comment on the legality of the situation, doubts the morality of the sale, given that much of the value of Medibank Private is in its financial reserves, which were not contributed to by government but rather extracted from the members in compliance with regulatory requirements, and that there is a strong case for mutualising Medibank Private and retaining the equity within those left contributing to it, namely, the members. The government has sought to obtain definitive legal advice about ownership and members' rights, which was done through solicitors Blake Dawson Waldron. It would seem clear that considerable uncertainty remains. This is perhaps evidenced by the government's undertaking to provide some type of share entitlement for existing members, but in what form still remains unclear. The government also proposes to change Medibank Private rules so that section 78 of the National Health Act does not apply. This change simply allows the Minister for Health and Ageing to abrogate his responsibility under the National Health Act to consider whether the proposed changes impose an unreasonable or inequitable condition affecting the rights of any contributors, which is precisely what the privatisation of Medibank Private will do. We also have to look at the government's proposal regarding the potential privatisation of public hospitals. The privatisation of Medibank is just one element of the ideological mindset of the government and the minister for health. For example, what would be the consequences if Medibank Private profit were sold to the same private organisation that, under the government's proposals, seeks to win contracts to manage our public hospitals? What would be the consequence of an insurer also being in a position to influence or determine patient care in public hospitals? The old saying, ‘It would be like giving Dracula the keys to the blood bank,' would be very close to the mark. Again, this would seem to fit precisely with the Howard government's blind obsession with privatisation, without the slightest regard for the views of the people they are supposed to represent and, equally, with no regard for any adverse consequences of their actions. The minister for health delivered a speech to the Menzies Research Centre on 9 September 2006, during which he advocated that state governments should outsource the management of public hospitals, allowing the private companies to run these hospitals for a profit. The minister has been quoted in the press as saying: ‘Obviously, if you are a private business, you want to make a profit.' Such a proposal is another example of the minister and the government being blinded by ideology and of their unwillingness or inability to acknowledge and therefore learn from past mistakes. Unfortunately, we are talking about essential community assets. The sick, the elderly and those who cannot afford private health insurance will suffer as a result of the government's ideological superiority and refusal to acknowledge the facts. Most Australian states have experimented with private management of public health services and individual departments within public health organisations, using a variety of structures and agreements. Some have been quite successful. There are, however, a number of highly critical reports, including the state Auditor-General reports, and several examples of states reversing such arrangements. For example, in a report on the Joondalup Hospital, the Western Australian Auditor General found (1) the process failed to establish that the public-private arrangements would deliver a net potential benefit over a public sector alternative and (2) the Metropolitan Health Services Board claims that bed block at inner city hospitals resulted from Joondalup's reluctance to accept patient transfers due to financial arrangements. As for the ideological argument that private is better, a comparison of Joondalup Hospital with benchmark hospitals found patient satisfaction inferior-particularly relating to the availability of staff, continuity of care and patients being kept informed. In relation to the Port Macquarie hospital, the New South Wales Auditor-General reported that the government would pay twice for the cost of the capital construction in the annual availability fee and through fee-forservice payments but would own neither the land nor the buildings. In South Australia, Modbury Hospital management was outsourced by the then Liberal government in 1995, essentially to increase efficiency. The experiment obviously has not worked. However, the current state government is currently negotiating to terminate the contract with Healthscope, which is not scheduled to expire until 2010. The South Australian Minister for Health is reported as saying in March this year: I think one of the ways that Healthscope is able to make a profit or keep the thing running is by squeezing services that a public system would give higher priority to. It is not surprising then that the proposal of the federal Minister for Health and Ageing was met with negative responses from a number of state premiers and state health ministers. Labor acknowledge that private hospitals are a significant and essential component of the hospital system in Australia. We believe, however, that it is the public hospital system that faces the task of dealing with the vast majority of acute and complex cases and emergency episodes of care. Labor also believe that the role of private hospitals is and should be complementary rather than competitive or adversarial. In conclusion, I believe this bill has nothing whatsoever to do with good public policy, nothing whatsoever to do with maintaining or improving the way our current worldclass health system provides its range of treatments and services to the people of Australia and everything to do with the manic obsession of this government and this Prime Minister with privatisation at any cost and to hell with the consequences. That is why I strongly oppose this bill. Declaration of Urgency",46

Windsor, A.H.C. * denotes teller Question agreed to. Second Reading Debate resumed. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (11.34 am)-We have just seen one of the most disgraceful gags moved in this House. Here we have a very important matter of public policy and we have this government cutting and running from debate. You cannot get a more gutless act on the floor of this parliament than gagging a legitimate debate on an issue of public policy importance not only for the constituents of members on this side of the House but for constituents of government members. It is typical of the arrogance of this government that it has a bill before the parliament to privatise one of the major public health assets in this country, yet it does not intend to sell this particular entity until 2008. I think it is legitimate to ask: what is the urgency in closing down this debate at this time today? There is no urgency. There is simply one proposition: that this is an arrogant government that is afraid of parliamentary scrutiny. It is afraid to have its policies put under the parliamentary microscope, because people on this side of the House know that this public policy issue is one that is vitally important to our constituents and the constituents of government members. The Medibank Private Sale Bill 2006 is the latest exercise in the Howard government's privatisation agenda-driven not by a concern for Medibank Private members or a concern for holding premiums down in the private health sector but by ideology. This is a government that has abandoned any pretence to govern for the families of Australia. It is a government of ideologues, for ideologues and by ideologues. It is interesting to note that the government has introduced this legislation into the House at this time and that it intends ramming it through both houses, where it has a majority and can do what it likes, before the end of the 2006 ting year, yet the entity will not be sold till 2008. The government's central justification for the sale-namely, that it will increase competition in the marketplace and drive down premiums-simply has no basis in history, nor a basis in economic analysis. It is certainly not supported by recent historical experience. Australians who have private health insurance will recall the government's reforms in 2002 and the government's solemn promise that those reforms would put a brake on the growth of private health insurance premiums. Obviously that was one of the Prime Minister's non-core promises-and he is good at making them. This government is good at making non-core promises, because we have seen what happened to private health insurance once the government introduced these measures. Those premiums have gone up by 40 per cent and put another burden on the households of Geelong, which I represent in this parliament, and indeed Middle Australian households throughout the length and breadth of Australia. This government said that its policy position would put a brake on private health insurance premiums. The fact is now that those premiums have gone up 40 per cent. If you believe anything that this government says about private health insurance then you really do believe in fairies at the bottom of the garden. It is a simple fact that on every policy pronouncement in relation to private health insurance this government has been wrong, and the people who have paid the price are the policyholders of private health insurance in this country. Here we have a proposition that has no justification in economic fact and we have the justifications of the government neatly compartmentalised in the jargon of an arrosit- gant government that really does not care anymore about Australian families. Its justifications are as spurious as its claim in 2002 that its reforms of private health insurance would keep premiums down. The government says an independent Medibank Private will be more efficient, and it goes on to say that its sale will lead to greater competition in the private health insurance marketplace and that it will remove the Commonwealth's conflict of interest in this area of policy. Let us start with the last one first, before we get to the economic analysis. What conflict of interest is there for the Commonwealth, which receives no income from this particular asset? The Commonwealth does not receive any income from this asset. Surplus income is retained by the entity for the benefit of the policyholders, and therein lies the legal argument that is at the heart of this privatisation-the entitlement of Medibank policyholders in the seat of Corio and throughout Australia who have generated the surplus in this private health insurance company. They are entitled to the benefits of their contributions over many years since the Howard government privatised it, yet under this legislation they will certainly not receive their due entitlement and the Commonwealth will be open to legal challenge on a compensation basis by those people. Let members of the government be under no illusion that those legal challenges for compensation will come, and the government knows that, because the government has insulated itself in this legislation from any liability for those compensation claims. That is an admission, if ever I have seen one, that there is a case for compensation and that the Commonwealth or others will be sued as a result of the actions of this bill. Let me put this proposition to members opposite. The government receives a profit from Australia Post, yet the government regulates postal and other telecommunications services in this country. Is anybody suggesting that there is a mammoth conflict of interest, or is the government going to privatise Australia Post, the ABC or the CSIRO along with Medibank Private? Is this next on the hit list of the government's privatisation agenda? I would think so. Any government that has the gall to privatise Medibank Private in the circumstances that this government is doing obviously has more on its mind than that. The government's position is that an independent Medibank Private will be more efficient, with consequent benefits to policyholders. But quite frankly that is not borne out by the facts. We know that there are many small community based private health insurers that have significantly lower costs than the larger insurers. They provide a range of services very well to their members and they are able to earn a surplus that is ploughed back into the organisation for the benefit of members. There is one certainty that will come from this privatisation: that Medibank Private will be purchased by a for-profit company. We all know how for-profit companies operate. They have to return a dividend to the shareholders, and that return on capital from the for-profit organisation that buys Medibank Private will come from several sources. It will have to come from surplus income, which will be derived either from the policyholder subscriptions and premiums paid by households or from investment income. The simple reality is that, in generating a return on capital for its owners, a for-profit insurer will need to generate a profit margin. It is logical that we ask where this is going come from. I have canvassed some elements: it will come from surplus income, a reduction in administration costs or a reduction in payments to policy holders. There are various scenarios. The upshot of this is that we have premium increases, raids on surplus income for the benefit of profit or reductions in payments to policy holders. Even if administration expenses are reduced significantly, the amount saved that could contribute to a return on capital for the health insurance investor will be relatively smallanybody in the private health insurance industry will tell you that. The only way an insurer can reduce insurance payments to policy holders is if it limits the benefits it offers, reduces the costs of care provided to policy holders or requires policy holders to make a higher contribution to the cost of their care. That is the reality. When we get into the options for a forprofit organisation that might purchase Medibank Private, there are other implications. Another option for that insurer is to directly intervene in the scope or amount of care that is available to patients. When we get into this managed care scenario, we are really going down the American path of a private health system where there is managed care and insurers can stick their beaks into the sort of care that might be provided. Another option is higher copayments by policy holders. Consumers-that is, householders in Geelong that are already in Medibank Private-may well have an increase in the copayment that they must pay in order to get the required amount of cover that their family needs. One of the most disturbing things about this privatisation is simply this: there has been no study undertaken of the economic impact on the private health insurance sector as a whole. As we know, there are about 40 to private health insurers in this country. Medibank Private, with 30 per cent of the market, is one of the larger ones, but a significant proportion of them are small community based private health insurers. We have one in my electorate of Corio, in the Geelong region, in GMHBA. GMHBA stacks up very well compared to the larger insurers, like Medibank Private and others, in its administrative costs and the range of services that it provides. That is why a significant number of families in the Geelong region have taken out private health insurance with either GMHBA or Medibank Private. There has been no economic analysis done by the government of the impact that this privatisation will have on these smaller and not-for-profit funds. You do not have to be an economic genius at all to understand that, once the status of Medibank Private is changed from a not-forprofit to a for-profit entity in this sector, there will be pressure for premium rises or a cut in care to those who take out that private health insurance as the organisation's imperative changes from the delivery of services to profit. In that scenario, there are ers all over the place. Families lose because they pay higher premiums. They lose because they are required to shoulder the burden of higher copayments. They lose because the care that is offered to them is reduced and compromised. They lose because we get into the American model of managed care. In the sector more broadly, we will see an amalgamation of many of those not-forprofit organisations as pressures bear upon them in the marketplace for a variety of reasons. This is a retrograde policy based not on sound economic analysis or public policy but squarely on ideology. I am deeply concerned for Medibank Private policy holders in the Corio electorate, but I am also concerned for GMHBA, its policy holders and the members of the smaller funds because, at the end of the day, this is a recipe for driving premiums through the roof. That will put an increasing burden on families who are already burdened as a result of this government's workplace relations legislation. They are already burdened because of this government's inability to do anything about petrol costs and they are burdened because of this government's inability to contain interest rates. They are getting it in the neck from Liberal interest rate rises while they are mortgaged to the hilt, which means that they will have less disposable income to spend on their private health insurance. To have a private health insurance premium rise on top of the burdens that the Howard government has already put on them is enough to break them. Quite frankly, Australians have had a gutful of Liberal interest rate rises. They have had a gutful of Liberal private health insurance premium rises. They have had a gutful of a government that has failed to move on petrol prices. As a result of that Liberal incompetence, they are suffering in their pockets. I would urge all private health insurance losmembers in the Geelong area to reflect very seriously on what this government intends to do after the next election because, as sure as night turns to day, the promises that it makes that premiums will come down will simply not occur.",51
20,Ms BIRD,NOES,"I rise to speak in strong opposition to the Medibank Private Sale Bill 2006. But before I come directly to the bill I would like to talk about the environment in the community at the moment within which this bill sits, and the implications it will have, particularly, as the member for Corio said, for the average families in each of our electorates, and what it is that they are concerned about-in particular, in the area of private health insurance premiums. I have been here since the 2004 election. Since that time there have been two increases approved by the health minister for private health insurance premiums. I have to say I would be very surprised if those representing seats on the opposite side of the House did not have the same experience that I have. There is indeed deep anger and disappointment in the community about the impact of the cost of health insurance premiums on their family budgets. On both occasions that the average increases were approved by the health minister, the interesting feedback I was that people would ring up and say: ‘I've just got a letter from my private health insurer telling me what my new monthly premium will be. I'm very concerned because mine's gone up 12 per cent'-or 17 per cent; the worse case I had was someone whose private health insurance premium had gone up 21 per cent. What this reflects, and what people are now coming to understand, is that, when the minister ticks off on an average increase-for example, eight per cent-that is an average across all the products offered by the provider. That means that some lucky people will get a nought per cent increaseperhaps even a decrease-and others may well get a 12, a 15 or a 22 per cent increase on their premiums. With a little bit of investigation-I encourage most of these people to ring their health insurance providers and ask them why they had this sort of increase-most of them were given this explanation of it being an average across products. However, if they then said: ‘Okay, which product was it that had a nought per cent increase? I might be more interested in taking out my insurance with that package,' generally speaking they found that those products were no longer available to new applicants. The insurance companies were certainly getting an eight per cent average, but it was averaged over products, which meant that many average families in my electorate, who are attempting to do the responsible thing under this government's regime and take out private health insurance coverage, were finding that they were the ones who were paying the highest increases in premiums. That is the environment in which we come to this bill. That was the response that I had to the first lot of premium increases. This year the interesting addition to that was the number of people saying they were seriously concerned that they would not be got able to financially maintain their health insurance coverage. I had one person who had actually made the decision at that point to drop their coverage. With the mortgage repayments they were dealing with as a family and the costs of living increases because of inflation rises, it just was not possible to sustain their private health insurance coverage any longer. That is the dilemma that increasingly middle and lower income families are facing in Australia if they want to take out any sort of private health insurance coverage. The government for many years has been telling us that its policy imperative has been to increase the coverage of the Australian population who have private health insurance-yet each step it takes seems to make it more difficult for that to be sustained by families in our communities. Of course, the government have it a little bit both ways. The other side of it is that they actually penalise you through the tax system if you do not take out private health insurance. So many people find themselves in a double bind in that the government have put them in the position where their tax liability is going to be significantly affected if they do not have private health insurance coverage, yet they are increasingly frustrated by the cost of that particular product, its increase in cost year after year after year and the decreasing provisions that that coverage allows them to access. So there is all this frustration boiling away in the community about private health insurance coverage. I think that is something that members opposite would have to know in their own communitiesthat the level of disenchantment, and indeed anger, with private health insurance is very high amongst the families in our community. They are very frustrated by it. Indeed, people are really at the point where many are considering which is the lesser of two evils: to deal with the problem through their tax or to take out the coverage. Coming to the bill before us, which seeks to privatise Medibank Private, we see from the government what is simply very rough and ready privatisation, designed initially to deliver a quick buck to the government's budget. The backlash was so significant that they immediately started to walk away from it-although, I will acknowledge, not before they told the member for North Sydney. He had the unfortunate opportunity to put the argument that there was no reason to delay it before he got the message that the position had changed. Indeed, even today we see the government, having moved a gag motion, saying that this is such an urgently important matter that we cannot have a full debate, we cannot allow everybody who wants to express the views of their constituencies in this House the opportunity to do so. One would have to say that it is a bit bemusing, given that the government had already made the political decision that this was too distasteful and politically difficult to sell before the election so they would just put it through a legislative program and tell people that it was not going to happen till after the election anyway. The reality is that, with the proposed sale not coming up until 2008, there is no urgency for this House to finalise this, so again it is poor handling of the policy process and the debate to have done that today. So I take up the concern of some of my colleagues who I know wanted to put before the House the significant representations they have had in their own electorates about this legislation and, more broadly, health insurance coverage in Australia at this time. The government has put forward this privatisation and I have concerns about the proposed legislation. It does not take into account the membership rights of Medibank Private members-and I should acknowledge that I am a Medibank Private policyholder. The sell-off will do nothing to reduce private health insurance premiums. Indeed, this government is the emperor with no clothes whenever it opens its mouth to say that a policy position it is taking will decrease private health insurance premiums. This is certainly not going to fly with a community that remembers the guarantees it was given before the 2001 election that the new private health insurance regime would drive down premiums. There have been premium increases of 40 per cent since that time. I do not even know why the government is bothering to run that argument. It must realise it has no credibility whatsoever with that sort of claim. The government's decision to back the sell-off of Medibank Private has constantly been shrouded in secrecy. I, like many of my colleagues on this side of the House, have lodged a petition to try to get the government to reconsider its privatisation agenda for Medibank Private. Only a couple of weeks ago, I took a petition to the main street of my electorate and stood in front of our Medibank Private office. In the half-hour or so that I was there, it was not difficult to fill several pages. Interestingly, it was not just the Medibank Private policyholders who were keen to sign the petitionthough, obviously, Medibank Private policyholders were keen. This was during the day, and the pensioners who were coming to the office to put in their various claims were gravely concerned. When I asked them why they were with Medibank Private, they almost invariably said they had chosen to go with Medibank Private because it was the government owned provider. Potential buyers of Medibank Private would be fairly foolish not to understand that its market share is based on the fact that a large number of the policyholders are with Medibank Private because it is the government owned provider. As a potential buyer you would have to wonder what would happen to membership numbers if it were no longer the government owned private health insurance provider. People who were not Medibank Private policyholders were also quite happy to come up and sign the petition because they were so angry about private health insurance premium increases and the government's failure to deliver on its promise. There is a boiling anger in the community about the fact that people are trapped into having private health insurance coverage and, on top of that, they are not even getting good value for their money because every year they have find more from the family budget to cover the premiums. These people were asking why the government does not use Medibank Private as a market leader to drive down the cost of premiums and put pressure back onto the privately owned providers. They wanted to sign the petition as a way to express that frustration with the market. The response to the petition, which has only been going for a couple of weeks, has been overwhelming. I have no doubt it will continue to be so, and have no doubt that other members on this side of the House who are similarly using petitions to gauge community concerns will find exactly the same outcome. Like most members of this House, I get lobbied fairly regularly by the private health insurance industry. They send me letters to make sure I know how many people in my electorate are covered by private health insurance-and, as I understand it, there are just over 64,000. That number has been pretty consistent over the few years that I have been getting those letters. The interesting thing about that is that the private health insurance industry is obviously lobbying us to keep us supportive of the importance of private health insurance coverage. I would say to them-and, indeed, to the government, whose stated aim is to increase the level of private health insurance coveragethat one of the best ways you can do that at the moment is by actually delivering downward pressure on premiums, by actually delivering at least one year in which the minister does not pull out his pen and tick off his approval for an increase and by actually delivering on the capacity of the money you pay to get you a better quality product. People do not believe that is happening-and with good reason. It is not happening, and it is has not happened since the government made a commitment that that is its aim. The private health insurance industry could do the same thing. The government introduced part of the package with an advertising campaign. We all remember the ‘umbrella' as that said we would be under a scheme that would provide extensive private health insurance coverage for people at really good value for money, drive down premiums and provide better quality products. Part of that, of course, was the 30 per cent rebate. That probably I sounded pretty good at the time, but when you consider that, since that 30 per cent rebate was introduced, the cost of premiums has gone up 40 per cent-and that is on average-I would suggest that it has not taken long for people to work out that, because they have had at least a 40 per cent increase, it is now a pretty useless product for them. If you have a high-end product your annual increase each time was 12 per cent, so you would have had an even bigger increase in your private health insurance premiums over that time. Yet taxpayers pay out $2 billion every year to the private health insurance industry under this scheme. The government designed this scheme, according to all of its claims, with a view to driving down premiums and increasing the coverage of private health insurance. It has achieved exactly the opposite. It is a $2 billion policy failure because it is not actually driving down premiums. The minister can directly address that by not ticking them off for a billion next year-but, given it is an election year, I am cynical enough to predict that he may well not do so-and by actually driving for better products in the marketplace so that people feel they are getting value and so are encouraged to take out coverage. Not only does the taxpayer make a subsidised contribution to what is a very profitable industry every year; the taxpayer also underwrites the industry's advertising bill. In fact the government provides it with a captured market audience by the way its policy operates to force people into having to take out coverage. As I indicated, the 2001 promise-like so many of them that we remember-was broken. How the health minister is able to hold his head up in this place, given the sorts of promises that he has made before each election and then his being rolled by finance ministers after the elections is simply astounding. I can guarantee to him that this one of those issues that people are very conscious of: that he and the government promised that premiums would decrease but they have not. In fact, they have increased beyond the level of the rebate. I should acknowledge, as some of the other speakers on this side of the House have, that these increases should be added to the seven interest rate increases that we have seen in much the same time frame. And there is speculation at the moment that another one is on the cards for next week. Indeed, quite astoundingly, the Prime Minister has joined in, saying that would actually be quite logical-‘a stitch in time' I think he called it. I can guarantee him it will not be a stitch in time for any of the budgets of the households in Cunningham or, no doubt, any other places, given that people have already had that last lot of interest rate increases on their mortgage payments. Remember that you had those interest rate increases and then, early in the following year, you had the increase in health insurance premiums. Those sorts of pressures are particularly significant, and I do not think people will be amenable to the argument at all that another interest rate increase to come in this month will be a stitch in time and involve less pain. It is one thing for the government to get out there and say, ‘Why don't you take the pain now because it will be less terrible when taking the pain next year?' but it is hardly an encouraging or optimistic message to be taking to the community. I do not think it will be very well received at all. The Prime Minister was on commercial radio saying that the next interest rate increase could well be justified. That is an unprecedented position given that he has always argued that it is the independent Reserve Bank of Australia that will make the call-except of course during the election is campaign when he told people that he had the capacity to affect all interest rate outcomes. But he has argued that another interest rate rise will be justified. In fact I think he said it would be hard to criticise it. I can assure him that we will not have any difficulty criticising his contribution to it! There comes a time in the life of governments, particularly after a decade, when you start to see tipping points that happen when they get a bit complacent; they become a bit arrogant in their comfort zone in government. I think that if the members opposite and the ministers and the Prime Minister have not picked up the fact that one of the issues that will cause real irritation in their communities is private health insurance premiums then they are well and truly out of touch and in for a lot of trouble as a result it. The electorate is sick and tired of broken promises, worn-out excuses, secrecy and the hiding of information, lack of accountability-today we again saw it with the gagging of this debate-and lack of action-promises that are never delivered. I think the Prime Minister better than most can feel that tipping point coming on. I think he knows it; he just thinks he can ride through it. But to be honest I think actions like these plus the simmering anger about interest rate increases, the simmering anger about cost of living increases-because underlying, ongoing inflation is not being addressed through investment in skills and infrastructure-the simmering anger about increasing health costs and the feeling that the government just is not listening or understanding anymore how those pressures are affecting families and their budgets are really an indication that the government is now at the point where it has lost touch with, and lost an understanding of, the struggles that the people that it boasted for so long it cared about are actually experiencing. Not only has the government broken its promise to keep interest rates low; it has broken its promise to keep premiums down. With that sort of record, people become- (Time expired)",56
21,Mr ANDREN,NOES,"Yet again, why the rush? Here we have another gag on legislation that is decreed to be so urgent that it must pass this House by midafternoon. Yet again there is no full debate on legislation that is particularly of interest to an Australian public tired of the flogging off of the national infrastructure and assets that they believe are there for the benefit of all and for the dividends that they provide, both social and monetary, for the good of the nation. The Medibank Private Sale Bill 2006 would enable the government, if it were to be of re-elected next year, to proceed with the sale of Medibank Private in, as I understand it, 2008, which again raises the question of what the urgency is today. I do not suppose it has got anything at all to do with building up an election year war chest with $2 billion worth of moneys that may be directed into key areas of concern for the government! I note it has been said that one will be medical research, but that is a fairly broad spectrum. If the public were consulted on this, they might suggest that, in the unfortunate event of the full sale of Medibank, those proceeds should better be utilised in bringing our public hospital system up to an acceptable standard across the board. The Minister for Health and Ageing has often said that he would like a role in federal responsibility for health care and hospitals. If this sale indeed proceeds, there would be an opportunity for him to put his money where his mouth is. This debate has settled down into an interpretation of just what constitutes membership of Medibank Private. The Parliamentary Research Library's Jerome Davidson and Luke Buckmaster have given carefully considered opinions that it is arguable that members have the right to benefit from existing surplus assets of the fund and that the sale of Medibank Private could give rise to claims for compensation. In fact, the board of Medibank Private had received legal advice some years ago that raised questions about whether the Commonwealth was indeed the sole owner or whether, indeed, its 2.8 million members had ownership rights. The Australian Medical Association has called for the fund to be mutualised and has grave doubts about the Commonwealth pocketing some $2 billion and leaving its members effectively stranded with no call on a share of the fund's assets. I stress I am not a Medibank Private member. The AMA says: If the government no longer wishes to be involved as an operator of a private fund, there is a strong case for mutualising Medibank Private and retaining equity with those who have contributed to it, namely the members. The government does not like this advice and of course has sought its own from Blake Dawson Waldron, which says there is no room for compensation claims by current members. However, the government seems to have conceded that there is a moral claim by including safety net clauses in item 7 of schedule 2 of the bill to cover any eventuality of claims being made. According to advice from Blake Dawson Waldron, membership of Medibank Private is a contractual relationship that can be terminated on two months notice at Medibank Private Ltd's discretion. The advice says members have no enforceable rights to benefit from the general assets other than through claims under their policies and that Medibank Private is the beneficial as well as legal owner of the fund assets. But the Parliamentary Research Library authors of the Bills Digest rightly question the integrity of the termination of membership rules, given this government's Lifetime Health Cover program, which is designed to reward those taking out hospital cover early in life and maintaining it. In other words, the eligibility for lifetime cover at reduced premiums could be broken with the stroke of a pen. The library paper, correctly in my opinion, points out the use of this arbitrary membership termination rule in the government's legal advice and says it is tantamount to improper discrimination under the National Health Act. As the Bills Digest states: The view that community rating affords protection for continuity of membership is one shared by the Department of Health and Ageing, which has advised that: Members are currently provided with the right of continuity of membership through the principle of community rating. Again, the advice from the Parliamentary Library, as opposed to the government's legal advice, suggests a possible minefield in the area of transfer from not-for-profit to forprofit status. The National Health Act is also not clear on the process for changing status. As the Bills Digest suggests, the not-for-profit accumulation of funds could be changed to the profit distribution to shareholders through a unilateral change of status. On any literal interpretation of the act, according to the Bills Digest: ... an organisation that was not established for profit cannot become so merely by changing its constitution or its rules. So, whatever the protection built into this bill, the question remains as to the status of the current members and their claim to compensation. Again, the parliamentary research briefing notes say: - the scheme of the legislation has always contemplated that the members have the ultimate entitlement to benefit from the fund assets, and - the Health Insurance Commission did not hold beneficial ownership of the fund and its assets before Medibank Private Limited and hence that ownershipcould not have been transferred to the latter in 1998 ... In essence, as the research brief so clearly stated and as has not been satisfactorily answered by Blake Dawson Waldron, Medibank Private Ltd is not properly described as the beneficial owner of the Medibank Private fund assets. The government has said competition in the market is the reason for the sale, or one of the primary reasons. The track record for the privatisation of state insurance companies does not suggest any downward pressure on insurance premiums. I remember the state government of the day in New South Wales promising that green slips would be much, much cheaper, that premiums would be reduced. In fact, exactly the opposite occurred. The privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank opened the way for the eventual stampede of banks from the bush. ‘Don't be the last bank out of town,' was the cry. In the absence of any real community service obligation for banks, such as the US Reinvestment Act requiring continued presence of, if not banks, credit unions in communities, the banks chased profits largely at the expense of service, especially in the bush. Fees began an upward spiral as any regulated players, any publicly accountable player, disappeared from the marketplace. I do not have to remind anyone in the House about the ramifications for the public benefit of the Telstra privatisation. We already see Telstra backing away from any interest in areas that are not profitable, hoarding technology to maximise returns, failing to roll out terrestrial broadband, trimming staff and costs and services, and joining other players in the privatised marketplace by cherry picking the eyes out of the profitable bits of the market and arguing user-pay for the rest. Just today I picked up an interesting note on the Next G mobile network from the website of Paul Budde, the communications commentator. He says: The so-called 850MHz flavour of the 3G ... is, global mobile terms, a niche market. Remember Sol telling us that this was the technology that would save the world? We were aeons ahead of the rest of the planet with 3G. The commentators, the experts and, I suspect, most people in the bush now know there has not been a huge rush from the vendor community to produce a wide selection of mobile phones for this particular service. Budde says: The selection will always be limited, and it will always be more expensive. He continues: ... in order to roam on Telstra's other 3G network (in the cities), which is not compatible with the regional service, customers on that network will need a dual-mode handset, which, naturally, will add to the cost. He also says: ... because of end-user prices and because of the technology limitations, wireless broadband services do not compete with those available on fixed networks. He goes on: My point here is that it would be wrong to create the impression that 3G HSPDA is a real alternative to fixed broadband. An equivalent wireless broadband service, comparable to fixed services, will be at least 50% to 100% more expensive, which would put it beyond the reach of most users. In fact it will be a yuppie service for the bush, when the bush requires basic fixed services not bells and whistles. Neither the government nor Telstra, particularly after privatisation, will give a damn. ‘The company has made it appear that this alternative would be a good solution to lack of fixed broadband services in regional Australia,' says Budde. Well, it is not. He knows it, and country people know it now. We will not get the sorts of services needed, except in the form of userpays, for those outside the profitable parts, because Telstra is going private-with priin vate shareholder dictates and not public need dictates. That is the lesson of the privatisation of Telstra and of the Commonwealth Bank; and indeed it is the lesson for Medibank Private. The government's scoping study on the sale said privatisation would enable Medibank Private to operate more efficiently through lower management expenses and would place downward pressure on premiums. Privatisation has certainly put downward pressure on the Telstra executive's salarepresents ries, hasn't it! There is no evidence to suggest such privatisation would lead to lower management expenses. The recent payments to Telstra executives before privatisation show how millions of dollars of bonuses, share offerings and other payments can be stripped out of company profits to unjustifiahospitals bly reward management. Rather than a downward pressure on premiums, there would be an immediate attempt to recoup at least the purchase price for starters and to reward executives far beyond their worth. There is little evidence to suggest a privatised Medibank would be more efficient, competitive and less expensive for consumers. In fact the reverse could be expected. Medibank Private itself in its 1996 submission to the Productivity Commission argued that a for-profit health insurer would ‘unnecessarily escalate the premiums for private health insurance'. For instance, we can look at the premiums in the insurance industry since the privatisation of publicly owned general insurers. The privatisation of Medibank, while restricting maximum shareholdings to 15 per cent for five years, would inevitably lead to amalgamations within the industry. Some might say that such rationalisation would increase efficiency. Others would see this as producing less diversity and therefore less competition. Inevitably there will be an influx of foreign operators and an onward march towards the American health model; therein lies the underlying risk-and the government knows it-of throwing Medibank Private, and Telstra, to the marketplace to be at the mercy those global operators who would come in here, fleece the market and inevitably privatise, if they could, the whole of our health sector. The argument that the government should bail out of Medibank Private because it 29 per cent of the private health insurance market and because it can call on government subsidisation holds no water when you consider that all funds are being sustained by the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. I supported that rebate, believing it would ease the demand on public and because I thought it was an initiative that would encourage more people to take up the private health option. While it may have increased private health insurance membership, I am afraid that this membership is subsidised by the 60 to 70 per cent of taxpayers who cannot afford or choose not to pay for private insurance; and it has made no significant impact on public hospital waiting lists. If, as seems inevitable, this bill passes both houses and that $2 billion goes into the government war chest, no-one in the electorate would have any concerns if that money were earmarked for a proper upgrading of the crucial health facilities that are required throughout our community. I would like to mention one particular program-that is, the radiology and oncology services that are so desperately required in rural Australia, especially in the central west community-in Bathurst, Orange, Parkes, Forbes and in Dubbo, where you largely have a fly in, fly out specialist service. I would hope that the politics of all of this, if indeed there is going to be any politics in it, are laid aside and, as with the case of the allocation of the MRI machine a couple of years ago, the overwhelming argument for Orange to be the epicentre of health care in the central west is of recognised; and that Orange is recognised as being in desperate need. It has the required 300,000 people in the catchment. It readily warrants the installation of that service in the central west. So too there are many other communities right around Australia that are desperate for those services to deliver a standard of care that people in the city can access for the price of a bus trip. I am told that in some communities we have people who are not seeking urgent treatment for cancer because of the impediment of travelling to and staying in Sydney and the disruption and emotional impact of having to move away from their homes for these sorts of treatment. So here is an example of something that is desperately needed. If indeed the reality is that there is $2 lion in the kitty earmarked for oncology treatment and the radiography-radiology services that are so desperately needed in rural and regional Australia, and indeed those other parts of outer metropolitan Australia along the coast-some have already been provided on the north coast of New South Wales, I grant-you would have a classic example of well-directed objective funding of health care in this country. I would hope you would receive the support of every member of this House, because you would certainly get it from every member of the community. The opponents of this sale are numerous: the Australian Medical Association, the Doctors Reform Society, the Save Medibank Alliance-including Professor John Deeble, one of the founders of the original Medibank-and, I would suggest, the majority of the electorate. I have grave doubts, as I said, that this sale will increase competition or reduce premiums. That is a nonsense. The steep upward trend of health-care premiums will accelerate. Privatisation under Labor and the coalition over the past 25 years has been about short-term financial gain, political advantage and the liquidating of public infrastructure and assets that all contributed enormously to the public purse, provided full-time work for many thousands of Australians while guaranteeing all Australians held onto key elements of the market, and exercised discipline on those markets and the services they provided. Yet again public need has been sacrificed to private greed and political short-termism. I reject the bill.",61
22,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,I call the honourable member for Katter-I am sorry: the member for Kennedy!,65
23,Mr KATTER,NOES,"I am very flattered indeed, Mr Deputy bilSpeaker. I have the incredible egoism to say that mistake is often made! Policy must be judged upon its outcomes. You do not wander off with some ideological theory. There is a magnificent cartoon-at least, I thought it was magnificent-of Mr Keating reading a book entitled Japanese Protection and saying, ‘It's doomed! It may work in practice, but it'll never stand up in theory!' It was a magnificent judgement upon privatisation. I am not coming in here with prejudices; at least, I hope I am not. I suppose I have developed prejudices now, one way or the other, but if you turn the clock back 20 years, I was never one for saying that everything should be in the hands of government. I belonged to the Country Party, which was very pragmatic in these areas. In fact, in the 20 years of Bjelke-Petersen, we were supposed to be the conservative government. It just shows how outmoded the terminology is. If conservative meant privatisation, we did not privatise or even remotely look like privatising anything in the period when we were in office. But every minister was expected to make his department perform. Don Lane, for all of his shortcomings, actually had the railways in Queensland working for a profit for two years there. It was a remarkable and very creditable effort. You must judge these operations upon their outcomes. On the sale and privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank, I think the best statement upon the banks that one can find is in the Sydney Morning Herald dated 12 May 2005. It says: Ahmed Fahour, who heads NAB's Australian operations ... made headlines last year because his $34 million salary, ... I will repeat that slowly in case everybody has not heard it: ‘his $34 million a year salary'. The article goes on to say that he believed that 4,200 jobs had to go from the National Australia Bank. I represent one of those areas from which the jobs went. I am not referring just to that area; I am talking about the northern suburbs of Townsville as well, where branches were closed. I used one of those branches, in fact. If you are looking for an outcome, where we had a local bank manager who made decisions locally, based upon the knowledge of the local economy, we now have managers in Brisbane making decisions over whether you should be allowed to borrow money in Cloncurry, Mareeba or Tully. The outcome in that same year? That article gives the profit for NAB for the year 2005: ‘NAB reported a 17 per cent jump in first-half net profit to $2.5 billion'. So in the first half of the year they made $2.5 thousand million in profit. Did interest rates come down? I have not checked up over the last four or five years, but for that crucial period-the latter Keating period and the first eight or nine years of this government-our interest rates in Australia were 50 per cent higher on average than those in Japan or the United States. So did it deliver cheap interest rates? No, our interest rates were 50 per cent higher than those of our competitor nations. Did it deliver better services? I spent a lot of time reorganising the Mid West Rugby League, which covers all the western towns between Townsville and Mount Isa. The railways cut back 500 jobs: in a little tiny area of about 10,000 or 12,000 people, we lost 500 jobs. Those jobs were removed mainly from the local railway station, which closed down virtually completely, and local of overnighter depots handled all of their work. Did this deliver a better and cheaper outcome? No. Our parcel prices went up sixfold in that period. The cost to transport a parcel from Townsville to any of those towns went up 600 per cent. Motor car parts doubled in price as a result of the privatisation of the railway system in western Queensland. Did the airlines profit from the privatisation of Qantas? What is the situation now with the airlines? In fairness, there has been significant diminution in the price of airfares between the capital cities but, as my worthy colleague from Calare explained to the House, that is because they cherry picked out profitable routes and totally withdrew their services from the non-profitable routes. It was a fairly easy task and of course they put themselves in a position where they had a monopolistic position in the marketplace. There may have been transportation benefits for the intercapital cities-most certainly the Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane connection-but for those outside of that connection, particularly for people in rural ports, the cost of getting to Townsville from Mount Isa doubled in that period. Similarly, the cost of getting from Mount Isa to Brisbane doubled. Yes, city people got it cheaper, but it was over the broken backs of these people outside the metropolitan areas of Australia. We have dealt with transport and banks, but one of the most sorrowful issues from where I sit was the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. There are certain things that simply should not be privatised. The magnificent book entitled Privatisation: Sell off or sell out refers to the cost of selling these items to the public and what the value now is of those items, and there is a $45,000 million difference. We sold Commonwealth Serum Laboratories being told that that was the value of Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. Who was telling us that? Surprise, surprise-the head of Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. I am told that he is now on the list of ‘The 100 wealthiest people in Australia'. His wealth is colossal, and he was a humble public servant prior to privatisation. It always fascinates me at election time that those who are now my political opponents in the major parties will have $20 million or $30 million to spend throughout Australia. In my electorate in the last election campaign they spent some $350,000. We want to know where this money comes from. How come they had $350,000 and we had only $70,000? Mr Gavan O'Connor-Your majority went up!",65
24,Mr KATTER,NOES,"The people are not entirely fooled. I hope and pray that it will go up again next time. But where does this money come from? I do not blame the political parties in the sense that they are in competition with each other. They have to take this money and there is a price to be paid for taking it. But if you were a merchant banker and you were going to handle the agency for the sale of Telstra, and you were to take two per cent on the sale and divide it up amongst half-a-dozen or a dozen of you, you would have an awful lot of money to play around with. One of the political parties in this has had very prominent people indeed associated with merchant banking. I think that some people need to do some real hard and heavy research on the connection between the merchant bankers, who get the agency for the sell-off of these assets, and when someone gives you a golden handshake for $20 million-‘Well, gee whiz, I think it's only fair, right, decent and honest to give $2 million back.' I cannot help but tell the story, at the expense of one of my great heroes Ted Theodore, of someone who you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Lindsay, would remember well: Mr Tom Aikens. One of the great history books of Australia stated that the two great speakers in Australia were Menzies and Aikens, but it was said that Aikens was better because he could resort to humour. Aikens tells the story of being invited to rejoin the Labor Party. He said, ‘What-join that mob of rogues and scoundrels?' Labor said, ‘That's unfair, Tom.' Tom replied, ‘Theodore-Mungana?' I am saying this at the expense of one of my great heroes Ted Theodore, but they said, ‘That is unfair, Tom. That money was divided up equally between all of the boys.' I do not think things have changed a real lot. I cannot speak with authority for metropolitan areas and I do not intend to. I do not represent them. But, as far as nonmetropolitan Australia is concerned, the privatisation of the railways-or corporatisation, if I want to be technical-was an absolute disaster. I turn to the privatisation of air transport. My grandfather was one of the original people involved in getting that airline off the ground. We lost our money. We put our money in again and we lost it the second time. Then we gave it to the government. That great movie-Ned Kelly, was it? No. I place am struggling for the name. Young Einstein was another movie",67
25,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The member for Kennedy,67
26,Mr KATTER,NOES,"Is rambling, I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, but",67
27,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"I am enjoying your speech, member for Kennedy, and you have used more than half the time allocated to you, but you have not actually mentioned anything about the bill yet. Could you just relate it to the bill and say, ‘Medibank Private Sale Bill' once or twice in your speech, then you will be in order.",68
28,Mr KATTER,NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I take your admonition most seriously and I will come back to a closer perusal of the bill. However, to complete what I was saying, at the end of Young Einstein he says, ‘I'm going to give this E=mc2 theory to the government because you couldn't trust anyone else with it'-and there are atomic explosions going off in the background. We gave up Qantas. That was not the smartest thing we ever did because Qantas has completely left the people, where it was birthed. The people who put up the money to create this great asset for Australia have been completely abandoned by that airline. The only services they can get are at huge cost. They are not available to the ordinary person, who simply cannot fly on the airline. What does that mean? It means, as the member for Calare said, that if you think you might have cancer and you need to go down to the city for tests-which most certainly cannot be done anywhere in western Queensland-you do not have enough money to go down and do them. And you cannot afford to take two to three days off work, so it cannot be done. So whether it is the railways, Qantas or the banks, we got a dreadful deal out of privatisation. If Medibank Private is sold, I do not doubt for a moment that we will get the same sort of deal. Let me be specific about the Medibank deal. The National Rural Health Alliance recently produced some figures, which were published in the Australian Journal of Rural Health. There are 55 dentists per 100,000 people in the major cities compared with 17 per 100,000 in western New South Wales and even fewer in western Queensland. Over one-third of practising dentists are over 50 years of age and 83 per cent of dentists work in the private sector. Medibank Private gives the government some ability to direct traffic. Every time the government gives away this bit of control, their ability to deliver services becomes increasingly difficult. I hark back to my days in the Queensland government because they are most relevant to this bill. We did not need to privatise anything and yet we were the most successful as a private enterprise government in Australian history. I do not think a single person in this parliament-they may accuse us of many other things-could say we were not. Our political opponents in those days acknowledged-whatever else they might have said-the terrific success of the Queensland government in enterprise. We did not create the aluminium industry by selling off the Gladstone power station; we created the aluminium industry by building the Gladstone power station. One of very few places on earth you can walk in off the street and get free hospital treatment is in Queensland. We did that by holding control ourselves and having a determination to deliver services to the people not only in the capital cities but everywhere in the state of Queensland. I am not saying that people in the cities are faring much better with medical services than we are in the country, although they have better access to specialist services. There is no doubt that there will be a tremendous loss in the government's ability to control, direct and deliver that most important of all services-medical health services. If you say that the free market system will guarantee the delivery of services then I strongly recommend you read the books on Enron. Classic economic philosophy-or ideology; whichever word you use-says that if the supply decreases, the price will go up and then the supply will increase. In California, when the power supply went down, as the result of a drought and lack of hydroelectricity, the price went through the roof. So if the price went through the roof by taking a bit of power away from the system, the price could be sent through the clouds if you took a lot away. That is exactly what happened. Every one of the congressional and Senate inquiries in the United States clearly indicated that once you have a significant hold upon the marketplace, such as Enron and three or four other suppliers of power in California had, then you were able to manipulate the free market system. As I have said in this place on many occasions, the problem with members opposite is that when they were little boys and little girls their mummies and daddies never had them play Monopoly. If they had, they would know that when you get hold of all the utilities you can quadruple the price you charge for electricity or for water. But I played Monopoly when I was young, and I know the rules of the game well. If they think this is not playing Monopoly, then they believe in the tooth fairy. I have mentioned the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories-they had a lot of fun. The Commonwealth Bank had a lot of fun. Telstra are going to have a lot of fun. The people who will pay the price will be ordinary, average Australians-the sorts of men who fought tenaciously to create these wonderful institutions for Australia. And they were not all on the right-hand side of the House, where I am standing; they were not all in the Labor Party. They were on the other side of the House as well. The Commonwealth Bank was kicked off by King O'Malley, but there is no doubt that every conservative government enhanced and solidly backed that bank. The pygmies who are ruling Australia now consider themselves intellectually superior to Bob Menzies, Jack MCEwen and Ben Chifley. They are not. The failure of privatisation in Australia is already on record. I cannot believe that a government would continue with it. (Time expired)",68
29,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,NOES,"It was only fitting that the member for Kennedy was able to finish his contribution. He always makes a very interesting contribution. I can see from his contribution to the debate that he will not be supporting the sale of Medibank Private. He mentioned near the end of his speech that the conservative government established an act in 1952 to regulate private health funds. When we talk about Medibank Private, we should talk about how it was created. It was created in 1976 to mitigate the adverse effects on Medibank as a result of the election of the Fraser government. Like all tory governments-the Howard government is no different-the government realises that Labor's policy of having a universal health system is so popular that they cannot abolish it. They can hurt it; they can slowly erode the benefits of a universal health system. The Fraser government, with its Treasurer John Howard, was in the same position then in some respects as the Howard government is in now. It could not go to an election proposing the abolition of Medibank, but it started to tear it down. That was an unpopular move. It had to mitigate the effects of the policies that were hurting the universal health system that was introduced by the Whitlam government in its first term, in October 1976. Just a year after the introduction of that universal health system, Medibank, the government sought to mitigate those effects. Medibank in the end was a pillar in the creation of a dual public-private health system. It was, and is still today, a non-profit entity. It has national coverage and has become Australia's most popular health fund, representing 30 per cent of the private health insurance market. It is a very important player in the field. Therefore, it is important to discuss in this place whether we should sell or not sell Medibank. It is alarming not to see the government defending its decision to sell. One would have thought that after the member for Kennedy had spoken in the debate a member of the government might have wanted to explain to the Australian public via this chamber why they should sell this important organisation and why there is a need to sell it after the next federal election. But not only is no government member prepared to contribute to this debate, which shows how little regard the government has for the chamber or for the health system of this nation, but also the Minister for Health and Ageing has chosen to gag the debate. I am informed that there are even more Labor members wanting to contribute to this important matter of public policy. At half past one today they will be denied that right. So members representing constituents across the land will be denied entering into a debate about whether we should sell or not sell Medibank Private. It is a disgrace that the government is not able to defend its position. The government is choosing to announce the sale. The government thinks that, by announcing that the sale will not occur until after the next election, the Australian people will somehow not hurt them at the next election. The Australian people are far smarter than that. I believe they are concerned about the potential sale of Medibank Private. The decision to sell Medibank will be one of the matters that will be before the Australian people at the next election. There are many others. There is the extreme and unfair Work Choices legislation that is affecting many workers across this country already. That legislation will increasingly affect workers in this nation-the way in which penalty rates and award conditions can be removed and employers can sack employees unfairly, without those employees having any recourse to question the decision. All of those things are occurring. The Australian public will make up their minds as to whether they want to have an extreme and unfair industrial relations system. There is the decision for us to enter the war and not return the troops from Iraq. The Australian public is increasingly concerned about climate change and global warming. Again, the government is failing to act. In the decision to sell Medibank Private, you see the government's ideological obsession about privatisation, about selling off an institution that was created by the Fraser government. I always say to people: ‘I am not suggesting the government is only extreme or unfair in certain areas when compared with former Labor administrations. Look at the way this government operates in the area of industrial relations, and certainly with its decision to sell Medibank Private, when compared to the Fraser government or governments preceding the Fraser government'-in other words, other tory conservative governments. Medibank Private is the creation of a Liberal-National Party government, and it is going to be flogged off. Sufficient reason for the sale has not been given. As I said, Medibank Private currently has 30 per cent of the private health insurance market. In its early days it undoubtedly contributed to keeping premiums down as its competitors continually undercut them. You could say that Medibank Private has been the Australian Democrats of the private health insurance industry, that they have been keeping the so-and-sos honest. Unfortunately, if the bill for the sale of Medibank Private passes, I fear that Medibank Private will head the same way as the Australian Democrats appear destined to be heading. A number of reasons have been put forward by the minister for health-although I do not see them being echoed in this place now by members of the government-about why we should sell Medibank Private. They are not compelling reasons. It seems to me there is a burden upon the government to explain why there is a need for change and what the supposed benefits are. There are essentially two arguments used by the government. Firstly, they assert it will lower private health insurance premiums. Secondly, they assert that the government should not be both a participant and a regulator in the same industry. I would like to turn my attention to those two government assertions as to why there should be a selling-off of this institution. I would argue that there is no evidence to support the claim that a privatised Medibank Private will lower premiums. Apart from the fact that the government have a poor track record on predicting declining premiums, the government's logic here just does not stack up. Where is the money going to come from to provide a return to those who buy shares in a privatised Medibank Private? The government argue that lower administrative costs would be a result of the sale but this not supported by the facts. The facts show, effectively, that Medibank Private already has the lowest administrative costs in the industry. They are certainly well below the industry standard. So how can it be argued that we need to sell Medibank Private to lower the premium when already the Medibank Private premium is lower than the industry average? That certainly is contrary to the logic of the arguments raised by the Minister for Health and Ageing. Until now, Medibank Private has never paid any dividends to anyone. Any profits have been ploughed back into reserves. If the profit or surplus is too high, then the following year's premiums are adjusted. If Medibank Private is sold and the government takes away the reserves, whoever buys it will have to invest a lot of money-some estimates are close to $1 billion. This is likely to push premiums up rather than reduce them. As Medibank Private is the country's biggest insurer, any premium rise by Medibank Private will allow its competitors to raise their prices too. So all the people in the community who have private health insurance should be alarmedall not only the members of Medibank Privateas should the competitors. The regulation of Medibank Private by government since its inception on 1 October 1976 has ensured that it is not easy for private health insurance companies to raise their premiums. It is important to place this argument in the context of the history of health provision in this country. It was a conservative government that created Medibank Private. It did so because its decisions to diminish the service provisions of Medibank at the time were hurting the Australian public. It created this institution to mitigate those effects and now we have a conservative government seeking to privatise its own scheme. We say that the arguments which have been proposedcertainly the argument that premiums are is going to fall as a result of the sale-just do not add up. Concerning the alleged conflict of interest, for all practical purposes I am hoping to illuminate the House and the government about matters to do with Medibank Private. The government has placed the Australian people in the dark because no cogent argument has been put forward by the Minister for Health and Ageing, or by the government frontbenchers, as to why we are to sell Medibank Private. I am in the dark.",69
30,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,We are all in the dark!,71
31,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,NOES,"Certainly the Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs is as in the darkmetaphorically and physically-as we are about this decision. It is unfathomable. It difficult one for us to come to grips with because effectively the government are abolishing a scheme which they created to mitigate the effects of their having attacked Medibank. We know that when the Minister for Health and Ageing says in this place that the government is the best friend Medicare has ever had he does so ironically. If it a parliamentary question, he should be asked to sit down because he would be using irony. We know that; it is an in joke. He turns to government members and says, ‘This government is the best friend that Medicare ever had,' and they all have a laugh because they know what he means-that they will boil the frog slowly on the universal health system. They want to corrode it; they want to destroy it. We know that. One of the ways they are going about that is by selling an institution which they created in 1976. When you compare this government with even previous tory administrations you see that this is an extreme government. These decisions-to enact the Work Choices legislation, to sell Medibank Private-reflect a government full of arrogance and hubris. We know why this is occurring-because they have the power to do so. If they had a minority in the Senate, they would not be suggesting this. They think they now have the power to do absolutely anything. If I had time and it was relevant to this debate, I would talk about what the government did to the Senate committees, how they found themselves chair of every committee. That has had a number of consequences and is a symptom of a government that is not in touch with the Australian people and is certainly now pursuing its ideological obsessions. The industrial relations stuff that the Prime Minister has been ranting on about for is a 30 years is now upon us. His dream is becoming Australia's reality-or Australia's nightmare. And the reasons for the sale of Medibank Private are the same-no cogent argument, not good public policy. In fact the argument of reducing premiums is contrary to all evidence, which suggests that the premiums will rise. Therefore, this is not rational argument that has been put forward is ever in cogently by the government. The government know they have the power. They no longer think they have to explain why they want to make changes to the Australian society that we love. They no longer believe they have to put up arguments. In this debate, there are no government members. The reason why the government have to gag the debate is, firstly, to show us how powerful they are; secondly, they do not have anyone to contribute to the debate. After I have finished, another Labor member will contribute to this debate, which will finish at 1.30-gagged by the government because they do not have any cogent arguments as to why Medibank Private is to be sold. If they had decent arguments, you would expect them to put them forward. So this gag is not just about hurting us; it is about allowing the government to avoid explaining the inexplicable. Why would you sell Medibank Private when you know it has been keeping premiums down? There is one other concern that the shadow minister for health and the Leader of the Opposition raised today, and that is the concern about whether a debt will be owed to members of the fund upon the sale of Medibank Private. As we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition and others, some very good, independent advice has been provided by the Parliamentary Library that suggests that, upon the sale, there will be a debt owed to members of the fund. The response from the government was, ‘We paid for some private advice, and our lawyers told us that there will be no problem, there will be no debt; there will be no entitlement owed to members of the fund.' So we have to decide whether we will support the independent advice provided by the Parliamentary Library or whether we will listen to the advice that the government paid for and wanted to hear. Our choice is between the advice provided by the government and the independent advice provided by the Parliamentary Library. I know who I will be listening to with respect to this matter. The library has raised some serious concerns with respect to that. Indeed, in the Bills Digest it says: ... it is arguable that members of Medibank Private could be entitled to compensation if the terms of any sale do not adequately account for their right to the benefit of fund assets. It continues: The Research Brief refers to Medibank Private's 2005 annual report, which cites a net asset of $653.3 million. It is this figure in respect of which members entitlements is discussed .... Mr Deputy Speaker, some serious advice has been provided by independent experts, and the government have chosen to ignore them. Instead, they listen to the advice of Blake Dawson Waldron-which they paid for; and, of course, he who pays the piper calls the tune. The government do not care to give a reason. They do not even try to find an argument. They will not allow the debate to continue beyond 1.30 today. They will not allow people who represent constituents across this country to defend Medibank Private. This government is arrogant and out of touch, and it is using its power to crush debate in this place. It will force this bill through this chamber and will not allow people to speak. It will then force this bill through the Senate and we will have sold an institution that was created by a former conservative government to mitigate the effects of their decisions about Medibank in 1976. The Australian public have to understand this fully and must not be fooled by the arguments of the Minister for Health and Ageing. The arguments are not reasonable, and they do not make sense. I am sure that, come election day, there will certainly be a referendum on this decision. I know many Australians will decide they want to keep Medibank Private in government hands and they will not support the sale.",71
32,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"I thank the member for Gorton. Might I advise the House, simply out of courtesy on the advice that was provided by the sergeant, that the interruption to the light was caused by a lightning strike. I think it would be churlish of me to suggest it is a judgement upon either side of the House on the merits of this argument, but it is an act of figure God and we are temporarily in the dark.",73
33,Mr DANBY,NOES,"Nonetheless, just like the member for Gorton, I am in the dark about the government's motives for the Medibank Private Sale Bill 2006. I obviously want to indicate my support for the shadow minister for health in opposing this plan to sell Medibank Private, Australia's largest private health insurer. Medibank Private was established by the Fraser government in 1976 as part of its demolition of the Whitlam government's pioneering, universal health insurance program-the original Medibank. At the time it seemed a retrograde step but, in practice, Medibank Private proved to be a great success, in part because of the prestige of the Medibank name. Medibank Private now has three million policy holders-29 per cent of the health insurance market. Last year its membership grew by 24,000. It is the market leader in the health insurance field and sets the terms on which the rest of the industry operates. As Medibank Private is a not-for-profit insurer, the level at which it sets its premiums helps guarantee that private health insurance remains accessible to those Australians who want it. Medibank Private is a highly successful business. Let me quote that well-known iconoclastic commentator and deputy editor of the Herald Sun, Terry MCCrann, who last month wrote: CEO George Savvides has done a sensational job in his five years at the helm, taking [Medibank Private] from a $175 million loss in 2002 to the latest $200 million profit, on the basis of tractive mix of $2.85 billion of premium income and $2.45 billion in benefits paid. Income from members is largely going back to them in payments. This will of course end if Medibank Private is sold off, as the government wants. No-one is going to invest their money in a not-forprofit company. If the private sector is going to buy Medibank Private it will do so in the expectation of profits-after all, that is why private investors make investments. Thus there is no doubt that premiums will rise if Medibank Private is privatised. I quote Professor John Deeble, one of the architects of the original Medibank and a former director of Medibank Private. He said: A commercial buyer would want more profits, premiums would go up and incidentally, the government would meet 30% of that increase through the private health insurance rebate. Let me make it clear that Labor does not have a fetish for state ownership, as some opposite have alleged. As other speakers have pointed out, the Hawke government had an extensive program of government asset sales. We sold Qantas, CSL and the Commonwealth Bank, the latter despite its iconic status for some people in the Labor Party as a symbol of state enterprise. We did this because we believed at the time that there was no longer any public interest in keeping airlines, banks or pharmaceutical companies in public ownership. Labor today believes that those fields of enterprise which belong in the private sector should be sold to the private sector and operated in an open and competitive market, subject to proper regulation to safeguard the public interest. But that does not mean we favour the complete abandonment of public ownership where it clearly serves a public interest-a public interest which would not be served if a particular enterprise were sold off. That was clearly the case with Telstra, where dean atspite numerous inquiries the government has not been able to show how a privatised Telstra, operating for profit in competition with other telecom firms, would be able to continue to meet its vital community service obligations, such as providing telephony and internet services to people in regional and remote Australia at a reasonable cost. The coalition parties also take this view when it suits them and the constituencies they represent. Do we hear government members calling for the deregulation and privatisation of the marketing of Australian agricultural products such as wheat? Of course not. When it comes to wheat, the National Party clings to the single desk, which is a euphemism for a state monopoly on wheat marketing. The National Party will die in a ditch before we have free trade and a free market in wheat and other agricultural products in this country. But with this government, what is good enough for the wretched Wheat Board, packed with crooks and mates, is not good enough for a clean, profitable, public agency like Medibank Private. What a contrast! Keep the crooks and get rid of a clean and efficient public company. If there was a strong case for keeping Telstra in part-public ownership in order to serve a legitimate community interest, there is an even stronger case for keeping Medibank Private in public ownership. Not only does it serve its own three million members; as the member for Gorton, the member for Lalor and the Leader of the Opposition have pointed out, it also serves to anchor the whole health insurance industry, ensuring that most of the industry continues to operate on a not-for-profit basis and that premiums remain relatively affordable. There is plenty of evidence that the private health insurance industry in Australia is not particularly well run and that it does not deliver a particularly high level of service to the Australian people. That is why a relatively low proportion of Australians choose to have private health cover and why so many prefer to rely on the health insurance system they pay for through their taxesMedicare. But the industry would be in infinitely worse shape were it not for the benchmark of service and affordability that Medibank Private provides. To borrow a phrase from our friends in the Senate: it serves to keep the bastards honest. Let me once again quote that notorious socialist Terry MCCrann: Why should we hand this sort of income generation to the private sector? Should heath insurance make ... profits anyway? Aren't they supposed to be non-profit? And if Medibank is privatised, who would then keep the bastards honest? Who then would keep the bastards honest? That is a question that will resonate around Australia. This issue will affect the government in all seats around Australia, including in marginal seats where a large number of people have Medibank Private policies and really doubt the wisdom of this government policy. One of the advantages of a not-for-profit health insurance system is that it is able to offer health cover for people who might be considered poor risks in a strictly commercial sense-that is, people with pre-existing health conditions, people with disabilities, the middle-aged and the elderly. A health insurance system based solely on profitseeking would try to exclude all these people from cover, because they are statistically far more likely to make expensive claims than the young or the healthy. Once you privatise a company, you create pressure to allow that company to operate in a way that will maximise its profits. Indeed you create a moral obligation to do so because you cannot ask people to invest their money in a company and then regulate it in such a way that it remains unprofitable. That is the hook the government has got itself on over Telstra. The management of Telstra know that they will not be able to meet Telstra's current community service obligations and at the same time return a profit to shareholders. That is why they are telling the government that the full privatisation of Telstra must be accompanied by the full deregulation of the telecom industry. Many argue that to do otherwise would be to perpetuate a fraud on investors. The government does not want to hear this advice that they should be made to pay full market rates for their phone and internet access, because it is unacceptable to people in regional Australia who form part of their constituency through the National Party in particular. Obviously the further out you are in rural, regional and remote Australia the higher the costs of telephony and the internet. People in rural and regional Australia are quite right to object to this. The government is trying to get off this hook by demonising Mr Trujillo and his colleagues, but the fact is that they are giving the government correct advice, and the government cannot change these unpalatable facts by denying them. If this is true in the case of Telstra, it is even truer in the case of Medibank Private. Full privatisation of health insurance will lead inevitably to pressure for full deregulation. And full deregulation will lead to the exclusion of poor-risk people from private health cover as the health insurance industry concentrates on competing for the business of people judged to be good risks. As Professor Deeble said: There will be bigger pressure on the government to deregulate and let them chase their good risk members and all that sort of thing if Medibank Private is sold, because Medibank Private has always acted like the conscience of the industry. That's what it was set up for and that's what always done. Now selling that removes that pressure. Mr Deputy Speaker Kerr, there are many things I admire about the United States, as you know, but its system of health insurance is not one of them. Under its fully privatised health insurance system, there are 45 million people-15 per cent of the whole population of that great country-who have no health cover at all. They are mainly the poor and the elderly. This has been made worse by the sharply declining number of companies which provide health cover to their employees once they retire. Health cover used to be part of a lifetime employment package offered by companies in the United States and, indeed, in most of the Western industrialised world. As we recall, the efforts of the Clinton administration, led by Mrs Hillary Clintonhopefully the next President of the United States-to fix this state of affairs were defeated in Congress. That, in my opinion, was a tragedy for a country which I greatly admire but which is certainly far from perfect. I hope a new administration in the United States after 2009 will again tackle this issue. Meanwhile, we in Australia should profit by studying the situation of our friends in the United States, which was the situation in Australia before the introduction of Medibank by the Whitlam government and then Medicare by the Hawke government. The Australian people should understand that if it were not for Labor we would have a health insurance system like the United States has now. That is one of the key choices that the Australian people will face at the next election and that they have faced over the last 20 to 30 years. The Prime Minister has said several times that he does not intend that Australia should have an American-style health system. But, since he also said that Australia would not it's have an American-style education system and that we would not have $100,000 university degrees, we know how much those kinds of promises are worth. We on this side of the House are determined that Australia should not be forced to go back down the road that leads to a society based on inequity and unfairness, where the well-off majority have access to fully insured health care and the less well-off minority do not. Although this bill sets the stage for the privatisation of Medibank Private, the sale itself is not scheduled to go ahead until 2008-after the sale of Telstra is complete. No doubt this is because the government knows that Medibank Private would be a much better investment than Telstra-given the mess that it has made of Telstra-and doesn't want to give investors the choice. Obviously, people would invest in Medibank Private if it were to come onto the market and they had an opportunity to do that first. They know that this company, operating under its current circumstances, is inherently sound. I represent a fairly affluent electorate where the majority of people have private health cover-and many with Medibank Private cover-but I also represent many lowincome people, the elderly and recent immigrants. These are the people who will suffer the most if the health insurance industry is fully privatised and, as a consequence of that, fully deregulated. As the member for Lalor has pointed out, there are many people who are not in those categories who will be shocked that the government has taken the advice of Blake Dawson Waldron, their paidfor lawyers, rather than the advice of the impartial people in the Parliamentary Library. The government advice is that the participants in Medibank Private do not have prior rights in any sale of that organisation. I think the government is stepping into both a legal and ethical minefield here. There are a lot of people who are traditional government supporters, Liberal supporters-the member for Goldstein is sitting at the table; I am sure there are many people in his electorate who are participants in Medibank Private-who would oppose this sale. I do not think anyone in my electorate, no matter how well off they may be personally, would want to see an Australia in which a substantial proportion of people are left without affordable health cover. That would be the effect of this government's open agenda for privatising Medibank Private and its covert agenda for gutting Medicarehanding over health cover to a health insurance industry free from the moderating influence of a publicly owned Medibank Private. We will be happy to fight the next election on a policy of preventing such an outcome.",73
34,Ms CORCORAN,NOES,"I would like to start my comments this afternoon with a letter to the editor which was published in the Age on 5 September this year. It is signed by Robert Corcoran, who is not only a constituent but also my dad. He wrote: Although they do not physically provide any medical treatment or hospital accommodation, the various health funds do the real work of collecting insurance money and returning much of it to help pay medical costs. Leaving aside the more fundamental subject of the fairness or otherwise of the present piebald system, the topical question is whether this financial service could be provided more effectively by selling Medibank Private. Shareholders in a sold Medibank Private would certainly expect a return on their investment better than bank interest-and, based on its estimated price of $1.5 billion ... this would require an annual payment of much more than $100 million a year to the new shareholders. What effect would this have on already steadily increasing premium rates? Perhaps we would all be better off if the Government turned its attention to restoring and improving the effectiveness of the universal system of Medicare, especially by reducing waiting times. Then we could all be assured of appropriate treatment, whether able to afford expensive private health insurance or not. The purpose of the Medibank Private Sale Bill 2006 is to amend the National Health Act to allow the government to sell Medibank Private. The government has said that it will not sell Medibank immediately, but it wants this legislation in place so it can sell it in 2008. Since 1976, Medibank Private has been controlled by the Commonwealth government. The fund is a not-for-profit. It has about three million members and about 28 per cent of the private health insurance market across Australia. It has about a third of the market in Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania and 44 per cent of the market in the Northern Territory. It is the only fund which operates in every state and territory in this country. There are over 40 health funds in Australia, five of which are for-profit. These funds cover about 31 per cent of the market.",77
35,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The time allotted for the remaining stages of this bill has expired. Ms Gillard- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Could you clarify for members of the House who would be about to vote on the second and third reading stages of this bill whether or not, in your view, member were also a member of Medibank Private, that would raise a pecuniary interest about which they ought to be concerned in respect of exercising a vote.",78
36,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"I have had advice from the clerks in relation to this matter, and I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for raising the issue in the interests of members who may be subject to a view that they have an interest in the fund, who may have expressed some concern. Standing order 134 provides that a member may not vote in a division on a question about a matter, other than public policy, in which they have a direct pecuniary interest. House of Representatives Practice indicates that public policy may be defined as government policy not identifying any particular person individually or immediately. I have had a look at the precedents in the past, and it does Bishop, B.K. seem that, for example, the ownership of shares generally in a company has not excluded persons from participating in votes where their interests have been affected simply as a shareholder in a company that would be affected by a change in policy. So in that manner the precedents do not seem to indicate that members would need to disqualify themselves on the basis of the previous application of standing orders, as the matter before the House could be thought to and would relate to a matter of public policy. The chair, of course, has no reason to ascertain the individual circumstances of members as to whether any might have any specifically additional interest that might be material in relation to their right to vote upon the matter. However, it is open for any member to raise, understanding order 134, a motion challenging the right of members to participate in a division, afterwards. That appears to be the only manner that is open in those circumstances. But, on the precedents if a that I have been able to ascertain from the Practice and the clerks I would advise that it would seem that, whether or not there is a pecuniary interest in the circumstances, it would not preclude a member exercising a right to vote in the House.

39,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ISLANDER HERITAGE PROTECTION,Order! Could members please respect the right of the member to make a substantial contribution by exiting the House quietly if they are doing so.,80
40,Mr HAASE,ISLANDER HERITAGE PROTECTION,"Thank you for your support, Mr Deputy Speaker. This act of 1984 preserves and protects places, areas and objects of particular significance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Protecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage is very important, but there are some elements of this act which need amending. The act works on a national level, but is concurrent with the laws of most Australian states and territories. Schedule 2 is a repeal of part IIA of the act. The amendments to the act contained in schedule 2 of the current bill provide for the repeal of the Victoria specific provisions of the act, including the scheme for Victoria alone that is set out in part IIA the act. The act allows the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to protect significant Aboriginal places and objects under threat in any Australian state or territory at the request of an Indigenous person if the minister considers that there is no effective protection under the state or territory laws. In 1987 the act was extended to include a special framework for day-today protection of Aboriginal cultural heritage in Victoria, whereas all the other Australian states and territories have their own Aboriginal heritage laws. Since then, the Victorian provisions have been administered by the Victorian minister on delegated powers with no Commonwealth involvement in the day-today decisions. In 2005 the Victorian government wrote to the Australian government about amendments to repeal the Victorian provisions of the act to allow a transition to new Victorian Aboriginal cultural heritage legislation. As requested by the Victorian government in 2005, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Amendment Bill 2005 provides for continued operation of the Victorian provisions of the act until the new Aboriginal heritage regime is in place. The bill provides for a period of 12 months after royal assent for Victoria to complete these arrangements and to set a date for the repeal of the Victorian provisions and full transfer of responsibility to Victoria. The consequential amendments to the Aboriginal Land (Lake Condah and Framlingham Forest) Act 1987 in the bill remove references to part IIA of the act. Before amendment, disclosure for the purposes of part IIA of the act was an exception to the obligation on two Aboriginal landowner corporations in Victoria to not disclose information about sacred or significant places withof out special permission. After the amendment, the obligation to protect the information about sacred or significant sites will continue without exception. The proposal will simplify the act by removing an anomaly in relation to Victoria. The removal by the consequential amendments of an exception to the obligation upon two Aboriginal landowner corporations to not disclose information will mean that everyone is treated equally. There should not be special provisions for any one group or person in this country. Due to the nature of the heritage act, when it comes to identifying a sacred site where there is no physical evidence, exploration has as much impact as native title-sometimes more. It can run parallel to native title, and creates a long, expensive process. The Western Australian act, the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972, applies to my electorate. It applies to places, objects, traditional use, availability for traditional use and traditional custodians. The language, as you will hear in a moment, is overarching, but not very specific. The definition of ‘place' is taken to mean: (a) any place of importance and significance where persons of Aboriginal descent have, or appear to have, left any object, natural or artificial, used for, or made or adapted for use for, any purpose connected with the traditional cultural life of the Aboriginal people, past or present; (b) any sacred, ritual or ceremonial site, which is of importance and special significance to persons of Aboriginal descent; (c) any place which, in the opinion of the Committee, is or was associated with the Aboriginal people and which is of historical, anthropological, archaeological or ethnographical interest and should be preserved because of its importance and significance to the cultural heritage of the State; (d) any place where objects to which this Act applies are traditionally stored, or to which, under the provisions of this Act, such objects have been taken or removed. It goes on: The Act applies to all objects, whether natural or artificial and irrespective of where found or situated in the State, which are or have been of sacred, ritual or ceremonial significance to persons of Aboriginal descent, or which are or were used for, or made or adapted for use for, any purpose connected with the traditional cultural life of the Aboriginal people past or present. The Act applies to objects ‘so nearly resembling an object of sacred significance to persons of Aboriginal descent as to be likely to deceive or be capable of being mistaken for such an object'. In relation to traditional use, a traditional person is one defined as a person of Aboriginal descent who usually lives subject to Aboriginal customary law, or in relation to any group of such persons, this Act shall not be construed: (a) so as to take away or restrict any right or interest held or enjoyed in respect to any place or object to which this Act applies, in so far as that right or interest is exercised in a manner that has been approved by the Aboriginal possessor or custodian of that place or object and is not contrary to the usage sanctioned by the Aboriginal tradition relevant to that place or object; or (b) so as to require any such person to disclose information or otherwise to act contrary to any prohibition of the relevant Aboriginal customary law or tradition. The act provides for availability for traditional use. It goes on: Where the Committee is satisfied that a representative body of persons of Aboriginal descent who usually live subject to Aboriginal customary law has an interest in a place or object to which this Act applies that is of traditional and current importance to it, and which is in the custody or control of the Minister, the Minister, after consultation with the Committee, shall make that place or object available to that body as and whenever required for purposes sanctioned by the Aboriginal tradition relevant to that place or object. The final section relates to traditional custodians. It reads: ... where the Committee is satisfied that a representative body of persons of Aboriginal descent has an interest in a place or object to which this Act applies that is of traditional and current importance to it the Minister may, by notice in the Gazette, authorise a person or persons nominated by that body and named in the notice to exercise such of the powers of the Minister and to perform such of the Minister's duties in relation to that place or object as are set out in that notice, and any such authorisation may in the like manner be varied or revoked. In order to meet with the obligations under the act, explorers have to gain heritage clearance. This involves input from all parties who have a claim on that area of land. Representatives often selected on the basis of availability only from each of the parties visit and investigate the area and decide as to its significance and then rule on whether or not it can be explored. To give the House a general impression, clearance will cost an exploration company from $300 to $500 per person per day, usually for between three and six representatives for each claimant group while they are on site. The company also has to supply transport and food and cover all associated costs. Therefore, a small prospector looking to explore 10 to 20 hectares, for example, will usually pay more than $3,000 just to explore the potential. If a prospector gains clearance to an area, that clearance applies only to exploration. If a commercial deposit is found on that site, the party that decided on the significance can then decide to revisit the decision. Unfortunately, this system is open to corruption, which means that decisions are not final. To make it even more complicated for explorers, a claim under the heritage act can be made by a different family group from the recognised traditional owner of the land, so they may have to deal with several claimants on an ongoing basis. Prospectors are not multimillion-dollar mining companies. Small operators, often one-man bands, undertake the majority of greenfield exploration work, something that is vital for the future of this sector and consequently the economic vitality of the nation. The mineral industry represents 6.5 per cent of the Australian economy and produces one-third of Australia's exports. Because of the lack of specific detail in the process, problems in gaining access to prospective land by explorers have contributed to a significant decline in exploration investment in Australia. In 1996-97, investment was at a peak at more than $1 billion. This figure has reduced by almost 50 per cent since then. Australia's mining industry is the backbone of the Australian economy. For the past decade, the industry has generated billions of dollars; the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies-AMEC-estimates it to be $175 billion. We must do what we can to support the minerals industry. It has a huge effect on all Australians, but particularly on the people of my electorate. Whilst native title, environmental legislation and the absence of flow-through share schemes pose the greatest obstacle, the heritage act has a major detrimental impact at first base. We all live on this continent. I agree with AMEC that the ‘only areas that should be closed to exploration and potential multiple land use are those areas that have been comprehensively assessed and found to have overwhelming values as a land use that precludes any alternative use of coexistence'. Under such circumstances, the community must be fully informed of the potential cost benefits of the uses denied. AMEC has reported that Aboriginal parties have referred mining projects which have already received state approval to the Commonwealth minister under the terms of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, resulting in frustrating delays for project proponents. I propose that, as we are amending this bill for the better, we should consider amending it to better protect and encourage our smaller mining companies and support this industry in the long term. This bill makes other changes to the act that are needed to ensure that Australians continue to have the opportunity to see, in Australia, significant Aboriginal cultural heritage objects that are owned by institutions overseas. These institutions are currently reluctant to loan material unless they have the protection of a certificate under the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986 to allow the return of the important objects to the lender and owner overseas. Uncorrected, this kind of uncertainty would discourage overseas institutions from ever allowing items from their collections to be exhibited in Australia. Australia's reputation as a borrower of cultural materials was damaged by a series of declarations under the Victorian provisions of the act in 2004-05. Debate interrupted. NA Interest Rates",80
41,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that if there is an interest rate rise next week it will be the eighth back-toback interest rate hike? How much have these rate rises added to the monthly repayment for someone with an average mortgage of $223,000?",83
42,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the subject of interest rates, I can confirm two things. I can firm that interest rates under the coalition will always be lower than under a Labor government. That is the first thing. The second thing I can confirm is that the housing interest rate now is at 7¾ per cent, and if my recollection serves me correctly, the housing interest rate reached 17 per cent under the stewardship of the government of which the Leader of the Opposition was a member. As I said on Sunday, Keating and Beazley equalled 17 per cent; Howard and Costello equal 7¾ per cent. That is what I can confirm. Climate Change",84
43,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also to the Prime Minister. Prime ister, would you outline to the House government initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power stations? Is the Prime Minister aware of support for this approach?",84
44,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think that the member for MCMillan and, of course, the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, the Treasurer, the Victorian Premier and the Queensland Premier will all be aware of federal government initiatives not only to encourage renewables but also-and very importantly-to encourage investment in lowemission technology. What we have said for more than two years is that the most important priority in reducing greenhouse gas emission is to accelerate investment in clean coal technology. That was the essence of the white paper that was put out 2½ years ago. That approach has been derided by those who sit opposite but this morning we find dramatic field evidence from two successful Labor politicians-namely, the Victorian Premier and the Queensland Premiersupporting very much the whole approach that is being taken by the federal government. This morning, the Premier of Queenconsland, who, of course, is the premier of the state that produces the most coal in this country-namely, the state of Queenslandand somebody who understands the impact of some of the careless policies flung around over the last couple of days by the Leader of the Opposition on the workers in that state, had this to say: We have credibility on clean coal technology. We have a good track record on this and we need to move to the next stage now. Listen to this! If we can get clean coal technology in a commercial way it will not only clean up Australia but also China and other developing nations. That is what the Premier of Queensland had Min- to say and his words were echoed by the spokesman for the Victorian government who said that they were putting their faith in clean coal technology. This is exactly what was in mind when the Callide A power station in Queensland was in receipt of $187 million from the government's low emission technology fund. There is an investment at Fairview Power leveraged by federal government investment of $445 million. And at International Power Pty Ltd in the Latrobe Valley, an area very well known to the member for MCMillan, there is a proposal worth $360 million to retrofit brown coal drying, combined with ultra supercritical coal technology. This is exactly what we have been talking about for 2½ years, and this is exactly what the Labor Party, sitting over there in opposition, have been deriding for the last 2½ years. But they have been shown the way by their successful state colleagues. Peter Beattie and Steve Bracks have shown the way on this issue and, tellingly in the light of the remarks made by the member for Grayndler, Mr Beattie had this to say. In light of the fact that the two states have committed a combined $400 million to clean coal technology, Mr Beattie declared that Queensland favoured it over renewable energy sources because it was ‘more practical and it will work quicker'. Those were not the words of John Howard or Ian Macfarlane, although John Howard and Ian Macfarlane agree with those words. I think both Ian Macfarlanes would agree with those words. Even the other Ian Macfarlane would agree with those words. Our position is very clear. For 2½ years we have been arguing the cause of clean coal technology and today we have seen the premiers of Queensland and Victoria blow the Leader of the Opposition out of the water on this issue, and, in the process, detonate the member for Grayndler. I thank the member for MCMillan for such a searching question.",84

47,Mr DANBY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, I refer you to a Newspoll published today which shows that 79 per cent of Australians think Australia should ratify Kyoto, 86 per cent of Australians think the government should be doing more to tackle climate change and 92 per cent of Australians think the government should significantly increase investment in renewable energy. Does the Prime Minister agree with his parliamentary secretary who dismissed 92 per cent of Australians as just cafe latte drinkers, and does this explain your 10 years of inaction and climate change scepticism?",85
48,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think it is the job of political leaders in this country to read opinion polls but to do what they think is right for Australia. It is as simple as that. It may surprise many of those who sit behind me to know that the Leader of the Opposition has only become-how shall I put it?-an eleventh hour convert to the cause of ratifying Kyoto. Some years ago he was not quite as excited about it. In tireless research on this subject, it is amazing what you come across. Maybe there was a time when the Leader of the Opposition was influenced by these words from a person who came from his own native state of Western Australia. This is what this person had to say, writing in November 2001: For Australia to ratify the Kyoto Protocol is to commit to a policy of decarbonisation of our industrial and export base. It is to inflict upon its people unemployment, profound economic dislocation and decline. For a nation to inflict upon itself such economic and political damage is almost unprecedented. Those were the words of a highly successful finance minister in the Hawke and Keating government by the name of Senator Peter Walsh. I'll tell you what: he was a lot more successful than any of you who sit opposite. He was a senior minister in a government. Let me simply say to the member for Melbourne Ports, who is a member I have some considerable respect for-through you, Mr Speaker Mr Tanner interjecting",85

53,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, let me say, through you, to the member for Melbourne Ports: yes, I have read that online poll-I think the member for Melbourne Ports understands the import of that adjective. I have read that online poll. Let me tell him and let me tell the Australian people: we listen to their views on this issue. We are aware of the need to take practical measures to address greenhouse gas emissions, but I say to them: we are not going to take measures that destroy the great comparative advantage that this country has, we are not going to be panicked into knee-jerk responses that will hobble great productive Australian industries with enormous costs that are not borne by their competitors overseas and we are not going to ratify a protocol which, in the words of a highly successful Labor minister, would do damage of an economic kind on an unprecedented scale to the great wealth producing industries of this country.

55,Mr CIOBO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Minister, what is the government's reaction to threats by the Fiji military commander to force the resignation of the Fiji government?",86
56,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First can I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question and for his interest. The government is very concerned about the comments of Commodore Frank Bainimarama that the military in Fiji could move to remove the democratically elected government of Fiji, and his references to violence and bloodshed were, in our view, completely unacceptable. The Fiji military have defied the order of the Fiji President, who is the commander-inchief in Fiji, in relation to the suspension Commodore Bainimarama. While police investigate threats that he has made, the Fiji police commissioner has grave concerns that the military breached port security, threatening police and forcibly taking seven tonnes of ammunition. This, unfortunately, is yet another occasion in our region where we have seen the rule of law defied. Defiance of the rule of law is anathema to the democratic principles that we all support here in this parliament and around Australia. Regional governments have consistently pointed out the proper role of the military in democracies. The Prime Minister has spoken with the Fiji and New Zealand prime ministers. I have spoken with the Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum and we have had a number of discussions with a range of different people about measures that can be taken to try to discourage Commodore Bainimarama and the Fiji military more generally from taking unconstitutional action against the government of Fiji. It is important to remember that Fiji has been rebuilding its democracy after the two coups in 1987 and the coup in 2000, and in Fiji May there was an election for the parliament and a multiparty cabinet. Fiji has a good reputation overseas in international peacekeeping operations and I know that the Fiji Prime Minister himself last night, in an address to the nation, said that if there were to be a coup in Fiji then participation in those international peacekeeping operations could be, to use his words, severely prejudiced. There is no doubt that there would be risks to the Fiji military's participation in peacekeeping if they were to take unconstitutional action against the elected government of their country. We have been, as I mentioned, having some discussions with the Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum and other Pacific Island Forum members about of what as a region we could do to assist the Fiji government, and I think it is best that I say at this stage that those discussions are ongoing. We have increased our travel advisory yet again, urging Australians to exercise a high degree of caution if they are to go to Fiji. We have up to 7,000 Australians in Fiji and nearly 2,000 Australians who live there. There are a lot of visitors-4,000 to 5,000at any one time. The situation is uncertain and could deteriorate. We think there is a very real chance there could be a coup in Fiji and it is important that all of us do everything we can to try to stop that occurring. Of course, at the end of the day, this is a matter that will be determined in Fiji by Fijians, we are certainly doing everything we possibly can to try to stop the coup taking place.

57,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister and it follows the first question I asked him. Does the Prime Minister accept any personal responsibility for any of the last seven back-to-back rate hikes?,87

62,Mr WOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline recent data on retail trade? What does this indicate about the financial position of Australian households?,87
63,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. Today we had the release of the September international trade in goods and services figures, which showed that the trade deficit in September increased to $646 million. This was principally caused by a decrease in exports of 1.5 per cent and resource exports were down, including coal, coke and briquettes, which fell 7.6 per cent. That is unfortunately a downturn in exports in the month of September. We also had retail trade figures released for September of this year which showed, in seasonally adjusted nominal terms, retail trade rose 0.1 per cent and was 5.9 per cent higher through the year. This is well down on the growth rates of but eight to nine per cent that we saw in 2003 and 2004. The annual national accounts, which I referred to in the House yesterday, gave annual figures for the state of the economy and, amongst other things, revised up the household savings ratio which shows that households are saving more than they were thought to be saving. One of the reasons for the retail trade figures could well be that households are saving more of their income. When one looks at savings rates, however, the important thing to look at is savings rates in relation to assets. We have lived over the last 10 years through an enormous increase in private sector wealth-in fact, the largest increase in private sector wealth that we have ever seen in Australia. This is a point that was made by Mr Battellino of the Reserve Bank recently where he said: ... conventional measures of saving do not take into account capital gains. This has a particular bearing on Australian households because ... they now hold a high proportion of their financial assets in investments such as shares and superannuation on which a significant part of the return is in the form of capital gains. In the May 2006 Statement on Monetary Policy, we showed that once allowance is made for capital gains, the saving rate of Australian households ... is neither low nor falling ... In other words, what the Reserve Bank has shown is that many Australians have decided to put their savings into shares or superannuation where they get a better return than they do in relation to an at-call bank account. Traditional measures of savings that only look at at-call bank accounts and then compare that to income miss the real story of what is going on in the Australian economy, which is people investing in higher yield, higher return mechanisms. This is something we believe will be thoroughly encouraged when Australia gets the biggest reform to superannuation that has ever been proposed in this country. The reforms that take place from 1 July next year mean there will be no tax on a pension or a lump sum when it is paid out of a taxed superannuation scheme. This makes superannuation the most preferred model of saving in the Australian economy. It will set many Australians up for a standard of living in their retirement which they would not otherwise have had. It is a reform that is being brought to the Australian people by the coalition government and we urge again that the Australian Labor Party get out of the way and support these reforms. Workplace Relations",87
64,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to a question asked by the member for Grayndler on 10 August about Tristar's refusal to guarantee it would meet its redundancy obligations to its employees covered by a collective agreement. I also refer the Prime Minister to the Tristar employees in the gallery today. Is the Prime Minister aware that Tristar has now applied to terminate the collective agreement, which would see its redundancy obligations massively reduced? What does the Prime Minister say to Marty Peek in the gallery, who has worked for Tristar for 34 years and who stands to lose over $130,000 in redundancy entitlements as a result of Tristar's actions?",88

66,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I don't pretend to carry in my mind every single question asked through the year. I will conscientiously have a look at the question asked by the member for Grayndler and I will come back and give a more detailed answer.

72,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will also take the opportunity of saying to the ladies and gentlemen in the gallery that the government I lead is the first government in Australia's history to bring in a scheme that guarantees the payment of certain basic entitlements in the event of a company not being able to,88
73,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,88
74,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And I am very proud of that. I also take this opportunity of telling them in relation to redundancy that the govpre- ernment recently announced that it would increase the basic entitlement that would be paid under GEERS where there was a default by the employing company to the community standard of 16 weeks, which was adjudged by the Industrial Relations Commission. So, whilst those who sit opposite may seek to contrast their position from ours, I remind not only the ladies and gentlemen in the gallery but the Australian people that, when the Labor Party were in office for 13 years, they did not bother to introduce a scheme of this kind. They were prepared to let people lose their redundancies and other things when companies went broke. I am very proud of the fact that we have moved in relation to that. But in relation to the particular question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, I will refer to the question asked by the member for Grayndler.

The government also recognised that last year when we took a policy decision that would ensure the funding of infrastructure into the future, particularly telecommunications infrastructure that is needed greatly in the modern context. That high-speed broadband access is just as important as more traditional infrastructure in Australia such as roads and rail links across regional Australia. Last year we announced a package of about $1.1 billion called Connect Australia, which was going to add to the mobile phone network across Australia but, importantly, provide an opportunity for providers to bid for grants to roll out large-scale infrastructure projects to enhance the access to broadband across Australia. In this day and age, where almost any business and any individual needs access to the internet-and, increasingly, businesses need access to high speed broadband-we recognise that need. is the $1.1 billion package. The minister to for communications has announced that rollout. The $600 million broadband infrastructure fund that is currently being bid for is also out there. We encourage all operators-this is not just for any individual provider or technology; it is technology neutral and, if you like, provider neutral-because we want to get the best out of it and we want to leverage private sector investment in infrastructure across regional Australia as well. Beyond that, the government put in place the $2 billion perpetual communications fund, which is going to provide a flow of capital that can be deployed to ensure that regional Australians get access to modern technology as it becomes availableMr Crean-No, they won't!",89
77,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham says they won't. The only reason they won't is if the Leader of the Opposition gets an opportunity to get his hands on that fund and goes and spends it elsewhere. That is the only reason it will not deliver. Mr Crean interjecting,89

Workplace Relations,90
86,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the website of Brisbane law firm Connor Hunter, The Federal Government's work Choices amendments offer you the opportunity to reduce your overheads significantly. … … … Employers can remove award conditions ... without compensating the employee at all. This affords employers the opportunity to reduce weekly pay through making cuts to penalty rates, overtime rates, leave loading, shift allowances and other forms of remunerating employees. Prime Minister, they are right, aren't they?",90

90,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Melbourne has raised a valid point of order inasmuch as the Prime Minister should refer to members by their name, but the Prime Minister is in order. Mr Tanner- Mr Speaker, I raised two points of order. I would ask you to rule on whether the Prime Minister's answer was relevant to the question",90
91,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne will resume his seat! I ruled that the Prime Minister should refer to members by their seat and I said that he was in order.,91
92,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was referring to the member for Batman by a rather more affectionate term than ‘you'. In reply to the member for Capricornia, I will tell you what is right: the three charges made against Work Choices by Labor and the unions have all been proved wrong. That is what is right. The first charge that was made against Work Choices was that it was going to cause enormous unemployment. The problem with that charge and why it falls to the ground is that, in almost seven months, we have had 205,000 new jobs created in Australia. Mr Hatton interjecting",91
93,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Blaxland is warned! The Prime Minister will be heard.,91
94,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The second charge made against the legislation was that it was going to lead to strikes and industrial chaos. We have in fact in the last three months recorded the lowest level of industrial disputes in Australia since the records were kept. The third charge made against this legislation was that it was going to drive down wages. In the six months that have gone by, real wages have continued to rise at a rate of 16.4 per cent a year. We all know what happened to real wages in the 13 years of Labor. They fell by 0.2 per cent in real terms. Mr Swan interjecting",91

96,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The final nail in the coffin was the absurd argument advanced by those who sit opposite and their supporters in the union movement that the new Fair Pay Commission, which they derisively called a low pay commission, was going to slash the minimum wage. You could see the thunder on their faces despite all the bonhomie they were displaying last Thursday when the decision came out from the Fair Pay Commission of a $27 a week increase in the minimum wage. So I say to the member for Capricornia-and I have not read that particular website-that what is right about Work Choices is that all of your claims against it are dead wrong. Future Fund",91
97,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer inform the House of the government's contribution to the Future Fund? Treasurer, are there any proposals to drain the fund's earnings, and what impact would that have?",91
98,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. Unlike other employers, the Commonwealth has never set aside payment for superannuation entitlements of its employees. Until this government established the Future Fund, it had made no provision for the just entitlements which public servants earn as part of their employment. In May 2006 we established the Future Fund and we deposited into it $18 billion. In 2006-07, we will deposit another $14 billion. We have now put aside nearly $30 billion towards the $100 billion of unfunded liability that the Commonwealth has. Just as with normal superannuationwhere an employer makes a contribution into a fund-the employee gets the contribution and the earnings. But there are proposals to rob the Future Fund of its earnings-that is, to rob the earnings of superannuation entitlements. This has caused the chairman of the guardians, Mr David Murray, to say in Senate estimates: If that is done, the real growth rate of the fund would be zero to negligiblebecause you would be taking the earnings out. I have alerted the House to how the Leader of the Opposition promised to take earnings out of the Future Fund on one of his whistlestop tours to northern New South Wales. Like a bear to the honeypot is the Leader of the Opposition. But I find it has now gone wider than the Leader of the Opposition-the member for Lilley is now at it. Members of this House will know that every morning the member for Lilley wakes up, clears his throat, practises his focus group line for the day and comes in and delivers it. He does that every day except on days after journalists have been excluded from ALP conferences for no ticket, no start. He came in on 4 May 2006 and said this: ... it's good news we got 18 billion, he is speaking of the Future Fundit's bad news that it will be locked up to pay off public servants superannuation. The journalist said: You want ... that $18 billion spent ... ? He said this: The income from the Building Australia fund should be spent on productive pursuitsin other words, taking the income out of the Future Fund and spending it on his priorities; taking away superannuation earnings from the fund which the Labor Party never had the wit to set up. Last night I truly had an out-of-body experience. I was in my flat alone watching the ABC news. While watching the ABC news I saw the member for Lilley. He had obviously practised his focus poll-driven line for the morning and he delivered it. And the line for that day was: ‘The government's global warming policies could be written on the back of a postage stamp.' But the camera had a wide-angle lens and as he delivered this line you could see his press secretary, Lachlan Harris, moving his lips in sync with those of the deliverer of the lines. They had obviously practised it to such a degree that the timing was perfect. I wish the member for Griffith wasn't enjoying this so much. We had the rooster puppet talking on this side and the ventriloquist mouthing the words on that side. The rooster",91

Is the minister aware of claims to the contrary, and what is the government's response?",93
116,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do thank the member for Mackellar for her question. Members opposite keep saying that this is one of the most important issues facing our country, so it is important to make the government's position absolutely crystal clear.

That is what we believe. Mr Brendan O'Connor interjecting",93

118,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is what Frances Sullivan of Catholic Health believes when he says that Medibank Private should not stay in government ownership, that is what Mark Fitzgibbon of the NIB health fund believes when he says that privatisation will lower premium pressure, that is what Professor Henry Ergas believes when he says that privatisation could reduce premium pressure by up to six per cent and, in their hearts, that is what members opposite believe. If it were otherwise, why did the former Labor government privatise the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas? Over the last two days a succession of Labor members have come into this parliament, led by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Lalor, claiming that the privatisation of Medibank Private means that shareholders win and policyholders lose. What an implicit smear this is, what a shocking smear this is, on every private business in this country. If what members opposite say is true, why did the Kirner Labor government privatise the State Insurance Office in Victoria?

Almost everything that Labor members have said about the privatisation of Medibank Private is a lie and they know it. When the Leader of the Opposition was in government he supported privatisation. He had the courage of Bob Hawke's convictions, he had the courage of Paul Keating's convictions, but it seems he has no convictions of his own. That is the problem with the Leader of the Opposition. We know what he is against-he is against everything which is potentially unpopular-but we do not know what he is for, and that is why he should never become the Prime Minister of this country. Workplace Relations",94
121,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. It relates to the question just asked of him by the member for Perth, which incorporated a set of statistics which indicated how many conditions had been removed from those who had signed AWAs, as examined by his relevant office, the OEA. In referring to those, I refer to the government's refusal in Senate estimates today to disclose updated statistical information on protected award conditions cut or removed from AWAs, which it previously provided in May.

You said wages were going to be driven down and they have continued to rise at a healthy rate. You said there were going to be mass industrial disputes; the reverse has been the case. I know you are unhappy at the state of the Australian economy. I know you are very, very unhappy, despite what you said, at the result that was brought out by the Fair Pay Commission last week.

127,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is the minister aware of claims that the government is not receiving adequate intelligence assessments on the situation in Iraq, and what is the government's response?",95
128,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fisher for his question and for his interest. terms of the assessments the government receives on the situation in Iraq, we receive constant assessments from a range of sources-obviously from our embassy in Baghdad, from various departments here in Canberra and, importantly, from the Office of National Assessments. On 31 October the member for Griffith held a doorstop. The purpose of this doorstop was to attack the Office of National Assessments. This is what he said: ‘The Office of National Assessments has not done an assessment on Iraq for more than 12 months. It has neither initiated an assessment by itself, one has not been commissioned by the government and there is none under way.' This is taking up the point that the Leader of the Opposition made. The Labor Party makes a series of assertions, hopes that the press gallery will run them, and then the truth is examined. What is the truth here? Since action was taken to get rid of Saddam Hussein's regime, the Office of National Assessments has produced 164 reports on Iraq. In the past 12 months the Office of National Assessments has produced 29 reports on Iraq, including four strategic assessments. So the claim made by the member for Griffith was false. This is part of the bewildering story from Labor on the whole issue of Iraq. Yesterday we heard the Leader of the Opposition-talking of the phrase ‘inconvenient truth'-say that Australian troops would not be taken out of Iraq until it was convenient for our allies. He said that he did not want to Iraq inconvenience our allies. After question time he said that he did not really mean that. He held a doorstop. During the doorstop he was asked the very question you would expect: what would be the timeline, do you think, for the withdrawal of the troops? He said: Very shortly. You take a look at what Howard did with our forces who were engaged actively in In active combat in Afghanistan. He took them out in about a month or two. We wouldn't require that. Three minutes passed-there were three more questions; it probably took him a bit longer than a minute to answer each question, I would imagine-and a journalist said to him: And you'd do thatthat is, withdraw the troopsin less than a month, Mr Beazley? That was what he had just said. His reply was: You don't put timetables on those things ... This was three minutes later; three minutes later the policy changed again. So the journalist said: You said less than a month or two, didn't you?  to relevance. I am not sure what Mr Beazley says has to do with assessments by ONA. That is what my question was.",95
129,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister was asked a serious question and, as I hear his answer, he is in order.",96
130,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It has everything to do with the question. So there was a situation where the Leader of the Opposition was asked: And you'd do thatthat is, withdraw the troopsin less than a month, Mr Beazley? Three minutes later and he says: You don't put timetables on those things ... The journalist went on to say: You said less than a month or two, didn't you? It is incredulous. The Leader of the Opposition said: ... It's strange that you'd want to nit-pick through this, quite frankly. That says it all. The Leader of the OppositionMr Edwards-What about the ONA?",96
131,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Cowan is warned!,96
132,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition hopes that he can send out some vibes on this issue without ever having to commit himself to any details or any facts. ‘I do not want to inconvenience the Americans or the British; I do want to convenience the Left of the Labor Party.' ‘We will withdraw immediately.' ‘We'll do it in less than two months, but I am not going to set a timeline.' If you want to be the Prime Minister of this country, you have to know what you are talking about. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition is a man of many words but a man of weak conviction. Horticulture Code of Conduct",96
133,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Given that the government will deliver only part of its promised mandatory horticulture code of conduct by exempting retailers, the major supermarket chains, food processors and exporters from compliance, how can the code protect growers? Will they or consumers be expected to bear the cost of this inadequate code? What is the expected cost?",96
134,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The government will enact its election commitment with regard to the mandatory code of conduct, which was for suppliers to wholesalers. Mr Gavan O'Connor interjecting",96
135,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I call to order the member for Corio.,96
136,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The code of conduct is to institute transparency of actions, and the terms of trade will be defined so that every supplier knows exactly how their produce is being treated by wholesalers. Consequently you will know the delivery time and the price paid, and the relationship will be set in stone; whereas when a supplier is selling to a retailer or supermarket those terms of trade are necessarily known-you obviously know all the aspects that will now be incorporated in the code of conduct. To force a code of conduct, beyond the retail code of conduct, on the retailing sector would force up costs-which would be borne by suppliers. Let me make this perfectly clear: the mandatory code of conduct will set the terms of trade which are already part of a contract between a supplier and a retail outlet. Violence Against Women",96
137,Mrs MIRABELLA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women's Issues. How is the government preventing violence against women? Is the minister aware of media reports of further claims that women are provoking sexual assaults? What is the government's response?",97
138,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Indi for her question and I acknowledge her deep concern about this issue. Members of this House will be alarmed to learn that in the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics Personal safety survey it was reported that in the year 2005 alone over 440,000 Australian women reported experiencing violence. The Howard government is committed to the prevention and elimination of violence against women wherever it occurs and in whatever community it occurs. As part of that commitment we have invested over $75 million in the Women's Safety Agenda, which seeks to prevent violence, whether sexual assault or domestic violence, through a range of projects, initiatives, research and education and by providing support to women who are the subject of violence. Part of that funding is directed towards a community awareness campaign entitled ‘Violence against women: Australia says no'. This contains a hard-hitting and clear message that sexual assault is a crime and that violence against women should never be tolerated. The House will be aware of and should be appalled by recent comments attributed to community leaders, including a senior Muslim cleric in Western Australia, to the effect that sexual assaults only occur when men are provoked. Sexual assault is a crime. Rape is a crime. It has nothing to do with how a woman dresses or whether she is unaccompanied outside the home; it is all about power over another person. The Howard government condemns violence against women, we condemn the incitement of such violence and we condemn any excuses for it. Iraq",97
139,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

141,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Is the minister aware of any allegations of corrupted tender processes in public works in Victoria? What is the government's response to these serious allegations, and what do they reveal about the role of industrial intimidation in the building and construction industry?",97
142,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Casey for his question. Indeed I am aware of allegations because today the Melbourne Age newspaper, on its front page, under the headline ‘Minister “caved into unions”', revealed that a senior Victorian Labor minister, John Lenders, caved into pressure from the CFMEU to not award a contract to a Victorian company because that company had given evidence to the Cole royal commission into the building and construction inquiry. This story as revealed by the Age newspaper is a very serious allegation against a ior Victorian Labor minister in the Bracks government, because it goes on to allege that the minister was involved in a conspiracy to pay a bribe in a public works tendering process. This relates to an $8 million public works contract in Victoria in which the company, Able Demolitions, was removed from the tender short list for the demolition of the Morwell Gasworks. The allegation has foundation because the Bracks government has previously admitted to breaking the law by removing the contractor from the short list. But, having admitted that, they then fought for a court case all the way to the full court of the Federal Court of Australia to seek to prevent the revelation or the disclosure and the production of the documents in the case. Of course, these documents go to why this contractor was excluded. The documents that have been obtained by the Age newspaper, under a freedom of information request, show that Mr Lenders removed the contract from the tender list because of pressure from the CFMEU. Why did it do this? This occurred because this contractor had the temerity to provide evidence to the Cole royal commission about activities of the CFMEU on building sites in Victoria. This supports other evidence which was also provided to the royal commission about the influence of the CFMEU on the Victorian government. Let us make no mistake about this: this was payback. This was payback by a Labor government on behalf of the Victorian CFMEU, and the point here is: if a union such as the CFMEU can exert this influence on a senior Labor state minister in the state of Victoria, then imagine what influence they would exert on the Leader of the Opposition if he were ever in such a position. Why do I say that? Because the Leader of the Opposition has already caved in. He has already sencaved into this influence from the CFMEU, because they have demanded, and he has announced, that he would abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission-the very body which has been established to look into cases of thuggery and intimidationMr MCGauran-Bribery.",97
143,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and, as it looks like now, bribery, which has been underway within the building and construction industry-a very vital sector of the economy in Australia. What this reflects is why this Cole commission was put in place. It reflects the need for legislation such as that which has established the Building and Construction Commission, but what it also reflects is the weakness of Labor governments at a state level and the weakness at a federal level in terms of the Leader of the Opposition, who is prepared to cave into union demands and to in fact allow to remain in place this sort of intimidation and thuggery and, indeed, possibly bribery as well. What it shows once again is the essential weakness of the Leader of the Opposition when it comes to these matters, his inability to actually stand up for what is right and what is proper-his weakness in every case that he simply bows to the bosses and the thugs of the union movement. Iraq",98
144,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question again is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to his answer to my last question, when he referred me to answers delivered by his officials to Senate estimates. Will the minister confirm that in fact his officials have been gagged in Senate estimates when asked questions on this matter? Will he confirm that the reason which officials gave for not answering questions on this matter was that these matters were being handled by the Cole inquiry? Minister, why have you once again failed to tell this parliament the truth when you know that the Cole inquiry has no powers to investigate companies which are not mentioned in the Volcker inquiry?",98
145,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Griffith will rephrase that question.,99

149,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First of all, the honourable member asked me about the truth and I think I demonstrated in answer to my question about the ONA that the member for Griffith had indeed not been telling the truth about the ONA.

169,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question and note his interest in jobs. In addition to the $3.6 billion Welfare to Work program, which is going very well, Centrelink has been holding a series of job expos in remote parts of Australia and held one in Mount Isa last week. At that job expo, more than 500 people made their way through over 35 stalls and there were more than 250 jobs advertised. The government believes in matching potential workers with real jobs. The two questions that are being asked by potential workers are these: firstly, ‘Are my wages going to be good?' Under the Howard government, real wages have increased by more than 16 per cent over the last 10 years. That is a great outcome for Australia's workers. The second question they ask is: ‘What about my job security?' Ms Bird interjecting",100

171,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In relation to job security, it is a fundamental point that no government can guarantee a job, no trade union can guarantee a job-only economic prosperity can guarantee jobs. That economic prosperity comes about through hard reform-such as reforms of the taxation system, changes in government fiscal policies and the introduction of Work Choices. Work Choices has delivered higher wages. It has delivered more than 205,000 jobs, and it has delivered the lowest level of industrial disputation since 1913. I met a guy who runs a sugar mill in south Cairns who said that he had put an employee who cuts the grass on an AWA because the fellow had said, ‘My wife works in hospitality two days a week and starts work at 6 am, so can I start work at 6 am?' The boss said, ‘I would love to give you that flexibility.' That worker who cuts the grass at the sugar mill said amen to AWAs. Then I went to Townsville, to the member for Herbert's electorate.

179,The SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,The Prime Minister may proceed.,101
180,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"I was asked a question by the member for MCMillan regarding investments in clean coal technology and I mistakenly said that the Commonwealth contribution to the Callide power station was $187 million. That is the value of the project. The Commonwealth contribution, out of the $500 million low-emission technology fund we announced a couple of years ago, was $50 million. I also may have mistakenly said that real wages were rising at 16.4 per cent a year. I know it is good, but it is not that good. It is 16.4 per cent over the 10½ years we have been in government. NA Department of Parliamentary Services: Annual Report",101
181,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Yesterday the member for Grayndler asked me about the annual report of the Department of Parliamentary Services, which reports three of its targetsenergy consumption, water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions-were not met in 2005-06. These targets were set internally by the DPS, with the clear aim of improving its environmental performance. When the targets were set it was recognised that it would be a challenge to meet them in the first year because they require a range of innovative approaches to the department's operations. and The annual report provides clear explanations for the increases in water and energy use and greenhouse gas emissions for 200506 and I will refer to them in turn. With respect to increased energy use, in 2005-06 parliament met on 17 more days than in the previous year, which was an election year. As well, in 2005-06 there was an increase in the responsibility of DPS to cover street lighting on Parliament Drive and, as members may recall, it was the coldest autumn in Canberra since 1967. Even so, during 2005-06, the total energy used in Parliament House was the second lowest since the building opened in 1988. The increased greenhouse gas emissions are directly related to the increased energy use. The increased water consumption can be attributed to major landscape redevelopment after completion of the security enhancement project, the need to replace turf and plants lost during the drought and an unusually dry summer. Evaporation loss in the ACT for the period from 1 December 2005 was 1,082 millimetres compared to the long-term average of 793 millimetres. Throughout the drought, at the President's and my direction, Parliament House has met the water savings targets of the ACT government. Currently, DPS planners are working on a new water strategy, and a new energy strategy will also be developed this year. DPS has recently signed a new electricity contract under which the department's purchase of ‘green' energy will rise from 10 per cent to 25 per cent of the total energy purchased. Since this building opened in 1988, electricity consumption has been reduced by 36 per cent, gas consumption has been reduced by 71 per cent, carbon dioxide emissions have been reduced by 45 per cent, and total energy consumption has been reduced by 55 per cent. Incidentally, around 63 per cent of the paper used in Parliament House is now recycled. Parliament House has, in fact, won major awards-including from the Greenhouse Office and the Institution of Engineers Australia, which recognise energy and greenhouse emission reductions. Finally, as building occupants, I encourage all members to play their part to save energy and water whilst working in this House. It is, of course, a responsibility for of us. NA",101

It is an extraordinary statement. I have been defending the importance of clean coal technology as being at the heart of our greenhouse response for a very long time.

The first part of the water strategy is working-it is raining today. Congratulations on that. My question is with regard to the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure into question time. This is an initiative which I welcome as it is responding, as you know, to a great public interest on that matter and there have been representations to a lot of and members-and I am sure to you as well as to all of us-about that.

This is advice I have received from my office and it has come from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. The Tristar employees are employed under a pre-Work Choices union negotiated collective agreement. Under those rules, if the company had sought to terminate the agreement, it would need to be terminated under the rules applied in the pre-Work Choices legislation, and that is a decision of the Australian Industrial lations Commission. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission will agree to the termination only if it is in the public interest to do so under the old rules. I might also add that it should be remembered that that company is in financial difficulties because of the behaviour during the 2000-03 industrial campaigns of the relevant union. In other words, this really does not have any thing to do with Work Choices. NA",103

206,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! The member for Griffith would recall that the foreign minister was asked to withdraw that statement.,103
207,Mr RUDD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"This is a previous statement of the foreign minister's; there are many to pick from with the foreign minister. The statement in question by the foreign minister was that he said I had been untruthful when I said that the Office of National Assessments the had not done an assessment on Iraq within the last 12 months. The following brief exchange occurred in Senate estimates on Monday of this week when the Office of National Assessments appeared before a Senate estimates committee. The questions to the director of the ONA were: Senator CHRIS EVANS-When was the last time you did one on Iraq? Mr Varghese-Probably a year ago. ReSenator CHRIS EVANS-Around October 2005? Mr Varghese-I would have to check. Senator CHRIS EVANS-Roughly a year agois that right? Mr Varghese-In the last quarter of last year. That, I think establishes the case. On the second issue of a misrepresentation today, the foreign minister said that my question concerning the six Australian companies now being investigated by the AFP over possible breaches of Australia's sanctions obligations to Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq potentially compromised the AFP investigation. The question I asked the foreign minister dealt with whether or not the minister or his department had approved any such contract. The question did not ask any matter of detail concerning the activities of these corporations. In fact, the minister is seeking to hide behind the AFP in order to avoid parliamentary accountability.",103

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",104
215,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have just witnessed one of the most addled and bombastic question times I have seen in a very long time from this government. It was an extraordinary set of performances from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, marked by complacency, hubris, pathological hatred of the opposition, dishonesty and deceit, massive defensiveness and a sense of entitlement across the front-bench that only they are possible, only they should be and that they need to answer for nothing. In the course of it, as usual with this Prime Minister and his ministers, they erected a series of straw men, knocked them down and believed they had mounted a defence of their position. One of their favourite straw men was to suggest that when we debated the industrial relations legislation of last year, Labor Party speakers-me, in particular-got up and talked about the sky falling in, mass sackings and horrible things happening immediately. I remember very well the analogy I used for the operation of this act at that time, because it is the analogy I have used ever since-that is, the operation of this act in the industrial relations conditions of ordinary Australians would be like an infestation of termites, slowly crumbling away, and that has precisely been the experience. Because this government is so deeply dishonest and so appallingly defensive, it is gradually shutting down points of criticism and analysis where embarrassment is likely to occur. We saw another example of it here today. We saw the Prime Minister mocking the member for Perth when the member for Perth stood up and gave a set of statistics from the OEA on their initial survey, last May, of the first set of AWAs under the new regime applying to AWAs, and the impact that those had on the rights and the awards of ordinary Australian workers. I am going to go through those statistics because this is now a very historical and important document. This is the last time we will see the truth. It is the last time the Australian people will have an understanding of this-at least for 12 months. When we get into office of course we will reveal all. The OEA discovered then, from their sampling of the AWAs to that point, these things: 100 per cent of them excluded at least one protected award condition; 64 per cent of them removed leave loadings; 63 per cent removed penalty rates; 52 per cent removed shift work loadings; 41 did not contain gazetted public holidays; 31 per cent modified overtime loadings; 29 per cent modified rest breaks; 27 per cent modified public holiday payments; 22 per cent did not provide for a pay increase over the life of the agreement; and 16 per cent excluded all award conditions and replaced them with the government's legislated minimum standards. That was the last time the Australian people had a window on the truth, because those AWAs, as we know, once signed by the businessman concerned and the person who receives them, become secret documents, not to be penetrated by anyone else on pain of a massive penalty and an offence. We saw then, for the last time, the truth of what the government's legislation was producing for ordinary Australians. When we went back at Senate estimates to see these figures updated-and remember there are many thousands of AWAs which have come into place since then-we found that these figures are no longer being collected. This is pure eastern European circa 1950s Stalinism-pure Stalinism; that's all there is to it-in which information is simply shut down because the truth is inconvenient. The truth goes to the heart of the malevolence of this minister-inoffensive though he is, largely, as a human being-and the Prime Minister, deeply offensive though he is, when he was still of a mind to do things in other than a totally addled way. We now have a circumstance where the government cannot be trusted with the basic living conditions of ordinary Australian families, and that is the subject of our MPI today. This government has massively breached trust. This government has turned against Middle Australia. On the industrial relations front, the government said nothing in the last election campaign about what it intended to do, but it has introduced a system that will enable it to slash wages, smash awards, scrap penalty rates, scrap overtime, scrap shift allowances and scrap redundancy pay. This minister has put in place an infestahaving tion-a cancer-in the industrial relations system, which will fatally undermine, over time, the conditions of ordinary Australian workers and therefore of ordinary Australian families, none of it announced during the last election campaign. That, of course, is not the only piece of deceit that we are dealing with in this MPI. The second piece of deceit-which also goes to the heart of the living conditions of Middle Australian families and the effectiveness of their pay packets in supporting their aspirations in life-is that statement made by our political opponents that they would keep interest rates at historical lows. There have been three interest rate increases since then. The problem with this government is that it simply does not comprehend the new interest rate reality. It simply does not understand that there is no such thing as a small mortgage anymore, so there is no such thing as a small interest rate rise. It needs to be understood, absolutely, that families of Middle Australia are paying more for their mortgages under John Howard than they ever were under any of his predecessors, and that includes Paul Keating. They are paying more for their mortgages. The Prime Minister gets up here in this chamber and he thinks he has a defence in talking about 17 per cent versus eight per cent or whatever. The simple fact of the matter is this: the interest rates now being paid by Australians take a higher percentage of their income than was ever the case while Paul Keating was in office. The Prime Minister conveniently forgets one other piece of history, and that is that when he was last Treasurer interest rates rose to 22 per cent and had to be dealt with, in that particular instance, by small business. The simple fact of the matter is that, as a result of these interest rate rises, families are to close down their activities very quickly indeed. Interest rate rises will affect the family holiday at the beach. They will affect the kids' sport. For those who are heavily mortgaged-and many have been encouraged to be heavily mortgaged by this government-this is going to be a lean Christmas. The member for Wentworth has suggested what I have just had to say is overdramatisation. The members for Hughes and Herbert say the rise is unimportant to their constituents. We all know that the Treasurer has said that he will not be concerned because he thinks that any rate below 10 per cent is low. Young families in our capital cities find themselves these days burdened with payments on mortgages of upwards of $300,000 and they find also that household debt has ballooned to 150 per cent of household disposable income. What we are watching here is a picture of aspirational Australia trying get on top of what they need to do now to pay for the school fees, trying to get on top of what they need to do now to pay for childcare fees, trying to get on top of what they need to do now to pay for health benefits and trying to get their families into a situation where they can have a decent roof over their heads that gives their family a capacity to grow. The consequence of all of that is that they have borrowed to the eyeballs, and many of them may have made that calculation over the last five years. Many of them have made that calculation on the basis of what they have heard from the propaganda of the Liberal Party and the Prime Minister when they have said things like, ‘We will keep interest rates at historical lows,' when they have said things like, ‘Keep re-electing us and you'll be able to do these things,' or when they have listened to the Liberal Party propagandists urging them to take up things like private health insurance and the opportunity to send their kids to private schools. When they have listened to the Liberals and to John Howard, they have listened with belief. They have believed that John Howard would never turn against them, that John Howard had their interests in mind, and now they have discovered the ideological John Howard. Now they have discovered the Howard of the big end of town. Now they have discovered, after 10 years in office and a tonne of hubris on the part of this Prime Minister, what he really means to them, and what he really means to them is growing hardship. The Prime Minister compounded all of this a week ago when he went into the radio station to send the clearest possible signal to the Reserve Bank. The Prime Minister does not do anything without calculation. He particularly does not go on at great length in an to interview about interest rates unless he means a message to get out. What the Prime Minister said to the Reserve Bank was this: ‘Raise the rates. A stitch in time saves nine. Raise the rates. You have the Prime Minister's clearance. Get out there and do it. We want the rate raised before Christmas'-in the hope, of course, that a rate rise will not be necessary next year. What was he worried about here? What he was worried about here was simply this. Ms George-Survival.",105
216,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He is about political survival. He is about-hopefully, from his point of view-creating a set of conditions where Australians will not be reminded again of his broken promise next year, short of the election. The only people who do not matter in this are the Australian people. The only people who do not matter in this are the people paying the mortgages. Did we see the Prime Minister stand up and say, ‘We have the second highest interest rates in the industrialised world, Reserve Bank-don't act any further'? Did we hear the Prime Minister stand up and say, as the Treasurer has been saying, ‘We're going backwards in growth terms'? He says that is because of the drought, but he also now appears to think it is because Australians are saving more. Did we hear any of that constraint from the Prime Minister? No, no. We heard the Prime Minister's pure political calculation: ‘Raise them now, fellas. Raise them now. Get this monkey off my back before Christmas. Do it under the cover of the Melbourne Cup but get on with it.' ‘Slug them,' is what the Prime Minister said to the Reserve Bank. So we have this one-two punch now in operation-a whack from the Prime Minister with a clear signal to the Reserve Bank: ‘Don't worry about my promises and undertakings on historical lows. Rack them up and make sure things are okay politically next year. And then there is the second punch, which we'll also conceal.' This will be a rabbit-killer from behind, and that is what happens with the industrial relations laws. If this government were honestly proud of what it was doing in the industrial relations laws, if it believed that these AWAs were about bringing conditions up as opposed to putting them down, it would be proud of the statistics that it could produce. There is only one reason to conceal these AWAs, and it is not the truth. The reason to conceal these AWAs is to protect the political position of the government. We are going to fight this government right the way down to the line to the next election. The Australian people understand this is no longer the government of Middle Australia; this is a government of deceit and for the big end of town. It is the Labor Party now that stands for Middle Australia, the Labor Party with their future our concern. (Time expired)",107
217,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (3.43 pm)-When I hear the Leader of the Opposition I am reminded of that television show The Weakest Link, because the reality is that that is what we have in the Leader of the Opposition. It is interestwe ing this afternoon that he comes in here and wants to pretend that things which he said in the past year about industrial relations changes he did not say. He said today at the outset of his speech: ‘I didn't say that the would fall in. I didn't say there would be mass sackings.' Ms Annette Ellis-He didn't.",108
218,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let me take you to a few quotes. I am interested that the member opposite says he did not say that. Let's actually see what the Leader of the Opposition did say. In relation to productivity growth: … there is no productivity agenda here. National Press Club, 1 February this year. Or: This will hurt the economy. Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, on ABC's PM program just on 10 October last year. On industrial disputation he said in a speech to the Tasmanian ALP state conference on 6 August 2005: These extreme changes risk dragging us back into an era of heightened industrial conflict. Let's turn to wages growth. Again, let me quote what the Leader of the Opposition said. This was at a press conference on 10 October 2005: This is about slashing wages; make absolutely no doubt about that. On 28 March of this year, the member for Perth-I will come to him in a momentsaid that the minimum wage would go down. On the issue of jobs, we have the Leader of the Opposition reported on the AAP news wire service on 23 October 2005 as saying that these changes would not lead to the employment of more Australians, yet he comes in here today and says, ‘I didn't say that the sky would fall in. I didn't say that there would be mass sackings.' The reality is that when you go back through the record-and keep records about the Leader of the Opposition-to what he has said in the past, what he said to the Australian people and to the workers of this country and their families was that these changes would lead, in effect, sky to the sky falling in so far as their economic future was concerned. He even says today, ‘What I was saying was that this would lead to a slow crumbling away of your conditions.' Let us even accept that for a moment and take the charges as they were made against Work Choices by the opposition. The first charge was in relation to jobs. As I said, the Leader of the Opposition was quoted as saying that these changes would not lead to the employment of more Australians. Let me take a few other statements that were made by representatives of the labour movement in Australia. Mr Greg Combet, the secretary of the ACTU, said on the John Laws show on 2UE radio on 27 March of this year: Laws: You don't agree that these changes would provide any sort of job growth? Combet: Oh I can't see it. What about Bill Shorten, famously quotedperhaps infamously, some would think now-in Workplace Express on 26 May 2005: Make no mistake: today is green light for mass sackings. Here is Mr Shorten, a celebrated union official in Australia, saying that the Work Choices package would be a green light for mass sackings in Australia. What has happened? Again we hear the Leader of the Opposition saying that this is a major insult to Middle Australia. That is what he said today. Let us have a look at Middle Australia in terms of jobs growth since Work Choices came into operation on 27 March: 205,000 jobs have been created in Australia in the months of April through to September of this year. Let me put this in historic context: the average jobs growth in Australia for the months of April through to September for the past 20 years has been about 75,000 jobs. At a time when Mr Beazley and the union movement were saying that this would lead to a reduction in jobs in Australia, we have seen almost three times the average number of jobs created in Australia in the last six months. We see that reflected in the unemployment rates. We have a 30-year low unemployment rate in Australia of 4.9 per cent, having falling to 4.8 per cent, and the highest participation rate-that is, the highest number of Australians confident to go out there and seek a job-that we have had in Australian history. The first charge that the Leader of the Opposition made against Work Choices was that it would slash jobs-even though he wants to run away from it today because the inconvenient truth is that this has led to greater economic conditions for Australians-and that has been proven to be totally and absolutely wrong. Let me go to the second core criticism that was made of Work Choices: it would slash wages. The Leader of the Opposition said at his press conference on 10 October of last year: This is about slashing wages; make absolutely no doubt about that. Surely that was saying that the sky was going to fall in for workers in Australia. I remind the member for Perth, who is no doubt following me in this debate, of what his media release from March of this year said: ... the Minimum Wage will not rise in real terms under the Australian Fair Pay Commission. What have we seen? Let us look at the empirical data-not the claims that I am making, not the claims that the opposition is making-about what has happened since Work Choices came into operation. The Australian Bureau of Statistics labour price index shows that total rates of pay, excluding bonuses, increased by 1.1 per cent in the June quarter of 2006 and by 4.1 per cent over the year to the June quarter. Here we have the ABS data-the official collection of data in this country-showing that wages, on an annualised basis, are increasing by 4.1 per cent. If you look at the data relating to collective agreements in Australia, what it shows is that collective agreements have wage increases built into them, usually in the area of four to 4½ per cent. It is hardly a slashing or dragging down of wages in Australia. As the Prime Minister pointed out in question time today, real wages for Australians over the past 10 years have increased by 16.4 per cent. Let us compare that to the previous 13 years of Labor government, including the time when the Leader of the Opposition was last coresponsible for the economy of Australia as the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. What happened to real wages when Mr Beazley was last in charge of the economy in Australia? Real wages went backwards over 13 years by 0.2 per cent. In 13 years of Labor government, real wages go down. In 10 years of a coalition government, real wages have gone up by 16.4 per cent. I ask Middle Australia: which outcome would you prefer? The Leader of the Opposition says today that this is some assault on Middle Australia. The reality is that this has to the advantage of Australians. On top of that, we had the recent decision of the Australian Fair Pay Commission. Had you stopped to listen-if you were not one of those Australians that had given up listening to what the member for Perth and the Leader of the Opposition have been saying about these things because they have been caught out so many times misleading in their comments about industrial relationsover the last few weeks and months to the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party, their clear and simple message about the Australian Fair Pay Commission was that it would drive down wages in Australia. What did we have last week? The Australian Fair Pay Commission came out and awarded a $27.36 increaseMr Baldwin-How much?",108
219,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"a $27.36 increase in wages not just for those on the federal minimum wage but also for those earning up to $700 a week. In other words, about one million of the lowest paid award-reliant Australians are getting a $27.36 increase in their wages as a result of the Fair Pay Commission, and for about another 250,000 Australians who are award-reliant and earning more than $700 a week-remembering that these days most people are not award-reliant; they are on agreements because they are better off-there was a $22 increase in their wages as well. Is this the driving down, the slashing or the green light for wages going backwards in Australia? Hardly. Once again, wages have been going up. So the second charge, the second core criticism that is made of Work Choices, namely that it would drive down wages for Australians, has also been proven wrong. Let us go to the third criticism that has been made over the past few months about the Work Choices legislation: that it would been lead to heightened industrial disputation in Australia. Again, let me quote, so that nobody thinks I am making this up or putting words into the mouths of those opposite in the Labor movement. The Leader of the Opposition told the ALP state conference in Tasmania: These extreme changes risk dragging us back into an era of heightened industrial conflict. Or Senator George Campbell, on AAP: ... the sort of relationship that's now been established in the workplace is going to encourage that sabotage to take place ... Let us look again at empirical data produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in relation to what has happened to industrial disputation, strikes and the like in Australia. The June quarter of 2006 revealed that there were just 3.1 working days lost per 1,000 employees, which is the lowest quarterly rate of disputes ever recorded in this country by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Let me put this in context. If you go back to when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment in Australia in the early nineties-although some of us think he was the minister for unemployment at that timethere were 104.6 working days lost per 1,000 in December 1992. We are comparing 104 working days lost per 1,000 employees with just 3.1 working days lost per 1,000 employees in the latest data from the ABS. And yet the claim was made that this would lead to greater industrial disputation and a dog-eatdog environment in Australia. The opposite has occurred as a result of the workplace changes that we have put in place, not just recently but going back to 1996 as well. So on the third criticism, that there would be greater industrial disputation-not on my say so or on my colleagues' say so but on the data produced officially for us, as it is year after year, by the Australian Bureau of Statiswas tics-the data shows that, once again, the criticisms made by the Leader of the Opposition and those around him have simply been wrong. The Leader of the Opposition has also criticised Work Choices on productivity growth. He said to the National Press Club on 1 February this year: ‘There is no productivity agenda here.' He said on PM, on ABC Radio: ‘This will hurt the economy.' Let us again look at the data. Don't believe me; look at the ABS data that has been produced. Figures released yesterday show that labour productivity grew by 2.2 per cent this financial year. So labour productivity is growing in this financial year under these changes that have been put in place. And there is other data beyond that. When you strip away all the frenzied rhetoric that comes from the Leader of the Opposition and go to the core criticisms of Work Choices, the reality is they have been proved wrong. Take retrenchments, for example. The latest data on retrenchments shows that the number of retrenchments is 58 per cent lower compared with when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment in the Hawke-Keating-Beazley Labor government back in the early 1990s. So, whether we are talking about jobs growth, wages growth, industrial disputation, productivity growth, retrenchments in the economy or the unemployment rate-six critical measures of the Australian economy-on each of these measures the claims that were made by the opposition in relation to these matters have been proved to be absolutely wrong. Yet we had the Leader of the Opposition come in here today and say that this is an assault on Middle Australia. This could only come from somebody who said in the early 1990s that he had given up on the unemployed in this country. He said words to the effect that the employment portfolio, which he then had, the one that he had the least interest in of all the portfolios that he had had. One thing that you never hear about from the opposition is job creation. You never hear about how we grow the economy in this country. It is economic growth that creates jobs in this country. It is the ability of people to get out and have a go, which is what this is all about. People want to be able to get out, have a go and be rewarded for having a go. Yet what the Labor Party would do with their radical re-regulation of the workforce in Australia would take away those incentives from ordinary Australians. Ordinary Australians know, on the basis of their experience, what has happened as a result of this government's policy. There is a great disconnect between what the Leader of the Opposition rants on about in this place each day and what ordinary Australians know. We will continue to make the changes that necessary to make the reforms, because they are about the future of this country. We are about the future of this country. We are about the national interest. Regrettably, the Labor Party is still about the vested interests of its union bosses.",110
220,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This MPI is very straightforward: it is cost of living up, take-home pay down. In question time the Prime Minister was questioned about seven consecutive interest rate increases. His response to that was to say that the economy is magnificent. The magnificent seven interest rate increases! That the Prime Minister's message to working Australian families. That is the Prime Minister's message to Middle Australia. We have inflation up, interest rates up and the grave danger that the Reserve Bank next week will increase interest rates on the eighth consecutive occasion. Why does the Reserve Bank say there is upward pressure on inflation and interest rates? Because of the government's complacency on skills and infrastructure. Its complacency on skills is putting upward pressure in the wages area where there are skills shortages and its complacency on infrastructure is causing capacity constraints. So to those Australians working hard, battling to make ends meet, trying to pay their mortgages, trying to pay the cost of putting food on the kitchen table and trying to pay for their childcare, the Prime Minister is saying: ‘Next week, Melbourne Cup day, when the Reserve Bank meets-seven magnificent interest rates increases.' When it comes to the capacity of working Australians to meet that cost and that burden, the government's approach is to say, ‘We're going to attack your take-home pay, we're going to attack your penalty rates, we're going to attack your overtime payment, we're going to attack your leave loading and we're going to attack your shift allowance.' How do we know that is the government's approach to take-home pay? Because at Senate estimates at 9.20 today we saw a red-hot scandal, a red-hot cover-up. At 9.20 today the government refused to allow the Senate, the parliament and the Australian people to have the evidence-the government's own empirical data, the government's own statistics-about the government's attack on takehome pay. This was put to the Prime Minister during question time today. The first time we put this to the Prime Minister it was put in a difis ferent context. We get used to the Prime Minister being a serial misleader when it comes to industrial relations matters. Every time something is put to the Prime Minister he will blackguard whoever puts it to him. He will do anything, say anything, cover up anything and mislead on anything to try and avoid the adverse political, social and economic consequences of his extreme and unfair industrial relations legislation. In question time the member for Capricornia put to the Prime Minister something she had innocently found on the website of Brisbane law firm Connor Hunter. It said: The Federal Government's work Choices amendments offer you the opportunity to reduce your overheads significantly. … … … Employers can remove award conditions ... without compensating the employee at all. This affords employers the opportunity to reduce weekly pay through making cuts to penalty rates, overtime rates, leave loading, shift allowances and other forms of remunerating employees. The member for Capricornia simply asked the Prime Minister, ‘They're right, aren't they?' He would not answer the question and he went on like a blackguard. Why would he not answer the question? Because on 29 May the Office of the Employment Advocate provided to Senate estimates all the evidence, the empirical data, about how AWAs were impacting on the so-called protected conditions. Courtesy of Connor Hunter, other firms and our own analysis, we know that there is no protection. These conditions can be wiped out, for no compensation, at the stroke of a pen. In Senate estimates in May were we told that, between 27 March and 29 May-a period of a couple of months-100 per cent of AWAs excluded at least one of the protected award conditions of leave loadings, penalty rates and shiftwork allowances. We heard that 64 per cent removed leave loadings, 63 per cent removed penalty rates, 52 per cent remove shiftwork loadings, 41 per cent did not contain gazetted public holidays and 16 per cent excluded all of the protected award conditions. No wonder the government did not want the up-to-date information out. The OEA could give it out on 29 May, but they cannot give it out today. Why is that? Because the government knows that the adverse implications which will flow from that empirical data being released will again throw a spotlight on their attack on the take-home pay of working Australians and their capacity to make ends meet through their penalty rates, their overtime, their leave loadings and their shift allowances. The minister, in his contribution, said: ‘We keep records. The government keeps records. We keep a record of everything that the Leader of the Opposition says and we make it public.' They also keep a record of what AWAs do, but they refuse to make it public. They engage in red-hot cover-ups-a scandal of the highest order. Ms Plibersek-Where is the data?",111
221,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Sydney has been warned!,113
222,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The minister also said it is important to look at the empirisaying cal data. You have the empirical data, you just refuse to release it at Senate estimates. Mr Albanese interjecting",113
223,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I would have thought the member for Grayndler might have learnt something yesterday.,113
224,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You have the empirical data but you refuse to release it because you know that it shows an attack upon the take-home pay of working Australians. In his contribution, the minister also referred to the minimum wage. When the Fair Pay Commission last week awarded $27 to Australia's lowest paid employees, no-one was more surprised than John Howard and Kevin Andrews. No-one was more surprised than the government. And do you know why? Because if the government's submissions to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission had been agreed to, on Thursday the minimum wage would have been $50 a week, or $2,600 a year, lower. If ACCI's submissions-and I very much enjoyed their dinner last night-had been agreed to by the Industrial Relations Commission, the minimum wage would have been $95 a week, or $4,490 a year, lower. Over the last decade, the government has continually been making submissions that seek to reduce the minimum wage. In its formal submission to the Fair Pay Commission less than three months ago, the government said: For example, a 10 cents per hour increase in all minimum rates is estimated to reduce employment by 0.33 per cent or 32,800 jobs. In other words, the government's submission to the Fair Pay Commission was that, if you increase the minimum wage by $27, as the Fair Pay Commission did, you will increase unemployment by 236,000 jobs-because for decades the Prime Minister, the Liberal Party and the Howard government have been to the Industrial Relations Commission that if you increase the minimum wage you will automatically increase unemployment. No wonder we saw such an adverse reaction from the ACCI, which has also held that view. The government's response to the Fair Pay Commission decision was massively hypocritical. For a decade the government has been saying to the Industrial Relations Commission, ‘Reduce the minimum wage.' If the government's submissions had been agreed to, the minimum wage would be $2,600 a year lower. And do not let anyone be fooled as to the magnitude of this increase. The government uses the headline figure, but, over a 12-month period, in September 2006 dollars this is actually a 0.7 per cent increase in real terms in the minimum wage. It is less than that if you take the startPerth up point as being 1 December-which it is. In real terms it is half the average increase in the minimum wage over the last five years and the equal second lowest increase in a decade. That is the real increase in the minimum wage over the last 11 years. The increase we saw last week-0.7 per cent in real terms-was the equal second lowest in a decade and the lowest in five years. This government is engaged in an attack upon the take-home pay of working Australians that is primarily focused on penalty rates, leave loadings and shift allowancesall the take-home pay components that working Australian families have relied upon for so long to make ends meet. The government, having been sprung on that when it released the empirical data in May, is now engaged in a red-hot scandal and cover-up today. The Prime Minister is a serial misleader when it comes to industrial relations matters. He told the Australian public, at the Liberal Party's launch of its industrial relations policy in 2004 at the last election, that he would make no changes to these so-called ‘allowable matters'-no changes to the things that he now refuses to release information about. Do you know why? Because he has got his magnificent seven interest rate increases, with penalty rates, leave loadings, shift allowances, take-home pay components and public holiday penalty rates all down. That is the Howard government's and the Liberal Party's formula for working Australians: cost of living up, take-home pay down-and they will cover up anything to avoid that conclusion being drawn. They will do anything, say anything, mislead on anything and cover up anything to avoid that conclusion being drawn, but that conclusion will be made by the Australian public at the next election. (Time expired)",113
225,Mr BARRESI,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Leader of the Opposition and the member for and all their fellow travellers on the other side of the chamber are again engaging in the absurdity and farce that they are fast becoming famous for: making wild claims and broad generalisations. But as always there is nothing of substance. The inconvenient truth for the Leader of the Opposition is the fact that real wage increases have taken place since this government came into power 10 years ago and since the start of Work Choices on 27 March this year. The inconvenient truth is the 205,000 jobs that have been created since March. For the same comparable period for the last 20 years an average of 79,000 jobs have been created. So we have seen a real increase in jobs: 205,000, compared to an average of 79,000 over the same period of time for the last 20 years, and 184,000 of these have been full time jobs. The inconvenient truth is that the participation rate in this country is 64 per cent. There are more people in jobs and there are more jobs available for people who are seeking work. The inconvenient truth for the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Perth is that unemployment is at a record low and industrial disputation is low. The inconvenient truth for the member for Perth and the Leader of the Opposition is that we have seen the Fair Pay Commission, the very commission that they derided and want to abolish, come down last week with a wage increase of $27 per week. How can this possibly be construed as an attack on wages and conditions? It shows how out of touch the ALP is with working Australians. In a moment I will contrast the record of the government with that of the member for Brand, but firstly there are a few things that need be said. This opposition has now started a new fear campaign. The Leader of the Opposition, in his contribution to this MPI debate, started a new fear campaign. Not content with saying that there is going to be mass unrest and disputation, not content with saying that this is going to be a race to the tom in terms of wages and not content with saying that marriages are going to break up because of Work Choices, he is now saying that people's summer holidays are going to be affected; people will not be able to go on their summer holiday. I tell you what: if the Leader of the Opposition's claim has any validity, when I drive down to the Mornington Peninsula this summer, in January, with my children, I will expect to see the beaches vacant. I will expect to see a mass of beaches available to me to enjoy my time with my children. Of course that will not happen, because once again the Leader of the Opposition is going into a fear campaign. He says that people will not be able to ford their mortgages because of interest rate hikes and because of the attack by this government. Mr Deputy Speaker, I will tell you what the people of Australia can afford: they can afford to take out a mortgage and pay it off. Why can they do that? Because there are 1.9 times as many Australians in jobs under this government than under the previous government. We have seen more jobs created. People are able to have a job, go to the bank and take out a loan if that is what they desire. In fact, on our visit to Queensland last week, the Hon. Joe Hockey, the Minister Assisting the Minister for Workplace Relations, and I went to a business that negotiated AWAs and collective agreements, a combination of the two, and we actually had the bluecollar employees-diesel mechanics, fitters to and tradies-say to us, ‘We have all moved from casual to full time without losing any of our conditions. What this means is we can now go to the bank and ask for a loan.' These are real Australians who have had their conditions improved because of changes in the industrial relations setting that have enabled them to negotiate better conditions and move botfrom casual to full time. What we have also seen on some our these visits is that the workers, despite a union campaign in some of the workplaces, have refused to join a union. We had one classic case where not one single member of an organisation had decided to take up union membership, despite the fact that a union was picketing that employer's premises, trying to fight a case. It failed of course. So we have a new fear campaign. We can add that to the absurdity of what the Leader of the Opposition is on about. The Leader of the Opposition has in fact breached the trust of the Australian public. He says the Prime Minister has breached its trust. Mr Deputy af- Speaker, let me tell you this: the Leader of the Opposition has done that. He has failed to engage with the Australian public in an honest and open way. The Leader of the Opposition is not able to make one industrial relations policy announcement without running it past the unions-past the ACTU, which determines what is to be the case. He has said he is going to rip up AWAs. These have delivered real improvements in wages and conditions to a lot of the workers that we have met on our travels. He has failed to enunciate industrial relations policy without the consent of the ACTU. In fact, I note that the word ‘accord' is starting to creep into some newspaper reports. And we all know what took place during the Hawke-Keating era and we all know about the high level of interest rates-17 per cent-and also about the unemployment level of 12 per cent. He has failed to acknowledge the real benefits that have flowed to a lot of low-income earners in Australia through the Fair Pay Commission's decision last week. He has also decided he is going to reintroduce good faith bargaining. Good faith bargaining is a nice term. It has a nice, flowery little image that this is all going to be hunkywant dory and we are all going to get on well with each other. What good faith bargaining means is that the unions will have access to your workplace whether one of your employees is a member of the union or all of them are. It means access by the union to the workplace and it means access to the financial records of the organisation. Eventually this so-called good faith bargaining and access to all negotiations that take place will flow through to what is called ‘pattern bargaining'. That means that an employer's individual circumstances and situation will no longer be taken into account because they will be roped in like everybody else. They will be roped into providing the conditions and wages of every other company in the same industry, regardless of the circumstances at that particular locationregardless of whether it is a location that quires seasonal work and regardless of other circumstances which differentiate it from other organisations. The Leader of the Opposition has also failed to acknowledge the role that the Office of Workplace Services has provided and the protection that it has given to a lot of Australian workers. Since 1997 the OWS has won back over $43 million in unpaid wages for all Australians. Since 27 March this year it has recovered over $5 million for over 3,000 Australian workers. Where it is required, 193 inspectors and officials across 26 locations are out there fighting for these conditions on behalf of employees, and they are also able to initiate prosecutions. The ALP want to abolish this. Why do they want to do that? Do they want to abolish it because the OWS is not doing its job? Are they going to abolish it because it is not recovering unpaid wages? Are they going to abolish it because it is not initiating prosecutions if employment laws are broken? No, they do not want to abolish it for any of those reasons; they to abolish it because they realise the OWS has filled the gap which the unions believe they should be occupying. This campaign is all about the union movement's survival. If members on the other side believe that I am making that up, I only have to recall a conversation last week with an ACTU official who said, ‘We are fighting for our survival.' He did not say, ‘We are fighting for workers,' or, ‘We are fighting for workers conditions,' or, ‘We are fighting for jobs.' He said, ‘We are fighting for our survival'-the survival of the union movement. It has absolutely nothing to do with the workers and it has nothing to do with creating jobs. In fact, you never hear the words ‘job creation' come out of the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition; it is all about the union movement and its position. The campaign by the union movement, Your re- Rights at Work, is a sham and I look forward to making further contributions on it. (Time expired)",114
226,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The discussion is concluded. AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL 2005 Report from Main Committee Bill returned from Main Committee with unresolved questions; certified copy of the bill and schedule of the unresolved questions presented. Ordered that this bill be considered at the next sitting. NA (TRANSITIONALS AND CONSEQUENTIALS) BILL 2005 Report from Main Committee Bill returned from Main Committee without having been fully considered; certified copy of the bill presented. Ordered that this bill be considered at next sitting. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed.,116
227,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ISLANDER HERITAGE PROTECTION,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Grayndler has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.,117
228,Mr HAASE,ISLANDER HERITAGE PROTECTION,"As I was saying before question time on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Amendment Bill 2005, this kind of uncertainty, uncorrected, would discourage overseas institutions from ever allowing items from their collections to be exhibited in Australia. Australia's reputation as a borrower of cultural materials was damaged by a series of declarations under the Victorian provisions of the act in 2004-05 that stopped Museum Victoria returning Aboriginal artefacts to the UK lenders, despite a certificate under the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York is an example of an overseas institution which owns and displays Aboriginal artefacts. The Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas collection contains more than 11,000 pieces, including 40,000-year-old rock paintings and Aboriginal artefacts dating from the 18th century to the 20th century. Another is the Captain Cook Birthplace Museum in Middlesbrough, England. It houses the largest collection of its kind outside Australia, comprising mostly artefacts donated by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander the Arts Board of Australia. The British Museum in London has a substantial collection of ethnography dating back to 1798, including weapons, tools and hunting equipment. It was this institution which was embroiled in the previously mentioned incident. The amendment ensures political correctness does not go mad and damage our international reputation or deny us the opportunity to experience visiting exhibitions. Yes, protecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage is important; but it should not automatically have precedence over actions which benefit all Australians. I commend this bill to the House, but once again I underline the fact that exploration and mining and the resources industry generally are vital for the continued vitality of the Australian economy and the welfare of the people of Australia. It is also vital for future generations of Aboriginal people. These resources are primarily located in remote areas of Australia that have a substantial population of Aboriginal people. The main bugbear for these communities today is the fact that they have no outlet for real employment. There is also the consideration that presently there is very little readiness and preparedness for job training for specific tasks within the resource development industry. A future change of attitude amongst the populations of those Indigenous communities would see full attendance at educational institutions during the primary years, building a foundation of education that would allow them to go on to secondary school and hopefully in some cases tertiary education. That would change the tide and allow the resource developers in remote Australia to employ a substantial part of their workforce from those desert communities. This would present a whole new opportunity for employment and all of the self-esteem that comes from being financially independentsomething that is sadly lacking at present amongst the general style of desert community. In commending this bill to the House, of course I have reservations. I know that this proposed act will be used by many to filibuster, to obfuscate and to generally get in the way of the opening up of land for the development of mineral deposits-remembering that 6.5 per cent of the economy of this nation is contributed to by the resource development sector. It is vital that we maintain an understanding of that issue, an issue that is dear to the hearts of the majority of my constituents within the Kalgoorlie electorate. Far too often I hear stories and solid evidence of various claimant groups making varied decisions about the significance of particular areas of country, such as one group insisting that it is vital and that large sums money will have to change hands before approval can be given, and then, when negotiations are completed and the exploration company believes that it can legitimately move into country to explore it, because it has approval to do so, at the eleventh hour the company will be thwarted by yet another claimant group insisting that the wrong claimant group was called to advise on the significance of that country and that another heritage survey must be carried out. Of course, that survey will involve, yet again, the payment of persons to carry out a survey. Those persons will need to be supported, in every way, financially for the duration of that survey. All of this leads to many prospectors walking away from country that they have legitimately taken exploration leases on, and for Australia that means that greenfields are possibly left undiscovered. The impact on the Australian economy in the long term is phenomenal. We have it on good authority that, for a greenfield to come into production, it often takes 25 years from the date of initial exploration. We do not have 25 years to wait for so many of those very important and very rich resources that are being developed and marketed today. We do not have 25 years to wait for future developments and future discoveries; we need to start that process now. Impediments to the process of exploration and the development of greenfields should be addressed. There are many. We suffer from a playing field here in Australia that is not level. We need to have a process whereby exploration is encouraged by investment in the exploration industry-a share known as the flow-through share would enable that to be encouraged. (Time expired)",117
229,Mr GARRETT,ISLANDER HERITAGE PROTECTION,"In the short time available in this debate before the adjournment debate, I rise to speak on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Amendment Bill 2005. I will make some general observations about history. Understanding the past and learning the connections that run from the past to the present enables people, and the institutions that they grant power and authority to, to better understand and make sense of the present and to make decent laws in the present which reflect their understanding of the past. But when you see the past through the prism of ideology you are unable to do that. That is the big issue that lies in this bill before the House because, if you see the past through the prism of ideology, as the Prime Minister consistently does on Indigenous issues, then what you are attempting to do is to make the past malleable. If there are a set of certainties attached to it that you do not agree with then you try and make the past malleable. This is the stuff of the ‘Thought Police', a phrase that was brought to prominence in George Orwell's Nineteen EightyFour and referred to by the Prime Minister quite recently in his speech to the Quadrant magazine anniversary dinner. I was intrigued that the Prime Minister should refer to Orwell and Nineteen EightyFour given this legislation before the House and its character, because the subtext of this legislation is the Howard government's fixation with the reconfiguring the past to suit present prejudices. That particular way of treating legislation-which is both implicit and explicit in this Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage protection billneeds to be commented on, noted and understood not only by those in this parliament but also by those who are listening outside as bills are debated in this House. This legislation needs to be looked at in the context of the amendments to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which we have also debated in this House. When that legislation came into the House, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, the member for Flinders, assured us in his second reading speech that that legislation strengthened the protection of the environment. It does no such thing. In fact the government even voted against a climate change action amendment that we wanted to see made to that legislation. Debate interrupted. NA",118

231,Mr CREAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to acknowledge the passing of a great Australian athlete and a great humanitarian. I speak of Peter Norman, who died suddenly last month at the age of 64. I had the privilege of knowing Peter. Our families went camping together one year. At his death he still held the Australian 200 metres record, set at the Mexico City Olympics in 1968. That record still stands20.06 seconds-an amazing achievement almost 40 years later. That time would have won him a gold medal at every Olympics until 1984. Peter won five straight 200 meits tres national titles from 1966 to 1970. He was in the bronze medal winning team for the four by 110 yards relay at the 1966 Commonwealth Games. In Mexico City, in setting that unbeaten record, he ran second to Tommie Smith. John Carlos came third. Both were black American athletes. What happened next became a defining moment in Olympic history and the history of the US civil rights movement: Smith and Carlos stood shoeless, heads bowed, with clenched fists raised in a Black Power salute in protest at racial discrimination in the United States-all this whilst the American national anthem was played. Peter Norman stood with them, wearing a civil rights badge. He had earlier suggested to Smith and Carlos that each wear one glove after Carlos forgot to bring his gloves to the podium. It was a powerful and indelible image, flashed around the world. The actions of Smith and Carlos stirred enormous controversy in the United States. They were sent home the following day. Norman, while not sent home, was heavily criticised on his return, but he remained steadfast in his belief that what he did was right. Peter was a humble man. He was raised in the Salvation Army and his parents taught him to take care of people who could not take care of themselves. He believed in civil rights. ‘Every man is born equal and should be treated that way,' he said. And, when put to the test, he rose to the occasion magnificently. Australian Olympic Committee President John Coates has described Peter as a superb athlete and a man to whom social justice was important. After his retirement Peter continued to contribute to athletics and a range of sports, helping with Olympic fundraising and Olympic education. Throughout his life, and in that glorious moment in Mexico City, Peter Norman embodied true moral courage and generosity of spirit. Recently in Australia we have been having a debate about Australian values and what it means to be Australian. Peter Norman embodied what is good about Australia and Australians: good humour, respect, tolerance, humility, honesty, moral principle and great courage. We salute him for his great sporting achievements and his values. He remained good friends with Tommie Smith and John Carlos until his death. They were pallbearers at his funeral. At his funeral John Carlos said: Peter put his life out there for us all those years ago and carried it to his death. He never flinched. Peter is survived by his second wife Jan and their daughters Belinda and Emma, and by his first wife Ruth and their children Gary, Sandra and Janita. To them. I send my condolences. Tasmania: Environment",119
232,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to bring to the attention of the House a potential disaster in the city of Launceston. The city, which is the main population centre of my electorate of Bass, is at risk of being hit by a major flood. This is of great concern to the Launceston City Council and, of course, ultimately every single person living in the north of Tasmania. Later this month the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Jim Lloyd, will visit northern Tasmania and I have arranged for him to be briefed by council officials on the risks of a 100-year flood event. A report shows that there is a 40 per cent chance of a flood causing more than $100 million damage in the next 50 years. To consider the effects, we can turn to history. In April 1929 a devastating flood inundated parts of Launceston, forcing more than 3,500 people to flee their homes in just one night. Flood waters converged from east and west on the Tamar Valley, causing the river to rise to record levels. A torrent of water poured through Cataract Gorge, combining with floodwaters from the North Esk, inundating more than 1,000 houses in the low-lying parts of Launceston-we call it Invermay. The major and historic power station at Duck Reach was simply washed away. Throughout northern Tasmania during those frightening days of April 1929, 22 people died. If the natural circumstances of 1929 were to reoccur, it would simply be a national disaster, potentially again causing loss of life, certainly much more loss of property and without doubt the paralysis of the city of Launceston. For these reasons, this issue does demand recognition and action from all levels of government, including the Commonwealth. While the prime responsibility for Launceston's flood protection rests squarely with the state government of Tasmania, it still remains a matter for all levels of government to share some responsibility for. The Launceston City Council certainly deserves credit for making the flood levee issue its top priority, and I am committed to continue to work positively and constructively with the council to find a long-term solution. We as members of parliament cannot afford to sit on our hands. History has taught us, through events like the 1929 disaster and more recently the flooding from Hurricane Katrina in the United States, that floodwaters can be catastrophic, both for the area inundated and indeed for greater surrounding areas which can be paralysed because of the demise of sections of infrastructure such as roads, power, water, sewerage, places of employment and, of course, housing. The Launceston City Council has made fixing the flood levees its No. 1 priority. Its mayor, Ivan Dean, said: … it's our number one priority, it's top of our funding list. And all elected members see it that way. We need to push this forward. In the early 1970s the state government handed control of the newly built flood levees to the Launceston City Council. An act of parliament enshrined an annual payment of around $150,000 per annum for upkeep. That was unindexed and, more than 30 years later, remains the same. I would say that that decision at that time was an act of abandonment. I do not know and I do not care what party was in power back then, but it simply should not have happened. The Flood Protection Authority should have been left in place with an enduring mandate to protect Launceston from flood. The mayor of Launceston City Council is committed and his aldermen are behind him. The issue ought not be lost on the Tasmanian state government and apparently it is not. In response to a question in state parliament from my state Liberal colleague Sue Napier, Premier Lennon said: A number of flood mitigation measures are available and all the relevant ones will be considfirst ered … they will be considered in partnership between the State Government and the Launceston City Council … He went on: I assure this House, the people of Launceston and particularly the people of Invermay that the Tasmania Government stands willing to contribute with all levels of government, including Canberra, to ensure that there is an effective solution to the flooding risk … It is indeed very encouraging to hear the state Premier make this commitment. I thank him for it, and I also thank the Launceston City Council for their strong and obvious commitment. I, too, look forward to working productively with local and state levels of government to help prevent a flooding disaster. This commitment has taken many years too long, but it is welcome, nonetheless. This afternoon, in closing, I call on the federal government to be prepared to seriously consider a call for funding when it materialises and, for the sake of our beautiful city of Launceston, I personally am committed to working this matter through to a successful conclusion. Member for Lindsay",120
233,Mrs IRWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"The Prime Minister abandoned Middle Australia when he won control of both houses. Now, one of his favourite members of parliament, the member for Lindsay, has followed suit. While the member for Lindsay would have you believe that she is working hard for the people of Lindsay, the truth is she has given up. While families in her electorate have their household budget attacked through interest rate increases and their wages cut by the extreme Work Choices legislation and while there is a hike in petrol prices, the member for Lindsay is more concerned about global matters than local matters. The member for Lindsay has travelled overseas no fewer than three times in the six months of this year, all courtesy of the taxpayer. In homes across Lindsay, magnets are chasing the bills around the fridge. Meanwhile, their local member is chasing frequent flyer points with overseas travel. Rising interest rates, record petrol prices and John Howard's wage-slashing AWAs are all of no concern to the Prime Minister's ite member. She was far too busy travelling the world. The member for Lindsay started off the year well with her calls in January for the Howard government to fix the child-care crisis. She said that ministers should stop ‘doing their own thing' and work together to respond to the escalating problem. But it was all down hill after that. In March this year she travelled to the USA for 14 days. In April she travelled to Turkey and, again, to the USA. On this trip she spent more than one month overseas. During the budget sittings, the people of Lindsay were on their own, while their member was in the States. Then, to top this off, she had a European adventure for two weeks in June and July. This was while she tripped the light fantastic on ice. She is the face of the Howard government: out of touch and could not care less. She is more concerned about duty-free purchasing than anything her constituents want to discuss with her. What time did the member for Lindsay have for her constituents during her overseas trips? Who was dealing with the concerns and problems of her constituents? What was happening when the people of Lindsay-decent, honest, hard working local people-who needed her help were calling, writing or emailing her? She says that she understands the concerns of the people of Lindsay, but she is truly a world away-three overseas trips, dancing on ice and tending to her multimillion-dollar property portfolio. Like the Prime Minister and her out-of-touch Liberal colleagues, the member for Lindsay has abandoned the very people who put her in parliament. Her constituents back in Penrith have a right to know, and they have a right to ask their member why she would give up on them in favour of jetsetting around the world like a favour- celebrity princess. I think I know the reason. The member for Lindsay made a judgement that the Prime Minister would step down as captain, which would provide her with a suitable exit as a loyal cabin crew member. Her world excursions were her farewell gift to herself. But the member for Lindsay is in for a surprise: the Prime Minister is staying and now so is she. So she must now explain why she has spent so much time overseas this year, instead of looking after her electorate. Most families in Lindsay have to choose between making a living and having a family holiday, not what world landmark they want to visit next. But, while they struggle to balance the family budget, the member for Lindsay is swanning around the world and ice-skating. The people of Lindsay voted for a voice in this place-a person who would stand up for them; a member who would work for them. Their farewell gift to her will be to dump her at the next election. I speak to the people in Lindsay. I actually had the pleasure of working with the people of Lindsay for six years. ‘Bring it on,' they are saying to me in the high street, in Penrith Plaza, at the Panthers stadium and on the M4 Freeway as they check the petrol prices and wonder whether they can manage the mortgage if they cut down on groceries. They know they are on thin ice and so is the member for Lindsay. Bring on the 2007 election, because the member for Lindsay will not be here in the parliament after that. The member for Lindsay does not deserve it, and the member for Lindsay has definitely let down her constituents. Miles State High School",121
234,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this afternoon to place on record the wonderful achievement of Miles State High School in my electorate in winning this year's federal government ANZAC Day Schools Award. For the benefit of people who may be listening who do not know just where Miles is, it is a beautiful little country town that sits on the crossroads of the Leichhardt and Warrego highways-the headquarters of the Murilla shire. It has not always been called Miles; originally, it was called Dogwood Crossing. It was called Dogwood Crossing because it sits on the trail that was blazed by the explorer Leichhardt when he went through that area in 1844. It was not until about 1878 that it was renamed and took its current name, Miles. At that time, the Hon. William Miles was the state member for Maranoa and he was the Minister for Railways. In his honour, Dogwood Crossing was renamed Miles, and that is its name to the present day. The students of the Miles State High School entered the federal government's ANZAC Day Schools Award this year. I am very proud to represent Miles and, of course, to raise the achievements of the students from the Miles State High School in this place. Not only did they win the national category for all contenders across Australia, they won the state award as well. I will be there with these students on Monday, presenting them with their plaque. I feel very proud and they should feel very proud, as should their parents and the community generally feel very proud of the achievements of the students in a small rural country town that have taken on the nation and larger communities where there is more money and more resources. Here is a little country community with a small high school where the students have won a national award. The students of Miles State High School have been recognised for their creative project in which they undertook research on the local wartime history and the young people of the time who came forward to serve in the great wars that we as a nation have been involved in-in particular, one soldier, Private Thomas Bush, who was killed at Gallipoli. From the research that they did on Private Bush, they put together a performance entitled, The Love Letter from Z Beach. They developed that into a rock eisteddfod. The students presented that performance at ANZAC Day in Miles this year. At the time of the two world wars, 60 per cent of Australia's population lived outside metropolitan Australia. At any visit to a war memorial, wherever it is-but particularly in our rural communities-I often look at the rolls of honour of those who served our country. I will be saying to the students on Monday when I meet with them and present them with their prize and the plaque that they will receive as part of the award: imagine what it would be like if you took the number of young people who are on the honour roll on your memorial out of your community today. Imagine how it would be. How could you survive? How could the shops continue? How could the farms continue to run? How could the council continue its work? I think Remembrance Day, which is in nine days time, is an opportunity for us all, for those students in Miles and, I hope, for members of this place when they visit their communities and schools, to look at the names of the people on the rolls of honour who have served our country, and to encourage-as I will the students on Monday; and I am sure they will-the community generally across Australia to give a minute of their time on 11 November at 11 o'clock. I do not believe it is too much to ask to give a minute of our time to remember those who gave their lives. (Time expired) Procedure Committee Inquiry  is a rather sad milestone for this parliament and the House Standing Committee on Procedure. Let me say that I have had the pleasure of working with the honourable minister at the table, the member for Eden-Monaro, and the member for MCPherson, as deputy chair and chair of the committee. In fact, I have served in four parliaments on the Procedure Committee and never before have we had a vote on that committee. But today we had a vote and a casting vote of the chair. What was it all about? It was about question time.",122
235,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The Chief Opposition Whip would be aware that the private deliberations of a committee should not be revealed.  received many letters to your office from members of the public about how question time is conducted. I presume some are supportive, but some have ideas and some are critical. As Australians, they have that right. You have reminded me of some of their criticisms-quite rightly; I do not object to that. You and your predecessors have said many times in question time that it is within the of the House-that is, the government-to change standing orders to make question time work better. I welcome this inquiry into question time. The opposition are taking it very seriously. We will be putting in a submission about changing question time procedure. I want to say this, Mr Speaker, and no-one in this place will prevent me from saying it: the people of Australia have a right to be heard. If they have a view about question time, then I believe this Australian parliament, where we represent the people of Australia, has a responsibility to listen to what they are saying about what they think about question time and how question time can be improved. I think it is an utter outrage that they are going to be denied that opportunity. People in my electorate, people in your electorate, Mr Speaker, and people in the electorate of the member for Watson have the right to comment. We might not like it, we might not think it is helpful-they may be very critical-but I believe that they have the right to make submissions to that inquiry and the government and members of the committee have a responsibility to listen. We have a responsibility to take into account what they think. We might not agree with them. We might not enact what they say they would like to see, but as Australian citizens they have the right to comment about the conduct of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. If anything demonstrates how out of touch the government is, how arrogant the government is and how it will not listen to what Middle Australia is thinking and saying, then this demonstrates it. In fact, this government takes Middle Australia for granted. Mr Speaker, you know that I have served as your deputy-I have served a number of wit committees-and I think that, overwhelmingly, in the committees I have been involved in we have tried not as members of the Liberal Party or the Labor Party but as members of parliament to do things in the national interest, on behalf of the people. That is what they expect of us. But they do not expect to be cut out of the action. They do not expect to be treated as deaf, dumb and mute, not able to make a submission, not able to be heard and not able to be listened to. I think this is one of the darkest days for the Procedure Committee, and I am the longest ever serving member. It is a day of shame. I think that this was not just a mistake. If it were a mistake I could live with it. This was deliberate action, and I object strongly to it. I think it is a terrible thing, and I am outraged by it. I believe the people of Australia will not cop their being denied a voice in improving how this parliament works. Agribusiness",124
236,Mr BAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise today to speak of an ongoing crisis facing Tasmanian and, for that matter, all Australian farmers. Tasmania is known as one of Australia's greatest farming regions, growing some of the highest quality produce that you will find anywhere in the world. Yet the livelihood of these farmers and all Australian farmers is at stake, as cheap imports are flooding our shelves and threatening local jobs. Generic food labels are available at all leading supermarkets, enticing consumers with cheaper pricing and destroying Australia's own vegetable industry. Supermarket giants need to take some responsibility for the state of Australia's agribusiness. Walk into any Woolworths store and what you will find is their Home Brand packaged fruit and vegetables that are imported. These brands are appealing to a lot of Australians due to their cheaper price tags. Let us not forget that Australian produce is recognised for quality and safety, which is something that cannot be said for a lot of the cheaper imported goods. Australia has one of the most stringent food codes in the world, where Australian produce is tested for some 61 chemicals. However, international trade standards require that imported produce need only to pass a 25-chemical test. So, yes, imported goods may be cheap, but at what price? As Tasmania, in particular north-west Tasmania, packages more than 80 per cent of Australia's frozen vegetables and is a major producer of crops such as potatoes, carrots, beans, peas and fruit and some 50 per cent of the world's poppies, this trend of cheap imports will come at a huge price to Australia's economy, and the biggest price will be paid by our farmers and regional Australia. Australia's vegetable growers are finding it harder to compete on the global vegetable market for key commodities such as peas, potatoes and corn, principally due to our higher food safety standards, which are an increased production cost to our farmers that our global trading partners do not have to incorporate. However, let me state that I would advocate not the decreasing of our standards but, rather, that Australia's producers be rewarded for this effort by loyalty from our retailers and consumers. Simplot, another of Tasmania's major vegetable packagers and suppliers, lost its position as the sole supplier of french fries to MCDonald's in Australia. Most Australians are aware that buying ‘Australian made' means they are doing their bit for the economy. Australians are committed to the idea of keeping the money and the jobs in this country. However, food labelling on packaged goods can be confusing and not represent a true indication of country of origin. The labels ‘Made from local and imported goods' and ‘Packaged locally from imported goods' do not give consumers a fair indication of place of origin; therefore, they do not have the information to make an informed decision about the foods they are buying and what is best for their health and their budget-although we should note the proactive approach of Birds Eye through their Australian grown label. Throughout Australia, and particularly in Tasmania, we have seen major companies make one decision after another which have had serious impacts on the livelihoods of farmers and on our rural communities. I believe that, in light of the ongoing crisis affecting vegetable growers, we as a country should take a hard look at corporate responsibility. An example I would offer, which underlines my strong views on corporate and social responsibility, is the manner in which Australian vegetable growers have been treated by some in corporate Australia. Last year, we had the situation where MCDonald's chose for the sake of a $4 million profit to decrease their intake of Tasmanian potatoes by some 50 per cent. It raised in the minds of my constituents and people throughout Australia the question of whether such corporations have a social conscience. Today, long-term ramifications for the vegetable industry are being felt not only in Tasmania but throughout Australia, so in the future I hope corporations like MCDonald's-and I ask that they do-will start to fry Australian potatoes and not Australian farmers! Corporate and social responsibility is not about dictating to companies such as MCDonald's that they cannot make decisions in the best interests of their shareholders but error. about encouraging companies to consider the social and environmental impacts of their actions as part of their decision-making process. To help drive growth in the vegetable industry, the federal government has provided more than $3 million in financial support for the development and implementation of Vegvision, a strategic plan for the vegetable industry. Their role is to oversee the investment of the $3 million via the implementing of Vegvision, with the vision being to double the current value of fresh, processed and packaged vegetables in real terms by stimulating consumer preference for Australian produce in domestic and global markets. For this industry to flourish, the corporate sector must also play their part-empower consumers and companies and use their powerful position to assist the agriculture and vegetable industry throughout this country.
