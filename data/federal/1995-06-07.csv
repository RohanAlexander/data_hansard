NA NA Motion (by Mr Snowdon) agreed to: That standing order 48a (adjournment and next meeting) be suspended for the sitting on Wednesday, 7 June 1995 and Thursday, 8 June 1995. NA Public Works Committee",11
5,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the ninth report of the committee for 1995 relating to an increased army presence in the north, APIN, stage 2. NOES Ordered that the report be printed.",14
6,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-In 1989 the Public Works Committee recommended the construction of facilities for the relocation to Darwin of the Second Cavalry Regiment, a reconnaissance unit which had been located at Holsworthy, New South Wales. The Defence Force structure review, which was announced in 1991, determined that a regular army brigade would be permanently based in Darwin by the end of the decade. This was to be achieved by the staged relocation of southern based units to the Darwin area. APIN is part of the overall Defence move to the north which encompasses the activities of the three services. APIN is not about the defence of Darwin; it is about the defence of Australia. In November 1992 the committee tabled a report recommending the construction of facilities for units relocating to Darwin under stage 1. The report, which.I have tabled, recommends the provision of suitable working, training and accommodation facilities for army units relocating to Darwin under APIN PAIRS stage 2 at an estimated outturn cost of $264 million. Currently there are no Defence facilities in Darwin of suitable size, function or location capable of meeting the requirements of a brigade sized force. A need therefore exists to construct additional facilities at Robertson Barracks and to construct additional ammunition storage facilities at Marrara Swamp, RAAF base, Darwin. In response to concerns expressed at the public hearing concerning the storage of ammunition at Marrara Swamp, RAAF base, Darwin, the committee notes that all storage is in accordance with the United Nations hazardous goods classification procedures and NATO safety principles. An issue raised at the public hearing concerned the payment of subcontractors. The Report committee therefore recommends. that the Department of Defence continues to include in its contracts a clause stating that subcontractors must be paid before progress payments are made to contractors. The committee was impressed with the willingness of the Department of Defence to hold discussions with contractors and to conduct seminars explaining how business is conducted with the department. I commend the report to the House.",14
7,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-In speaking to the report, I specifically want to refer to recommendation 4 concerning the payment of subcontractors. The Public Works Committee has now adopted, as a formal arrangement, the asking of its contractors or its clients to ensure that the tender document has this inclusion. So far, we have had a remarkable acceptance of this principle from the departments concerned. I believe that the committee hopes this does form a precedent, particularly not only with references to the PWC but wherever the Commonwealth does work of this nature; where contractors and subcontractors are involved, this too might be part of the tender process. I have spoken to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) 'on this matter, and I believe that he concurs with this. I believe that I speak on behalf of the committee when I say it would be a great idea if this could be accepted right throughout the Commonwealth contract area. For years I kriow there has been-in my state, and I believe in New South Wales right along-a considerable amount of debate on contractors not paying subcontractual payments. This has been continuing right throughout, with some of the states promising that they will either, through trust arrangements or other protective legislation, do something to protect subcontractors. But, to my kriowledge, I do not believe protection has eventuated in Australia, except perhaps in New South Wales. So I would make the stipulation that there are precedents right across the nation, there are precedents internationally-Canadian precedents, I understand-but there is need to make sure there is more protection of subcontractors. The problem, of course, is getting state legislation in place. I understand also that for the Commonwealth this would not be a difficult arrangement because the client, which is the Commonwealth, has the cash. To make that a stipulation within the contract just means that the person paying the cash makes sure those subcontractors are paid. So that is relatively easy. I ask the Minister for Administrative Services whether, perhaps at his state ministers conference, this matter might be further explored with at least a condition that the states' contracts also include a reference to payment of subcontractors. Some would think this would not be necessary, but I have had a case given to me within the last week of a subcontractor working with a contractor for the housing department in Queensland where the contractor has not paid the subcontractual arrangements. Yet that contractor is allowed to tender on other jobs because of his lower tender. It is alarming to kriow that this is still happening in an area in which state governments are involved, and I believe it could happen in areas in which the Commonwealth is involved. I ask the minister whether he could see a means by which he could ask his state ministers to make sure the public works committees in those states opt for similar conditions and also try to widen the issue so that state legislation is introduced eventually to protect small business subcontractual enterprises, because I believe this is long overdue. I join in this debate to also recommend the project which I believe, as a northerner, is well overdue. Protection of the north means protection of the rest of Australia. In this regard I pay tribute to the witnesses we had. Their submission was first-class and they gave an indication that they are very much on top of their jobs. I think they will be a very welcome presence in the north. That goes for those of us who live on the east coast of the continent and also in the north itself.",15
8,Mr SNOWDON,COMMITTEES,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training)-by leave-I endorse the report of the Public Works Committee and also congratulate the committee on its work under the chairmanship of the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). I was privileged to accompany the committee on part of its tour around Darwin in relation to APIN stage 2. It carried its duties out with a great deal of professionalism and dedication and asked appropriate questions. I endorse the remarks made by both of the previous speakers in relation to the issue of subcontracting. The point I make, which has been made already by my friend the member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), is that the role of the defence forces in terms of their presence in northern Australia is one which is accepted and endorsed by the community. The Defence Force personnel offer a great deal to the Northern Territory community in particular in this instance. I endorse the remarks made by him. The other point I make is that the commitment the government has made, and which has been endorsed by the committee in this case, will cost until 2002 around $268.3 million. That is part of $561.1 million announced in the recent budget for either work under way or work to be undertaken between now and 2002. That is a very strong indication of the strength of the government's commitment to the move of defence forces to northern Australia. The point that needs to be emphasised is not only the role this expenditure has in underpinning the Northern Territory economy, both in terms of the construction industry and the work which has obviously been taken out through these capital works programs and the multipliers that flow from that, but also the multipliers that flow from the wages which are being paid to Defence Force personnel upon their arrival in northern Australia and the costs of running those Defence Force establishments. Those things mean a great deal to the Northern Territory as they are helping to sustain very low levels of unemployment, particularly in Darwin, and they also mean that small businesses are thriving. That is commitment which has been made as a result of these Defence Force expenditures by this government. I thank the committee for its work, its diligence and its dedication, and thank all those associated with the construction. SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICA TIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 Cognate bills: SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995 Second Reading Debate resumed from 6 June, on motion by Mr Gear: That the bill be now read a second time.",15
9,Mr STEELE HALL,COMMITTEES,"The presentation of these sales tax bills enables me to raise a particular issue in relation to an exemption from sales tax which was brought to my notice by a constituent over two years ago. The government has not responded, and has been deficient in its attention to the problem that this constituent has. It is a problem for relatively few people in Australia. I would not know whether it would be a dozen or 20-odd, but it is a matter of great equity as far as the individuals are concerned. The matter relates to the exemption of sales tax on vehicles purchased by those individuals who have a certificate from the secretary to the department that they are unable to use public transport in the pursuit of their employment. They therefore receive a sales tax exemption on the purchase of the vehicle in those circumstances. I will not use this particular constituent's name, for obvious reasons, but I will use some of the correspondence I have had with her in relation to this matter. In the first part of 1993 I was contacted by her and given the reply that she received in relation to her application for an the exemption of sales tax on the purchase of a vehicle. The letter said in part: We refer to your application for sales tax exemption on a motor vehicle. We regret this delay in replying. Item 97 of schedule 1 of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 provides exemption forI will go to subsection (3), which is the pertinent partin this item 'eligible disabled person' means a person who has a current certificate given by the secretary certifying that the person has lost the use of one or both legs to such an extent that he or she is unable to use public transport. 'Secretary' means the secretary of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services or an officer authorised by that secretary. My constituent has never had the use of arms use of arms. because of the effects of thalidomide on her before she was born. She has no useful arms whatsoever. She has a driving licence, has passed advanced driving tests and is extremedepartments ly adept. I asked for a demonstration from and I am simply amazed at the capacity of this individual, who is fully employed, drive a vehicle. The letter concluded: The certificate of medical eligibility issued Commonwealth Medical Office states that you not lost the use of either or both legs to the that you are unable to use public transport. means that you will not be able to obtain sales exemption on a motor vehicle. This was quite clearly an unintended discrimithe nation when the schedule was inserted in the legislation, I am sure, but I am finding that the government is quite solid on its resistance to moving in this matter. I approached the then Treasurer, the Hon. John Dawkins, in August 1993 and after his departure from this place I approached the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) a number of times and no action has ensued. My constituent made a further approach to the department after the rejection I just read out. The pertinent part of the second response was this: As your objection has not been made against assessment or a disallowance or partial disallowanswer ance of a credit claim, your objection cannot accepted as a valid objection. have reviewed your claim for exemption. Whilst we are sympathetic in respect of your situation, the act is quite explicit as to the type of disability a must be suffering from before he or she is entitled to exemption under item 97. As has previously been advised, only persons who have been certified by the appropriate authority that have lost the of one or both legs to such an extent they are permanently unable to use public transport use of transportation to and from gainful employprevious ment can claim exemption from sales tax on the purchase of a motor vehicle. As your disability does not involve the loss of one or both legs, we have no option but to confirm the earlier decision that you are unable to claim exemption from sales tax for the purchase of a motor vehicle under item 97. Then followed further correspondence with the individual concerned who had been denied the exemption and medical certificates which quite clearly show that she does .not have the I find the minister's response to this extremely unsatisfactory. Whilst it is not possible to extract, I find, statistics from the in each state to indicate how her many people are involved or might be involved, I understand there are three in my to own state. On some pro rata basis one can only assume that there might be a score of by the people around Australia. The minister's have response has been, 'She can get a disability extent payment and that will be equal to the exempThis tion from sales tax in a given period of a tax purchase and retention of a vehicle.' My constituent says, 'I do not want to get onto social security train. I want to be equal to everyone else. I am earning my own living in full employment and I do not accept that I should go on a disability payment when people with a disability of the same severity or less severity are getting sales tax exemptions because of the loss of the use of legs.' I concur entirely with that constituent. Why should she be on a lesser base in regard to this schedule than others? Why should she be discriminated against? The minister's negative response disappears entirely if he is talking about economics. He says that she can get a disability payment. He is not talking about an saving any money. He cannot be. That is his to the people in similar circumstances. be So he is saying, 'I am not going to do it. I do Nevertheless, we not want to do it.' I am going to move an amendment during person the passage of the bill through the consideration in detail stage and I will press it to a vote. I hope the minister will alter his view and will concede that on· no ground whatsouse ever, on equity or money or finance, is there for the any reason but dogged persistence to his view that would induce him to vote against an amendment of this nature. I wanted to make those few remarks before we reached the consideration in detail stage. I see here a defect in the schedule, one that is practically demonstrated by others. I have had a phone call from one of the executive officer of ACROD supporting this move. I am sure that, if it were a widely known effect throughout the community, Australians generally would say that of course there is a question of equity and of course it should be remedied. This is the easiest way possible to do so at the presentation of these bills. I look forward to further dis-ussion at the consideration in detail stage.",16
10,Mr CAMERON,COMMITTEES,"Stirling) (10.14 a.m.)This bill· is a cruel and heartless attack on Labor's battling true believers. It is a pernicious and thoughtless attack on Australia's battling home builders and renovators, particularly young Australians. Finally, it is a callous attack on battling Australian workers. Despite all the denials that members opposite will make, this bill is a slug against the Aussie battler, and it is a fairly vicious slug too. These tax increases will collect an extra $2112 billion over the next four years-$2Y2 billion, not an insignificant amount for dishonest increases. It makes a mockery of the claimby the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on Lateline prior to the last election: What I am promising is not to put up tax. He said his tax cuts were law-I-a-w, law. He abandoned them. He told the people of Australia prior to the last election that they have tax cuts without a GST. Well, they have got the GST, but the tax cuts have been abandoned. In fact, he has gone completely into reverse. The Prime Minister holds his esteemed office through fraudulent and deceptive conduct. He was elected to the office of Prime Minister through broken promises, deceit and misrepresentation. It was a prostitution of our democracy. He bought himself the prime ministership by offering tax cuts, promising not to put up tax and a plethora of bribes. Following the election, the tax cuts were abandoned, taxes went up and the bribes were forgotten. He turned the office of Prime Minister into a bidding game-he has prostituted it, and that is anathema to the principles of democracy. These bills seek assent to the Labor Party's dishonesty. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) presented the budget in the expectation that the coalition, the Australian Democrats, the Greens and the Independents would support it; and thus support Labor's dishonesty. He should not be so ridiculous. If we supported any of these dishonest tax increases, it would send a clear message to the community that we do not mind such immoral, unprincipled and undemocratic behaviour. However, we oppose dishonesty. We oppose the prostitution of our democracy. For that reason, we are opposing these tax increases. We oppose these bills. Whether the Democrats, Greens and Independents will support the legislation will indicate to the people of Australia their commitment to honesty and integrity and the principles underpinning our democracy. If the Democrats, Greens and Independents allow these tax increases to pass, they will tell the people of Australia that lying is fine and will call into question everything they say since they collude in dishonesty. If they oppose this bill, as they should, it will indicate they do uphold the principles of democracy and will not be party to Labor's dishonest attack on Australia's battlers. The bill increases the burden on Australia's battlers by increasing the sales tax payable on could passenger motor vehicles to 21 per cent. On 1 July, it goes up to 22 per cent as a result of the Labor Party's 1993-94 budget of betrayal, which increased each tier of the wholesale sales tax by initially one per cent, and come 1 July another one per cent. This is but another broken promise. Remember the Prime Minister's One Nation speech in which he said: From tomorrow, the sales tax on new cars currently subject to the 20 per cent will be permanently lowered to 15 per cent ... You have to ask: if the sales tax were to be permanently lowered to 15 per cent, how permanent is permanent? If the Prime Minister said, 'I will permanently tell the truth,' how would we interpret that? I would like to quote from a letter I received the other day from a Mr and Mrs Stokes: We entered into a binding contract to purchase our new motor vehicle from Titan Ford in Melville prior to any announcement of tax increase on 29 April 1995. After much research and consideration, we decided to purchase an Australian built vehicle in support of our own local economy, and not some foreign economy. This vehicle was yet to be built and we accepted the delay required to get our Australian built new car instead of a foreign import. We could in fact get delivery of a foreign import within days. We have just been advised by the dealer that the new sales tax will apply to our new car, even though we had fully committed ourselves to the purchase (production number and all has been allocated). We believe that the sales tax increase should not apply to us, as a firm order to purchase was placed prior to the announcement of any sales tax increase. I do not infer any criticism of the company Titan Ford in Melville. It is a company with a very high reputation indeed. I wonder what the Stokes are supposed to do: go to the car dealers and say, 'You better absorb the tax increase for it.' That was the ridiculous answer from the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) last week when I asked a question along similar lines about increases in the cost of a home. Mr and Mrs Stokes are not alone. There are many Australians who have been slugged with this dishonest tax. The facts are simple. When, before the last election, did the Prime Minister, the then Treasurer, or any Labor spokesman say, 'We will increase the sales tax on passenger motor vehicles'? When, before the lasi election, did anyone from the Labor Party seek endorsement for that? They did not seek endorsement, they did not get a mandate; and we will reflect the wishes of the Australian people and oppose this tax. The Labor Party government says it is balancing the budget. As well as using shonky figures, it is based on dishonesty. While members opposite defend this budget by saying the tax increases are to balance itthey forget the assets sales will not be realised and therefore the budget will not be balanced-they ought to remember their excuses are useless because balancing the budget does not defend their dishonesty. If the Labor Party wants to balance the budget, it has to be scrupulously honest about it. It has to do it truthfully, and come out before the election and say, 'We will balance the budget but it means increasing tax, it means abandoning tax cuts.' Then it can see whether it has a mandate. It is too honest to do that, and it will be thrown out for its dishonesty. This bill also modifies the sales tax law to remove sales tax exemption for certain 100 per cent recycled paper. Over four years this will increase government revenue by $49 million. Like the other measures in this bill, we will oppose the removal of this exemption. My concern on this issue is not just Labor's dishonesty but also the environmental aspect. In the present circumstances we must encourage the purchase of products which are a suitable alternative to products which in their manufacture are detrimental to the environment. I certainly hope this measure does not see increased consumption of non-recycled paper at the expense of recycled paper thus accelerating the destruction of our environment, no matter how small. I have working in my office a student intern from ANU, Mica Stark, who is preparing a paper for me on hemp and its potential uses as an industrial resource in Australia. I have here a piece of paper made from industrial hemp and, as can be seen, it is a fine piece of paper. Not one tree was felled for it, and I would like to see, if it is viable-Mica's report will certainly enlighten us further on this-greater development of industries which are an alternative to destroying our environment. Hemp paper is one. The reason I bring this up is that for such an industry to develop it needs in the first instance assistance to get off the ground and, secondly, no taxes on the product. While all recycled paper is now taxed, I would hope that this government will ensure that if hemp paper production does get off the ground in Australia it is not slugged with a tax and that the industry will be allowed to develop. The government also intends to remove the sales tax exemption on building materials. This means the 12 per cent tax will apply to, to quote the explanatory memorandum, 'builders' hardware; wall and floor tiles; plaster and plaster mixtures; taps, nozzles, tap handles and shower heads; bonding, setting and sealing agents; wooden floor coverings; paints, putties, fillers, thinners, pigments and driers; wallpaper; prefabricated household cupboards, cabinets and storage units and office partitions and workstation panelling.' The government predicts the financial impact of this will see revenue increase by $215 million in 1995-96, $245 million in 1996-97, $265 million in 1997-98 and $290 million in 1998-99. This is the Treasury estimate. Building industries will collect over half a billion dollars and, quite frankly, I trust them more than I trust the boffins here in Canberra in their ivory towers, putting the tax through a computer simulation and working out what impact it will have on a house. Those boffins have predicted that, on a $100,000 house and land package, the impact on home buyers will be $400. The thing is, they do not build houses-they dream up broken promises. The builders, who know what goes into building a house, predict the impact will be at least $1,000. I notice in the press today that the government at last is coming slightly clean on that and getting a little closer to the mark. At the end of the day, it all depends on what goes into a house. It will certainly collect at least $215 million; probably as much as half a billion dollars. On 31 May I asked the Minister for Finance why Aussie battlers who had already signed a contract to have a house built, a contract which allowed unforeseen rises in costsdishonest Labor taxes these days are not unforeseen, I suggest-should be slugged with this great Australian dream tax. All he said was that the impact, according to Treasury, is only $400 and that, if builders charge more, home buyers should argue the tax with their builder. Who should the builder argue with the supplier? The government increases the price but, according to the minister, home buyers should argue the tax with the builder. That comment is as fanciful as the minister believing he can win the seat of Brand. He knew he could not win Swan, but if he wants to stay here his only option is Fremantle. I look forward to Penny Hearne joining me on that side of the House after the next election as the new member for Brand. The other point worth making is that, while the initial slug might be $1,000, this will not be paid immediately-it will go straight onto the mortgage. So, if one is paying a mortgage over 25 years, and assuming the tax slug adds $1,000 to the price of the home, at a 10 per cent interest rate that will increase the mortgage by $9 a month-increasing the total impact of the slug to $2,727. The impact on the Aussie battler will not be $1,000, but $2,727. I have had numerous constituents contact my office regarding this unfair impost. Let me quote from Kym Winter. She and her husband are typical of the sorts of Aussies trying to achieve their goal of owning their own home. Kym, I think, speaks for all people faced with the same situation as she is. She speaks better than any of us in this place on the difficulties faced by young Australian home buyers. She wrote: I received a letter from Homestyle the other day notifying my husband and I about the federal budget 12 per cent rise that will come in from the 1st July. Our concern is that we have recently purchased a home with the West Australian Housing Centre. Our concern is that Homestyle, our builders, have begun building our home and the thing is we are worrying about the 12 per cent rise on certain building items. As we are only receiving my husband's income, as I stay home and care for our children. We have already been to Prestart and budgeted for a few things extra for our home. Now as we have been told we may be up for more money, which we don't have to spare. If this 12 per cent comes through from the 1st July, it will be impossible for us to have that money aside. It would mean saving hard and a lot longer and preventing us to move into our home when completed. That would mean a lot longer delay for us to have the money up front. I don't think it is fair considering that my husband and I have already signed the papers a few months ago and everything was finalised to go ahead ... I feel that we shouldn't have to be in this situation considering it may start from the 1st July and we have already started building. We are all encouraged to buy our own homes to have for security and a place for our children to grow and call home. It is going to be impossible for all families to purchase a home with all these new conditions changing, especially to families having only one income coming through. I feel if the Government do decide on the 12 per cent rise on certain items that it should only apply to families that purchase a home from the 1st July. At least they would be aware of the changes. Please if there is anything that can help my husband and I in this situation, it would be well appreciated. Kym Winter speaks for many Australians. This bill hurts Kym and her family; it hurts many families throughout the nation. The government ought to listen to Kym and to people in a similar plight to her and her family. If you are not going to back down on this unfair and pernicious slug-and I hope those who hold the balance of power in the Senate consider the Kym Winters of our country and oppose the bill, even if it forces an election-then at least exempt from paying the tax those who have already entered into contracts and have worked out their budget. Kym Winter speaks for many people in my electorate of Stirling. She speaks for many Australians. On behalf of the Kym Winters of Australia, notwithstanding Labor's dishonesty and lack of a mandate to increase tax, the coalition will be opposing these dishonest and shonky tax increases. We oppose this bill.",18
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Rocher)Before I call the honourable member for Indi, let me say that I am not sure of the conventions-and I resolve to check with Mr Speaker-as to where parliamentary secretaries may address the House from if they do not have carriage of a government measure; or a shadow minister who does not have carriage of the opposition's case. Having allowed the honourable member for the Northern Territory to address the House from the dispatch box earlier today, I will afford the same courtesy to the honourable member for Indi. I will get some guidance on the matter.",21
12,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES," Mr Deputy Speaker, I am somewhat surprised at your comment. I am only a relatively new member of this House. I have been here for two years. I have observed the practice of this House. As far as I can see, the practice has been that parliamentary secretaries on duty, when rostered to speak, speak from the place where they are on duty.",21
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,I will check it with Mr Speaker.,21
14,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES,"I am happy to speak from whatever position you say because I feel very strongly and passionately about the impact of this legislation on the people of Australia. I support the statements made by my colleague the member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) that this bill has to be rejected. It is symbolic of so many things that are going wrong in this nation. It is time that people stood up to be counted against what this government has been doing. If this government had a mandate to introduce this tax, even though I objected to it because of my view of the problems with the tax system in Australia, I probably would be persuaded that the government should be allowed to proceed with its taxation proposals. In this place and in Australia this government has no mandate at all to introduce this tax. You might say that a government, with a three-year term, can introduce measures during its term. Perhaps you could argue strongly that this is what this measure is all about and, therefore, the government is entitled to do that. Never before, as far as I can ascertain, has a government specifically said to the people of Australia, before facing a general election, that it would not introduce new taxes. Of course, this government further said that it proposed to make major changes to the tax impost on all Australians. In fact, it said that it proposed to reduce taxes during its term from the 1993 election to, presumably, 1996. To reinforce that commitment to the Australian people, in order to get the Australian people to give it a mandate-which it did get, although very narrowly-the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that he did not want just his word to be taken with respect to his proposals for the financial management and well-being of Australians. He wanted to make absolutely certain that his proposals would be carried forward and would be believed, so he said, 'We have enshrined them in legislation.' In making that infamous statement-'What I am promising is not to put up tax and my commitment is in l-a-w law'-he was trying to perform, as he is good at doing, in front of the television cameras across Australia and say, 'I have actually enshrined in legislation the promise that this government is making and, therefore, I ask you to support my government and me as the Prime Minister and give us a three-year term from 1993.' Of course, they got it. We now find that the procession of budgets introduced by this government, since it got its mandate by fraud and by breaking the law, has progressively increased taxes. This bill is the second round of increasing wholesale sales tax. This government introduced sales tax increases in the 1993-94 budget. Honourable members will remember that, to soften the blow, the Prime Minister proposed that the sales tax be introduced in two distinct instalments-one last year and the other to come in on 1 July. There has not been a lot said about the fact that we have another increase from last year's budget to operate and bite into the Australian people, into the Australian battler, from 1 July. But, not content with just that, this current budget and these new measures propose even further increases in wholesale sales tax and sales tax in breach of the commitment made by the Prime Minister of Australia to the people of Australia. I feel very passionate and angry about that. Wherever I travel around my electorate and around Australia, I hear ordinary people saying to me that they feel let down. They are very concerned and angry at the way they have been treated. The bottom line about Australians that this Prime Minister does not understand is that they will make sacrifices for their nation: they will contribute substantially to consolidated revenue to enable the elected government of the day to deliver services they believe should be provided to the people of Australia. Australians are very generous in that regard and have made many sacrifices over the years in order that services can be provided by the government and in order that a safety net can be provided for people who need assistance. That is the characteristic of Australians that we are all very proud of. But Australians have been let down so badly that they do not feel generous now about the contributions they have to make. They are very resentful of the contributions they are being asked to make. They are resentful for very good reason. The Prime Minister has lied. He promised that he would not increase taxes and he introduced",21
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The honourable member for Indi will withdraw that last comment.,22
16,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES,"I withdraw the last remark. He introduced legislation and said that the tax cuts would be l-a-w. That is all in tatters. I find it absolutely offensive to see the Prime Minister now trotting around Australia getting ready to help celebrate what we are all very keen to celebrate-the culmination of Australia Remembers in August. It will be an occasion when we will all come together and remember the sacrifices that people made. In my family-as I am sure in yours, Mr Deputy Speaker-there is a very proud record of service in the defence of this country. Projecting my mind to August, just a few weeks off, I feel that we are going to see the spectacle of the Prime Minister parading around Australia in a wave of compassion reminding people of how he feels on behalf of Australians about Australia Remembers and the sacrifice Australians made to help make this nation safe. The same man with his other face will be smirking to himself, smiling to himself and reflecting proudly on what he has done, because just two short years before he made the strong commitment and promise-la-w-to Australians that he would look after them and he would ensure that their financial circumstances were protected by a fabric of management of the economy that would not involve the introduction of new taxes. He said he would enshrine tax deductions in l-a-w. Instead of having the guts to face the Australian electorate, as the coalition did in 1993, and sayMr Snowdon-Ha, hal",22
17,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES,"The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training is laughing. The government's arrogance is absolutely extraordinary. Government members thinks that it is funny, a joke, to go around Australia and promise things in an election, to pass a law enshrining promises in legislation and to break them. They think it is good to do that because they think they got away with it. Sure they got a mandate of about 1,500 extra votes and got government in 1993. They think they are going to win the next election by tapping into the reservoir of patriotism and pride that comes from Australia Remembers. That is what they think. I can tell you now that they will fall flat on their face because Australians are not going to let them get away with it. Australians will not see their patriotism and their strong feeling of pride about Australia's commitment to freedom sallied by a politician who is manoeuvring himself into another election campaign. Let me just paint the scenario. The Prime Mini-ter can take half of the Senate and the House of Representatives out after 1 July, and he has until March next year, or a little longer if he stretches the constitution, to have a general election. His plan, in view of the economy, the US markets and the way in which our current account is being treated at the moment, is to have an election when he can divert attention from the economic mismanagement of the nation and before the consequences and the aftermath of the recession are fully embedded into this economy. Mr Snowdon-Ha, hal",22
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The member for the Northern Territory!,23
19,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES,"The parliamentary secretary laughs. I wish I could bottle the parliamentary secretary, take him with me and let the Australian people see him smirking and laughingMr Snowdon-At you?",23
20,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES,Okay. Let us have a debate outside. Let us see whether Australians will laugh at me or at you in this situation.,23
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Order! The member for the Northern Territory and the member for Indi! I have let the member for the Northern Territory go, but that is the last of it.",23
22,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES,"Let us look at this legislation and see what it does? Mr Snowdon-Ha, hal",23
23,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES,"I would like Hansard to note again-I know inaudible things cannot be put into Hansard-that the parliamentary secretary is laughing and smirking at the comments I am making because he thinks it is okay. The standard of government we have is that government members think it is okay to break a promise, to break the law, to pass laws and then turn them around. Members of this government do not understand because they have so clearly lost touch in their quest to hold power at any price, to reward their mates and to keep people with vested interests involved in supporting them. They have lost touch with the ordinary Australian-the battler. As a result, they are quite proud of saying, 'We're bringing in a budget that is going to give a surplus.' In fact, they are selling off the Commonwealth Bank, et cetera in order to get enough capital so they would have a figure, once they put that and their income from revenue together, which is not in red ink. If you went to a bank and said, 'I'm running my business on the basis that my trading figures are not good enough to cover my costs and wages; however, I'm going to sell off the farm, the plant or the factory, and that will give me a surplus and, therefore, I want you to back me for future trading because I am a healthy business,' the bank would say, 'Get out, you've got to be joking.' Mr Duncan-That's exactly what Pacific Dunlop is doing now.",23
24,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES,"It seems as though we have gone through two parliamentary secretaries-we are onto our second one. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General says that is what Pacific Dunlop is doingselling off. Pacific Dunlop is facing up to the fact that it cannot continue to operate in an area as diverse as its business portfolio, and it is rationalising. It is going to use the proceeds from its sale to increase the return to its shareholders. That is what selling off is all about, but not in this case. This government is selling off so it can borrow more, get past Australia Remembers and go to a general election. It is hoping to be re-elected, because God knows what follows after that. What can we expect to follow after we have had budgets of increased taxes, broken words and promises and the law ripped up? The Australian people know very well what they can expect. They can expect more of the same-that is, more of the last 12 years of incompetence and mismanagement, not looking after ordinary people and putting people in a position where this nation is being divided more and more. They are your mates so long as you go along with them. They want to know what they can do for you; they are open for business. But, to anyone who questions or criticises them, watch out, there will be retribution at all costs. These sales tax bills are going to increase the costs of homes, particularly for first home buyers-that is, young families who have already faced the problems of great interest rate rises during the recession; a fall in est rates, which they rejoiced in; and now three interest rate increases in the last 12 months. How long is it since the Prime Minister understood what sort of sacrifice families have to make on their budgets to pay that monthly instalment on their mortgage to their building society or bank? Does the Prime Minister have any idea at all of the budget Australian families have to run today in order to pay their monthly instalments? Clearly, he has not. This government is faced with the problem of a mismanaged economy. When you look at the revenue areas this government has moved in, you see that it has struck a blow against the ordinary, decent family-the battler. Why would you want to increase the impost on ordinary people who are trying and struggling to buy their own homes? They have gone through four or five years of high interest rates and a recession. Many of them lost their jobs and had to fight to get them back. Many of them had to take out second mortgages to pay their instalments while they were looking for jobs. In the last 12 months, we have had three interest rate rises. In connection with the last 12 months, that works out to be an extra payment of up to $200 per month. Have any of you ever thought how hard it is for ordinary families to find an extra $200 per month after tax out of their PAYE wage? Have any of you ever thought how hard it is for small businesses to go to their banks to renegotiate their overdraft, to pay a higher interest in return, so that they can buy some more stock for their shops or factories and perhaps keep their staff on while they hope that their trading figures increase so that they can get over the recession? With that scenario, why the hell would the Prime Minister of Australia increase their home mortgage payments when they have had to cope with all of that. This increase in wholesale sales tax will increase the cost of houses. I thought it was very revealing yesterday to hear the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) and other ministers of this discredited government saying, 'Hang on, this sales tax increase is only about $400.' interThen the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) got up and made a personal explanation, the gist of which was that he was not saying that this increase was going to result in an extra $3,000 in sales tax on houses, but that it might be around $1,500. He is a very honest person, as we all know. According to advice that I have from talking to builders and others, it seems to me that the estimated cost will probably be around $1,000. Some members of the government would say, 'So what, it is only $1,000.' What I say is that we should put it into context with all of the other tax rises over the last two years and we should factor in that the promised reduction in income tax rates is not going to be delivered. If we add that to the fact that there has been an increase in interest rates in the last 12 months and the probable further increase in interest rates at the end of this year or early next year-and that is why the Prime Minister is going to use Australia Remembers to go to an election before thenwhat do we get? We get a disgraceful performance by a government that has had its day. It is time for it to go and, in my view, the election should be called straight away. We should not wait until August or September, let us have it now. If he wants to wait until then, the sooner he calls the election the better because it is time that the government faced the people of Australia.",23
25,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEES,"Mitchell) (10.48 a.m.)The extensions to the wholesale sales tax have taken place during the period that this government has been in office. On this occasion it has occurred after a promise at the 1993 election that there would be no increase in taxes. These increases in the wholesale sales tax should be known as the Keating sales tax, the KST, because they represent a broken promise from a government that knew at the election that it could not maintain the commitments it had made. The Australian people will see and they will know that this government will say anything or do anything to win an election. I have some leaflets from Labor candidates in the last election campaign that contain comments about the goods and services tax. One should note the sheer hypocrisy of those remarks which come from government members who have accepted an extension and increase in the wholesale sales tax-the Keating sales tax. To remind the House and the community exactly what is involved in a wholesale sales tax, I will briefly outline some of the things that are already covered and then illustrate the government's secret agenda of taxing the Australian community without their knowledge. It is only in parliament or in places where there is an interest in tax collection that there is a real understanding of the issues. The community goes blithely on and wonders why it costs more each week to live. A wholesale sales tax is inflationary, complicated and one of the worse ways of collecting revenue. Let us look at the current wholesale sales tax system and the 10 per cent rate of sales taxation. There is a wholesale sales tax on food of course. That will go up in the current budget from 10 per cent to 11 per cent. This tax is on biscuits, snack foods, popping com, chips, muesli bars, health bars, ice cream, ice blocks, fruit juice, fruit juice products, nonalcoholic wines and beverages, cordials and flavoured milk. We have a wholesale sales tax on all these things, and the government will increase the taxation on food. Do not worry about the battlers! Do not worry about the people who are striving to stay alive and retain a semblance of a budget! We are seeing a one per cent increase here. We are seeing an increase from 10 per cent to 11 per cent in this budget. The government will collect 10 per cent more than previously. The government is collecting 10 per cent more from the Australian community through food products and household goods in its grab through the wholesale sales tax. It is a complete disregard and lack of concern for the 'battlers in the Australian community. What home ware products have a wholesale sales tax on them and have been increased now by the Keating sales tax? Home wares include garbage cans and bags, compost bins, brooms, furniture, floor coverings, carpets, rubber, tiles, blinds, screen doors, electrical goods, stoves, dishwashers, airconditioners, toasters, electric jugs and kettles; you name it, there is a 10 per cent tax on it, going to 11 per cent. It is a 10 per cent increase in the government grab from the battlers of Australia. They are replacement articles in a normal home. The very argument that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) used to try to put down the goods and services tax applies ultimately here. He said that those with the least disposable income are those who are going to be paying the most tax. The greatest proportion of their income will go to pay wholesale sales taxes. The argument applies to the goods and services tax in a weird way, if you do not worry about the compensation that was in that package but just worry about the raw tax. What the Keating government has done is take up the very principles it said it would never take up and has applied them to the Australian community. The battlers are paying a greater proportion of their income to the government in a wholesale sales tax. If one looks at the 20 per cent sales tax level-where I would contend there has been a five per cent additional grab by the government in this budget-one finds that it applies to cleaning and chemical agents, such as glues, starches, disinfectants and insecticides. These are products used every day in every household, but the government does not concern itself with the way in which the battlers of Australia spend their money. The government said, 'Here is a chance to tax something. We are going out for a one per cent tax increase' - but this increase in wholesale sales taxes is really a five per cent money grab from the battlers of Australia. It is the Keating sales tax-the KST. There is a one per cent increase on home entertainment, such as colour television sets and video cameras. But the biggest range of products and the greatest percentage increase in government revenue comes from daily-used household products, such as baby baths, cleaning sponges, baby bottles, all the toiletries and fittings in the bathroom, stationery, giftwrapping and ribbons. Even the tax on the dog's blanket is going to be increased. I cannot believe it. The government is going out into the dog kennel and finding things to tax. It is telling us that we are going to have to pay more for our pet dogs. I just cannot believe the way in which this government does things or the sheer hypocrisy and vindictive, hateful nature of the Prime Minister when he comes into the parliament espousing all the best things of Australia and then taxing those people who can afford it least-taxing them, taking a greater proportion of their salary and· making it more and more difficult each week for them to live but saying, 'We have a right to rule because we understand the Australian community.' Well, they do not. I believe that this is a sneaky hidden tax; is an obscene and obscure tax. Nobody knows they are paying it. The government jacks up its share and the prices go up on the products on the shelves-and nobody knows why there has been a price rise. The Australian people should recognise that those price rises, which are occurring right now, are caused by the Australian government-the 1 per cent grab, the five per cent grab and the three per cent grab, just in those areas I have mentioned. On top of that, we have the grab out of the cost of a car-an extra $1,000 for a new motorcar; and, on my estimation, we have approximately $700 to $2,000 on the cost of a new home. These contracts for cars and houses are written and agreed to by the buyer and by the person who is building or supplying the product. Where does the consumer go? The consumer has no alternative but to pay the price, and the person who is selling the product has no alternative but to increase the price to the consumer. Who sits back and cops no flak but, in a sneaky, secret and obscene way, grabs 10, five and three per cent more from all of these important ordinary household items? What is the government doing? Rubbishing the battlers. Not only is this wholesale sales tax a hidden, sneaky tax, but none of the rest of the world will tolerate it. The Keating sales tax that we have here in Australia is not used by other nations. When they have to pay the V AT in London, they hate it because it is upfront. But governments should have to be upfront. They should tell people how much they are collecting. People have a right to know where governments are getting their money from. But not with this government. No, it prefers to keep things secret and hidden. It prefers to do secret deals with the unions and the big bosses-the Murdochs, Bonds, and that mob. It prefers to operate in secret behind closed doors. The taxation system in Australia is an exact reflection of the character of the government: the government takes secret, sneaky decisions, punishing the battlers and those who work and try hardest. Not only is the sales tax, the Keating sales tax, a hidden and sneaky, secret taxation; it is it also inflationary. It works this way, Mr Deputy Speaker-and I know that you are a man who is versed in these things; I have heard many erudite speeches from you on the tax system in Australia and I know that you understand: if a commodity costs $8, for instance, and there is a 20 per cent sales tax ° on it, it rises to $10. So the sales tax component is 20 per cent of the total cost. But that is the wholesale price. The wholesaler then on-sells it to the retailer, who takes it and puts it on his shelf. The product he bought for $10 he has to make a profit on, so he sells it for $15. He makes a profit of 50 per cent. But hidden in the $10 price he has paid is a 20 per cent Keating sales tax. What does he do? He puts his profit on top of a tax; he puts a 50 per cent profit on the 20 per cent sales tax. So instead of the price to me, to you and to the shoppers of Australia-the battlers of Australia-accurately representing a 20 per cent rise, it is much more than that. In the example I have used, a $2 tax that the government receives becomes a $3 cost to the consumer, because there is a profit put on tax. It is a cumbersome, illogical and hopeless way of taxing. I have heard people call the Keating sales tax system a 'ramshackle tax system'. So not only have we a hidden tax but it is building extra costs into our system, and they are costs that Australia does not need at the moment. To give the House some idea about how the government has moved on indirect taxes since it has been in office, I point out that sales tax revenue as part of its whole taxation collection has jumped from around 8.5 per cent in 1983-84 to a projected 11.4 per cent in the coming year. We have seen a big extra grab coming out of these indirect taxes. The Prime Minister proclaimed at the last federal election, 'We are not going to have a consumption tax,' but the government has increased the grab from indirect taxes by 30 per cent in the last three to four years. The government is unashamedly grabbing more from consumers and from sales in a way that it promised it would not. Not only has the government grabbed more; it has not given back as it promised. It has secretly grabbed and has had to admit publicly that the l-a-w tax cuts everybody was promised were not going to be delivered. What government have we, secretly grabbing more and then breaking promises? What it had said it would do, it is no longer going to do. To give an idea of the total tax regime and where the poor old pay-as-you-earn taxpayer, the one who pays every week, stands with this government, in 1983-84 the government collected about $24 billion from individuals. This year the government will collect $55 billion. The collections from all sources, including individuals, have gone up by 240 per cent in a 10-year period-a big spending government. Where is the money going from an increase in total tax grab by 240 per cent and a 30 per cent increase in the grab from sales taxes in just a twoor three-year period? Has anybody seen the benefits in Australia for all this money being collected? We can see some interesting deals being done by the Prime Minister. We can see him flying around the world, criticising German architecture and giving away money here, there and everywhere. But the style of living for Australians has declined. Where has this money gone? There has been a 240 per cent increase in total tax take in the 12-year period the government has been in office, and inflation in that period has gone up by 60 per cent. The tax rises are not just matching a rise in the cost of living; it is far and above that. With all of the splendour he can muster in his office, the Prime Minister proclaims that the government is a thoughtful, caring government-a government of the people. Of course, it is not because it is taking in the form of tax revenue, particularly through the Keating sales tax, from the people who can least afford it. A greater proportion of money is used and consumed by people on low incomes for daily needs. People with lower incomes spend a greater proportion of their income on day-today necessities than those with high incomes. They are the very people who will pay most with the Keating sales tax. I point out to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), who is at the table, and the government that the taxing of a wide range of business inputs makes sales tax an inefficient tax. It also imposes taxes on exports. You would not believe there would be a nation on earth that would actually tax a product before it left its shores to compete in a foreign market. But that is what Australia does. The Prime Minister has exacerbated that and said, 'I will put a Keating sales tax on this, so exports will be even further penalised when we are right in the middle of an export drive.' Where is the logic in that? This is a crazy process. It is a mad way of balancing the budget or running government. As much as nine per cent-an average of five per cent-sales tax is imposed on our exports.",24
26,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,Twelve per cent in indirect taxes.,27
27,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEES,"Yes, I know. The member is right. We have a tax system that penalises extra Australian exports. We rely too heavily on personal income tax. Nobody else anywhere in the world relies as heavily as we do on personal income tax. It is a punishment against incentive. It is a punishment for hard work. It is a punishment against thrift. It is punishment against anybody who wants to get anywhere. The Prime Minister does not seem to worry about that. It is very interesting that most of our competitors use different forms of taxes and tax more broadly than we do and they seem to do better. But, no, that is not for the Prime Minister. We are going to tax the battlers and we are going to do well by taxing the battlers and our exports. This is where he wants Australia to go-tax the battler, tax exports and Australia is sure to do well as long as we keep trusting him. A streamlining of sales tax was undertaken in 1992 and it really did suit the tax office admirably, but it suited few other people and the business community at large, as all of the simplification processes this government enters into finish up becoming more complicated or, at best, remain the same. So the sales tax simplification program of 1992 has basically failed and taxpayers have received little advantage from it. I believe there is a wide range of issues associated with the liability for tax. The main liability is on a day-today trade basis. That is where the wholesale sales tax falls down. It is complicated. It is inflationary. It increases the price of goods to the consumer beyond the cost of the tax. It is complex. It is hidden. It is ramshackle and it is not an easy way to balance the budget, but we are going to do it. Prices will rise. Battlers will pay more. And the government remains unconcerned. The Prime Minister will continue living at and refurbishing the Lodge and buying new cars and the rest of Australia will continue to pay for it. Sales tax has risen 30 per cent since the last election. Personal income tax for individuals has risen by 240 per cent over the life of this government. Yet there has only been an increase in inflation of 60 per cent, but Australians are asked to keep copping it. Australians have had enough of that, especially the battlers. If anybody is sick of the Prime Minister and his antics it is the bloke in the blue singlet. Those people have had it. They know they cannot work any harder. They know there are no more jobs out there. They know their teenagers are not going to get jobs when they leave school. They are the ones who are going to desert the Labor Party and the Prime Minister. The Keating sales tax is going to be one bf the things thatwill bring him dbwn because this is the very thing that he promised not to do.",27
28,Mr REID,COMMITTEES,"I welcome the opportunity to speak in the cognate debate on the sales tax bills. I want to note a couple of things in these bills: there is an increase in the sales tax payable on passenger motor vehicles from 16 per cent to 21 per cent, there is a modification of the sales tax law to remove the exemption for a range of building materials which will now become taxable at the rate of 12 per cent, and there is a series of other tax increases. I want to go back to the One Nation statement that was made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 26 February 1992. In the ministerial statement, the Prime Minister stood at the dispatch box and had this to say to this place and the people of Australia about motor vehicles: From tomorrow the sales tax on new cars currently subject to the 20 per cent rate will be permanently lowered ... That was his statement on 26 February 1992. I indicate to the House that the coalition will vote against, will oppose, those increases in sales tax on building products and on cars. Alsoin November of 1992 the Prime Minister said clearly in words which one can hardly put a different meaning on: What I am promising is not to put up tax. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), who is the minister responsible for housing, on 5 May rejected categorically any tax increases on the housing industry. The minister responsible for housing rejected it out of hand. He said, 'No. There will be no increase.' What do we find? We have a 12 per cent increase. The then Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, on 30 April 1992 said: No sales tax on the building industry. What do we find? We have three of the most senior people in the government in November of 1992 making promises which they have now broken to the Australian community-the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the then Treasurer. Who are the Australian community to believe? This will lead some massive changes in the building indusis try and will affect a lot of young people others trying to get into homes. It has been said that there are only four major essentials in life: air, water, food and shelter. The family home is the great Australian dream. What has the government done to it? Mr Deputy Speaker Snow, you know that figure so wrong? in your area, the marginal seat of Eden Monaro, you are under pressure. The battlers in your area are coming to you, no doubt, and saying, 'Look what they have done to the cost of my home.' You know how difficult it for young people to get into a home. Even they can get into a home, the minimum cost of most homes is $95,000 to $100,000 and as having said: they have to borrow most of that. Interest rates at the moment might be stabilising little. Who knows? It could is allover the place. Even if interest rates do come down, what you have done and what the government has Treasury done is to take away any advantage stabilisation of those interest rates by increasing the cost of that home. There seems to be quite an amount of debate. When the Treasurer (Mr Willis) made his statement on budget night here in the House he said, 'It is only going to be about $300 or $400 on the cost of a home.' Now there are admissions from all sorts of people that it may be $300, it may $800, it may be $1,000, it may be $1,500, may be $2,000. How can you be so wrong? We had Senator Cook, representing the Treasurer in the other place, saying that the tax rise would be between $500 and $800. Then the Minister for Small Business, Cusindustry toms and Construction (Senator Schacht) stated a different figure. He said it could increase the cost of a home by $1,000 or more. Then we get the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) speaking to the backbenchers. No wonder the backbenchers are jittery. They on the phones to their electorates trying to pacify new home builders and home renovators. That is why they are not in the House. The House is empty, apart from one parliamentary secretary who is in a safe seat. Mr Deputy Speaker, you can feel the to pressure in your electorate. You know what happening. You know where the pressure and is. This morning the Treasurer, who stood at .that dispatch box right there and told us it would be $300 or $400, has now admitted that it will be $1,000",28
29,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"More than $1,000.",29
30,Mr REID,COMMITTEES,Or more. How can you get that Mr Truss-Harry Woods was right.,29
31,Mr REID,COMMITTEES,"Obviously. I will just pick up a copy of the article which appeared in the is Daily Examiner-I presume that is further if north than Bendigo. The article reports the federal member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) ... that some home builders had been advising of a increases of more than $3000 on a home worth be up or down; it about $75,000They have not even got up to the $100,000 home. The member for Page then said: Figures from the Home Building Industry and officials suggest it should be less than half from the that amount . . . He is now saying it will be about $1,500Mr Truss-On a $75,000 home.",29
32,Mr REID,COMMITTEES,"On a $75,000 home. What is the real figure? The government has absolutely no understanding of this. It said that the 12 per cent sales tax on building products would be bring in an estimated revenue of about $215 it million-I think that was the figure it quoted-if the sales tax on an average home was about $400. It seems to me that the government has badly underestimated this. The housing understands what it is about. It understands that it will be more than that. What will happen if the sales tax is $800, $1,200 or $1,500? It is just like the fringe benefits tax. The government underestimated the receipts from the fringe benefits tax. This are is another indication of how wrong the government has got it. It has absolutely no idea. If sales tax goes up to some $1,200 per house, the government will rip off the battlers, young people trying to get a home, to the extent of $645 million per year. The members for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) and Moore (Mr Filing) both know that. They would be feeling the pressure in their electorates too. who are concerned about this tax would be ringing up and asking, 'How am I going get into a home?' There are a number of ways that people get into a home. They can buy an older home at a cheaper price and then renovate it. But what does the government do? It hits them with sales tax on all the renovations as well. So people cannot even get a start in the housing market with an older home. are fortunate enough, if they have been prudent and saved enough for a deposit on a new house, they will be hit again-not by $300 or $400; it could be up to $2,000. The Housing Industry Association gave this sales tax increase a fairly quick appraisal the Age of 11 May just after the budget. In the article Mr Les Groves, a respected chief executive officer of the Housing Industry home. Association of Victoria, said that it is likely to cost an additional $1,OOO-and that is just the starting point for a new home. He said: ""If you get a $6000 kitchen, which is not usual, you'll have $720 of tax on it"" ... That is fine, but what about the kitchen, the vanity units, the laundry cupboards and all the plumbing fittings-a whole range of things? When you build a house, all you get is a shell on a concrete slab with a few bricks around it and a roof on top. It is what you put into the home that makes the price and to the quality of the home. They are the very items that the government has attacked with this 12 per cent sales tax. When you build a home, you are really dealing with a shell. You put up four walls a slab, put a roof on it and you have got a home. Where the money really comes into is when you start talking about doing kitchen, bathroom and laundry. The governSpeaker, ment could not even leave ceramic tiles alone; it put a tax on them as well. You cannot build a modern home now without putting in ceramic tiles or cupboards. I have spoken to people in joinery firms in my electorate and they inform me that it is better to build cupboards in a joinery plant, then take them on site and install them in the home. That way you get a better job and a better finish. The government has put a 12 per People cent tax on cupboards as well. There are all of those items-the fitting out to items. You cannot hold the roof on without nails, screws and adhesives, and the governcan ment has even put a tax on them as well. There is all of the joinery in the kitchen, as well as the tiles, the plumbing fittings, the vanity units and the storage cupboards, and then if you want to put a decent finish on your house it will cost you more for the paint If they and wallpaper to decorate it. The government realised this, and it has tried to conceal the real cost to the Australian people. Fancy the Treasurer of this nation saying it would only cost $300 or $400, when everyone in the building industry knows that in it will cost far more than that. Once again we see the government misleading young Australian people who are trying to build their own The Housing Industry Association has said that this has happened at probably one of the worse times for home builders because of the unlow activity in the industry. Industry activity is falling rapidly, registrations with the housing guarantee fund being 30 per cent lower in of April this year than the same time last year, falling from 2,118 to 1,504, according to Mr Les Groves. So interest rates have caught up with people and they are not building homes. Mr Truss-This is their way of encouragdifference to the ing building.",29
33,Mr REID,COMMITTEES,"As the honourable member for Wide Bay says, it is the government's way of encouraging building-put the price up, tax everything and do not give people any enon couragement. We can see that the housing industry is already having difficulties, and that it is being demonstrated right throughout my the electorate. I can assure you, Mr Deputy that, when the Prime Minister made that response in the House when he was asked a question about building contractors being locked into fixed price contracts and he treated them with absolute scorn, saying that it was nothing and it was only going to cost $300 or $400, I was extremely angry. In fact, it led to my having a spell from this House for an hour. I can say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that my anger was a reflection of the thoughts of people in my electorate. They are concerned about this-and I know that you will understand this point and that is why I am addressing my remarks through the chair. In your area and ill my area there are many people on low incomes. They are struggling. For example, all of the rural community in my area has just come through what has probably been the worse drought in our history. I would have thought there would be some support for them from this government, but there has not been one dollar in drought aid for all of those people-not one dollar. That impact on the rural community flows into the city of Bendigo, and the flowing through of this lower economic activity in the rural sector is a major blow to a place like Bendigo. There is now a further major blow to people in that electorate-people who are trying to build a home, trying to get themselves established. The government has further dampened their opportunity to get a home for themselves. Does the government want to keep them in rental accommodation? Does it not want young people to get a home? One has to ask this question, and I can assure the House that people in my electorate are asking it. Another aspect of the changes in sales tax in the building industry is the move by the government to embrace small contractors who operate as individuals in a building-type industry. They might be tilers who work as individual contractors, they might be concreters, or they might be carpet layers. The government and the tax office are putting pressure on them to come in under the pay-asyou-earn tax system. These people are individual contractors. They work for a whole host of builders. Let us take tilers as an example. They would work for a whole host of building firms and would do subcontract work for builders on a number of different homes. They operate their own vehicles. They operate totally as a sole contractor or an independent contractor. All the time there is pressure on them by the government. The government is instructing the tax office to gather as many of these people as it possibly can into the pay-as-youearn system. That is happening. Let me instance also the position with respect to a carpet layer. After the home is constructed he lays the carpet. He has pressure on him from the government, through the tax office saying that he is not an independent contractor. He does contract jobs for eight or nine different carpet suppliers. He operates his own vehicle. He operates as a separate business or individual entity. He contracts to lay carpets in homes. Now he is under pressure by the government to come in under the payas-you-earn tax system. He would lose all the operating costs associated with his motor vehicle. The pressure is there. I have had case examples of guys who started in the field as independent contractors. In its quest for extra dollars, the government is putting pressure on them to be taken in under the pay-as-you-earn tax system. I believe it is time for the government to come out and clearly state exactly how much money is involved in this sales tax on building products. It has deceived the parliament, the community and the people in my electorate. There is absolutely no explanation why the Treasurer can go from saying at the dispatch box that the extra cost was $300 to $400 to saying in the Australian today, 'I am sorry, it is going to be $1,000.' That is the increase on a low cost home. What is it going to cost anyone who builds a home costing $150,000, which seems to be about the average price of a new home that is fitted out properly? What is it going to cost? What revenue will come into the federal government's coffers? It is time the government answered the questions. (Time expired)",30
34,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"I rise to speak on this legislation which is another example of how this budget has increased the tax take from ordinary Australians. We should be reflecting now on the last federal election and on the deceit that was used by the federal Labor government to get itself re-elected at the time. We should cast our memories back to some of the things that the government was saying then about sales tax and the prospects of the implementation of a goods and services tax and the like. Here we have basically a goods and services tax on people's homes. There are no two ways about that. This is not a widespread reform of taxation to allow people to have tax cuts to be able to make a choice at the election. It is a straight out slug, an increase in the tax take, as part of the 1995-96 budgetary measures. I want to make a few observations about the general increase in tax take from ordinary Australians because it is pertinent to this legislation. I am indebted to my colleague the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), the Second Deputy Speaker, who has made a fine contribution to this House. I believe he will continue to make a fine contribution to this House after the next federal election, notwithstanding the fact that his preselection was taken away by the Senator' CrichtonBrowne faction in the Liberal Party. Mr Duncan-Can you tell us a bit more about that?",31
35,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"You would probably say it is irrelevant. It is amazing how the relevancy rule is stretched a little when it suits those opposite. The honourable member for Curtin has made a tremendous contribution in taxation legislation debates and always makes what I consider to be detailed contributions in making sure that the public is fully aware of exactly how much money is being ripped off them by the Keating Labor government. He has pointed out that the total tax take. since 1983 has risen by 190 per cent under Labor. This is made up of individual tax rising by 136.8 per cent, total company tax rising by a massive 370 per cent, total indirect tax by 149.8 per cent and sales tax by 305.7 per cent-making up for a total increase in tax revenue of 189.8 per cent, which is close to 190 per cent. We are constantly being told by the Labor Party that we are blessed to live in a country that is a low taxing country. Yet, quite frankly, nowadays very few people in this country believe that particular statistic that is bandied about continuously by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) every time there is a taxation debate in this place and elsewhere. One thing of interest-because it is going to come down to these sales tax changes-is the very high level of compliance costs that are foisted on taxpayers within Australia. In fact, we are probably at the top of the compliance cost tables of the industrialised nations of the world. Probably only the United States outstrips Australia as having higher compliance costs or compliance costs that are anywhere near as high as those in this country. Let me tum now to the sales tax increases that have slugged what we consider to be the battlers of Australia. I represent an outer suburban mortgage belt seat. My electorate contains the city' of Wanneroo. The city of Wanneroo is now the fastest growing municipality in the country. It recently tipped the shire of Albert in the' home state of the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). As far as growth, demand and the infrastructure requirements of what we consider to be average Australians are concerned, the city of Wanneroo is at the grinding edge. Why is this so? Let us look at the key elements of this budget, focusing on, in particular, the sales tax changes which we are specifically debating today . We have seen an increase in the Medicare levy. That will obviously hit those-those whom we consider to be the average Australians-on PAYE tax pay arrangements. It will particularly hit those people in my electorate because I have a large number of people with dual incomes coming into the household. I might say that dual incomes are not some sort of luxurious arrangements. Dual incomes are required in households to be able to service the high mortgages, particularly since the increase in interest rates in recent times, and there will now be more pressure on them because of the changes to the sales tax arrangements. So many people are going to find themselves paying more not only because of the increase in the Medicare levy but also because there are two incomes r coming into a household. The second aspect has been the change to the sales tax arrangements on passenger motor vehicles. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you. would know, many> families rely heavily on the motor vehicle. Whatever we might say about public transport systems, particularly in metropolitan areas, there is no doubt that many require a motor vehicle in order to go to and come home from work-in other words, to be able to derive an income so they can pay for all the things they need to pay for, ,such as shelter and food for their families. Because my constituents live in the fastest growing area in Australia and because we are at the northern end of the urban sprawl in the Perth metropolitan area, quite naturally my constituents rely very heavily on either public transport or a motor vehicle to travel to work. Those who know the Perth metropolitan area will know that it is a very large area. I think it is not much smaller than the Sydney metropolitan area in its total distances between the extremities. In the northern. extremity of the Perth - etropolitan area we have a situation where, notwithstanding the fact that there have been some improvements in public transport, the majority of people work out of the area-many of them work in the city centre-and, therefore, are forced to rely very heavily on their own resources to provide their own transport to get back and forth to work. That means that the increase in sales tax on passenger motor vehicles is going to hit them hard. One might argue that many of them probably buy second-hand motor vehicles. That is probably true. Many of the houses in my electorate need two motor vehicles, because often there are two people in the household who need to go backwards and forwards to their place of employment. Therefore, this tax hits them twice as hard. Clearly, anybody who argues that this would not have any carry-on or pass-on effect to second-hand passenger motor vehicles is being less than truthful. Quite clearly, we all know that, with an increase in the price of new motor vehicles, the price of second-hand motor vehicles rises accordingly. It is a well known market effect. It is quite logical and understandable. This means, notwithstanding the increases in fuel, the increases in stamp duty and all the other increases that have been: foisted on ordinary household expenditure, we have yet another increase-the passenger motor vehicles sales tax increase-that will slug those who can least afford it. It is very timely that the member for Canning, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), is in the chamber because he also represents one of the fastest growing electorates in Western Australia. His electorate of Canning is another electorate that contains new urban sprawlnew suburbs, new developing areas and new homes-and the people who live there have to rely on their own passenger motor vehicles to get backwards and forwards to work. I ask the member for Canning: how can he justify to his constituents the enormous increases that he has foisted on to them when they can least afford it and when they have been hit in recent times by increases in the interest rates applicable on their homes? In Western Australia we have already seen - substantial decline in housing starts. It is quite clear that this decline has been caused by the increase in on-costs, by a combination of government charges and' federal government taxes. The statistics for 1993-94 show that there were 24,800 housing starts and, for 1994-95, 22,000. But, for 1995-96, only 18,000 housing starts are predicted. In my case, many of those starts will be in the city of Wanneroo-the fastest growing area, as I have mentioned, in the country. The member for Canning, the Assistant Treasurer, who is sitting"" at the table, would know this because he has a similar electorate to mine with a lot of developing areas and a lot of new home starts. The Assistant Treasurer would know that he has had foisted on him, at a time when he is up against it to win his seat, increases that are going to cause his constituents to think twice and very seriously about ever voting for him again. One could argue that he ought to have had a more substantial voice in the cabinet room and put what was a quite clear, commonsensical case against the imposition of the wholesale sales tax on these various building products. Let us put the case for the building industry. The building industry is a very substantial employer around the country, particularly in the Perth metropolitan area. One can question why the home building industry has been slugged again. It already pays its fair share of tax--,-$260 million was collected in 1992-93 from wholesale sales tax imposed on building materials. Home owners pay stamp duty and developers and builders are required to pay developer contributions on top of that. The other argument is that somehow this imposition of a wholesale sales tax increase on these building materials can be viewed in isolation, that it is somehow just another little charge that will slip in there and people will not notice. That is another furphy, another deliberate untruth, being mooted by this Labor government, which has been desperate to increase revenue just before the federal election. Quite clearly you should see these cost increases on top of the others that I have already mentioned, one of which is the recent increase to housing interest rates which has slugged home buyers across the board. It also should be seen on top of new statutory requirements for fire protection and insulation improvements within homes; and also new termite protection measures that are applicable from 1 July 1995. If you look at it in the context of all these other increases and charges, you can see quite clearly that the poor old home buyer-the person who used to have the great Australian dream of buying a new home, moving their family in and starting their lives in a new home-is going to be harder hit. In relation to the interest rate fluctuations, we have seen a slight dip but I believe that is only the calm before the storm-we are going to see more interest rate rises. Those people who will be hit are those who can least afford it-the home buyers. The new building tax is not quarantined. The tax base will be widened in following years to other building materials, systems and products, and the tax rate will increase from this 12 per cent GST to 22 per cent. Bearing in mind that a large number of building material products already attract the 21 per cent sales tax rate, from 1 July they are going to attract a 22 per cent sales tax. So there is another one per cent increase in sales tax. Quite clearly this is another oncost, and it can be seen as being a lessening of this government's commitment to the concept of home ownership within Australia. I came to this country in 1971 from the UK. One of the things that have appealed to me as a new Australian has been that in Australia there is a very strong commitment to personal home ownership. It is one of the great institutions in the Australian society that there is this great commitment on the part of Australians to home ownership. Why is that a good thing? Because it improves our communities to the extent that people obviously see they have a further commitment through their home ownership to their communities. This also provides a greater sense of community in areas that are fast developing, in areas that are new and, in the case of my electorate, in areas that until recently were urban bushland or undeveloped. It is important that we develop a sense of community, a sense of belonging, as soon as possible in these new communities principally to provide the sort of lifestyle that most Australians consider to be valuable or invaluable to their function of raising a family and being good Australian citizens. The government is working against the commitment to home ownership. There is an overwhelming plan, a long-term objective, in this government's philosophy to destroy the concept of home ownership. That is anathema to the social engineers in the Labor government, those on the left and elsewhere, who believe that home ownership lessens the control of the state vis-a-vis the individual and that the abolition of home ownership is one of the major steps towards making our society a more collective society dominated by government and dominated by the fief of the fiefdoms of individual ministers and cabinet decisions. In order to implement these taxes, this government has also made it more difficult for people to pay their taxes. We have already seen-and we are indebted to Senator Baume-that you would get a gold medal for jumping over the income tax legislation at the Olympics. That is how high it is when you pile income tax book on top of income tax book, full of the legislation, regulations and decisions. It makes for a situation where individual taxpayers just do not understand the taxation system. How could they possibly understand it? It is hard enough for professional taxation accountants to understand the taxation legislation. Yet, here we have another situation where the administration is going to be more complicated. It is going to be a nightmare for building operators, particularly for those who are working on government housing projects which are exempt and for those who may be working on private sector projects at the same time. There will be another added cost to the construction of homes because building companies are going to have to put on more accountants and more administrators to be able to work out the complexities of the sales tax administration. Small shops will bypass the kitchen and bathroom requirements because they will not be caught up in the system. We will see the situation where merchants will not give builders a breakdown of sales tax because it will disclose their buying prices. Many of them would not be anxious to do that. I will make another observation. Those who have taken an interest in the subject of home ownership and home construction would know that homes are often built by quite large project builders. Those builders would perhaps have several hundred home starts in a particular municipality or city. There are some large builders in Western Australia who would be building a large number of homes at anyone time. Many builders are down to a fraction of their margins for the construction of homes. We have seen builders go out of business because of the competitive nature of the industry.",32
36,Mr GEAR,COMMITTEES,Some are starting stevedoring businesses.,35
37,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"The Assistant Treasurer lives in a marginal, mortgage belt electorate. He will lose his seat because of these types of changes. He will find that his constituents have worked out the fact that they will be paying more and more. Many of these homes have prefabricated components that are brought in and installed in the kitchens, bathrooms and elsewhere. These components include cabinets and commodes. They are the sorts of things that are part and parcel of a standard, modem day kitchen or bathroom. These components are constructed in factories. That means that the sales tax that is being levied on these products for the first time as of 1 July 1995 will be applied to the labour element that has been used in the prefabrication of those components in the factories. This is the first time we have seen the application of a GST on the labour used to construct these components. To say that there will be an additional cost of $1,000 on the average home is an understatement. I believe it will be much more. It will be a huge added cost to my constituents and on behalf of my constituents, and in particular the new home buyers and those relying on motor vehicles to get backwards and forwards to work or their other activities, I urge the government to change before it is too late and withdraw this legislation that is an iniquitous attack on those who can least afford it, the large Australian family.",35
38,Mr GEAR,COMMITTEES,"in reply-I thank all those who have participated in the debate on the sales tax bills. I have just witnessed the dying minutes of the speech of the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). I think it encapsulates the sorts of arguments we have heard from the opposition about the sales tax bills that result from the budget. The budget was aimed at making sure that we have a sustainable recovery in this country, that we put in place what we can to make sure that interest rates stay down and that we continue our excellent record on jobs growth into the future. I know that a few members opposite have made the claim-and I think the member who is leaving the chamber made this claim-that this is a GST by stealth. Nothing could be further from the truth. What we are talking about is the wholesale sales tax system. It has will nothing to do with a GST. When talking about the GST, we all remember that it was the honourable member for Moore-the member who was just talking about home buyers and the moves in this budget which are very modest indeed in terms of their impact on housing costs-that would have put a 15 per cent GST on everything that went into a house. That is the policy that those opposite went to the last election with. The opposition said that it was not only the goods we are taxing in this budget but also the labour that goes into it. That is what· the goods and services tax is all about: it is about taxing labour. There is nothing in these bills that even suggests that that would be the case. What I am saying to honourable members opposite is that, when you talk about GST by stealth, you are really showing your ignorance on this matter, because what we are talking about here is the wholesale sales tax system. Mr Truss-You are taxing labour.",35
39,Mr GEAR,COMMITTEES,We are not taxing labour at all. Mr Truss-You are taxing labour on these kitchens.,36
40,Mr GEAR,COMMITTEES,"Here is the argument again: we are taxing labour on kitchens. We are not taxing labour on kitchens. What we are taxing is the inputs-that is, the hardware that goes into the kitchens-not the labour that goes into them. Why would the honourable member show his ignorance in this way by interjecting? In the end, we are talking about changes to the wholesale sales tax system. Not only would members opposite put a GST on all home building materials, they would put it on everything else, including the electricity and water account. There would have been a 15 per cent tax on everything that a home buyer buys to go into a house: that is from the opposition's proposals at the last election. Nothing like that has happened under this government. We have a tax system that is so fair that even the opposition is talking about not changing it when it gets into government. How about that for an endorsement of this government's taxation policies? Mr Truss-That's a joke.",36
41,Mr GEAR,COMMITTEES,That is what opposition members are saying. They are not going to introduce any new taxes or change the rates. How can they say that we have an unfair tax system if they are not going to change it? Mr Truss-Wait and see.,36
42,Mr GEAR,COMMITTEES,"Wait and see? This is not a policy we are hearing, is it? This is. not the start of li policy on taxation! We would never know what oppositiqn members are going to do, but we do know what they are not going to do. Maybe we are seeing a few cracks in this situation, because the opposition says it has not got a tax policy at all. What we are talking about is making sure, as I say, that we keep interest rates down. Since the budget,. I think opposition members would have to agree-if they were objective about this and had a look at the news reports and commentary that have come out, typically from institutions like Moody's-that there has been a downward pressure on interest rates. When we tbjnk about home buyers,· we have to think about the main cost of buying a home-that is, servicing the loan. It is the case at present that home loan interest rates are around 9Vz to lOVz per cent-way below what they were all the way through the 1980s, and a lot less than what they were when the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer. At that time, it was very difficult in that regulated environment to even get a loan. I can remember in 1982 and 1983 when, to get a loan from a bank, you would have had to have been with the bank from birth -:and then you would not be given all your loan. The bank would give you what was known in those days as a 'shandy'-that is, you would get about half your loan from the bank at the regulated rate and then be flipped over to the bank's finance company, where sometimes the rates were 18 to 20 per cent, to get the other halfof the loan. When we think about home buyers in 1995 and compare them with those in 1982 or 1983 when the Leader of the Opposition was the Treasurer, we find that today's home buyers are light years ahead. Home buyers in 1995 can actually afford to service the loan. The best part about it is that there are more of them. There are an extra two million jobs flowing from the policies of this government. It was a responsible budget, and the bills that we are debating today are an integral part of that budget and have been well received. Nobody in government likes putting taxes on items or increasing taxes on items but, from time to time, these things are necessary. Nobody complained when we slashed tariffs and wore that on the budget. If we had kept tariffs where they were, we would have had an extra $9 billion coming to the federal government. But the community has benefited from the $9,000 million that the government will not collect this year because we have cut tariffs. That is a direct benefit to consumers. Not only that: because we have lowered tariffs, we have a much more competitive, industrial structure in Australia today, an industrial structure that is up there with the best in the world. We are exporting things in 1995 that we could have only dreamed of in 1983: That has come about because we have lowered tariffs and forced Australian industry to compete. We have also given the industry decent policies to do it with. The budget this year, of which the tax bills form an integral part, plays a very important part in making sure that we keep inflation down and that we repair one of our major problems - that is, national savings. It also puts downward pressure on interest rates. We have done everything we can in this budget to ensure that Australia gets the best chance it can with which to move into the future, and these bills are a part of that. I commend the bills to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Clauses 1 to 7-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Schedule 1.",36
43,Mr ANDREWS,COMMITTEES,"I move: (1) Schedule 1, page 8, omit items 7 and 8. This part of the schedule relates to those provisions in the bill which provide for the increase in sales tax on cars. As I indicated the second reading debate, that is something which the coalition will vote against. We do that for one simple reason: that the measure the government is proposing today constitutes a direct reversal of that which was said in place at that dispatch box by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his One Nation statement on 26 February 1992. I remind the House briefly of what was said by the Prime Minister then: From tomorrow the sales tax on new cars currently subject to the 20 per cent rate will be permanently lowered to 15 per cent-a saving on a new Commodore or Falcon of around $800. Of course, he elaborated on that-and the point is still relevant today-by saying: With cheaper cars we' will drive newer cars, which is good for the environment, good for road safety, and good for one of our most important industries. There could never in this place be an example of a more clear, unambiguous statement about what the government's intention was prior to the 1993 election; namely, that it would permanently-not temporarily, not for a period of a year, not for a period of a number of years-lower the sales tax on motor vehicles in this country. Yet here we are in' this budget and in this particular sales tax bill with a measure which again raises the sales tax on cars. What we have, in effect, is a mechanism for use by the Prime Minister and the government. It was convenient for them prior to the last election, for electoral purposes, to reduce the sales tax on cars; to say simply, 'We are doing something about bringing down costs on ordinary everyday goods for ordinary Australians; we are going to bring them down to 15 per cent.' However, now that the election is over, it is convenient to tum around and say, 'Well, we're going to put it up again.' What this illustrates once again is that, when words like 'permanent' are used by the Prime Minister, they mean exactly the opposite· if he wishes them to-namely, 'temporary'. When he comes into this place or goes to the National Press Club and says, 'I'm not just making a promise to the people of Australia, I'm in fact legislating in l-a-w, in law,' then you can bet your life that it will not mean l-a-wbut the opposite. So we have seen in this bill, and in relation to this particular measure, the total reversal of that which was promised in this place, as I said, this on 26 February 1992. Further words will not add to that argument. As I have indicated, we are therefore moving that those items be omitted from the schedule. Question put: That the amendment (Mr Andrews's) be agreed to.

44,Mr ANDREWS,PAIRS,"Menzies) (12.11 p.m.) I move: (2) Schedule 2, page 9, omit items I-II. In schedule 2 as it stands in the bill at present, are items 1 to 19, all of which deal with the proposal by the government in this legislation to increase from currently no sales tax on a range of building materials to 12 per cent on these items. It is divided into two sections so that the honourable"" member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) can move an amendment, in effect, to introduce item IIA of that schedule. The reason why the coalition is moving to delete these items is that this again constitutes an act of electoral fraud on the part of the government to introduce against all the indications whkh it gave in this place and elsewhere prior to the last election any taxation on building materials and like matters. If one goes back into Hansard and looks at, for example, the reply of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) on 5 May 1992 and the reply to a question from the opposition by the then Treasurer Mr Dawkins on 30 April 1992, one finds that there was a clear categorical rejection by the government then that it would tax in any way the building industry and building materials. But, now the election is over, it is convenient for the government to come in here and impose its GST on building materials. On the list of items covered by this amendment one sees things ranging from plaster and the materials that go into plaster to every nail, nut, washer and bolt that goes into a building, to every piece of glue or issue of glue used to screw materials together through to taps and nozzles and showerheads. They are all going to be taxed at 12 per cent under this item. In addition, when you have cupboards or a kitchen manufactured and brought into the house or you buy a new vanity unit for your bathroom then that too will be taxed at 12 per cent. This is coming from the government that campaigned across the length and breadth of this nation prior to the 1993 election saying, 'We will not have a sales tax on these sorts of items.' Every Australian can remember the advertisement prior to the last election with the cash register ringing up 15 per cent and the government saying that we were going to do it. You were saying, 'No. We don't need it. We are not going to do it.' Yet here, in the life of the parliament in which the Labor Party was elected, it is doing the precise thing which it said it would not do; namely, it is adding a sales tax to these items. The moral of this story is the same as for the previous amendment which we voted on. The moral is that the words that come from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of this nation can no longer be believed. The Prime Minister said, 'We will permanently reduce the sales tax on cars.' Yet we find that that has only been a temporary measure. So the word 'permanent' is meaningless in the dictionary of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister went to the National Press Club and said that not only was he going to make a promise-implied in that was that he believed that no-one would understand or accept his promise-but 'These are l-a-w, law, tax cuts.' What has the Prime Minister now done? He has increased tax. So not only is a promise from the Prime Minister unbelievable; when he says, 'I am going to legislate as well,' that is also unbelievable. In relation to this particular item, promises from the Prime Minister and from this government such as, 'We're not going to introduce sales tax; we're not going to push up the prices for ordinary Australians on things like their cars and their homes,' are simply meaningless. I say to the people of Australia: anything that is said by the man who stands at this dispatch box-when he bothers to come in here-is simply meaningless. Any word that he gives cannot be taken on face value. In fact, if you were wise, you would say that we will trust the opposite of what he says rather than what he actually says. For those reasons, we will vote for this amendment.",38
45,Mr REID,PAIRS,I noted that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) was in the chamber but has disappeared briefly,39
46,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,He's very busy.,39
47,Mr REID,PAIRS,"I understand that he is busy. But what I wanted to get was a response from the Treasurer regarding his admission that the revenue raised from the additional sales taxes included in this schedule-which he first made note of at the dispatch box on budget night-would be $215 million. He has now admitted that the likely sales tax on all of those products on an average home would be as high as $1,000. There has been no response from the government on what additional revenue this would raise. Obviously, the figures in the 1995-96 budget are incorrect. The government has cooked the books because the budget states a particular figure of $215 million based on sales tax of $300 to $400 on these items. I understand that some. of the colleagues of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in the Senate have admitted that the figure could be $800 or $1,000 and that one of your own colleagues in this chamber has said that it could be $1,500Mr Ronaldson-Minimum.",39
48,Mr REID,PAIRS,"Minimum. I want to know from the government: is that figure of $215 million in the budget papers correct or not? If it is not correct, we want to know how much will be raised and how you arrived at that figure of whatever it might be-whether it is $645 million or $800 million. It is like the fringe benefits tax. When that went through the House, we were told that it would be only a small amount. We then found out that the figure ballooned out to a huge amount of money. It is appropriate for the Assistant Treasurer to respond by telling us what those taxes. in this schedule will raise and whether or not the budget figures are incorrect.",40
49,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,"1 will respond to the questions put by the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). We stand by our figures in the budget. The amount stated in the budget will be raised. We do not resile from that. On the other matter about the impact on houses: obviously, as you would know, the more expensive the house, the more tax will be raised from it. There is nothing new about that. That has been the same throughout the tax system ever since we brought it in. The amount that will be raised on a modest house, as the Treasurer (Mr Willis) has rightly pointed out, will be about $400. The tax may rise up to about $1,000 for a more substantial house. As for the amount of $2,500 claimed by the opposition, you would have to build a mansion for it to be that amount. The central question by the honourable member was: do we stand by our figures in the budget? Yes, we do.",40
50,Mr TRUSS,PAIRS,"I was somewhat amazed by the answer just given by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) and by his response when summing up the debate that this tax was necessary to sustain the recovery. What an extraordinary attitude the government takes to taxes. It finds the most intellectually amazing reasons to justify higher taxes. How on earth can you sustain a recovery by increasing taxes? This tax is going to hit the battler and the young family trying to get a start in life by building their first home. One would have thought that, if the housing industry was booming, governments might be looking at ways to raise revenue from a booming industry. The housing industry is experiencing one of its most difficult times. The government's response to the difficult times in the housing industry is to make houses more expensive and, therefore, to guarantee that the industry will go through more times of difficulty. My electorate has the lowest average income of any electorate in Australia. We are the epicentre of the battlers, a place where it is difficult for people to get established in life and to make ends meet. Hervey Bay is one of the fastest growing cities in Australia, but the most significant industry in that city has been building. Now that essential element of the region's economy is to be slugged with a tax on its basic elements. I was interested to hear the Assistant Treasurer suggest that this tax is not going to affect the cost of a basic house, only the little bits and pieces you put into the house. What a load of nonsense. True, it does not actually affect the iron that goes on the roof, but how are you going to attach the roof to the house? With taxed nails or taxed screws. How are you going to affix the walls? With taxed screws and taxed nails. This tax applies to every element of the building of houses. 'It is only going to be $300 a house,' we were told on budget night. Then it grew to $400 or $500. The honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) has got it as high as $1,500. The reality is that this tax will probably be another fringe benefits tax and end up raising very much more than the government admitted when first introduced. If you are building a dog kennel, the increased cost may be only $300. If you are building a traditional family house, it is going to be very much more than that. This additional tax will be an enormous burden on the entire building industry. It will particularly affect the joining industry and those who are associated with putting together the various fittings that make up a house that is worth living in. These are the sorts of elements that will attract this punitive tax as a result of this legislation. I have already had letters and phone calls from joiners in my electorate who are particularly concerned about the way this tax affects them rather than others in the building industry. If you build cupboards in a house you will not be subjected to this tax, If you buy a readymade kitchen, it will be taxable. That distorts the marketplace. There is also the effect which this tax will have not just on housing but on commercial buildings. I wonder whether the Assistant Treasurer would care to respond about the effect of this tax on the cost of a new hotel, for instance. Clearly; if you are putting in built-in cupboards of the type that are riormally used in houses, this tax will apply to those cupboards. The extra cost for a new hotel could be hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars. It will be a significant and adverse tax on the tourist industry. The government is not coming clean about the effects of this tax. It has not been able to get its own act together in respect of the effects of the tax on houses, let alone On commercial buildings, hotels and the like. This is another tax on the battler. It is another example of the government intending to stamp out those who want to make their life a little more pleasant and who aspire to the great Aussie dream of owning their own home. .",40
51,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,"As I have said, the best thing you can do for home owners in Australia is to keep interest rates down, and that is what this government has done. I will repeat what I said earlier. The current interest rates that people are paying now are two to three per cent lower than they were all the way through the 1980s and they are a lot lower than they were under the regulated regime of the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) when he was Treasurer. This budget was all about keeping those interest rates down. We have done the best we can to make sure that home owners can move into their homes and sustain their repayments. I notice that in a couple of arguments that have been put forward those opposite have brought up the fringe benefits tax and the fact that the estimates of the amounts raised were somewhat conservative, and those opposite laugh at that. But we did not understand the amount of fringe benefits being paid in the Australian community instead of wages. We did not know that. The former Treasurer, now Leader of the Opposition, never taxed those things. He was happy to have a taxation system that taxed all of the workers' wagesthe battlers' wages. The PAYE taxpayer paid 100 per cent under the then Treasurer, now Leader of the Opposition. But what about the executives who took 50 per cent of their income in cash and 50 per cent in kind? Of course, the current Leader of the Opposition did not want to know about the other 50 per cent in kind, but we did. That is why we brought in the fringe benefits tax. We makes no apologies for bringing in the fringe benefits tax, even though you opposed it at the time we brought it in. It showed how fringe benefits had become part of the land;. scape out in the business community and how right we were in retrospect-that is always the best position to speak from-to bring in that tax. History has shown us that where we have made these taxation adjustments they have been the proper ones. Those opposite jump up and down and say, 'What a terrible thing the taxation measures in this budget are,' yet you will not tell us what you were going to do. We know that, had you been in government at the last election, the impost that you would have put on not only home owners but everybody in the community would have left these tax measures far behind. The taxation regime that you were going to put on Australians would have resulted in a 15 per cent tax on all of these building materials but, worse than that, it would have resulted in a 15 per cent tax on the labour that went into them. That is what you were proposing. So you do not come into this debate with clean hands. You come with a proposal that you put to the peopie at the last election that would have decimated the industry. As I said earlier, these measures are very modest indeed. They help a budget that will make sure that we have a sustainabie recovery into the future and they also keep interest rates down, which is the best thing you can do for home buyers.",41
52,Mr REID,PAIRS,"We have just heard a staggering admission by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) that the government did not know how much revenue would be raised through the fringe benefits tax. I put it to honourable members that the government does not know how much money it is going to raise from the poor battlers who are trying to buy a home. The Assistant Treasurer really has not responded adequately. A number of different spokesmen in his party have given us different answers to every question that we have asked about how much money will be raised on each house. Give usa couple of examples. What would it cost on a $75,000 house? What would it cost on a $100,000 house? What would it cost on an average new home, which in my electorate is probably about $125,000 to $150,000? The staggering admission that the government did not know how much revenue would be raised by the fringe benefits tax indicates to me that it had done no work on it beforehand. It could not even give an estimate. It has the figure of $215 million in the budget papers which represents the tax on all of these building products, yet it cannot really assure the House or people who are trying to build a house exactly how much money will be raised. We have had so many different opinions on this. If you do not know, Assistant Treasurer, get the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in here to answer the question; get the information so that we know exactly how much revenue will be raised.",42
53,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,"At the risk of repeating myself, we stand by the figures in the budget. They ale correct. They are our projection. We stand by them. For the illumination of the House, it has been pointed out to me that in today's Australian there is an article about home ownership now being within the grasp of 70 per cent of householders. The first sentence states: The Australian dream of owning a home is becomlot. ing a reality for more people, with 70 the country's population either owning a home or in the process of purchasing one, a new survey has shown. This has been written after the budget. More and more people are now able to gef ,into houses. Opposition members can ask me the question as many times as they like, but the answer will be exactly the same. Let me say one more thing. Interest rates in . some cases have been falling. A one per cent interest rate cut on a $75,000 mortgage is equal to $750 a year. Have a think about that and have a think about the interest rate regime when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was Treasurer. We have achieved a saving of $750 for one percentage point. Just think what he had. The fact is that he was the home loan interest king. He had them at the highest levels they ever were. As I said before, as long as we can keep the pressure on interest rates to remain lower than they otherwise would be, we are doing the best thing we can by home buyers. This survey, which has been released today, just proves that more and more people are able to get into their own homes.",42
54,Mr RONALDSON,PAIRS,It is terrific to see this government stewing in its own juice of dishonesty. We are now seeing a return to the pre-1993 election when you wantonly attacked the coalition for its taxation measure. We are seeing the true goods and services tax government in this country as opposed to the coalition's proposal. Mrs Moylan-By stealth.,42
55,Mr RONALDSON,PAIRS,"By stealth, as the shadow minister for small business says. What you are not doing is providing compensation. There are no offsets. You are just slugging the tax on. This will come back to haunt you, as it should. The last election campaign was fraudulent. You know it was and the people of Australia know it was. The sales tax on cars is another classic example of the duplicity of this government and the utter disregard it has for regional Australia. What you idiots do not realise, and what you will never accept, is that country people happen to use their motor vehicles a You ought to get out there and have a per cent of look rather than being closeted",42
56,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Mr Hollis)Order! As I understand it, we are speaking just to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Menzies. I do not think that deals with sales tax on cars. I think we are dealing with other items. So I would ask you to keep your comments to the actual amendment moved by the honourable member for Menzies.",43
57,Mr RONALDSON,PAIRS,"I am quite happy to do that, but do not let government members talk about environmental concerns when they are raising the tax on cars, Mr Deputy Speaker.",43
58,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,We are not talking about the environment.,43
59,Mr RONALDSON,PAIRS,"What I want to talk about today in relation to this is the price of housing. You are idiots in relation to sales on cars and you are idiots in relation to any understanding of what makes rural and regional economies work. You do not go and whack the price of houses up! It is an idiotic approach to developing regional economies. It is about time you understood what actually happens out there. My colleagues representing rural and regional centres in this chamber know exactly how important a strengthened and vibrant building industry is to those centres. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) would not know what it is like. He is closeted over there in Perth. But I can tell you what it is like for those of us who represent regional centres. If you kick the building industry in the backside, you kick the regional economy in the backside. When you cannot stand up here and tell this House how much the cost of a house is going to go up, it shows that it was a cheap moneygrabbing idea, done late, like the Commonwealth Bank sell off, to balance your budget. It is indeed a measure of deceit. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and others who pretend to have some knowledge of regional centres should not come in here and talk about what this government is doing for regional Australia. It is doing nothing for regional Australia. This housing move is another classic example of the utter contempt in which government members hold regional centres. You will be shown in no uncertain terms by the voters in those electorates exactly what they think of your views about this. The Assistant Treasurer does not understand: where do tradespeople and others involved in the building industry go if you try to force them out of small centres? Put away that stupid bit of paper you are holding up and get back to the realities of what is happening in regional Australia. Where do they go? Do they drive, for example, from Ballarat to Melbourne in their old car that they cannot afford to trade in because you have whacked the sales tax up on the new ones and cause the very problems we were talking about before? Wake up to yourself, do your figures and withdraw this outrageous measure which will do only one thing-make life tougher for tax people in regional centres who simply cannot afford any more problems.",43
60,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,PAIRS,"I did not intend to enter this argument on the sales tax bills until I heard some of the responses coming from the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear). They show that he does not go home on the weekends to mix in the electorate to find out what the effects of the 12 per cent tax will be on housing. If he did, he would find that the reaction would be quite different from that which he gets in the cabinet room, where these decisions are made, and quite different from the reaction he gets from the Treasury department that recommends these types of things. It is going to be an imposition not only on home owning throughout Australia but particularly on joinery works which have been operating on a very thin margin up to this stage. To have to sell their product with a 12 per cent tax on their labour content is right out of this world. I want to debunk the argument the Assistant Treasurer has used so far about the GST. Obviously, he did not understand the GST then, and he does not understand it now. As far as housing is concerned, there was never any indication that there was going to be a 15 per cent tax on labour. This is a tax on labour. Joinery works now have to add a 12 per cent manufacturing cost to their price on site. I also take up the point the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) made that this is going to have an effect in regional Australia. The 12 per cent tax will be added to the cost of freight to get the materials from the major timber works to site. He compared the 12 per cent tax, although on a limited amount, with the 15 per cent GST. But this does not have any compensating factors. The cost of fuel, the cost of payroll tax and the reduction of private individual taxation measures are not included in the tax-in fact, it is the reverse. We are going to get an increase in Medicare, an increase in company rates of taxation and an increase in the cost of motor vehicles. There is no compensating factor in this at It is a grubby little trick by the Treasury, a grubby little trick by the government, to get more funds out of a very sensitive area. I have a responsibility for a joinery work, I have a responsibility in connection with my electorate for joinery works; and on 1 July there will be a massive diminution in the activities of these places. A modest kitchen going into a $100,000 house will cost between $3,000 and $4,000 retail. Twelve pet cent on a wholesale price of $2,500-1 would say $3,000-is $360. Yet the minister comes in here and stresses that the Treasury estimates are $300· on a moderately sized house across the board. It is rubbish. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) should go back to square one and find out what is actually going to happen with this tax. For somebody who works at the ground level, I can tell you that this could be an intended consequence of crushing a lot of small businesses in my city of Mackay. At the last check, we had about 30 or 40 small business people operating in the joinery works. Many of those will go out of business. For no other reason than that, the Treasurer and this government are desperate to show a margin of surplus in their budgeting arrangement which itself is a fudge. The reaction on 1 July is going to be one of dismay. As far as small businesses are concerned, they are going to be loaded with an extra government cost, an extra government tax, which is for only one person to try to get this government re-elected. I will not have that.  the member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), I am dragged into the debate on these sales tax bills by some of the comments that have been made. People could be forgiven for thinking that at the last election the opposition was proposing a GST. If we want to talk about the impact of this impost on small business, what was the administrative burden going to be on small business with. that goods and services tax?",43
61,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,"It would choke them.  able. I sympathise that we need to keep all. paperwork for small business ·at a minimum. In relation to labour costs, the GST was going to be the most pernicious form of payroll tax on labour that we had ever seen. We seem to have forgotten that. I have always felt that major parties in this place have a responsibility to see the system of government work. It is almost as though the disappointment of failing to get a GST supported by the general public has led the opposition to go feral. It wants to oppose every revenue measure proposed by the government in this budget. You might also ask rural and regional Australia, 'Guess what happens if the opposition does succeed in these measures to deny the government revenue? Are the existing home owners who are on a variable rate happy to have their interest rate go up by one per cent, 1V2 per cent, two per cent or three per cent?' Responsibility comes with a price. I can understand the frustration of the honourable member for Dawson in his mentioning that the government has brought in a surplus. It certainly caught the opposition by surprise, and I am happy to admit that it caught some members of the government by surprise. There was speculation about whether the deficit could be brought down to $1 Y2 billion or $1 billion. The truth is that we have ended up with a surplus of over $700 million this year, $3.5 billion the following year and $7 billion the year after that. This is one of the most important things we can do for national savings, and in terms of trying to put a cap on interest rates-as the government appears to be &ucceeding in doing-is to have interest rate- lowered. My electorate attracts a lot of first home owners, and perhaps my electorate is different froro:·. the electorate of Dawson-certainly, mine! is in the western suburbs of Sydney. The real fear those people have is that interest rates \will rise an- put pr-ssure on. f-mily budgets. When buymg the flfSt home, It IS not uncommon for every financial resource in that family to be stretched to the nth degree to get over the line and afford the repayments. Propositions where interest rates are to rise by one per cent, two per cent or more, hold a real horror for those families. I say quite frankly to the honourable member for Dawson that in my electorate there is great support for measures the government takes that result in reduced interest rates. They certainly see it as a long-term benefit for them not an impact on prospective new home buyers. I think in that regard the home owners in his electorate would be no different to mine. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) mentioned the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. I am interested to know whether the honourable member for Ballarat is suggesting that the sale should not proceed. I put on the record that in my electorate there is a branch of the Commonwealth Bank at Emerton that serves a particularly deprived",44
62,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I drew to the member for Ballarat's attention the question of relevance. This debate really has nothing to do with the Commonwealth Bank. We are talking about the amendment moved by the honourable member for Menzies- Have you finished?  I have just about finished. I would not presume - to flout your ruling, but the closure of that bank and the resultant shift up the road made me realise that the aspirations we on this side of House held for the public ownership of banks that deliver banking community services· have long since gone. Not only the words but also the actions of the. Commonwealth Bank have convinced me, the people in my electorate and, if not them, the people of Emerton that that is the case. (Time expired)",45
63,Mr TRUSS,PAIRS,"I find it quite extraordinary that government members seek to justify their increasing the tax on houses on the basis that the coalition once proposed a GST. The coalition's tax proposals at the last election involved a very comprehensive reform of the entire national tax system. The package included the imposition of a new goods and services tax, but, at the same time, involved the axing of seven other taxes lock, stock and barrel. Consumers would have been much better off. Their buying power would have been substantially enhanced. One of the programs included in that package was a new first home buyers scheme-something to assist people with the extra costs that might be associated with housing as a result of the imposition of the GST. The interesting thing about this government's record in relation to housing is that one of the very first things it did upon coming into government was axe the first home buyers scheme. That scheme helped young battlers to buy their first home. Not only has Labor got rid of that assistance program, but now it is seeking to make housing more expensive. I cannot understand why it should launch this incredible assault on home buyers. It is trying to make the dream of owning one's own home more remote. The other point I will comment on is the suggestion that somehow or other this is not a tax on labour. That is an absolute nonsense. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) was completely wrong to say that it is not a tax on labour.",45
64,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,Is it a new tax on labour?,45
65,Mr TRUSS,PAIRS,"It is a new tax on labour. The situation is that if you build your kitchen cupboards or your wardrobes in the home there will be no tax on the labour, but if they are built in a factory, as happens in most instances, then there will be a tax on the labour element of the construction of those fittings. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) has obviously had the same experience in his electorate as I have had in mine. Joiners and those who operate furniture factories are extremely concerned about their viability in the future. There will be an advantage for those who have these pieces of furniture constructed in their own home compared to those who have them manufactured in a factory. It is more efficient to have them manufactured in a central location because you achieve economies of scale and there are national benefits in producing things as efficiently as possible. This tax will distort the normal efficiency patterns. This will clearly place at risk many of the small businesses in the member for Dawson's electorate and my electorate and, I believe, other small businesses across Australia. The previous speaker, the honourable  the coalition was going to oppose all of the tax measures in this budget: that we were against all tax increases. It is true that· we believe in lower taxes. We believe that the country would be very much better off if there was less of a burden on business, less of a burden on those who earn and less of a burden on the productive sector of our society. Our fundamental objection to the tax increases in this budget is that they represent gross dishonesty on behalf of the government. At the National Press Club, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) promised, in words of one syllable that everybody could understand, 'What we are promising is we will not put up taxes.' That was a simple assurance given to the Australian people. It was a simple promise made that we all thought we could understand. It was l-a-w. It was a clear promise that there would be no increases in taxes. At the very next budget, only months after the election, we had the biggest range of tax increases in the history of our nation. That has continued in every budget since. We believe that governments should be honest with the Australian people: when they say no new taxes, they should mean no new taxes and it should deliver no new taxes. This tax is a part of this government's dishonesty. We believe that there should be a commitment to the Australian people from members of parliament: when they make promises, they will honour them. By moving this amJndment, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) is seeking to impose a degree of honesty on government members that!they do .not consider they have to sustai- .for themselves.",45
66,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,"Let me make a few points about the remarks that have been made /lbout labour being taxed. I could use the argument that is being used and say that any manufactured product contains some component of labour. If I buy a brand new car, obviously some labour has been put into manufacturing that car. Opposition members would understand that when we buy a brand new car, we have to pay the wholesale sales price on it. The wholesale sales price on that car reflects the tax that we put on that manufactured good. Opposition members would understand that point. If we are talking about products that go into the home, we see that the same argument holds true. If a product is made for a home, there is a percentage of labour component in it. Mr Truss-It is tax a on the labour.",46
67,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,"Always has been. But the point I am making is this: any manufactured component or good has a percentage of labour in it. What we tax of that is the wholesale sales tax rate. Nothing has changed in this budget, from the budget before, the budget before that or the budget before that. Nothing has changed. What the opposition is saying now is that somehow this year's budget has changed all that. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss)is shaking his head, but I just heard his interjection. When I asked him whether this was a new tax, he said, 'Yes, it is.' But it is not. And now he is agreeing with me that it is not a new tax. Mr Truss-It is a new tax.",46
68,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Hollis)Order! We will not have any debate across the chamber.,46
69,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,"The opposition's argument is convoluted. The simple fact is that the only thing that has changed· in this budget has been that some items which go into buildings which were previously exempt from tax now hav- a 12 per cent concessional rate on them. We \agree on that point. But to extrapolate fro- that the argument - hat so-ehow there was rot a tax on labour mputs mto a manuabout factured product before this budget but there is nOf is wrong, and the opposition knows that it is wrong. So the argument just falls downf Pedple have been asking about the impact of tMs tax on a new house, and I gave an answJr which I think is broadly some!figures brought down to me and I will read them out for the benefit of the House. They' are broadly iIi line with what I said. is not possible to give a precise estimate of the impact on the price of a new house because the size of the impact depends on the cost of the relevant fittings. most new houses, the impact is expected to be in the range of $300 to $1,000. For a medium new house in the capital cities costing $ 155,000-that is house and land-the impact may be around $500 to $800. For a medium new house on an Australia-wide basis costing $131,200-that is house and land-the impact may be around $450 to $700. For a modest house with modest fittings-that is for a modest house and land package of around $100,000 to $120,000 with the house being around 55 per cent of the cost-the tax impact may be around $400. Those figures are broadly in line with the responses I gave to previous questions. That is putting it as well as I can. You can see that some of the figures that were being floated around really were out of the ballpark, particularly those of the Deputy Leader of the (Mr Keating)Opposition .(Mr Costello) who talked about $2,500-you would have to have a pretty house. Let me just read out one other fact: a one per cent reduction in interest rates would boost loan afford ability by eight per cent, equivalent of a reduction in housing prices $9,800. Clearly, it is difficult home buyers would benefit from the removal of the proposed tax if that removal were at the cost of putting in doubt the budget come of putting downward pressure on interintegrity est rates. I go back to my central point, which is this: this budget is aimed at getting sustainable growth into the future and putting downward pressure on interest rates. If you are talking home buyers and battlers, the best thing you can do for them is to keep interest rates down. Those payments come in every month. On the figures relating to a $75,000 loan, which I read out before, if you could save them about $750 a year, you are doing much more for them than anything this budget has correct. I had an impact on. The government stands by the figures in the budget. It is doing everything it can for It housing affordability. As the newspaper article in today's Australian points out, never has there been a period in our history where home loan affordability has been higher than However, for it is at present.",46
70,Mr RONALDSON,PAIRS,I am pleased that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has given us the figures to lock-up stage; perhaps he can get the ones for finishing the house off. I take up a comment made about the Assistant Treasurer in the course of the speech of the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). The member for Dawson commented that the Assistant Treasurer did not understand the GST.,47
71,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,Who did?,47
72,Mr RONALDSON,PAIRS,He has repeated it: who did? Mr Lee-Start on the birthday cake.,47
73,Mr RONALDSON,PAIRS,I think we might go through some examples. Do you want to talk about the little charade of the Prime Minister,47
74,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Mr Hollis)big Order! We will deal with the amendment which is before· the House at the moment, nothing else.",47
75,Mr RONALDSON,PAIRS,"Thank you, Mr the Deputy Speaker. lam glad that you have of picked up the minister's interjection during to argue that my speech today. I think the important part of the Assistant Treasurer's admission is: if you do not underoutstand something, how can you with any comment on the likely outcomes? How can you",47
76,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,Because I understand the outcomes.,48
77,Mr RONALDSON,PAIRS,"'Because I understand the outcomes, but I do not understand what leads us there.' I think this is probably the best admission we have had from a senior government minister about the GST in the last two years-that he did not understand it and, therefore, that he cannot, with integrity, comment on the likely outcomes. The only conclusion we can draw from that is that your campaign against the GST was purely political and was not based on any intelligent, economic or social argument. That is the height of hypocrisy. It was a campaign of dishonesty. The broken promises of this government, since it was re-elected are, again, the height of dishonesty.",48
78,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,PAIRS,"I am forced back into this argument because of the comments of the member for  inadvertently omitted initially. I also want to refer to the tax on labour. I can tell the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) that for a sole operator in a joinery, earning $700 a week, this sales tax will mean 12 per cent on $700 extra on his product-not including the addons to that $700. That is a fact. It is a 12 cent tax on that $700. There is nothing you can say that will justify that in the mind of the joiner when he goes out to sell the product after 1 July. . I will talk about compensation, which we have already spoken about. It was very real compensation. As far as a house owner is concerned, we could demonstrate that there would be a net reduction over the whole package. People in my electorate are not buying houses because they fear a repeat of what happened five or six years ago. They see the budget for what it is-a short-term measure, but giving no long-term stability. I guess that interest rates will be forced down initially but after the election they will go back to the level where they were five or six years ago. Do not talk to me about compensation in terms of interest and the reduction of a m ,)rtgage. That has not been effected yet. That olltcome has not been seen in my electorate, and I· do not think it will be seen until more is demonstrated to show that the budget is for real and is going to ach eve those ends. When you talk about an int rest rate reduction to support the dollar whe we are going to have a trade deficit of I $27 billion, do not talk to me in terms of realisable compensation for this cost. Could I talk about the administrativelProblems. The honourable member for Chifley reminded me that there are joiners that I Jknow who cannot get a proper method of c-cula­ tion of this tax, which is to come in \on 1 July, from your office. Apparently that advice is still coming; it is still to be worked out. We have people who are trying to run a business who do not know what the position on the wholesale price will be after 1 July. What we know for sure is that there is going to be a tax on the labour, there is going to be tax on the freight, there is going to be tax on the material and there is going to be a tax on the profit margin on the wholesale price; and that that tax is as yet undetermined. When you talk about administration, think of the initial administration involved in trying to comply with this law and the compliance cost once it is in place. I will go on record and say that there is nothing more convoluted per and misunderstood in this country than the wholesale sales tax laws. You could probably take all of Australia and the Australian Taxation Office and you would get only a dozen people who understand sales tax. That is about it. The compliance cosUs going to be for real. The honourable member for Chifley also indicated that the budget was a surprise to him. I will bet it was a surprise! When he goes back to his electorate he will get a bigger surprise. I would like to see any of the government members at a meeting of joiners, or at a meeting of householders or potential home owners or even current home owners, trying to convince them that the possible interest rate reduction is compensation for paying the up-front additional cost of a house. I can only say that the $300 cost for one range that was mentioned must be for a tent with a built-in mobile kitchen or something like that. I will go back to the point that, if you just buy a ready-made kitchen at a shop-I am not talking about any of the other join-ry in the house at all-you are going to pay \$3,000 to $4000 for a modest one in a $1O(!),000 house. The staff of the Treasury who are giving these figures must live in a very closeted society where they have got their houses, they have got their secured loans and they have got e-erything else going for them. But it is the average Australian who is looking for a home, the Australian dream, who will be denied this after 1 July. (Time expired)",48
79,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,"In response to the member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), he has talked about joiners as if we were going to impose this tax on one joiner but not on another. The simple fact is that it is going to be neutral across the industry, and he should appreciate that. I cannot see how one joiner will be disadvantaged against another. On the other point he raised about the ruling being out on 1 July, I am advised that discussions with industry are taking place and that within a fortnight we will have a ruling so that, when this tax comes in, there will be guidance for them. So I can allay his fears on that one. Question put: That the amendment (Mr Andrews's) be agreed to. The House divided. [1.08 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr EJ. Fitzgibbon), Ayes ...............

80,Mr STEELE HALL,NOES,"I move: Schedule 2, page 9, after item 11, insert following item: ""llA. Subitem 97(3) of Schedule 1: Omit the definition of 'eligible disabled substitute the following definition: ""'eligible disabled person"" means a person has a current certificate given by the Secretary, certifying that the person has lost the use of more limbs to such an extent that he or she unable to use public transport;'."". I apologise for holding the House up earlier in the debate. There is a rather novel process in this bill, in that schedule 2 of this amend to ing bill amends schedule 1 of the parent act. That was the where the mix-up in my thinkentirely ing occurred. I spoke on this matter during the second reading debate. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) was not here at that time. I doubt whether he is hanging on my every word to extra hear, but he does know about the circumstances surrounding and the reasons for my moving these amendments. In the first part of 1993, I sentations from a constituent who has a driving licence and, having passed an adinconsistency vanced driving course, drives without arms. I made representations to Mr Dawkins, when he was Treasurer, and, subsequently, to Assistant Treasurer sitting at the table today. I have not made any public politics of this matter over that two-year period, hoping that the government and the minister in particular would see the justice of putting these people who drive without use of their arms on the same legislative basis as those who drive without the use of their legs. For the informaunder tion of the House, for those members who may not know the detail of this matter, the safeguard and the oversight of issuing these licences is in the hands of the secretary to department, who must give a certificate that the person is fully employed, uses the vehicle for the purposes of transport to and from that employment and that he or she cannot use public transport because of the loss of use as the bill now stands in schedule 1, lower limbs. I imagine the advent of thalidomide effects has centred attention now on those who diive the without arms, and the act therefore contains an inequity in that it does not include those with the loss of arms. My long series of contacts with the minister over this elicited an person', answer from him that these people could obtain a disability payment, which they can, who and this in effect would equal the advantage of an exemption from the sales tax for the one or purchase of their vehicles. The immediate is response of my constituent was, 'Look, I am a full working member of this community. I do not want to go on social security or social services when in fact what I am asking for is be placed in the same position as others with a loss of use of lower limbs.' I agree that these people should not be differentiated by the fact that the schedule to the act did not envisage the need for this particular inclusion when it was written. I think it is insulting to people who go to that effort, with all of these difficulties, to maintain their morale and their attitude, to say, 'You can go on social service,' rather than, 'I as a minister will put you on an equal level with those already mentioned in the received represchedule of the act.' The minister's response contains its own in that, having offered a payment, he cannot argue the lack of inclusion on financial grounds. He says, 'Finance is not a the question. I will give you the money in a disability payment.' So what we are talking about is the simple matter of equity, an equal level of regard by the community for disabilities. I think the case is overwhelming. I had a look at the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, and that act does not cover this case because the comparison there for the action the act is between the person disabled and a person who is not disabled. We have this finer point here that this person and others like her are being discriminated against the on a judgment of disability to disability, not disability to no disability. But it is the same principle, and I draw to the minister's attention that the intention of the act is to make it an offence to discriminate, and this current of, legislation does discriminate.

81,Mr GEAR,NOES,"I have listened with interest to the member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), a member whom I might say I have a high regard for. I have served with him on a number of committees. He went through what I believe to be the proper procedure in seeking for his constituent some redress to the concern that she had. He did not politicise this argument. He has gone through it, I think, in a model fashion. I can tell him that we will be accepting his amendment. We are doing it because it seems to us that the points that he makes are right. Back when this concession was given, it was never envisaged that people without arms could drive cars, and he would agree with that. It was entirely possible in those days that people without legs could drive, but technology has gone a fair way since then and people without arms can now drive too. I would like to make this general point about the way in which we give concessions: it is better that they are given on outlays than through the taxation system. I think he would agree on that. But we are not here today to argue about that because, historically, this concession has been given to one set of people and not to another. This amendment moved by the member for Boothby will redress that. But it is not the most desirable way. The best way that you can give assistance to people who unfortunately find themselves in this position is on the outlays. That is why we do have a mobility allowance which is paid at $52.40 per fortnight, and I draw the attention of the House to the fact that anybody who is buying a car for $19,640 or less is financially better off in taking the mobility allowance rather than taking .the concession on the car. What we are talking about today is equality of treatment for handicapped people. As a result of the amendment moved by the member for Boothby, people who do not have arms or people who do not have legs, who are in the work force and wish to buy a car to get to work, will now be treated in exactly the same way . They will have the choice of the tax concession or the mobility allowance. Perhaps debate on the underpinning philosophy behind assistance to people with disabilities can be left to another day. But I make the general point that when we are giving assistance of this kind it is much better done on the outlays, because for anybody who can afford to buy a car, for instance, for $40,000 the benefit that goes to that person is about twice that for somebody who buys a car for $20,000. The government will accept the amendment from the member for Boothby. I congratulate him on the way he has handled this matter, which is a model for others.",50
82,Mr STEELE HALL,NOES,"I would like to thank the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) for his consideration and his acceptance of the amendment. It is a proper recognition of the problem, and I am sure my constituent will be very grateful for that. As a matter of detail, I will have to move the amendment to each of the three bills, because there is a similar schedule in each of them. Amendment agreed to.",51
83,Mr ANDREWS,NOES,"I move: (3) Schedule 2-pages 9-11, omit items 12-19. These items also relate to the increased tax on the building industry and on housing which has been the subject of some debate in this place so far. I want to address a couple of the remarks that have been made by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in relation to this measure. He is suggesting to members of this chamber, and to the people of Australia generally, that somehow this measure is not a new tax. The way he does that is by saying, 'There is already a tax on manufactured goods and all we are doing is including some more manufactured goods under the schedules and, therefore, it is not a new tax.' But, of course, there is no tax at the present time on kitchen cupboards. There is no tax on the variety of other building materials which are referred to here, ranging from nails and bolts and screws and glue and plaster materials right through to taps and shower heads and nozzles. There is no tax on them at the present time. But, as of 1 July, if this measure passes, there will be a tax on those items. So it is using words in a very curious way to say that this does not involve a new tax. The way in which this tax is implemented actually distorts the market. If a person wishes to have his kitchen remodelled or get new kitchen cupboards, there are two ways in which it can be done. One is that he can have the kitchen cupboards made up in a joiner's workshop and then put together in his kitchen. If he does it that way, he will be charged 12 per cent tax on the final price. That price includes not only the materials that go into making the doors, walls, benchtops and every other component of the kitchen but also the labour that went into making them. The Assistant Treasurer is not going to stand here and say that, if the kitchen supplier gives that man a bill which itemises labour as a separate component from the goods which are supplied, he will only charge sales tax on the goods supplied. Of course he will not. He is going to charge sales tax on the final price which is paid, and that includes the labour component. This is a tax on goods and services. There is no running away from that fact. It also distorts the market because, if a builder makes the kitchen from scratch in the person's house, he will charge the tax on the components that go into making the kitchen units, but he will not charge a tax on the labour. This comes from a minister who has charge of the Hilmer recommendations for new competition policy in Australia. He stands up in parliament every second day and says, 'We must remove the distortions in competition throughout the economy,' yet here he is introducing a distortion into the. housing economy. The bottom line is that a new tax is being introduced on materials which go into the building of houses. This completely changes what the government said prior to the last election. This government said before the election, 'We won't do this,' and now it comes in and does it. Everyone in Australia ought to remember that the moral of this is that this is a government which cannot be trusted. In the coming weeks and months-however long it is to the next election which is now looming-when the people of Australia think about anything that has been said by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) or members of this government, they should remember this measure and the other measures introduced by this government which have reversed what the government had promised it would or would not do. We are dealing with a government that simply cannot be trusted. Question put: That the aJl)endment (Mr Andrews's) be agreed to. , The House divided. [1.32 p.m.] (Mr SPEAKER - Hon.

87,Mr ELLIOTT,CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION,"Parramatta-Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts) (1.47 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the bill is to establish the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, CASA, as a Commonwealth authority with responsibility for aviation safety regulation. A separate bill, the Air Services Bill 1995, has been introduced in the House to establish Airservices Australia as a government business enterprise to operate Australia's national airways system and associated services. The two bills provide the legislative framework for the creation of two new bodies to replace the Civil Aviation Authority, CAA. The proposed arrangements build on the government's announcements of 20 July 1994 and 12 October 1994 on new aviation safety arrangements. This included the decision to remove the aviation safety regulatory function from the Civil Aviation Authority and place it in a separate and entirely independent statutory authority; .the decision to fund that part of the safety regulation function which had been identified as 'public goods'; a direction to the CAA to establish a formal system which automatically triggers an increase in safety surveillance of operators are known to be in financial difficulty; proval for the CAA to recruit an additional staff to resource adequately its safety tory function in terms of both staff numbers and requisite skills; a request to the House Representatives Standing Committee on '24 Transport, Communications and Infrastructure 11 May 1995. to conduct an inquiry into air safety standards in the commuter and general aviation sectors of the industry; and an increase in the maxition mum compensation available to fare paying passengers in the event of an aircraft accident to $500,000 per passenger for Australia's domestic and international airlines. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority will provide the regulatory framework for civil aviation in Australia. CASA's regulatory functions include standard setting, safety surveillance of the industry and of standards, entry control and licensing. Its additional responsibilities include regulatory oversight of the national airways system, air traffic services and aviation rescue and firesafety fighting services provided by Airservices tion Australia and administration of the carriers' mandatory death or injury insurance arrangebills ments which the government announced on 12 October 1994. CASA will also be required to place much greater emphasis on safety awareness and· education. Together with the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, BASI, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia constitute a tripartite structure for providing safe aviaas tion, each with separate and distinct functions but working together as parts of an integrated system. The government also intends to introduce separate legislation to increase BASI's capacity to conduct more sophisticatDirector ed, systemic investigations and analysis. The target date for the establishment of CAS A and Airservices Australia is 1 July 1995. The separation of the regulatory service provider functions, as proposed in the two bills before the House, will provide much clearer focus on aviation safety regulafunctions tion and ensure that there is no conflict with the more commercial goals of the service provider. On 28 March 1995, the Minister for Transwho port (Mr Brereton) referred the bill to the apHouse of Representatives Standing Committee 57 on Transport, Communications and Infrastrucregulature for comment. The committee sought comments on the bills and took evidence at a of public hearing during the week commencing April 1995. It issued an advisory report on The minister and the government are grateful to the committee for conducting its aviabills inquiry at short notice and for the constructive comments in its advisory report. I will address the committee's specific recommendations later in this second reading speech. The standing committee's 11 May 1995 advisory report noted that there was broad support for the establishment of an independent aviation safety authority, and endorsed enforcement this approach. It said: The creation of a new authority with a new and more specialised board and a new director is a far better solution for the troubled world of aviation regulation in Australia than any reorganisawithin the existing Civil Aviation Authority. The importance of safety is reinforced in both through a requirement that, in exercising powers and performing their functions, CASA and Airservices Australia must regard the safety of air navigation as the most important consideration. CASA's leadership, strategic direction and management of aviation safety will be considerably enhanced through its establishment an independent authority, the appointment of an acknowledged expert on aviation. safety as its new director and the subsequent appointment of a small, expert board. CASA's board will comprise the chairperson, the of Aviation Safety and up to three other members. A major priority of the board and the Director of Aviation Safety will be to address the various management problems that and have emerged over the last 12 months. The Minister may give CASA written a instructions as to the performance of its or the exercise of its powers but, in respect of the performance of CASA's regulatory function, the directions shall be only of a general nature. The bill also provides that the minister may give CAS A notices about its strategic direction. The bill makes provision for CASA to provide a corporate plan that includes objectives, strategies and performance measures, an analysis of aviation safety risk factors and human resource and industrial relations strategies. The minister must respond to the plan and may direct the board to vary the plan. As recommended by the standing committee, the legislation will be amended to require the corporate plan to be tabled in parliament. The government believes that the proposed responsibility and accountability framework in the bill provides a proper balance between the exercise of ministerial strategic direction and accountability and the day-today exercise by CASA of its functions and powers. Subject to safety being the most important consideration, CASA will be required to have regard to the environment in the exercise of its functions. This will ensure that, as far as possible, the community will be protected from any adverse effects of aircraft operations. Given the importance of air operators' certificates-AOCs-as a safety regulatory tool in respect of commercial operators, the CASA legislation brings together the main requirements relating to AOCs in a single, integrated set of provisions. Currently, these provisions appear in a variety of regulatory documents, and consolidation of the provisions will make them more accessible both to industry and to the regulator. Provision is made for CASA to be the body responsible for ensuring that all carriers of passengers are insured against their liability for death or injury to passengers. The government has already introduced legislation to amend the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act to make it mandatory for all operators to be so insured. As announced in October 1994, the government will continue to fund that part of aviation safety regulation that has been identified as the public benefit component, for example, standard setting, enforcement and provision of safety awareness information. Other aspects of aviation safety regulation, which primarily benefit the travelling public and the aviation industry, will continue to be met by a combination of charges and levies on the aviation industry. These proposed cost recovery arrangements for CASA will be reviewed prior to preparation of the 1996-97 budget. The government has agreed to a number of initiatives for CASA to enhance its effectiveness in providing safety regulation to the Australian aviation industry. The most important include the aviation safety surveillance program-which will provide an assessment of the safety health of the aviation industry and enable implementation of follow-up responses-and a' review of the system of flight crew testing. Provision has been made in the bill for the transfer of assets and for the transfer of staff, under the same terms and conditions as apply at present, from the Civil Aviation Authority to the new authority. The government also intends that rights, debts, liabilities and obligations-including insurance aspectswill be allocated to CASA in accordance with the functions transferred. The legislation provides that both CASA and Airservices Australia must, where appropriate, consult with government, industrial, commercial, consumer and other relevant bodies and organisations, including the International Civil Aviation Organisation and bodies representing the aviation industry. Both the boards of CASA and Airservices Australia will be asked to provide the Minister for Transport with proposals for consultative arrangements with industry. In relation to the standing committee's aviation bills inquiry, the government has 'accepted 10 of the 12 recommendations totally or substantially and, as necessary, will be moving amendments to accommodate these changes. As recommended by the committee, the government will reclassify CASA's functions to avoid any confusion between the object clause and the functions clause. The government also proposes a number of technical amendments to accommodate, inter alia, suggested changes proposed by the other House's Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The House committee noted that item 28 of the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill omits subsection 10(2) of the Civil Aviation Act. That subsection requires the authority, in so far as it is reasonably practicable to do so, to 'have regard to any costs that would arise from complying with the standards'. Some. industry representatives indicated concern that the ultimate issue of cost might not be addressed and that a focus on enabling more people to participate in aviation would recognise that regulation has its costs without explicit reference to costs. The committee proposed that the object clause be a broad in-principle statement of purpose which should include reference to the need for more people to benefit from civil aviation and that, pending the passage of the Legislative Instruments Bill, subsection 10(2) of the Civil Aviation Act be retained. The government considers that the committee's proposed changes to the object clause run the risk of diluting the safety intent of the bill. They seek to establish a dual mandate for CAS A by requiring CASA not only to regulate aviation safety but to foster the aviation industry. They introduce uncertainty as to how CASA should 'recognise the need for more people to benefit from civil aviation' and they could be used to challenge the validity of safety rules on the basis that they may have an economic impact on industry. In short, they involve the inclusion of the concept of 'affordable safety' under another name. The amendments also present a real danger of what the committee described as 'regulatory capture'-which could happen if CASA (the regulator) is seen to be 'accountable' to industry (the regulated). As the committee itself noted: CAS A should be accountable to the minister, the Parliament and the courts and to no one else. The government considers the question of costs is most appropriately addressed through the relevant provisions of the Legislative Instruments Bill. Under this bill, CASA will be required· to put in place a mandatory consultation process before any civil aviation regulation is made to ensure that all affected persons have an opportunity to comment. CASA will also be required to prepare a legislative instruments proposal which contains a summary of the proposal and its objectives, an analysis of alternatives to meet the objectives, an indication of relative costs . and benefits to government and the affected public of the proposal and alternatives and reasons for the preferred approach. The government therefore proposes to respond to the committee's concerns by firstly amending the object clause so that it is a broad in-principle statement of purpose as follows: The main object of this Act is to establish a regulatory framework for maintaining, enhancing and promoting the safety of civil aviation, with particular emphasis on preventing aviation accidents and, incidents. Secondly, a written direction will be issued to the CAS A board immediately upon its establishment requiring CASA to comply with the relevant provisions in the Legislative Instruments Bill, pending its enactment. The committee also proposed that the purpose of clause 28(2) be elaborated. This clause provides that the financial position of the applicant is one of the matters that CASA may take into account in issuing an air operators certificate. Clause 28BC(3) enables CAS A to take into account the financial position of an AOC holder when making a decision to impose or vary AOC conditions. As part of the government's broad strategy, to improve air safety regulation in Australia, the minister issued a written direction to the Civil Aviation Authority that it should establish a formal system which would trigger an automatic increase in safety surveillance of any operator found to be in financial defaults. The bill provides that CASA has a safety regulatory role: it does not provide CASA with the powers of an economic regulator to control the entry and licensing of operators in the industry or to monitor their financial affairs. The bill, nevertheless, allows CASA to take into account information about financial viability in order to assess whether the applicant can meet other provisions, for example, the requirement to maintain an appropriate organisation, with a sufficient number of qualified personnel and an effective management structure. Financial problems do not necessarily imply that safety standards are not being met. However, the bill empowers CASA to have regard to information about the financial viability of a particular operator in deciding whether or not to conduct a detailed safety audit of the operator. To make it mandatory to consider the financial position of an operator would interfere with CASA's responsibilities as a safety regulator since CASA would be required to undertake a financial viability test before it could suspend or cancel an AOC, with consequent, and potentially damaging, delays in CASA taking the necessary regulatory enforcement action. Section 20A of the Civil Aviation Act contains offences in relation to the flying or operation of aircraft in a manner likely to endanger life or cause danger to person or property. The Director of Public Prosecutions advised that it was difficult in some circumstances to obtain a conviction under this section, principally because the risk of danger that would have to be proved would be substantial or probable danger, even to the extent of actual injuries being sustained. The bill therefore contains amendments to section 20A along'the lines proposed by the Director of Public Prosecutions. Concerns have been raised that the proposed amendment casts the net too wide in that legitimate aviation activities, such as training pilots, could be in breach of the revised provision. Following advice from the Attorney-General's Department, the government proposes that the amendments to section 20A be withdrawn from the bill, that is, the current position be retained. The minister has asked the standing committee to look specifically at the issue as part of its broader inquiry into air safety standards in the commuter and general aviation sectors, with the aim of striking an appropriate balance between the public interest in preventing dangerous flying and the legitimate needs of the aviation industry. Finally, members will be aware that there are a number of inquiries into aspects of aviation safety at present, including the standing committee's aviation safety inquiry and the Staunton inquiry into certain aspects. of the operations of the Civil Aviation Authority in relation to Seaview Air. Because of the significance of the structural changes encompassed by these bills, the government is unwilling to delay their implementation until the outcome of these inquiries is known. However, the government will give careful consideration to the findings of these inquiries and report to parliament on its proposed responses, including any necessary legislative amendments. The minister noted that the standing committee accepted the need for the two bills to be passed in the current sittings. The government considers that this legislation package will give a clearer and stronger focus on aviation safety and restore public and industry confidence in the safety of aviation operations. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. AIR SERVICES BILL 1995 In the second reading speech introducing the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995' and in past statements, it has been made clear that the two new bodies to replace the Civil Aviation Authority, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia, together with the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, will constitute a tripartite structure, each with separate and distinct functions but working together as parts of an integrated system. The purpose of this bill is to establish Airservices Australia as the airways service provider. Airservices Australia will be established as a government business enterprise. Its functions will include the provision of airways facilities and air traffic services, an aeronautical information service, a national aviation rescue and firefighting service, an aviation search and rescue service and radio navigation and telecommunications. Additionally, Airservices Australia will be required to undertake specified environmental functions such as noise monitoring. In the performance of its functions, Airservices Australia, like the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, must regard the safety of navigation as the most important considertralia, ation.. Subject to this requirement, the makes provision for Airservices Australia perform its functions in a manner that ensures that, as far as is practicable, the environment is protected from the effects of aircraft operations. Airservices Australia will be governed a board comprising a chairperson, deputy chairperson, chief executive officer and six other members, appointed on a part-time basis. The finance provisions in the Air Services Bill, including those relating to corporate plan, are consistent with provisions contained in the Commonwealth Authorities apply at present. and Companies Act 1995, which establishes core accountability and finance provisions for Commonwealth bodies. The provisions relatwithout ing to ministerial direction, the board, the chief executive officer and miscellaneous matters are adapted from those provisions applying to the former Civil Aviation Authaviation ority. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure aviation bills inquiry in an advisory report, dated 11 May 1995, commenting on this bill and the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, recommended that the corporate plans of both organisations be tabled in parliament within 15 sitting days of the minister receiving final version. The government has accepted this recommendation in relation to CASA because of the nature of its plan as a broad strategic document rather than a business plan. However, the government considers such a recommendation in relation to Airservices Australia is inconsistent with government policy that such documents remain confidential between the minister and the GBE concerned. Like the Civil Aviation Authority, Airservices Australia will be required to pay payroll taxes but will not presently be liable to pay other taxes under any law of a state or territory. The government proposes that a review be conducted next year to examine the nature of the Airservices Australia enterprise and its capital structure. The application of all air state and territory taxes to Airservices Ausconsistent with the competition princibill ples agreement agreed by Commonwealth, to state and territory leaders at the Council of Australian Governments meeting in April . 1995, will also be considered. The bill further proposes that Airservices Australia will inherit the rights, debts, liabiliby ties and obligations, including insurance aspects, and assets of the service provider functions of the former Civil Aviation Authority. Relevant staff will be compulsorily transferred from the Civil Aviation Authority the to Airservices Australia on its establishment under the same terms and conditions that The establishment of Airservices Australia, the regulatory function of the former Civil Aviation Authority, will enable the new body to continue to serve Australia and international aviation by providing world class services and facilities. The government looks to Airservices Australia to build upon these achievements in the future. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. I commend the bills to the House.",54
88,Mr SHARP,CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION,"I commence my remarks this afternoon on behalf of the opposition by stating that we will not be opposing these bills, the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill and the Air the Services Bill. Indeed, we will be making some amendments, which I will outline in my speech this afternoon, which we think will add further force and meaning to the two bills we are debating this afternoon. These bills are that an important moment for me. They are important because the presentation of these bills and the work that has gone into splitting up the CAA and creating two new authorities that have a function to perform in the aviation industry are much due to the work that I have been doing following on from the Monarch crash of June 1993. This Saturday will be the second anniversary of the crash at Young, of Monarch flight 301, in which 7 people were killed, five of them my constituents, six of them people I knew. Since that date there has been a lot of publicity and interest in the Monarch crash and subsequently the Seaview crash which occurred in October of last year. My speech in May of last year in this House was followed up with another speech in early June of last year in which I outlined my concerns about Monarch Airlines and the things that I felt needed to be done to overcome the problems that had allowed Monarch Airlines to continue to operate in an unsafe fashion and that ultimately led to the deaths of those seven people two years ago this weekend. So I feel a degree of involvement with this legislation and some responsibility for it and some degree of pride that, as a result of the efforts we have put in, these changes are now before the House in the form of the two bills we are debating. It is interesting to note that when I started to look into the Monarch crash there was very quickly available to me a series of anecdotes and some evidence that indicated to me that the circumstances surrounding Monarch Airlines were not the iceberg but rather the tip of the iceberg and that there were other airlines operating in a similar fashion because of the failure of our Civil Aviation Authority to, in my view, correctly and effectively administer aviation safety in this country. In the speech that I made in May of last year I said there were other airlines posing a threat to public safety. One of those that I named was Seaview Airlines. As history will unfortunately show, that proved to be correct in October of last year, when nine people were killed in an accident on a flight to Lord Howe Island. All of the things we have seen happen since the Monarch crash prove to a reasonable man that the body charged with administering aviation safety in our country was not doing the job that the public would expect of it. The evidence of that was there to be seen in the form of those two air disasters and, indeed, in other examples which came to me as I started to take a public profile in my concerns about aviation safety. It seemed that the CAA was an unusual body. It did not have many friends. The people in the industry disliked it intensely. Fewpeople were prepared to say a kind word for it. People were frightened to say a bad word about it publicly because they felt the fear of persecution. We have seen plenty of examples of how the CAA can persecute people if it takes that idea into its head. We have seen how poorly administered the Civil Aviation Authority was, how bureaucratic it was, how expensive it was in some areas. We also saw how inward-looking the Civil Aviation Authority was and how self-defensive it had become. Indeed, those who looked at the Civil Aviation Authority witnessed an organisation that was prepared to shoot the messenger rather than listen to the message. We had an organisation-I think many people who have looked into the CAA over time would agree with me-that was a complete shambles. That shambles led to a chronic failure to properly regulate civil aviation safety in this country. I drew this matter to the attention of the parliament in May of last year and the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) personally-I think it was the following day-when we talked about it over lunch. I said that I felt there was a need not only to have an inquiry into the Civil Aviation Authority but also to make some very substantial changes. The minister listened to what I had to say. A short while afterwards-I think it was in June of that year-on the same day as the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation's release of its findings into· the Monarch crash, the minister announced that there would be an inquiry into the Civil Aviation Authority conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure and chaired by the  ·Morris); that the Civil Aviation Authority would be split; and that a whole host of other changes in relation to insurance and so forth would be implemented over the next few months as the government dealt with it in its legislative program. I told the minister at the time that I felt he had made one mistake: he was splitting the Civil Aviation Authority in two to differentiate between its regulatory and commercial functions but the new regulatory body was still reporting to the chief executive officer of the CAA and to the board of the CAA. I thought that was an inappropriate split and would not overcome one of the principal problems that had been identified in my work which was that the commercial interests of the CAA often overrode the regulatory interests of the CAA. To leave the structure in the way that he had originally proposed would mean that the commercial interests would still overlap the regulatory needs of the authority. Having said that, following the Seaview crash in October of last year the minister then duties. took the opportunity to follow that up. He decided to create two totally separate and independentorganisations..:-the two organisaality tions we are debating in the legislation today. Before going into the legislation in specific terms, I make the point that this legislation comes to the parliament before completion of our aviation safety inquiry chaired by the honourable member for ShortElliott), land. The inquiry will not two or three more months. I hope it will be concluded by the end of August. The Morris committee has not fully finished the process of review and inquiry that it has been underobvious taking for quite some time now. I would expect that we will be back in this House at some future date-I hope sooner rather than later-to add further amendments to these two bills which will reflect the findings and recommendations of what is commonly called the Morris committee. I take this opportunity to thank the chairman of committee, the member for Shortland. He has been a good chairman throughout the process that we have been engaged in. I also thank the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) who has been a very diligent attendee of all of the aviation safety inquiry hearings. He has shown a great interest in this issue. 1 would like him for his considerable contribution to the inquiry. Both of us, as well as other members of the committee, have put a lot of our time into this inquiry. Therefore, we want to ensure that, at the conclusion of our studies, our findings will be reflected in further amendments to this legislation. I am sure the honourable member for Shortland and the honourable member for Corio would agree with me that, in the course of running this inquiry, we have heard some incredible stories from people in the Civil Aviation Authority and those associated with the industry. These stories would lead us to . believe that theCAA is an organisation at civil war with itself. There seems to be an enormous problem based around personalities and interest groups within the organisation which reduces the effectiveness and capacity of the Civil Aviation Authority to perform its This is a major problem. It leads to personclashes and leadership problems. We have seen these problems created over time. We have seen the opportunity to make chanmore ges along the way. Some of the changes which have come before us are reflected in the the legislation which was introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr to which he referred in his second be completed for reading speech. A number of personnel changes have occurred since this process began. The most one is the departure of the former chief executive officer of the CAA, Doug Roser, and the departure of the former head of the directorate of aviation safety regulation, George Macionis. Whilst my colleagues on the safety inquiry would agree with me that many of the problems of the Civil Aviation Authority hinged on personalities, we have seen some personnel changes there. But it that goes beyond those people who have already left. It has been put to us that if we are to see the new organisations-CASA and AAestablished and working effectively we have to see a marked change in the culture and attitudes of those people who switch across from the CAA to the two new organisations which are tasked with the job of overseeing to thank safety in the aviation industry. Many people say there is no point in introducing new legislation bringing administrative changes, unless the attitudes of those people change and change .dramatically. That is where leadership plays an important role. The new head ofCASA, Mr Leroy Keith from the United States, is already in Australia. He has been here since the end of March. A great deal of hope and expectation rests on his shoulders as people look to him to provide the much needed leadership that the CAA lacked. As we have heard from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott), Leroy Keith will be assisted by a small but, we hope, expert and effective board, but a great deal of expectation and hope rests on their shoulders. I for one-and I know many others-sincerely hope that Leroy Keith and his fellow board members are .successful because, in the end, it is in everybody's interest that they are. It is in nobody's interest that they are not successful. I will continue to act as a watchdog over the operations of the new organisations-the CASA and AA-as I have done for quite some time now over the old CAA. I think I have proven to anybody interested in the subject that I have a capacity to find out what is going on, regardless of the wishes of people with contrary views. I will c?ntinue. to be vigilant. I hope that others assocIated WIth this industry will also be vigilant. I notice that one of the industry organisations, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, has undergone a considerable change in recent times. A new leadership group has taken charge of that organisation. I sincerely hope that they prove to be an effective watchdog and keep an industry eye on the operations of both CASA and AA. One of the unintended consequences of all these changes and revelations about aviation safety in Australia has been that the leadership of AOPA has changed as a consequence of all the public focus on aviation safety. A new and vigorous team, led by Dick Smith and his senior vice-president, Boyd Munro, is now actively engaged in stamping their mark on aviation in Australia at the moment in a way that we have not seen before. They have been very active and very persuasive in their lobbying activities. Aviation desperately needs an effective, capable and a fearless watchdog to speak out on issues of concern when it comes to aviation safety. They need to be fearless because the track record of those who have spoken out in the past shows that people have been subject to persecution by the organisation that they have criticised, whether they are members of it or members of the aviation industry. For example, in my case, my actions have led the CAA to attempt to sue me and to silence me from saying what I have been saying. The CAA is an organisation with a proven track record of being prepared to attack people who speak out against it. That is why we need a fearless voice to keep a watch over what goes on. I believe the whole purpose of my activities over the past nearly two years has been proven worthwhile, and the proof of that is in this legislation before the House today. That brings me to the legislation that is before us today. Those of us on the Morris committee have. had a chance to look through this legislation in some detail. We did it in the company of members of the industry who gave us· their considered opinions about what changes needed to be made to the original legislation. I believe that was a very helpful and useful process. It pleased many of those people in the industry to be given the opportunity to participate in that process. I believe the recommendations which the committee made and which have now been presented in the parliament by the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Shortland, have been well considered by the committee and those in the industry. I am pleased to see that so many of these recommendations have been picked up by the government and added to its list of amendments. It is a good process which should be undertaken on other occasions when we have bills of this nature before the House. One of the principal changes that the Morris committee put forward which was not picked up in its entirety relates to the main objects of the bill. The committee felt that it was necessary to enforce the views that the committee and people in the industry had about what the main objects of the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority should be. The main objects of the bill that we put forward in our recommendation specifically referred to an 'economical and effective' way of operating the authority. It also referred to more people being able to benefit from civil aviation. That last aspectthat is, more people being able to benefit from civil aviation-was dropped by the government, and you have heard the parliamentary secretary's reasoning for that. In my view, the purpose of our making that recommendation on the main objects of the bill was to reinforce the need to undertake a careful scrutiny of the costs of anything done by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority versus the benefits. It is always one of the major bugbears that people in the industry have that CAA does not always often carry out what you would call a ratjonal cost benefit analysis of everything that it does. The purpose of one of the amendments that we will be moving today is to ensure that the CASA obtains the maximum safety dividend from every decision that it makes. The next amendment that we will be moving is (3)(1)(a), which reinforces the same point yet again. I want to make it quite clear that in that amendment we use the expression 'economical and effective'. I am sure anybody who would look at these things would say that you could hardly get much of an opposition going to an amendment which asks an authority like this to be 'economical and effective' in the way it carries out its functions. We also use the expression 'promotes and fosters aviation'. When we use the word 'promotes', we do not mean that CAS A should set up a promotions division. The use of the expression 'promotes and fosters' is designed to reinforce the message that we have to get as many people enjoying the benefits of aviation in this country as possible. Despite the accidents of late, aviation still a very safe form of transport in this country. The amendment is designed to ensure that everything is focused on maximising safety by increasing participation in the industry and, therefore, increasing the viability of operators, which in tum improves their capacity to operate in a safe manner. Our next amendment deals with clause 57subsection 20A (1) and 20A(2). As theparliamentary secretary said in his speech, this has been an issue of some debate over recent times. The government's original legislation changed the old legislation to introduce the word 'potential' - the potential to put at risk a person's life or the potential to put at risk a person's property. The parliamentary secretary has pointed out that, on the advice of the Attorney-General's office and on the urging of the new Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association executive team, this part of the amendments to the old legislation has been withdrawn and the old section will be reinstated, subject to a review of the whole proposal surrounding 20A(I) and 20A(2) by the Morris committee. That is an interesting way of going about it, and it is one that many of us can see has some value. But it is the view of the opposition, as it is the view of people in the industry, that we need to address this issue quickly and effectively. The amendment the opposition will be moving later today is designed to ensure that we maximise the safety value of CAS A operations and that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is in a position to adequately and appropriately prosecute people who are offenders and who put people's lives and property at risk. The opposition's amendments, which relate to putting the life or property of another person at risk, duplicate the regulations in other countries. We have an amendment which is exactly the same as the United States, the UK and New Zealand. Those countries have been operating an amendment similar to the one we propose to move for many years and have found it to be effective in running successful prosecutions, maximising the resources of the safety regulator to protect public safety and maintaining the is respect of people who operate within the industry for the safety regulator. It is interesting to note that our amendment to subsections 20A(1) and 20A(2) will reflect not only the words used for the same purposes in other countries but also, almost identically, the words used in the ICAO agreement. Chapter 3.1.1 of the general rules of the ICAO agreement in annex No.2 states: An aircraft shall not be operated in a negligent or reckless manner so as to endanger life or property of others. That is the substance of the amendment the opposition will be moving today. It is part of the ICAO general rules and part of the responsibilities of the Civil Aviation Authority of old and CASA of new to actually pick up. The whole purpose of ICAO is to ensure that safety regulations are compatible from country to country. Australia has not been compatible in this particular aspect of safety regulation with ICAO. We could say, 'That is fine. We don't have to adhere to every single word of the ICAO general rules.' But if a country chooses not to take up an ICAO general rule or safety regulation, there is a provision for it to do so by giving notice to ICAO that it chooses not to take up that particular regulation. CAA Australia has not chosen to do that. So we are wrong on both counts. We have not picked up the spirit of the ICAO regulations, as exhibited in annex 2 of its general rules, and we have not notified ICAO of the fact that we have failed to do that. What the opposition is proposing in this amendment is a reflection of the rules and regulations of ICAO-an organisation of which Australia is a leading member and an organisation with which we have a signed convention that commits us to the implementation of ICAO rules and regulations unless we otherwise give notice of not intending to do so. So the amendment that the opposition will be moving later today is a key amendmentone which we believe shows that Australia has not been living up to its commitments under this international convention and that Australia has been allowed to fall behind in safety regulation standards that other countries have been enjoying. I know the concerns about this regulation and this amendment centre on the ability to prosecute, and I know that the government, people in the department and people in the industry are keen to ensure that this aspect of the billsubsections 20A(1) and 20A(2)-gives the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority the maximum capacity to undertake prosecutions and to undertake them successfully. The experience in other countries proves that, if the amendment that the opposition will be putting forward is adopted, this will be so. I have a letter here from a United States lawyer, Mr Yodice. He has been general counsel to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association in the United States for the last 35 years, defending pilots against prosecution by the FAA. He will tell you that the FAA is successful in between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of all of its prosecutions, that there is no concern about the way this part of the regulation works in the United States and that it is the most used regulation for the purposes of prosecution. Therefore, what we are proposing in our amendment has been used successfully and frequently in countries such as the United States, as exhibited by the letter I just referred to. If we adopt this amendment, it will give the Civil Aviation Authority the opportunity to direct its resources to the areas where they are most needed. Indeed, if you listened to the· evidence put before the Morris committee, the Monarch coronial inquiry and the Seaview judicial inquiry, you will realise that one of the great problems that the Civil Aviation Authority has confronted in the past has been a lack of sufficient resources, despite some glaring deficiencies in the way airlines operate. This amendment quite unambiguously tells the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority that its first and foremost priority is to protect the lives of the travelling public and to let pilots be responsible for their own actions so long as they pose no risk to another person's life or another person's property. We believe this amendment will save the lives of innocent people. So we think it is an important amendment. We will be proposing some other amendments, and I will foreshadow those in the concluding moments of my speech. The amendments relate to ministerial directions. We would like to see ministerial directions tabled in the parliament within 15 sitting days of their being given, rather than, as proposed by the government, their being published in the annual report of the relevant authority. We believe it will promote good and open government. We also have some amendments to the Air Services Bill that relate to the tabling of Airservices Australia's corporate plan. We believe again that this is important for good and open government. They are some of the amendments .that we will be moving' late- in the debate today. ' We believe that the key amendment we will be putting forward recognises the need to make Australia's air safety regulations compatible with those of ICAD and of other countries that have adopted a similar. amendment-an amendment which in those countries has been operating successfully"" !lnd is th- most used regulation, in .. prosecuting people who offend against their' air ,saf«ty laws ... But, at the end of the day, the passage of this legislation will prove that those people who were killed oil Monarch flight 301 just on two years ago this weekend did not necessarily lose their lives in vain; that the subseam quent fallout and changes that have followed from the crash of that Monarch flight have led to, the saving of lives of other people in other commercial airlines around the country since that date.  p.m.)-I am pleased to partiCipate in this debate and to indicate my support for the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendinent Bill arid the Air Services Bill which are now before us. At the outset, let me express my appreCiation to the member' for' Hume (Mr Sharp) for the very great effort that he has into the inquiry into aviation safety- which we are conducting. His contribution and that of the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) have helped to provide consistency and a very solid base to the work that we ,have been carrying out. After listening to the member for Hume I am disappointed with some of his remarks, I will come back to them later. He has played, and is playing, a very valuable role in this work that is being adopted on a bipartisan basis. Having unanimously endorsed the report brought to us-and I understand this is the way things work sometimes and I understand the difficult position he finds himself in-he now has to make some presentation to the House on behalf of his colleagues. I know from discussions across the table that his heart is not really in it. He has to present those cases and those words. I am sure he would agree with me, and by the way he smiles at me now I know that what I am saying is correct. We understand that. Having .said that, I repeat that he is a very valuable member of the committee. The parliament and the aviation industry are fortunate to have a solid core of members conducting this most important inquiry. There can be no more important inquiry into public transport safety than the inquiry that we are conducting. It is the first opportunity for people who have lived for years, for decades, to make a clamour about the aviation industry and push thyir own particular barrow when making allegations. It is the first opportunity they have had to be able to provide evidence to support the allegations in that clamour. I sure, more than I 'am disappointed, that in many cases they have not been able to substantiate them. "" Our task is very much about sorting the oats from the chaff-that is, what are the substantive problems'; in simple terms, what is the best system for Australia; and how ought it be paid for? That is virtually the brief that we have been given in the reference from the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). The legislation before us is seen as essential as it puts into, place two new authorit\es, which time and circumstances demand must put be est-blished from 1 July. We understand that thqse new structures may well go into place, but there is' an expectation that the legislation may be modified subsequent to the receipt of our report and the report from Justice Staunton and his commission of inquiry into the Seaview tragedy. On page 11 of our report, we refer to what the Department of Transport said in a submission to the committee When inquiring into this legislation: One should not expect the establishment of CASA to be the only cure for the problems that beset the administration of aviation safety in Australia. The Department of Transport recognises this. The government may amend the legislation following consideration of the recommendations in the aviation safety report from our committee and the outcome of the commission of inquiry ... The inquiry is being conducted by Justice Staunton. The bills before us were the subject of an inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. As the member for Hume said, that is a new process. I would like to underline, as I said in my tabling statement, that it is a very healthy process. Not all legislation lends itself to this kind of treatment but on issues like this where there is a wide public interest, and a wide public priority, you can be sure that the organisations being established and the legislation being examined go to the very heart of protecting the public in the use of transport services. In the tabling statement, we mentioned the recommendations we were making to the government. I come before the House this afternoon confident that the treatment we gave to that legislation and to the report was correct and appropriate. During the inquiry thus far we have had more than 220 submissions; over 100 exhibits; 93 witnesses, with more to come; 16 days of hearing, with more to come; and almost 8,000 pages of evidence. Departments like the Department of Finance have yet to give evidence. We have had various committees, groups and associations come before us and they have all made contributions. The point I want to make is that when you look at the whole area of aviation safety, the starting point is not the regulations but the state of the industry. In many ways, it is very similar to the state of the shipping industry when we started the Ships of shame inquiry. In this inquiry we are looking at general aviation and commuter services. It must be remembered that this legislation is not about the operation of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association alone and it is not about general aviation alone, it is about all aviation services operated in this nation. The legislation before us provides for the whole industry and within that some of the lesser activities of the industry. It is very clear from the submissions and the evidence that we have taken thus far that the industry is in oversupply in the general aviation sector. The general aviation sector has, with the exception of supplementary air licences and commuter services, to the best of my knowledge, always been a deregulated industry. Aviation safety requirements are set out in the legislation, but there is no economic regulation of the industry. There is free entry and free exit as long as you can pay the required fees and obtain the necessary licences. We were told in Moorabbin a few months ago that if you have $800 in your pocket in the morning, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, we can have Hollis Airlines in operation this afternoon. It can be done that fast. You do not need a pilots licence because we were told that that would be fixed for you. That is the way the industry operates. That freedom of entry and exit is a factor in the oversupply. This oversupply within the industry means that we have too many aeroplanes chasing too little business for too little return. That generates pressure to cut comers. We have also been told in evidence that there is selective observation of the regulations. No amount of bashing of the chief executives of the CAA, regional inspectors, flight worthiness inspectors, airworthiness surveyors or district flying operation inspectors is going to fix the problem. We have an industry, albeit a small element of that industry, that thinks it is quite all right to observe those regulations that it feels are appropriate to its line of business. If anybody questions what I am saying now, you only have to look at the transcript of our hearings in Brisbane on 7 April last. It is this issue of the observation of the regulations where the problem starts. The problem has been exacerbated in recent years by continuing instability within the management and leadership of the Civil Aviation Authority. It is very difficult for people to give their best day after day and week after week no matter what slings and arrows and abuse are directed their way from all quarters. They are totally unable to defend themselves. These are cheap shots by some people in the media and some people with vested interests in the industry. These are the things that we have become aware of-and I am sure the member for Hume agrees with me-during the inquiry. That is the observation we have made from the evidence that has come before us. Some of the regulations are stupid. Responsible regulators do not observe those regulations because they are stupid. I do not know of any other industry in this nation that operates in this fashion. We must remember that we are talking about a small segment of the industry, not the industry as a whole. We are talking about a sector of the general aviation industry. It seems to the committee as though the instability in management and leadership is an infection that goes down the line and it is then exploited by people at the coalface-that is, those who are required to observe the regulations. This can result, as it seems it has, in variations in the application of regulations and responsibilities. A sector of the general aviation industry seems to be happier to be at war with other sectors of the industry and the Civil Aviation Authority than it is to work together to try to create a better performing industry-an industry in which there could be pride about its performance and an excellent public image generated so that it would attract more business. We have noted some joumalism and media performances in the general aviation sector. The industry seems to have lived for yearseven decades-on conflict and generating conflict within the industry and about the industry, the regulators and the regulations. Everyone says that it is always the regulations which are to blame, rather than some of the participants, but most of the time it is a combination of both. My personal view is that the industry would be in a much better state and probably much better off commercially if a lot more time was spent promoting the positive aspects and the achievements of the industry, rather than creating division, alarm and exaggeration. Much of the input from the general aviation sector appears to be from vested interests or from journalists in one way or another. The problem in this area is that there has virtually never been any input from the people who use the services. I ask my colleague the member for Hume-through you,",59
89,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION,"whether he feels the same about this. I know that it was very difficult to find a point of view or a submission from a passenger. There is no passenger association or organisation that has a voice for the people who pay for the services at the end of the procedure. That is one of the problems that organisations like the Civil Aviation Authority have had, and the CAA's successor will have the same problem. They have been trying to guess what it is that the public wants. I see that as being a very valuable role for our committee to play. I know that members of the committee have sought to think along the lines of what is right for the passenger and what is the public entitled to expect in terms of safety and efficiency standards from services within the industry. That is something we have to be vigilant about-especially as we conclude our report. The other factor that grows out of that is that the bureaucrats sitting in the middle get bashed. They are asked questions along the lines of, 'How could you possibly let this happen?' The minister gets the same. He is asked, 'How could this possibly be allowed to happen?' So regulations get tighter, things get tougher and the bureaucrats build more and more rings of defence around themselves, until we get to the point where there is overregulation and over-rigidity. I want to touch quickly on the section 20A amendment, which will be moved later by the member for Hume. I am puzzled about this, and I will relate the circumstances to the House so that honourable members are fully aware of what happened. When the committee was asked to look at these two bills, we invited what we believed to be all interested parties-including the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association-to make a submission. It did not make a submission. Its vice-president was in the audience at our public hearing on 26 April, and we exchanged some courtesies and nice words to each other after the hearings were over. My understanding is that AOPA did not have this information available to it at the time. I am at a loss to understand why my colleague the member for Hume, for whom I have great respect, is now being asked to move that section 20A be amended; rather than, as the minister decided, referring the matter back to our own committee for consideration. I have confidence in the honourable member's judgment and his investigative capabilities. His colleagues also ought to have confidence in his investigative capabilities, his performance and his contribution to the work of the committee-. This section deals with an area which was put to us a number of times during our inquiry. We questioned the CAA ,about the number of prosecutions-that is, how well it was doing its job-and we found that there were very few prosecutions, relatively speaking. When we followed that on, the answer we got was that it was difficult to get the evidence required for the Director of Public Prosecutions to initiate - an action. The DPP then 'referred that to the minister and the department, and the amendment' that came forward is the amendment to the bill, which is now going to be proposed to be deleted and the matter referred back to us for examination .. We need to understand the process that takes place here. There is a defect in the existing legislation. It is difficult to put into practice. The process then is that the minister gives drafting instructions to parliamentary counsel. Parliamentary counsel---;the laWyers that they are-drafts the legislation. The legislation is before us; it is parliamentary counsel's version of words that.are appropriate for the task. The next step is that it is being questioned here. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) provides some other advice. One, I think, Laurence Gruzman QC provides some other advice. I suggest to you, Mr Speaker, that however many lawyers you ask for advice will be the number of different views you are likely to get. Given the special circumstances of that clause and its importance, the most appropriate course is to send it back to us to be looked at in the continuing activity of the committee. It has been said that section 20A does not conform with the ICAO convention-in particular, paragraph 3.1.1 of annex 2 to the ICAO convention. The ICAO convention deals with international civil aviation. Whilst Australia adopts standards contained in the convention as Australian law, it is not obliged to do so. Section 20A, while not in strict conformance with annex 2 of the convention, does not place Australia in breach of its international obligations. I am really puzzled that suddenly this matter-a matter that was not raised by any of the major operators in the aviation industry in this nation who participated in our inquiry into the legislation-is now raised at this late hour and put forward as a matter of great urgency. I am afraid that I cannot accept that. It has been there for a ,very long time. It did not suddenly become a matter of urgency in the last 14 days upon this advice from Laurence Gruzman QC being secured; it has been there for a long time. Tha- legislation does not put us in conflict with convention, and it is peculiar to Australia. But we know that the Aircraft Owners and Pilots' Association has carried out a vigorous campaign during the last few weeks about that section. The government has acknowledged some of those concerns which have been raised in relation to the amendment. That is why the minister has decided that it be referred to our coinmittee for examination and report to the parliament. What we will have to do is strike an appropriate balance between the public interest in· preventing dangerous flying, on the one hand, and the legitimate needs of the aviation - sector, on the other. As I said· earlier, when all those in the aviation industry in this nation-except for those people who fly because they love to fly-do not have any problem with .the legislation, we will have to be convinced about why there is suddenly such an horrendous problem for those who love to fly and not for all the major operators in the airlines who really are the great bulk of the aviation industry in this country. That is not to say that those who love to fly should not be listened to. Yes, they have, to be listened to, but it will be done in a context of all Australian conditions. It is on that basis that we will be looking at this. I would like to invite everybody who has a view about it to make a submission to the inquiry, particularly the larger organisations and some of the lesser organisations in which private fliers and pilots are involved. The US legislation has been referred to, and it has been said how wonderful that legislahave tion is. That legislation is suitable for a US climate of civil aviation and private flying. is a totally diff-rent climate in legislative terms, commercial terms and general environplace. mental terms to the climate in Australia. Certainly, it is vastly different in terms climate in relation to the industry itself where each of the sectors of the industry fits together. We look forward to that examination of legislation that is ahead of us. I believe that it is the most appropriate course to be folit! lowed by the government. I am sure that, this when we come back, we will have had a chance to have a good look at that, with interests of all parties in clause 20A of legislation before us having been adequately dealt with and the interests of all aviation served. The recommendations that were made by the committee, we believe, received excellent treatment from the government in that most of those recommendations are being picked up.

91,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Finance and Leader of the House. I refer the minister to statements made by two of the central figures in the Hindmarsh Island bridge saga, both of whom claimed yesterday that the secret women's business was fabricated. Why has the government refused to instruct the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to attend question time today and explain to the parliament his gross failure of responsibility and incompetence the Hindmarsh Island bridge affair?",69
92,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One of the reasons we not instructed him, in your words, to appear here to discuss this is, at least in part, It related to the way in which the opposition has handled this issue since it first arose in this You thieved box loads full of documents, you asked bogus questions of the of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait and Islander Affairs in which you pretended that he was responsible for a set of leaks that you were directly responsible for yourselves, and you fabricated a case against him. And you expect us to all stand up and applaud you for You followed that up, during last week and week, with a series of propositions to him on this precise matter, everyone of which the was demonstrated to be falsely based, and the everyone of which you put forward in the course of your questions to him was demonbest strated to be without foundation. The minister for Aboriginal affairs has pointed out repeatedly in this place that he acted on advice. He acted on an appropriately structured assessment, both on his part and on the part of the South Australian government at the cultural issues involved in this. He received that advice. You challenged he had acted on that advice and you presented an alternative timetable, which was proved to be wrong. The minister received that advice and subsequently acted on that advice. That advice and his actions were subsequently the subject of court consideration, which happens to be continuing. You must not think we think your handling of this situation requires us to stand aside from the normal roster processes when you will have yet another opportunity to present your views and have them knocked back by the minister for Aboriginal affairs tomorrow. We do not see the particular urgency in bringing him in here at precisely this moment to discuss this with you. He has obviously acted in the only way a minister can act when a proposition is put up where there may be Aboriginal sacred issues involved, and respond to a properly constituted investigative process associated with that. When it comes to Aboriginal affairs, you on in the other side of the House occasionally have the words but you never have the music. You talk up a storm about being inclusive, about having opposed us, having belaboured the High Court, having slandered-not necessarily the people here but Liberals elsewhere-the High Court on native title. We finally got the Leader of the Opposition's statement yesterday-as though nothing has passed before, as though we all had 24-hour memories-that the native title legislation is through and we now accept it. Dr Kemp interjecting",69
93,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"How big of you to do that. You go through all of that. You have this Midas touch. When you think you have an opportunity to make a bit of politi-al capital out of it, you will actually do anythmg in this area. You will slander the people involved, steal documents, circulate documents, photocopy secret documents and breach every conceivable oath a minister would be obliged to be held to, and you expect us all to stand up here and applaud you and put ourselves out for you. NA Suspenstion of Standing and Sessional",70
94,Mr DOWNER,KEATING GOVERNMENT,I seek leave to move a motion of censure on the government forthwith. Leave not granted.,70
95,Mr DOWNER,KEATING GOVERNMENT,"I move: That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Mayo moving forthwith that this House censures the government for abrogating the principle of ministerial responsibility by refusing to havthe Minister for Aboriginal and Torres StraIt Islander Affairs attend the House at question time today to answer serious questions on matters directly relevant to his ministerial responsibilities. The fact is that the headline in today's Adelaide Advertiser says it all. This is a headline which exposes the way the government and, in particular, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) has behaved in this whole tawdry affair. The fact is that the revelations that we read in the Adelaide Advertiser today and that we saw on Channel 10 last night are revelations by Aboriginal people who were centrally involved in the whole of the Hindmarsh Island bridge affair.

98,Mr DOWNER,KEATING GOVERNMENT,"And indeed people like the minister who cast around words like 'hypocrite', which, by the way, I thought used to be unparliamentary, the hypocrisy is on that side of the House because what you people do the whole time is try to play the Aboriginal card. You like to play the black card. That is what you do. If anybody ever criticises the Labor Party's Aboriginal affairs policy, you sneer at them and say they are racist. That is what you people have been doing. You have been exploiting Aboriginal people for all you possibly can for politic-l purposes: That is the track record of thIS Labor government. Orders",70

100,Mr SPEAKER,KEATING GOVERNMENT,Order! Those on my right!,70
101,Mr DOWNER,KEATING GOVERNMENT,"In fact, what you have done, despite the establishment of a reconc!liation council, is not only set AustralIan against Australian but, as the Hindmarsh Island bridge affair has proven beyond doubt, set Aboriginal person against Aboriginal person. Instead of shouting at your political opponents, you should all be sitting there hanging your h-as in shame. There is no better illustration of the shame of the Labor Party in this matter than what we have read in today's Adelaide Advertiser. Mrs Sarah Milera, one of the central figures in the Hindmarsh Island bridge affair, came out in an interview with the Adelaide Advertiser yesterday and said: ... the ""women's business"" was fabricated after it became obvious a legitimate claim based on two archaeological sites, including a burial ground, was not enough to convince the Federal Government to stop the bridge. This woman is of particular significance. Most of you will not know this because you will not have been told this by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, who has not got the decency to turn up today. You will be familiar with Cheryl Saunders's report. In her report she basically used two sources as the foundation for her support for the secret 'women's business' claim. One of those people was Doreen Kartinyeri and the other was Sarah Milera. What Cheryl Saunders said about Sarah Milera was that Sarah perceives herself and is accepted by others as a custodian of the law of the land. She spoke of Dr Fergie, the anthropologist, who argues that 'Sarah's experiential spiritual knowledge provides a complementary emphasis on the particular significance of this area in Aboriginal tradition.' But the point here is fundamental- Mrs Milera was a crucial figure in supporting the Tickner case, if you could call it that, to ban the Hindmarsh Island bridge. She has come out and made it perfectly clear that this whole exercise was a fabrication. She has been supported by her estranged husband, who yesterday wrote to the minister-and you will be pleased to know this letter was copied to others, such as the Premier of South Australia and the South Australian Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Mr Milera, in his letter, said: I feel I have been used by othersone of your friends, actuallyto further their cause and not our cause . . . ours being the cause of Aboriginal people. He went on to say in his letter: People we considered to be our friends, unionists, the Friends of Kumarangk and other bridge protestwere ers used my Aboriginal heritage for the purpose stopping a project that they were unsuccessful at stopping. Pretty damning words. You should blush when you hear those words. He goes on to say",70
102,Unknown,KEATING GOVERNMENT,Government members interjecting,71
103,Mr DOWNER,KEATING GOVERNMENT,You jeer at him. You sneer at him. You sneer and jeer at Mr Milera and Sarah Milera but these are people whose earlier evidence has been used by the minister to ban the building of the bridge. Now you are sneering at them. He went on to say: My wife and I got swept along with the current and we got in so deep it was hard to get out again. Now is the time to speak out and I feel the bridge would be a good thing for the whole community ...,71
104,Unknown,KEATING GOVERNMENT,"Government members interjectingYou ought to listen, instead of howling. He goes on: both blacks and whites, and the bridge would do more for reconciliationwhich you people say you believe in, although I sometimes doubt itthan what the government is doing. They are pretty damning words from Mr Milera but, above all, they are damning words for the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. These are words that must ultimately lead to the resignation of that minister. That minister has been exposed as being grossly irresponsible in the fulfilment of his duties. He is a man, supported by the rest of the government-not least the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon)who has set Aboriginal person against Aboriginal person. That is it pretty deplorable record for a minister for Aboriginal affairs to boast of, which no doubt he does. These interviews, this evidence, are in my view and in the view of this side of the House extraordinarily damaging and damning. The minister's record in this whole affair has been a very bad record in many other respects. One of the respects in which his record has been bad is revealed by the judgment of the Federal Court judge Justice O'Loughlin. Justice O'Loughlin said that the minister had failed to properly consider the representations that made to him. He said that as a matter of of probability the minister did not give any consideration to the representations at all. It is quite clear that the judge was right and the minister was wrong. The minister has not been listening to a large number of Aboriginal people in South Australia on this affair. He has been ignoring them. Indeed, it is perfectly obvious that he made up his mind to ban the bridge long before he said he made the decision to ban the bridge. We ought to think about this. The minister said he made the decision to ban the bridge at 11.15 on 9 July 1994. The minister said that he had a phone call with Dean Brown, the Premier of South Australia, and that in that phone conversation they discussed the bridge and the minister had, as the minister himself admitted, not made up his mind as to whether to ban the bridge or not at the time of that phone call. That phone call finished at 11.08 and the minister made up his mind at 11.15. So in seven minutesMr Bilney-Dean Brown is very persuasive.",71
105,Mr DOWNER,KEATING GOVERNMENT,"It is not a trivial matter. In seven minutes the minister claims to have made up his mind to ban the bridge for 25 years. My time is expiring, Mr Speaker. I remain convinced that this government will go down in history as a government that has cynically exploited Aboriginal people, and never let that be forgotten. These headlines just about say it all about you people and what you have done. It is a disgrace that the minister is not here to answer these charges. (Time expired)",72
106,Mr SPEAKER,KEATING GOVERNMENT,Is the motion seconded?,72
107,Mr MCLACHLAN,KEATING GOVERNMENT,"I second the motion. In doing so, there are many other reasons why this censure motion should be brought forward and why the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) should come into this House and answer these questions. For example, why does the minister not come in here and tell us why nobody from his department got in touch with the only source of the women's knowledge alive todayLaura Kartinyeri? Why does he not come in here and say, 'I knew because Doreen wrote me a letter, yet I chose not to pass that information on to my reporter Cheryl Saunders'? When Cheryl Saunders did not mention Laura Kartinyeri' s name in 56 pages of the report, why does he not come in here and tell us why he did not give people time to check up on the one source who is alive? Why does the minister not come in here and tell us why he did not give discovery of documents to his opponents, when he was using the might of the Commonwealth against the citizens of that Commonwealth? If he had nothing to hide, why would he not have given discovery? He does not have to give discovery in a judicial review, as we know; but, when discovery was asked for on three occasions and six FOIs, every time that was resisted. Why has he not chased up the people who have come out in the last few weeks: Dorothy Wilson, who was there at all of the meetings; Dulcie Wilson, 63 years old; and Bertha Gollan, 75 years old-very respectable people? Why has nobody been to see them? They are very senior Ngarrindjeri people, much more senior than the source of the information, Doreen Kartinyeri. Why has nobody been to see them? Do you know why? Because it just might be that this thing is a fabrication and a hoax. It is now quite clear, as Doug Milera has said again this morning, that the women's business is all fabricated. You might say: who is he? Who is Doug Milera? Doug Milera is one of the litigants against the Chapmans in this Federal Court case. He is not just somebody who has walked in off the street; he is one of the litigants. Who is his estranged wife? She is quoted by Professor Cheryl Saunders in her report as being one of the two people who are seminal to the whole of the women's business-that is, Doreen Kartinyeri and Sarah Milera. Both of them have now said, 'It's a hoax.' There are not going to be many left by the end of next week. All this time the minister simply refuses to answer these questions. For example, did it not occur to him that this was overturning 140 years of anthropological history? Did it not occur to him that his reporter had never been near the Adelaide Museum, the greatest repository of anthropological information? That has been confirmed by the director of the museum. It has now also been confirmed by the senior anthropologist, who said last Friday, 'Well, sometimes these ideas blow in from the desert.' Why did the minister refuse to pay compensation to the Chapmans? Here is the might of the Commonwealth being used against citizens who are investing money in this country, and all of a sudden the minister says no compensation. On the other hand, he was writing to ATSIC at the very same time saying, 'If we get sued successfully or we have to compensate the South Australians, just tell us whether you will pay us. some money because the Prime Minister and the cabinet want to know how much it will cost'-not whether the women's business was true but how much it will cost. He says, 'So we will break the people down there'-my constituents-'and then when we have done that we will make sure that, if somebody has to pay, ATSIC has to pay because, after all, don't forget they were one of the protagonists in the matter.' This minister will not come here. He himself should be censured. He should resign because he has not answered any of the answers in the last three weeks. My guess is that he will not answer them because he knows that, if he does, he will have to resign.",72
108,Mr BEAZLEY,KEATING GOVERNMENT,"We will oppose this motion. It is based on the same tendentious nonsense that the Liberals have every time they have stood up to, present a case in this place. There are one or two. in elements which can arouse some justified resentment on this side of the House. The Acting Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), stood up and accused us of playing politics with Aboriginal affairs. He sits where he does now and not at the table precisely because he monumentally played politics with Aboriginal affairs in his brief period as the most unsuccessful Liberal leader since Billy MCMahon. Rightly was he removed from that position. Talk about our case. allegedly playing politics with Aboriginal affairs! This feilow rocked in in front of the ern Australian members of the Liberal PartyManager the increasingly discredited, stinking Western Australian Liberal Party that finds· one ideological excuse after another to get stuck into the weaker people of Western Australia, to give themselves some sense of personal justification-stood up in front of them and said, 'Of course, when we get in we are going to be walking back from this native title proposition. Don't you worry about us.' went off into the middle of the desert revealed his total ignorance of Aboriginal affairs, which he now purports to lecture us on. He had the most unsuccessful visit to central Australia since Lasseter and Bourke and Wills. He found himself, without a drink and without common sense, sitting there in the middle of the desert. He comes in here to lecture us on this matter now and asks us to drop everything for them. This' performance started with the wholesale theft of government documents connected with a court case-not political, not policy documents. These documents were in photocopied, including, I bet London to a brick, the women's evidence. I do not believe that a junior officer in the office of the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), alone and uniquely failed to photocopy that element of it. I do not believe for one minute that that was the case. They were thieved. The material the Commonwealth's case was sent to the lawyers who were appearing against the Commonwealth. The material was also then presented sent to the newspapers. If that were not bad enough, he stands up this place and suggests that the Minister for Aboriginaland Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) had been responsible for the public revelation of women's business and that he had been responsible for forwarding this material-thousands of copies-around the countryside. He said that the minister had been responsible for ensuring that the Advertiser got that and, by implication, the minister had been responsible for handing over all this documentation to the other side in the court The member for Barker resigned from the front bench anq was subsequently censured by this parliament. Of all people, you should not Westbe, acting in the same way as the Acting of Opposition Business is acting. He has no right to move motions in this place, new and you have no right to second them. Mr Downer-No right to move motions?",73
109,Mr BEAZLEY,KEATING GOVERNMENT,"You have no moral right, in the circumstances in which you find yourself. Not content with this display on your part of a complete neglect of any sense of He personal responsibility that any average and member· of parliament would have, you persist. At the beginning of this week the Acting Manager of Opposition Business came in here and assigned great significance to the proximity between telephone calls from Dean Brown and an ultimate decision in this case. Let us cast our minds back to how that particular question arose. That question arose from your belief-again erroneously on your part-that the minister had taken his decision before he received advice from Cheryl Saunders. That was how you based your claim at the beginning of this week. Then suddenly, to your horror, you discovered that he received that advice on the 7th and that it was a couple of days later that he took his decision. Then you tried to make some sort of darned case out of some motion that purely vital documents had been lost. We had a rerun of the sorts of the lines that you argued in relation to the theft of those documents. Then you discovered that all those issues that you raised were complete irrelevancies. So now you are coming into have another go on this. I am not going to be in the business of slandering anyone in this particular matter. It does happen to be the case that Aboriginal tradition is always a matter-if you know anything about it---of continuing development and argument in the Aboriginal community. You are never necessarily going to find consensus on anything in the Aboriginal community about what constitutes a tradition. You are not likely to find that. You to find that some tradition will be regarded by some Aboriginals as relevant now but that other Aboriginals will have regard for what was relevant in the past. Mr Milera was finally questioned on matter this morning, after those particular headlines which you have been waving about so cheerfully in this place. Admittedly, the presentation that he made in discussion with the radio station goes in a variety of directhought; tions. But let me just go through one direction with you. The interviewer, Mr Conlon, said: Well, that's different, isn't it? If you've got bring it out into the openthat is, the view of another person's in the Aboriginal communitythat's different from fabricating it. ; Mr Milera said: No, I don't believe it's a fabrication. This was said this morning. He continued: All I'm saying is that this was something that was practised and taught to our people for ail of those years, but we are different now. Mr Conlon said: But, Doug, you're just saying that it's not fabricated, that it w'lS there, it was part of your tradition. Is that righn Mr Milera said: Yeah, you're making it bloody hard for me. When you go through the rest of the transcript, you find that he appears to have a view that he believes that it is fabrication. When he was questioned a bit further, he said: Yes, the tradition is there certainly, but it's not a tradition which is any longer relevant to you. That is what his argument is. Mr Costello-If it is not relevant, build the bridge.",73
110,Mr SPEAKER,KEATING GOVERNMENT,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition! He seems to have moved up.,74
111,Mr BEAZLEY,KEATING GOVERNMENT,"When he asked whether it was a fabrication, he said: No, I don't believe it's a fabrication. Mr Costello-I am just trying to keep the truth.",74
112,Mr SPEAKER,KEATING GOVERNMENT,"No, I will adjudicate. You are going just worry about where you are. Mr Costello-1 worry about the truth.",74
113,Mr SPEAKER,KEATING GOVERNMENT,Order!,74
114,Mr BEAZLEY,KEATING GOVERNMENT,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition worries about the truth. That is a this new one. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is asked why he stood up in the court and said, 'I think the minimum safety net ought to be cut by about 25 per cent,' he says that was not the truth of what he really that it was because the Victorian employer federation told him to say that when he got into court. Who has told you to say to help what now that you are in here? As far as you are concerned, we know about all your comtradition mitments to the truth. Mr Costello interjecting",74

If you've got to help bring it out into the open, that's different from fabricating it. Mr Costello-Your policy is the size of your waist.",75
117,Mr SPEAKER,KEATING GOVERNMENT,I warn the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.,75
118,Mr BEAZLEY,KEATING GOVERNMENT,"Mr Milera replied: No, I don't believe it's a fabrication.

Mr Conlon said: But, Doug, you're just saying that it's not fabricated, that it was there, it was part of your tradition. Is that right? Mr Milera said: Yeah, you're making it bloody hard for me. What is happening with the Aboriginal community in the hands of the Liberal Party? As is so often the case, the Liberal Party says, 'Let us get in and batter; let us say the words that we think would cause the rest of Australia to think that we are supportive of the Aboriginal community and its rights; let us resist every change but, when the change is made, let us finally sign up to it and say that we're an inclusive people. But when it becomes an issue, when it becomes a question, let's find the way in which we can most demonise whatever particular Aboriginal commitment there is to whatever particular tradition this is. Let us do that.' That is your record. That is your personal performance before the Western Australians Mr Downer interjecting",75

How does that commentary rate Working Nation in' terms of meeting the needs of Australian job seekers?",75
122,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The OECD has commented very favourably on the Working Nation statemerit and other initiatives of the government. I will read to the House some of the appropriate quotes. This is what it said at page 62: ' The government's measures involve a far more comprehensive strategy of active'labour market assistance with close linkages with education, NOES training and skill enhancing measures than has ever , been attempted before in Australia. It goes on to say: It silenced the talk of the jobless recovery. It further says: It is a package which will, in a relatively efficient way, help ease the difficulties the long-term unemployed have experienced in obtaining a job. It goes on further to say:, - ustralia' s measures,' inchJding substantial expanSIon in the llUmber of entry level training places and the introduction of the training wage, are intended to improve Australia's skill base and hence the growth potential. ' Morris, P. F. Finally, it says: . It applauqs its initiative on competition, in the provision of case management, ,as was'seen through the innovative initiative iIi openin,g up that area for competition. This is the same document which those on the other side label a failure. Some failure! In terms of the international recognition of what has been achieved hete, that is what the PAIRS OECD had to say. But that is not what the opposition has to say. Yesterday we heard the Leader of the Oppos'ition cJeliver his so-called headland statement. What did it say about employment ' and training initia-ives and Working Nation? Absolutely nothing. At.least The Things :rhat Matter-and I see the former Leader of the Opposition has already left this placeallocated the first chapter to employment and education. I askJhe Leader of the Opposition: is that, an indication that these things no longer matter? ' . _ ' There was nothing' in the headland speech on skill formation and .training. There was nothing on the Working Nation, despite the fact that members on the-other side of the House. hre going _to their area consultative committees and coming forward with initiatives under Working Nation saying that they would support it if they got back; in office. Where is the commitment· to that in the so called headland speech? '. We do see a reference to the oppositIon being prepared to resource voluntaryorganisation's to lOOK 'after the unemployed. In other words, if they got into goverrimentthey would give up; they would hand the lot over to the Salvation Army, the Brotherhood of Laurence. They would give them no guidetion they want? lines in terms of the direction that they would expect them to take. The reality is that we do use those organisaand tions already. We use them and accredit them through the Employment Services Regulatory Authority to help us in terms of getting unemployed people, the long-term unemtion ployed in particular, back to work. Those opposite say that they will resource them but they do not say how; Those organisations, many other programs, are currently being happen. resourced under the Working Nation initiative. There is not one mention of that in this document, despite the fact that the OECD endorsed it. We have heard the Leader of the Opposieither tion and his cohorts say they are concerned about the battlers, and well they might. The only people who have been battling of late are those who have been trying to put a policy together in the Liberal Party. failed in this statement last night.

125,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I address my question to Mayo. the Leader of the House. I ask whether he is aware of comments made by Mr Malcolm The Turnbull, the Chairman of the Australian Republican Movement, who has said: I would really like to see the government promote and support a grassroots discussion on the our constitutional arrangements. I also ask whether he has heard the remarks of Professor Tony Blackshield, a professor law at the Macquarie University, who has said: The republic shouldn't be something handed down from on high.

Why is the Prime Minister so deterprocess. mined to give Australians the republic he St wants rather than let them have the constitu",77
126,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The opposition leader loves a throwaway line. He ought to know, indeed the Australian public knows, that nobody can give to the Australian people a constitutional change that the Australian people do not want. The Australian constitucannot be changed to create a republic, to change federal-state relations, to put in a bill of rights or whatever unless a majority of and people in four states decide that that will Nothing the Prime Minister says tonight is capable of being implemented without a full has and total discussion with the Australian people when, at the end of the day, they will give it the thumbs up or the thumbs down. That is the end of it. There is no possibility that the Australian people can have foist upon them the republic that they do not want. That is the sort of glib suggestion that They the opposition leader has put forward. The opposition leader tries to turn his process into a policy. He did a deal of policy Republic pinching in the remarks that he made yesterday. Virtually any area of substance in the remarks that he made yesterday was a policy pinch. The proposition that we should have a convention happens to be one that he has stolen from the unfortunate member for There are risks with a people's conference. risk is that a people's convention could rapidly come to be seen as a very expensive fraud. Unlike the people's conventions of the 1890s, it would not take place in a policy issue of vacuum or in a structural vacuum. The people's conventions in the 1890s were formulated against the background where the of Federation of the Commonwealth of Australia did not exist. There was no process therefore for them to determine the shape and structure of a constitution and no process for them to . They had to determine a constitution of own. They started with conventions and ended with a constitution. The subsequent of that constitution requires a The process starts not with a people's convention because it has no constitutional standing; it starts in the federal parliament. The federal parliament determines whether not a referendum will be put to the Australian people. The referendum is then put to the Australian people and they determine the lies? constitution they want. The constitution the people want is not determined for them by people's convention, it is not determined for claimedthem by the federal parliament; it is determined by them when they reach judgment upon it. The risk you have with a people's convention, which would be enormously expensive to get together, is that at the end of the you have a set of recommendations which, they are going to be of any effect whatsoever, must be accepted and passed through the parliament for the purposes of a referendum. The parliament will decide what is put to Australian people not anybody else and then the Australian people will decide whether they will have it or not. Whatever merits you might think lie in this proposition for a people's convention, we know that the origin of it was not respect the thinking of the average Australian was not a concern that the average Australian needed an opportunity to put forward suggesunder tions to change the constitution, it was an attempt to get out of a divisive debate within the Liberal Party. That may have merits from your point of view, but the problem within the Liberal Party is not necessarily a problem for the rest of the country. Before you go down the road of trying convince people around the place that how or other they are going to be capable determining a change in the constitution by elected people's convention, consider the fact that you have the potential to create a very expensive fraud. As for the Prime Minister's views and the government's views about what proposition on the republic ought to be the Australian people for discussion and their determination, I suggest you wait to hear the Prime Minister's remarks.

128,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Last night in his Cape a Barren speech, the Leader of the Opposition",78
129,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,78
130,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! We have had a laugh; the minister has got the call.,78
131,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Amongst other things, the day Leader of the Opposition claimed, 'Existing if taxation and welfare provisions disadvantage sole income families who have decided that one parent should be at home whilst children are very young.' That statement is completely the false, in so far as having any supporting argument put forward. It is based on the maximum amounts payable under the childcare cash rebate compared with the home child-care allowance. In fact, if we look at what is paid under for those provisions, we see that the average and it amount paid under the home child-care allowance exceeds the average amount paid the child-care cash rebate. In aggregate terms, around seven times as much is paid in the form of the home child-care allowance than is paid through the child-care cash rebate you have in each financial year. The more fundamental point is that this sort of analysis completely ignores the very to substantial amounts paid through the family somepayment system-separate from' HCCA and of the parenting allowances. That amounts to an some $6 billion a year, with the inclusion of the new maternity allowance which will come. in next financial year. Those payments are targeted on the basis of income. By virtue of the fact that they are targeted on the basis of put to income, a much higher average level of benefit goes to single income families than to dual income families. In an earlier question, I quoted the specific numbers on that. It is overwhelmingly the case that family assistance goes predominantly to single income households. This system of assistance is about to be very substantially enhanced from July this year, with the introduction of the new parenting allowance- The introduction of the parenting allowance in aggregate terms means that the total amount being paid on assistance to families will increase by around $400 million a year. I would have thought that that was a pretty good commitment for families. That comes into effect next month. Again, it is very much targeted to families that could be reasonably described as battlers-if that term has any meaning at all. Low income, working households-there are around 120,000 such families-stand to benefit to the tune, on average, of $117 a fortnight. This is an average of $117 in additional benefits which is going to be provided to these battling, low income, working households. I would have thought that was a pretty substantial commitment which builds on the very considerable measures we have already made. This new payment will subsume, absorb and enhance the existing home child-care allowance, which was itself a major improvement on what it replaced-that is, the with-child dependent spouse rebate. Another measure that comes into effect from July is a much better income test structure for this payment. The old home childcare allowance imported into the social security system the income test that previously applied to the with-child dependent spouse rebate. This meant that people could earn only $10.80 a fortnight before the taper cut in and they started to lose the entitlement. Under the new income test, they will be able to earn up to $60 a fortnight before the income test cuts in. So it is a vastly superior income test arrangement. All in all, we have gone from the with-child dependent spouse rebate to the home childcare allowance. The home child-care allowance meant that some 55,000 low income, working households got a significantly enhanced benefit because they did not have enough income to benefit fully from the tax rebate. It is a much more flexible system that enables people to enter and exit the work force. From July we will be enhancing that with a much higher level of assistance targeted to low income working households and a much superior design of the income test, which will be much more conducive to people putting forward work effort. So this is what this government has done. All we have had from the opposition in the Cape Barren speech are some platitudes about assistance to families. What it has singularly failed to do is come to grips with just exactly how such assistance would be delivered and how any possible assistance-whether it be through the tax system or the social security system-can be reconciled with its objective of tightening up, very considerably, on government outlays. It has an incoherent vacuous position, and nothing that was said last night in the Cape Barren speech does anything to rebut that proposition. Constitution: Reserve Powers",78
132,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Special Minister of State. The minister will be aware of the passions aroused in the Labor Party in 1975 in relation to the conventional reserve powers of the Governor General. The Republic Advisory Committee in its report some 20 months ago proposed, as an option for an Australian republic, that the constitution set out all the circumstances in which the head of state can exercise a reserve power. However, Senator Gareth Evans recently told a conference that codification of the reserve powers could not be done, 'unless . you have about 20 to 30 years at your disposal and infinite resources'. Can the Australian public now take it that the government accepts th!).t the president of the Keating republic, like Sir John Kerr in 1975, would be able to sack a future Gough Whitlam?",79
133,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a very lengthy question; I am sorry that I have to give you a short answer, but the matter is not my responsibility. You can listen to the Prime Minister tonight on that. Families",79
134,Mr SNOW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. I refer to media reports today concerning the plight of Australian families. What action has the government taken in the recent budget to improve the lot of Australian families? Is the government intending to take additional steps to assist Australian families?,79
135,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The recent budget was fundamentally focused at locking in sustained economic growth, ensuring ongoing job growth, keeping inflation low and ensuring downward pressure on interest rates. Basically, all those propositions advance the interests of Australian families and, indeed, all Australians. There were some specific measures in the budget. One of those measures is that families will benefit from a number of measures, such as targeting of child-care assistance; an extra $17 million to support women caring for children with special needs in 36,800 families; an additional $10 million over three years for carers of frail older people, the chronically ill or for people with disability. Included in the budget too amongst the measures to assist families was a proposition to spend some $24 million over two years for the childhood immunisation program. I do notice, in what was referred to as the Cape Barren speech, given last night, that there was some mention made of a childhood immunisation program. Little bits of vignettes, tiny little elements of policy popped out of that speech. The only problem with the tiny little elements of policy which popped out almost unobtrusively from that speech was that they happened to be our policies. So out popped childhood immunisation as the one health initiative in the speech, while everything else that we did on health was given a big tick. Also popping out from the speech last night was a policy for a committee of audit, a commission of audit-as I mentioned yesterday-which went through with a set of specifications exactly the same as I named in the House yesterday. That set of specifications popping out just happened to be covered by actions of this government in their entirety. So there are little bits of policy popping out every now and then. What we were doing, as far as families are concerned, was building on in this budget. And, of C(lurse, there were moneys in this budget for u substantial number of additional support measures that have caused families to find themselves in this situation. Their real household disposable incomes-in part, because of the social net underpinning that they have been given-have increased by 40 per cent since we have been in office. The additional family payments since we have been in office are up 150 per cent. The minister who answered a question previously pointed out the implementation from July this year of a parenting allowance, where some 115,000 low income working families will make an average gain of $59 a week. Those are things that have been done in the budget, of course. Of course, what sustains the bulk of a family income is not what appears in the budget, but that can be absolutely critical to an advance in its standard of living. What underpins family income is what goes on in the wages system of this country-whether an ordinary battler in society can be effectively protected by the wages system from any conceivable exploitation-and what underpins that is awards. What underpins that is a capacity on an enterprise basis to collectively bargain. That, more than anything else, sustains family income in this country. As you draw out from what the opposition had to say in that Cape Barren speech not policies but tendencies, you find two tendencies. One tendency is that the public spending to GDP ratio that forms the underpinning of the social safety net must be carved back. That is there implicit. The other tendency is that the wages system, which underpins the capacity for wages to deliver things like overtime, holiday leave loadings and a capacity to underpin via the award process a wage structure at all, is quintessentially the new policy. It is a continuing old Liberal policy but a policy at least that is not being implemented by this government; that is, the capacity to knock over wage justice for the average Australian. Of all the press commentary this morning, I thought one of the most effective expositions of this was by Tom Dusevic. I conclude with a paragraph that I think is worth recounting. He says: Yet there is a danger for Howard. At some point he'll have to outline beyond the rhetoric of last night why things will be better for families under a Coalition government. Voters will want to hear how a deregulated labour market will produce better outcomes. And they'll want to see a firm commitment to the social safety net, the great equalising mechanism in our society. What a wonderful expression: 'the great equalising mechanism in our society'. The opposition discovered battlers one week ago. In that one week they sought to belittle the social safety net, which we have been talking about for a very considerable length of time. They have .got darned unlucky because their very belated interest, compared with our 10 years of interest, has actually coincided with a quite ·substantial piece of decent new analysis in the academic communities, think-tanks and commentaries on the social safety net. Whereas we have been routinely blackguarded over the last five or six years on that issue, there is now a serious, detailed, decent, academic 'and well-structured analysis going oil of whlj.t is mean:t by the social safety net. Unfortunately. for the opposition, this coincides with precisely the point in time when they decided top-rsist with a challenge to it. What a great expression Tom Dusevic had for it: 'the great equalising mechanism in our society? That. great equalising mechanism is being sought after by the opposition to find ways of subverting it. There was no comfort in anything the opposition had to say last night about that. . . . Income Distribution",80
136,Mr GEORGIOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security. I refer the minister; apropos· of an effective piece of social·research, to the findings of Dr Bob Gregory that between 1976 and 1991 the income gap between the top five per cent and the bottom five per cent of census collector districts widened by $20,144, or 92 per cent, with the income in the bottom five per cent of socio-economic status areas falling by $7,589. To·what .extent does the minister's social wage of $1,744, notionally allocated to each and every member of the Australian community; regardless of income, address this .. massive increase in inequality? Government m-mbers interje·cting",81
137,Mr GEORGIOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Given the response from those on the other side of the chamber, I also ask: is it only legitimate for a person to ask a question about social inequality if he has bought a $2.5 million house?",81
138,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member makes reference to the work by Gregory and Hunter, which has been misrepresented and misquoted as suggesting the sort of conclusion which he has suggested. I have participated in a number of radio and television discussions with Professor Gregory and I have had a careful look at his work, so I think I have a reasonable understanding of what it is he is saying. He is not implying, as some have suggested, that the bottom one per cent of people in our society have suddenly had some cataclysmic fall in income. How could that possibly have occurred? How could people at the bottom whose income is dependent on the social safety net have possibly suffered a loss of $8,000 per annum? That clearly is an impossibility. The reality is that those at the bottom, those who are dependent on the social safety net, have clearly and unambiguously had an improve- . ment in their circumstances in real terms and also when set against the Henderson poverty line or any other measure you care to use. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, on a point of order, the question by the member for Kooyong was directed very much to the inequality between the top five per cent and the bottom five per cent. There is a growing gap between rich and poor. The Minister for Social Security should be so directed to answer.",81
139,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. The minister is clearly talking about the very subject matter that was put to him. I think the member for Kooyong was actually nodding when some of the comments were being made.,81
140,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In discussing Professor Gregory's work, he makes reference to the situation in the bottom one per cent of suburbs and his basic unit of account there is the census collection district, which is 200 to 300 households. It is important to bear in mind that in this country around about 5'1z per cent of the dwelling stock is accounted for by public housing. Over the last 15 to 20 years or so, there has been a major shift in public housing policy towards targeting public housing at those who are right at the bottom in terms of income distribution. That represents a major change, and I can give you a whole raft of figures on that if you like. The net effect of that is we have seen a compositional change in the sorts of people who live in public housing. It is now much more the case that people in public housing are unemployed, on sole parent pensions and so forth. To the extent that that occurs and you get a compositional change in the bottom one per cent-when a wage earner moves out of public housing accommodation and is oped replaced by an unemployed person or an unemployed couple-obviously that means the income of that household is going to fall. I discussed this with Professor Gregory and he agreed and accepted my analysis of situation. The reality is that the opposition has been grossly misquoting Professor Gregory's work. The reality is that, if you are talking about people who depend on the social safety net, there is no question that their situation has improved very significantly under this governcountries ment. It went backwards under you. If you talking about people on low wages, say, twomarket thirds of average weekly earnings, there is question that their disposable cash income has improved as a result of the improvements in tion. the safety net. Such people, if they are in private rented accommodation, would be around about $88 a week better off than they were under you in real terms. That does not include the great enhancements in the social wage that have be-n made, particularly child care, education, health and housing. Those four elements of the social wage, according to Professor Harding sity of Canberra and the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, are worth average for a couple with two children around $200 a week. What has happened to those and social expenditures under this government? Take health-expenditure has increased by 180 per cent. Take education-expenditure has increased by 40 per cent in real terms. Take child care-expenditure has increased by a whopping 495 per cent. These are all in real terms. What this means is that the total social wage expenditure has doubled in real terms. That represents a real increase of 73 per cent per head of population. That follows a significant real decline in social wage expenditure per head of population under the coalition. It is, as I have said repeatedly, the case that in this country, as throughout the developed world, earning disparities have increased. But it is the case also, as I said in answer to your previous question on the last sitting day, that those disparities are far less in this country than they are in virtually all develcountries bar the Scandinavian countries. The ratio between men 10 per cent from the top and men 10 per cent from the bottom in this country is about 2.3: 1. In the United States the corresponding ratio is about 5.6: 1. the In the United Kingdom the corresponding ratio is about 3.4:1. In France the corresponding ratio is about 3.2:1, and so on. You talk about inequality. The countries where there have been the most severe increases in inequality in recent years - and there is unanimity about this amongst analysts-are those that have slashed the social wage are and pursued policies of wholesale labour deregulation, with the stripping away no of award protection-that is, precisely the policy prescriptions advocated by the opposiIndustrial Relations",81
141,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Acting Minister for Industrial Relations. What has been the impact of the government's industrial relations policy on Australian workers? What would be the impact of alternative industrial relations proposals on the lot of at the UniverAustralian workers?,82
142,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable on member for his question. This government is very proud of its industrial relations record its industrial relations reforms. I remind the House that since the introduction of the Industrial Relations Reform Act there have been about 2,300 certified agreements in this country covering almost 60 per cent of workers covered by federal awards. The most pleasing aspect is that the duration and quality of those agreements have been steadily improving. The speed of enterprise bargaining, as you would be aware, continues apace, also under the guise of enterprise flexibility agreements. At the same time, though, through the operation of the award safety net and the no-disadvantage test, workers' rights and entitlements to decent wages and conditions have been protected via legislation. Also, the level of industrial disputation remains at historically low levels as real unit labour costs have decreased. Despite that record and despite the soothing words of the Leader of the Opposition, he still maintains that there is great work to be done. The trouble is that in his policy-free speech of yesterday he does not tell us what that great work ought to be. Let me suggest what it might be, though. It appears that the Leader of the Opposition is still suggesting that he would place great reliance on individual contract employment and that he would rely on awards to fade out of existence within a few years. As an individual left their job and went to another job they would lose the protection of awards and move onto a single contract employment. That means that the very struts underneath our system of awards and the no-disadvantage test would be kicked away. Australian workers will ask of the opposition: will they keep Australian awards secure, relevant and up-to-date, to make sure that they underpin any enterprise bargains or indeed contracts, and will they make sure that the no-disadvantage test that we have written into our act remains integral to the system and maintains its integrity? These are two questions that we will continue to put to the Leader of the Opposition from now until election day. The integrity of our system is based on the security and the integrity of awards and the no-disadvantage test. But there is also the matter that they seem to be cocky about recently of unfair dismissals. The reason why we have increased the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth in the area of unfair dismissals is simply that we are sick of workers being sacked unfairly. There are a whole lot of examples that I would like to give to the House-but we do not have time-whereby it needs to be reported that there are people who are cruelly treated by the employers in this country and who need the protection of federal legislation. Let me give you an example. Recently there was a case where a man was employed as a school bus driver. One day he complained about an aggressive guard dog kept on the premises where the buses were parked. Other people had also complained about this dog. A week later, while getting a bus ready to be taken out the man was attacked and bitten by the dog. He attended a doctor who gave him a tetanus injection. The man's employer saw the attack but did not speak to the employee about it at the time. When he returned from his round the employee spoke to the manager about the attack, saying that he felt unable to continue working while the dog was present. The manager said that the employee would have to go because the dog wasn't. That is the position of that employer. He sacked the worker but not the dog. That is Liberal policy: you will sack the worker but not the dog. Industrial Relations",82
143,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was interesting to listen to the comments of the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations, because my question is also addressed to the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations. He just confirmed that 'the government is proud of its IR reforms' and also gave us an example of some of the unfair dismissals. Government members-What's your question?",83
144,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you listen, you will hear the question. I am sure the assistant minister is aware of the latest judgment by the Industrial Relations Commission to reinstate a former employee of the Electricity Commission of New South Wales who had been dismissed for smoking marijuana at work. What limit of unfair dismissal insanity does this country have to reach before your government realises that the only dope involved in unfair dismissal is the current Minister for Industrial Relations?",83

147,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The grave mistake that the honourable member has made is to believe the member for Flinders. That was your first and probably your last mistake. The fact is that this is an example of a case taken in the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission under legislation written by Mr Fahey, the former Liberal Premier.",84
148,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Given the success of the recent pilgrimage of Australian veterans of World War II to Europe for VE Day ceremonies, will the minister advise the House as to what remaining pilgrimages have been arranged in the lead-up to the VP Day commemorations in August? In particular, will the minister ensure that appropriate recognition is focused on the role of Australians in the Pacific war and in Asia generally? Mr Costello-How many heads have rolled?",84
149,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you just hang on and listen, I will tell you about that later. I thank the honourable member for his question. The pilgrimage to North Africa and Europe for VE Day commemorations by a group of 10 Australian veterans was very successful, as many Australians would be aware due to the intense media interest that was shown. I can advise the House that I have arranged two additional pilgrimages during this important commemorative year, to Papua New Guinea and to Borneo. In selecting the destinations of the three pilgrimages, no judgment has been made concerning the relative significance of the associated campaigns over those that will not be included. It is just not possible to include them all. Rather, I have tried to be as comprehensive as possible in terms of Australia's involvement in World War II. The pilgrimage to Papua New Guinea will sail from Sydney on 29 June on a Russian cruise ship. There will be approximately 120 veterans on board, an ADF ceremonial contingent, a medical team and media representatives. The ship will sail via Brisbane to Port Moresby, then to Milne Bay and Oro Bay, with side visits to Kokoda, Rabaul, Buna, Gona and Sanananda; and also to Lae, with side visits to Wewak and Madang-returning to Australia on 11 July. Major commemorative ceremonies will be conducted at the war cemeteries at Bomana, Lae and Bita Paka. Other ceremonies and events are planned for Milne Bay, Kokoda, Popondetta, Buna, Gona, Sanananda, Wewak and Madang. Mr Ted Kenna VC, who is the sole surviving army VC winner of the camVPDay paign in New Guinea, will be on board this pilgrimage. He will be taken back to Wewak where he will unveil a plaque at Mission Hill where he won his VC on 15 May 1945. The pilgrimage to Borneo departs on 5 July to visit Jakarta, Balikpapan, Tarakan, Sandakan, Kota Kinabalu, Labuan and Singapore. Ceremonies will also take place at each of these locations. A major commemorative ceremony will be held at Sandakan on 11 July at the site of the former POW camp and the start of the death march to Ranau. Some 35 veterans will participate in this pilgrimage and will include at least one survivor of the death march. Given that a large media contingent will be travelling with both pilgrimages and the interest shown in the previous pilgrimage, I can state quite confidently that there will be an appropriate focus on the role of Australians in the war against Japan. Members of both pilgrimages have been selected and written to. I will be releasing their names closer to departure date, as medical considerations may dictate that the list may not be finalised for several weeks. There was another pilgrimage this year. That was to Gallipoli. Some people would know about that one. I must admit that at the time. I did get a little emotional, but I have to say that it is very hard not to get emotional when you are on ANZAC Cove at Gallipoli. That day we had with us 13 pilgrims who would give their eye teeth if they could go back and experience again today what they experienced that day. I am pleased to say to the House that those 13 pilgrims-one from every state and territory, including one from Norfolk Island; one representative from the Army, the Navy and the Air Force-are in the gallery today. They were worthy ambassadors for their country. Sure, we had a few little problems, but we want to go back. In the circumstances, I am sure that all members will appreciate that these things do happen. At the end of the day, it was an experience which we would all love to have again. Industrial Relations",84
150,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before I get to my question, I would like to associate myself with some of the comments made by thtMinister for Veterans' Affairs. Ted Kenna lives in Hamilton, which is in the middle of my electorate. Hamilton has held a number of special occasions for him in the last month. My question is directed to the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations. Recently I was approached by the exasperated owner of a small trucking company who had taken on a young woman as a new office manager. In her three months at work, the woman was absent for 11 days without producing a medical certificate, and on many other days arrived late and drunk. After being given five verbal warnings, the woman was dismissed, with two weeks pay in lieu of notice. Despite this, she was still awarded $2,500 after her case was judged an unfair dismissal. Minister, how can you possibly justify that law after this case?",85
151,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thought the dog example was eminent justification for any unfair dismissal. People should be given,85
152,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,85
153,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not say that. Don't be silly. I referred to a previous example, as you might have heard. The fact is that we have not changed the law in Australia on dismissals. We have taken into the federal arena the ability to hear cases where people previously did not have coverage. We have given a remedy to people who did not have an adequate remedy. That is the major change. We have given people an adequate remedy where previously they had none. There are exemptions for people who are only on short term contracts or who have just been taken on. I do not take your example as being-I will not say 'the truth of the matter'. I would like to see the case because I have found repeatedly that not so much you but the member for Flinders has constantly misrepresented cases that he has brought up in here, either by placing them in the wrong court or by simply giving the wrong information. I would want to see the case first because we have so many representations here. In essence, we are giving protection to people who previously did not have a remedy under state law. The reason why there are so many cases before us is that those people were not fairly treated. That is all we have asked. I have spoken to a number of chambers of commerce around the country. They say the game is now over because employers are learning that there are reasonable ways in which they can dismiss people. It has been an educative process. Forget the headlines, that educative process means that employers have decent and clear guidelines on how to dismiss people fairly. Education",85
154,Mr NEWELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Can the minister outline what was the outcome of the two-day forum on civics and citizenship education which concluded yesterday?",85
155,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Richmond for his question. The two-day forum held on Monday and Tuesday of this week was a successful first step in developing well a comprehensive national and non-partisan education program. It was held in response to the report of the Civics Expert Group entitled Whereas the people: civics and citizenship education. When that report was released in December of last year, it received overwhelming support from all sectors of the community. Among other things, it highlighted the lack of understanding by Australians of our system of government, our constitution and our responsibilities and rights as citizens. Honourable members would be aware that the recent federal budget allocated $25 million for a civics and citizenship education program. The forum was the first step in the consultative process to examine the ways we could give all Australians the opportunity to know about, understand and contribute to the civic life of the nation. Day one of the forum convened a number of peak community organisations with a demonstrated involvement and commitment to enhancing the profile of civic life in Australia. Members of the Civic Experts GroupProfessor Stuart Macintyre, Susan Pascoe and Dr Ken Boston-were present both days. The second day convened education organisations which discussed methods of implementation as well as possible curriculum material. Also, at yesterday's session the Prime Minister launched the government's response to the expert group report. I am pleased to say that the government's report accepted most of the recommendations of the expert group. At the forum, many groups expressed the need for a coordinated national civics and citizenship education program. There was overwhelming agreement that civics education in schools should be consistent and concordant with any education programs in the wider community and vice versa. I am pleased to say that the forum was successful in initiating discussion on the shape and direction of the civics and citizenship program. However, there is still a way to go. There will be further discussions and further consultations around the nation with the objective of ensuring that the program that we have will be non-partisan and comprehensive and will equip our youth and our broader community with a practical knowledge of what it means to be Australian. Jobstart",85
156,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I ask the minister: is it a fact that the number of unemployed people placed under your major labour market program, jobstart, during the first six months of Working Nation was 30,000 fewer than in the same six months of the previous year? Given that the target for commencements in jobstart in 1994-95 under Working Nation was 190,000-50,000 higher than in the previous year-has the government been delaying commencements in jobstart until closer to the election to hide unemployed people from the statistics or is this just another example, like the trainees hip fiasco, of the inflated promises of Working Nation being revealed as a fraud?",86
157,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I sometimes think the best thing that was done in terms of you getting elected to this parliament is that you are no longer at the university teaching people. If you brought the same rigour to research that you bring in terms of your analysis here, you would be turfed out, and so you deserve to be. The simple fact of the matter isOpposition members-What about unfair dismissal?",86
158,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Unfair dismissal? How can it be unfair for incompetence? He gets everything wrong. He misquotes everything.,86
159,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will come to his answer.,86
160,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He gets out the scissors and paste and the little white-out. No wonder they call him the doctor; he doctors every document that comes from my department.,86
161,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will come to the answer.,86
162,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Does not this great illuminary from the other side, who has been following the pattern of Working Nation, understand that what Working Nation did was to open up a whole raft of programs beyond jobstart to help people get into employment? Does he not understand that in the last year what this government has been doing has been producing jobs at the rate of 396,000that is, five per cent employment growth? We have seen the number of unemployed people fall by 16 per cent and the number of long term unemployed fall by 23 per cent. The numbers did not fall like that in the previous recovery, because there were not these targeted measures. I noticed last night that the only reference the Leader of the Opposition made to employment in his headland statement was to claim that the number of people unemployed has trebled from 250,000 to 800,000 since 1974-75. Dr Kemp- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister has made no attempt whatever to answer the question, which was that his target for jobstart was 50,000 higher this year than last year but his commencements are 30,000 fewer than last year. Is this a fact or is this a fraud or are you trying to manipulate the statistics?",86
163,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister is responding to the question of employment.,87
164,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What the Leader of the Opposition should notice is that in terms of his figures from 1974-75 to now the opposition has to claim practically all the credit for that rise, because only 15 per cent of the increase that he referred to in his speech has occurred since April 1983. Since that time, Labor has increased the total number of jobs by almost two million. Do you know what the Leader of the Opposition achieved as Treasurer in five years? He achieved 262,000. What a fantastic performance ! You claim to express concern and policy direction for putting people into jobs. I might say that when you were in government, the participation rate was 62 per cent. We have seen it increase to close to 64 per cent. In 1974-75 when Labor left office, the unemployment rate was 2.4 per cent. Howard left it at 10.1 per cent. Dr Kemp- Mr Speaker, I raise a further point of order. The minister has made no attempt whatever, since you gave him a direction, to answer the question. He is now talking about participation rates. The question was quite specific about the numbers and targets in the jobstart program. I invite you to ask the minister to answer or sit down.",87
165,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Minister for Employment, Education and Training might refer to those specific matters.",87
166,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am prepared to come to those, Mr Speaker. The difficulty with the shadow spokesmanDr Kemp-No, the difficulty is you. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.",87
167,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I do not know if the minister is coming to it or not. I have asked him to do so and I presume he will.,87
168,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am going to address the question of targets, Mr Speaker. Do they not want to hear about the targets? . Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, can I make my point of order. You suggested that he come to the figures. He then went straight into a reference to the shadow minister. It was a deliberate defiance of you and I ask you to remind him again to come to the figures.",87
169,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have asked the minister to do that. He got a couple of words out and I was hoping that he was doing so.,87
170,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If what I was referring to were not figures, I do not know what they were. But the figures for the opposition are dismal. So far as Working Nation is concerned, the totality of the program has exceeded every target set for it, except in relation to the traineeships which are 90 per cent of the target. Dr Kemp-Tell us about jobstart.",87
171,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member said, 'Tell us about jobstart.' What I am saying is that jobstart was the only effective labour market program that we had assisting people to get into employment before Working Nation. We have expanded the opportunities in Working Nation. Members of parliament who go round the country see these new work opportunities, the LEAP programs, the jobskills programs, the jobtrain programs and the traineeships which are massively contributing to getting the number of unemployed down. The problem with the shadow spokesman is that because the figures are so good and the opposition does not have an answer to those figures, it has to resort to the view that we are fudging the figures. Dr Kemp- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order under relevance. The minister has still not come to the question of the jobstart targets. He is now talking about LEAP and other programs.",87
172,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. The member for Goldstein will resume his seat. The minister, in conclusion.",87
173,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not going to allow him the luxury in this parliament to distort, as he does with every press release he puts out, the totality of the record of this government. The simple fact of the matter is that there is no fudging of the figures. It is not the CES that measures the number of long-term unemployed; it is the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The definition of 'long-term unemployed' has not changed in the last nine years. It is the ABS that goes out and asks the questions of the long-term unemployed. So how can we be fudging the figures? Essentially, you are saying that the ABS is crook. Why do you not make a substantive motion to that effect? Because you know you are wrong. I might also say that, when he gets on to it, he is always moving and shifting around, distorting the position Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.",88
174,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am answering the question. You do not like the answer.,88
175,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister has been entirely relevant in his last responses to the question that has been put to him. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is taking a point of order on relevanceMr Costello-No, I am taking a point of order on your ruling, Sir.",88
176,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Government members interjecting Mr Costello-Some time ago you said, 'The minister, in conclusion.' We expected, therefore, that he would wrap up. What he is obviously doing in a very longwinded, repetitious and tedious way is pulling out a lot of boring material and going through press releases which are not relevant to the question. I ask you again to remind him that you said 'in conclusion'.",88
177,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I will drop the hint. The minister, in conclusion.",88
178,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will take the hint, but let me just say again how the shadow minister distorts these figures. Last month he allegedand your side has to deal with people who distort and misuse: I . .. putting unemployed people onto training programs which remove them from the statistics, even though many are still unemployed at the end of their training. That is totally wrong. I put out a statement that showed how it was wrong. Let me make it clear to the House: people who remain unemployed at the end of their training program remain in the job compact. They are not reclassified as long-term unemployed. When you get your facts right, then I will be prepared to engage in some serious debate with you, but until then go back and try to find something else useful to do. Clearly, you have had no input into employment and training policy in the headland statement. Why would they? Because you mucked up higher education when you had that responsibility.",88

180,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",88
181,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Do you claim to have been misrepresented?,88
182,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes, I do. Last night the ABC television news at 7 o'clock carried a report to the effect that, because in the speech I delivered last night I had not repeated the commitment that there would be no tax increases or the introduction of new taxes by a coalition government-the commitment made by the shadow Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) during his excellent press club response to the budget-in some way I was leaving open the option of doing that. Let me say that I fully endorse everything that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said in his normal eloquent fashion at the press club.",88

185,Mr DOWNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes, I do. During a debate earlier today on a motion I moved, the Leader of the House and the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) alleged that I visited central Australia last year to exploit Aboriginal people. Mr Beazley interjecting",88

187,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! I will hear the member for Mayo uninterrupted.,89
188,Mr DOWNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"That was a particularly vicious and appalling thing to say. I went to central Australia with Dr Nelson, the then President of the AMA, to examine the health problems of Aboriginal people, which have deteriorated over the last 13 years. I would like to make a further point. During the division we had at the end of that debate, the Minister for Finance, as he was crossing the chamber, said of Aboriginal people, 'The trouble is these fellows change their mind twice a day.'

If members are taking personal explanations, they know the rules and they are to show where they have been personally misrepresented. If something is said in this place, and it is clearly audible, or if in some other way members have been misrepresented, they have the opportunity to express the view that they have been misrepresented.

205,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! I am trying to listen and I am having difficulty. The member for Barker will come to where he has been misrepresented.,89
206,Mr MCLACHLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"This explanation would be over if this had not gone on. It would be finished. Milera then went on to say, 'Let everybody in South Australia know that I was one of the instigators who created the story to stop the bridge.'",89

221,Mr VAILE,CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION,"It has been interesting to do a bit of research on the background to these two pieces of legislation that are now before the House-that is, Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 and the Air Services Bill 1995. Effections tively, these bills are splitting the functions the former Civil Aviation Authority into two separate bodies. This is an action that the government is belatedly taking. I think many commentaservice, tors-not just from our side of politics or from this side of this House, but people regulation. generally who have been interested in air safety, air travel and air safety regulations a number of years-have been pushing for cial this. We on this side of the House believe the responsible minister, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), has been a little slow in moving to bring this legislation accommodate these changes. We agree with the majority of changes. The shadow earlier today highlighted a few amendments that the opposition is going to deal with at later date. It is interesting to note the purpose of legislation. Both these bills were referred the House of Representatives Standing Comover mittee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. I suppose it is worthwhile commenting briefly on the fact that, number of occasions, the government has referred legislation to House of Representainvestigation tives committees or joint standing committees for scrutiny. I tum to the main features of the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Aviation Act to establish the Civil Aviation Safety Authority as a Commonwealth statuthat tory authority. The explanatory memorandum to the bill says that the separation of the· regulatory and service provider functions will ensure that aviation safety regulation is not compromised. Apart from this, the bill has three major characteristics. Firstly, the CASA bill attempts to describe the purpose of aviation safety regulation and the functions of CASA; secondly, the bill increases the powers of the minister; and, thirdly, the bill transfers civil aviation regulations into this legislation. The purpose of the Air Services Bill is to establish Airservices Australia as a govern the ment business enterprise to provide Australia's national airways system. AA's funcwill include the provision of facilities to of permit safe navigation of aircraft, provision of air traffic services, an aeronautical information service, an aviation rescue and firefighting service, an aviation search and rescue aeronautical communications, and specified aviation environmental activities and As I said at the outset, the purpose of these for two bills is certainly to separate the commer-· activities of what was the Civil Aviation that Authority from its very important safety regulatory activities. As I also said at the outset, a number of different organisations, on to commentators and people around Australia who are interested with air safety have been minister promoting this for some time. Why is the government bringing this legisa lation before the parliament now? I think two very strong and important reasons for the this introduction of this legislation are two exto tremely serious air accidents which occurred the last couple of years. First, there was the crash of a Monarch Air Piper Chieftain near Young on 11 June 1993. While there on a was much media comment regarding the cause of the crash, the BASI report of the was not released until July 1994. The report found that the cause of the accident was controlled flight into the ground. It also found a number of defects with the aircraft and inspection procedures, and conCivil cerns with the operator and the CAA. In summary, the major aircraft defects were the autopilot had been removed for maintenance and had not been refitted by the time of the flight. Also, the absence of the autopilot rendered the horizontal situation indicator inoperative, which was particularly important in the low cloud weather conditions that prevailed at the time of the accident. The inspection program for the aircraft was found to suffer from a number of defects. One was that, when informed that the autopilot was unserviceable and that repairs had been delayed, the CAA, at Monarch's request, issued a permissible unserviceability approval, PUS, that was valid until 16 May 1993 to allow the aircraft to operate, subject to conditionsincluding that two pilots be on each flight. A permissible un serviceability approval is intended to be an interim measure until a defect is rectified. The PUS applied only to the inoperable autopilot and not to other instruments. A further PUS was issued on 14 May 1993, as the autopilot had not been fixed. Again, the PUS related only to the autopilot. The aircraft underwent a regular maintenance check beginning on 31 May 1993, during which the autopilot was removed for repair. The engineer carrying out the check on the instruments and electrics, on a subcontract basis, noted that the horizontal situation indicator and autopilot had been removed. He was unable to complete the check as the horizontal situation indicator had been removed, although the check could be completed without the autopilot as this was covered by the PUS. The engineer requested to be informed when the horizontal situation indicator had been replaced so that the check could be completed. On 2 June 1993, the engineer checking the instruments and electrics learned that the aircraft had departed. He was informed by a Monarch engineer that the HSI had been refitted and tested by a radio engineer and a pilot. Consequently, the engineer inspecting the instruments and electrics certified his work. This was after the aircraft had been returned to service. It is interesting that at the time the BASI inquiry was being undertaken, and when the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure was also inquiring into the circumstance of that particular crash, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts was undertaking an inquiry into GBEs. That inquiry included the Civil Aviation Authority as one of the government's major government business enterprises. The terms of reference for this inquiry by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, whose report was ultimately tabled in this parliament as report No. 336, Public business in the public interest, state: On 16 June 1993 the Committee resolved to conduct an inquiry with the following terms of reference: To inquire into issues raised by the provision of goods and/or services on a commercial basis by Government agencies, including: the efficiency, effectiveness and appropriateness of corporations as a means of service delivery to the public; and the accountability of commercialised Government agencies and the mechanisms needed to ensure their accountability. While not limiting its scope, the Inquiry will focus on three Government agencies: the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services; the Civil Aviation Authority; and the Federal Airports Corporation. A major part of that inquiry was into the efficiency, effectiveness and appropriateness of the Civil Aviation Authority conducting its business as a government business enterprise. Some of the evidence of a lot of the officers of the Civil Aviation Authority was certainly very interesting in terms of looking at the modus operandi of that department-whether they were looking at the imperatives of air safety as opposed to those of complying with the government's requirements in undertaking their commercial activities in returning a dividend to the government and how. that prejudiced the implementation of air safety in Australia by the Civil Aviation Authority. Report No. 336 of the JCPA stated: The committee believes, however, that, until recently, the Department of Transport (Transport) had not recognised that separation was also needed for the Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA) dual functions as a commercial provider of aviation services and an air safety regulator. At the time of this Inquiry, the Civil A viation Act 1988 required the CAA to provide services to the aviation industry and to regulate it. At that time, the CAA was classed as a GBE because it charged for most of its services. However, its main function was regulatory. At a public hearing, the CAA's Chief Executive Officer described the Authority's roles in the following terms. I highlight to the Committee and the public that the CAA has two very distinct roles. We are first andforemost a safety regulator. We regulate the Australian aviation industry to achieve high levels of safety. That is a requirement under our Act and we also provide services to the Australian aviation industry. ... our safety regulation functions account for about 10 per cent of our staff and about 10 per cent of our budget. The service side of our business, which is the provision of aviation services such as air traffic control, rescue and firefighting services and technical support, is about 90 per cent of our budget and business. The opening comment of the CAA's chief executive officer, Mr Roser, was: We are first and foremost a safety regulator. But safety regulation made up only 10 per cent of the operations of the CAA and 10 per cent of the budget of the CAA. That evidence was given on Friday, 20 May 1994. I think the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) spoke about what means the CAA had at its disposal, as far as forcing compliance of safety regulation is concerned. We took evidence from representatives of the Civil Aviation Authority-and bear in mind that that public hearing took place after the Monarch crash and prior to the Seaview Air crash. I asked both Mr Roser and Mr Macionis: As the compliance officers, you are basically the policemen of the aviation industry. In your total budget for 1993-94, how much was set aside for compliance and prosecutions? Mr Roser responded: We do not prosecute. So for recalcitrant operators in the aviation industry, putting innocent people's lives at risk, Mr Roser stated, 'We do not prosecute.' Mr Macionis interrupted: Well, technically Mr Vaile is quite right, and details can be found on page 12 of the booklet we gave you yesterday. Details of this are in the section relating to the administrative action of prosecutors. However, it is up to the Director of Public Prosecutions. We only submit briefs of evidence. In relation under-compliance activities, there are four items, which are planned surveillance, unplanned surveillance, advice on regulatory requirements, and prosecution and administrative action. That makes up a total of about $24 million or $25 million out of the $58.4 million ... The interesting point is: they do not prosecute. As one of the travelling public in Australia who buys tickets and travels regularlyon aircraft in this country that are regulated and checked by our safety regulators, under the Air Services Bill, I hope that these checks are enforced much more stringently than they used to be. From the evidence that was taken at the BASI inquiry, the equipment that was missing from the Monarch aircraft was missing for in excess of 100 hours while that plane was operating. It is unbelievable to think that those people who lost their lives in that crash boarded that plane in Sydney with the expectation that they were. going to arrive safe and sound at their destination. One would think that regular transport operators have the imprimatur of the Commonwealth government on their activities and their operations, that they have been checked out, that they are safe to travel with. That certainly was not the case. It certainly did not come across that way in the evidence we received at the Joint Committee of Public Accounts when we looked into it. One very important recommendation in report No. 336 was recommendation No.4, which states: The Department of Finance should coordinate a review to examine all agencies with regulatory and commercial functions, with a view to separating these functions. This is for very obvious reasons. Hopefully, with the legislation that is being discussed in this place today, we are going to see a major improvement· as far as air safety in this country is concerned. I certainly hope so. It has been highlighted on a number of occasions that this action could have and should have been taken a long time ago, certainly immediately after the Monarch crash. The evidence we took from Mr Macionis and Mr Roser indicated that everything was hunky-dory, that everything was sweet in the garden, that there were no problems and that these people were being checked out. Yet they were being allowed to fly. At the time. I think the shadow minister, the member for Hume, highlighted the possibility of some problems with the next regular transport operator that ran into strife, Seaview Air. That was after this inquiry, which was after the Monarch crash. So it took those two major aviation catastrophes in this country to bring this government to where we are today, to realise that its process of reform, which I think started in 1988 with the establishment of the Civil Aviation Authority, was not working. There were not the checks and balances. There were not the controls. The commercial imperatives had taken over from the safety imperatives. Management was confused as to whether the lives of the travelling public in Australiawho were boarding planes under the perception that nothing was likely to go wrong because the planes were operated with the stamp of approval of the Commonwealth of Australia-or the commercial imperatives of providing government with a dividend or running to a budget were more important. I hark back to some of the recommendations in the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts that a number of areas of government operation in this regard certainly need review. There are some core activities of government that nobody is going to argue against hiving off or commercialising-get them out there, separate them, let them stand on their own two feet and make sure they compete properly on a commercial basis with the private sector. But there are certainly areas that should remain as government agencies under the direct control of the line agency or the government department so that they can be suitably funded by the Commonwealth of Australia to ensure those safety aspects. Another major discussion has taken place as to whether portfolio ministers should also carry responsibility, as the taxpayer's representative, as the shareholder-the only shareholder with responsibility to GBEs. This highlights the point that a number of us on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts have discussed at length-that those responsibilities should be separated. The portfolio minister, the minister responsible for establishing the regulatory control over these organisations, over these GBEs, should not also be the minister responsible for their commercial activities, who sets the height of the hurdle when it comes to the dividend that must be provided back to government. There is a conflict of interest there. Ultimately this country will follow other countries around the world which have gone down this path and will separate those responsibilities. This case with the CAA highlights the fact that the portfolio minister should not be the minister responsible for extracting dividends, (Time expired)",95
222,Mr LEO MCLEAY,CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION,"Watson) (5.08 p.m.)I agree with many of the remarks that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), made. Throughout most of this current saga of the CAA I have agreed with many of the things that the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) has said, particularly in relation to the Monarch Air matter. In September 1993 during an adjournment speech about noise abatement at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport I said to the House: Over the next 12 months I will be paying particular interest to this organisation, working to ensure that it is made accountable to this parliament and to the public, including the people of my electorate, whose lives the CAA, in cahoots with the Federal Airports Corporation and at the industry's bidding, have so consistently disrupted-and more seriously-unfortunately, at times potentially threatened. In those remarks I was referring to the current Civil Aviation Authority. I said on that occasion that this abrogation of accountability by the CAA to the government and the parliament and its lack of regard for regulations had to cease. At that time. I was responding to an article which had appeared in the Sydney Morning-Herald in August 1993 where the CAA admitted that it was systematically authorising breaches of regulations. The CAA admitted that it had authorised breaches of noise abatement procedures to accommodate industry imperatives during what it termed 'peak periods'. Similarly, the CAA covered up for the FAC figure fiddling on the impact of the third runway. As members will recall, on 18 November 1994, another article in the Sydney Morning Herald revealed that the Civil Aviation Authority-again conspiring with the Federal Airports Corporation-had deliberately set out to· mislead the public about the impact of the third runway. Civil Aviation Authority documents confirmed that they knew that the FAC noise contour maps and statistical projec-ions in the environmental impact statement were wrong. What did it do? Nothing. It said nothing. Incidents like these, I believe, were serious breaches of the duty of this authority to provide reliable information to the minister, the government, the parliament and the public. Unfortunately, the legislation at that time governing the Civil Aviation Authority did not specifically set out this requirement. These actions of the CAA were symptomatic of the deep-seated problems and culture of this GBE-a GBE that was out of control; a GBE that had a cowboy approach to life; and a GBE which, in many ways, acted according to its own agenda, and clandestinely did so in the name of what it thought were its corporate responsibilities. For the CAA it was the best of all worlds. It could do what it liked and in the end had none of the responsibilities that a line department might have had for its actions. It had escaped the government after it ceased to be the old Department of Civil Aviation and was out there on its own unencumbered, irresponsible and uncaring. The legislation before us today is about ensuring that the government, which, quite correctly, is responsible for public safety, has the power to enforce strategies and regulations-putting safety and the community before industry concerns and, most important of all, something the opposition is having difficulty grappling with, above monetary concerns. The opposition's monetary bias to safety is no doubt stolen, as are many of its other policies, from someone else. In particular, those opposite still seem under the sway of the discredited former chairman of the CAA, Dick Smith. In 1990, when the CAA became a government business enterprise, the then chairperson Dick Smith said in the CAA annual report that there was a need to balance the cost of safety supervision. He said: Increasingly over the last 12 months the mediaand therefore the community-have come to understand the complex balance between safety and cost. The result is that there is now less pressure to spend the limited amount of money available for safety as a reaction to newspaper headlines. The Authority's safety experts are now able to concentrate on areas where the best value is obtained for the safety dollar. This ethos of valuing safety in dollar terms was, I believe, the wrong approach. I think subsequent events, such as the Monarch and Seaview disasters, highlighted just how wrong that approach was. Concerns over the CAA's safety performance had been expressed for a number of years. There was a need for action to be taken. In 1992 the government established a safety regulation forum which reported in August that year and raised a number of concerns. However, concerns continued, and in February 1993 the board's safety committee was requested by the government to examine the CAA's Safety Regulation and Standards Division. It is needless to restate how public concern came to a head following the fatal crash of the Monarch Air Piper Chieftain near Young on 11 June 1993. As a part of its investigations, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation investigated the role of the CAA. It reached a number of negative findings against this government authority, including: The activities of the safety Division appeared biased toward promoting the viability of the operator rather than on promoting safety. To my mind, this was a cultural change in the organisation which had occurred at the urging of the former chairman, Mr Smith. In my opinion, it was this cultural change of moving to affordable safety which led to less stringent safety checking. It is no good Mr Smith saying in the newspapers how there were no to be aircraft crashes when he was the chairman. That had nothing to do with him; it had more to do with luck. What we have seen in this organisation is an ethos which has changed from stringent safety checks, which would result in the grounding of aircraft if they were unsafe, to allowing them to fly as kmg as they could get into the air. I believe that that ethos and cultural change occurred after the urging by Mr Smith that you could put a price on safety. It is a ridiculous proposition and one that the government is rejecting in this legislation. On 20 July last year, after these disasters, the government established the Aviation Safety Agency within the CAA arid initiated an inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. Further concerns were highlighted again following the Seaview aircraft crash en route to Norfolk Island on 2 October 1994. That incident prompted the government to take a number of harsher steps, including the transfer of the then director of aviation safety and a judicial inquiry into the operations of the CAA independent of the ongoing House of Representatives inquiry. That inquiry is continuing. The member for  important job with that inquiry. I am of the firm belief that there are other people whom the committee ought to have a look at. I believe the committee should look at the New South Wales Air Transport Council, which is not very well known to members of the public or members of parliament. That body was set up by the New South Wales government quite some time ago. It exists to grant intra-state licences on behalf of the New South Wales transport minister. You can trace back the particular problems of Monarch Air to the decisions of the New South Wales Air Transport Council in the late 1980s and early 1990s to grant willy-nilly commuter licences in New South Wales which ensured that safety was the first victim of the cut throat competition which developed between operators. We saw that happen on larger scales in the United States when deregulation occurred there. Some of the very significant safety problems which have shown up in New South Wales have been a result of that willy-nilly deregulation that that body allowed. That caused the Commonwealth, as my colleague said earlier, to put its imprimatur on it. Those licences to operate in New South Wales were granted by the New South Wales Air Transport Council. I am glad that the honourable member for Shortland has come into the House. I commend to him and his committee that they look at the New South Wales Air Transport Council to see what sort of role that deregulation had in what might have been avoided with Monarch Air and to find out how that council made those decisions. Were they at the behest of the New South Wales government, commuters or industry? What drove the council to change its policy? The most unfortunate outcome of that policy change was the fact that three operators were flying into a small town like Young. Anyone with half a brain would know that a small town like Young could not sustain that sort of activity. The only way those operators were able to keep themselves in the air was to slash things which in the past the Civil Aviation Authority would not have allowed them to slash. The unfortunate combination of the changed culture at the Civil Aviation Authority, which allowed inspectors to feel that they were under pressure to let people get into the air rather than keeping them on the ground, and this deregulation which occurred in New South Wales at about the same time meant that safety became the first victim. The people on the Monarch flight became the second victim. The legislation we are debating here today will replace the CAA. I hope that, when the bureaucratic changes occur, the people who move from one authority to the other might leave behind some of the baggage that they have accumulated over the years. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority will assume responsibilities for aviation safety regulations, while Air Services Australia will be the industry'S service provider. One of the other important things that this legislation does is to strengthen the hand of the minister. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority is directly accountable to the minister and, through him, this parliament. It is required to report to the minister, and the minister has the discretion to issue strategic directions as to the manner in which the Civil Aviation Safety Authority should perform its functions. I think that is right and proper. One of the problems with a number of these GBEs is that they have just decided they are a law unto themselves. They have become captured by industry groups. Ifever there was an example of a GBE that has become captured by industry groups it is the old Civil Aviation Authority. Hopefully, this legislation will break that nexus and restore some accountability. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority will be required to take into account the views of the minister when performing its functions. A key aspect of this accountability to the minister and the parliament is the requirement of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to prepare a corporate plan each year. It seems to me that, since its inception in 1988, the CAA has always had difficulties in understanding that it was accountable to the government, the parliament and the. people of Australia. Somehow it seemed unable to reconcile its obligations to the community, which paid a lot of its salaries, with its obligations to the industry. It seems that it thought its obligation to the industry and its commercial concerns were of a higher priority. The CAA saw this as being as flexible as possible-bending rules and putting corporate dollars before lives-to accommodate corporate imperatives, the imperatives of the industry that I believe it thought it should be serving rather than the Australian people. The government has come to terms with the CAA's problems for it, as it was unable to reform itself. We have separated the corporate from the regulatory responsibilities. By having that circuit-breaker in place, we think that at least might inject a little bit more responsibiliAustralia ty into this organisation. So you will have one body focused on service delivery and the other appropriately resourced to develop and secure compliance with aviation safety standards. In the future, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's job will be to make sure that the flying public are given a safer approach to flying rather than having aircraft operators allowed to operate to keep their business going. One of the main gains from this initiative is that it places a central and unambiguous focus on safety. The baggage that these bureaucrats had from the Smith days should be jettisoned-and jettisoned quickly. There will be a much greater clarity in the delivery of the functions and much greater accountability and greater separate reporting to the government. This will be a positive approach, and I hope those public servants will realise that they have an obligation to ensure that the future does not replicate the past. Even if the attitudes of people remain unchanged, I believe the legislation will ensure that public safety is given the priority it deserves. The government has moved away from the idea of affordable safety and cost recovery, which Dick Smith talked about. I am sorry to see that the opposition is still going down that track with respect to cost recovery. But the government will increase its contribution to the administration of safety regulations by $11.8 million above the previous cap of $22.8 million, which will bring the government's total contribution this year to $34.6 million. The industry and the travelling public will make a contribution, and that will be in.., creased by $17 million, funded by an increase on aviation fuels of approximately O.9c per litre, bringing the price of fuel to 2.38c after some reductions in fees and charges. Taken together, the increased government and industry contributions represent a 39 per cent increase in the spending on aviation safety. An additional $1.6 million will be allocated to enhance the capacity of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation to examine aviation accidents and incidents. These changes will go a long way to getting back to the reputation it used to have as one of the safest countries in the world in which airline commuters can safely take to the skies. We need to debunk the myths that Dick Smith sent forth about the wonderful job he did. We need to say to the people who are going to work for these two new organisations that they are getting a second chance and they must ensure that the interests of the travelling public are put ahead of the interests of the industry or we will be back where we started. That would have a detrimental effect not only on people from country areas who use small commuter operations but also on people in the larger cities to where they fly. It might sound cruel and unconscionable to say that while a Monarch disaster and a Seaview disaster were exceptionally bad at the time, imagine the effect it would have had if they had been going in the other direction. Both disasters are the fault of cultural change. There is no point trying to finger some poor inspector and say that he or she did not do the right thing. The reality is that this cultural change came down from the top of this organisation. We might not find anything in writing, but the people at the coalface knew that the mood had changed. Their job was no longer to do ramp checks and stop these pilots from flying but to let them go if it looked okay. This legislation says that we are going back to the way it was. The safety of the travelling public is important, not the financial ability of operators. I think the authority and the House should take account of those matters.

The main object of this Act is to establish a regulatory framework for maintaining, enhancing and promoting the safety of civil aviation in an effective and economical way, with particular after emphasis on preventing aviation accidents and incidents whilst recognising the need for more people to benefit from civil aviation.'."". I commence my remarks by thanking all the people who have participated in the debate to date. It has been an interesting exercise because virtually everybody in this debate has approached the legislation from the same point with varying degrees of passion. I thank the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) for the remarks he just concluded because, whilst he has some different views on a couple of minor points, he and I share sentiments about the outcome, the reasons and the need for this legislation to be introduced into parliament. There is no doubt in my mind that the legislation, if it goes through the House and ultimately the Senate, will make aviation safer and will lead to lives being saved. It is for these reasons that we will move a number of amendments this afternoon. We believe our amendments will add additional force to the government's legislation to achieve that overall goal of making aviation in Australia safer. This amendment relates to the main object of the act and states: '3A. The main object of this Act is to establish regulatory framework for maintaining, enhancing and promoting the safety of civil aviation in an effective and economical way. with particular emphasis on preventing aviation accidents and incidents whilst recognising the need for more people to benefit from civil aviation.'."". This is a direct pull, if you like, from a report of the House of Representatives Standingp.m.)-The Committee on Transport, Communications Brereton) and Infrastructure, chaired by the honourable  of which I am a member. The report was opposition. made to this House only last week following our deliberations in consultation with memrefocusing bers of the industry. The members of the industry. committee who deliberated during those hearings felt that was an appropriate set of words to outline the objectives of the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It was a neater, more effective, more comprehensive way of saying what was originally proposed. As members of the House who have listening to the debate would know, the government has chosen to adopt nearly all of the Morris committee's recommendation, with the exception of the last few words-'whilst recognising the need for more people to benefit from civil aviation'. The opposition has proposed to include the phrase that was omitted by the government from the Morris committee's recommendation because we invalidate believe that, by encouraging more people to participate in aviation, it will ensure that anything that acts in contrast to that will be undertaken by the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Despite the accidents and problems of the CAA, aviation is a very safe form of transport when compared with driving a motor car, travelling on a bus or whatever. So, in the interests of safety, we want to encourage people to participate in civil aviation and in tum that will enhance the capacity of aviation operators to maintain their operations in a viable sense. If aviation operators maintain their viability, they are more likely to maintain their aircraft and flying operations in proper order. So the amendment I have moved picks up the full intent of the House of Representatives standing committee's original objective as put a to the parliament last week. We believe this will be a useful amendment to the amendment the government has moved.",102
225,Mr JOHNS,CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION,"Petrie-Special Minister of State, Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (5.39 Minister for Transport (Mr has made it clear in his response to the Morris committee of 31 May 1995 that he is opposed to this amendment moved by the It is our belief that the amendment will dilute the safety intent of the new act by on the commercial interests of the It will set up a dual mandate for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority by requiring it not only to regulate aviation safety but also to foster the aviation industry. In that regard, we believe it will introduce uncertainty as to how the Civil Aviation Safety Authority should recognise the need for more people to been benefit from civil aviation. The amendment could be used to challenge the validity of safety rules on the basis that they may have an adverse economic impact on the industry. We believe that the proposal would also make the safety authority accountable to the industry, which is inconsistent with the committee's views as reflected in its report. In short, the proposal is likely to the government's major purpose in separating the service provider and the safety regulation functions of the Civil Aviation not Authority and create a safety authority with a clear and unambiguous focus on aviation safety. Industry expressed concerns that the bill could be used as a vehicle to promote a policy of safety regardless of costs, but that is not the intention of the bill. As the second reading speech explained, the government decided that the industry concerns would be best addressed if the relevant provisions in the Legislative Instruments Bill were brought forward in 'their application to the safety authority. Those provisions provide for full public consultation and cost-benefit analysis of regulatory changes, and represent a clear and unqualified means of taking costs into account in developing safety regulations. The second reading speech indicates that the minister will issue a direction to this effect immediately the authority is established.",103
226,Mr SHARP,CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION,"I appreciate the response from the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns). All of us on this side of the House, and those throughout the parliament, would and do appreciate the attempts being made in this legislation to focus as much as is humanly possible the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority's attention onto its primary function of maintaining aviation safety. The thrust of the complaints that we have heard over time in our inquiry, and in my own investigations, is that the Civil Aviation Authority of old had lost its way, that its commercial function had overtaken its safety regulatory role. This had led to a deterioration in the standard of aviation safety regulation in Australia and in the standards within the industry. As a consequence, it had actually damaged the regard and/or respect that people in the aviation industry had for the regulator, which in tum led to people in the industry disregarding much of the CAA's actions and decisions. We all appreciate the need to focus as much as is possible this new legislation on the need for safety to be the primary role of this new Civil Aviation Authority. On the other hand, we also have to remember that we are dealing with people about whom we cannot always be confident will be doing everything the way we want them to. We have seen examples in our inquiry, and again in my own investigations, of how the Civil Aviation Authority of old has often done things that have related to expenditure, or the introduction of new regulations, which do not take into account, or do not take regard of, the cost of those regulations or decisions. In effect, not regarding the costs involved in the end reduces the amount of safety in the industry. As we all know, many people do not like using the term 'affordable safety'. The hon Morris) and I have heard people saying in 1,000 words the very thing that affordable safety means without using the term 'affordable safety' because it has become a term that many people do not like, and I can understand that. However, we have to recognise too that at the end of the day there must be a limit to the amount of money you can spend without prejudicing safety in the process. I will take an extreme example. The new Civil Aviation Safety Authority, in cahoots with the new Airservices Australia, may decide that it would be a damn good idea to put a full air traffic control system in at Wagga to control the three, four or half dozen commercial flights that come in there each day. One has to ask: is that a sensible allocation of the limited resources of our aviation industry when perhaps the same amount of money could be spent upgrading the radar system at Sydney airport, Tullamarine airport and any other airport, which have a greater number of commercial services going into and out of them and where many more people's lives depend on having an adequate radar system? We need to consider whether the dollars could be better allocated to another area to provide a better safety dividend. That is why the opposition, and I know members of the committee, felt it was necessary to put into the wording of the legislation something that called on the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority to take into account costs and to have some kind of cost-benefit analysis. I am pleased to hear that the minister will, with the commencement of the new authority on 1 July this year, give a direction to the authority to ensure that any new regulations or any decisions that are made by the authority are accompanied by a cost-benefit analysis. It gives us some heart to see the sentiment of the opposition's amendment brought into effect. However, we make the point that, if the government is going to do that via a different means, why do we not do it via a direct means by having· it worded in the legislation to ensure that it reflects what the minister proposes to do on 1 July and what the Legislative Instruments Bill will enforce from 1 January next year?  p.m.)-I would hate to think from the remarks of the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) that anyone thought that the primary consideration in the performance of the duties of the CAA would be to ensure the viability of what could only be described as marginal operators. You may not have intended that meaning, but that could be construed from your opening remarks. I would not want to see a situation where that was the case. The suggestion that the survival or success of someone in the general aviation industry is dependent upon the fees they pay to the Civil Aviation Authority or CASA means that we have to deeply consider and evaluate our public priorities. I think we need to bear in mind that the House of Representatives Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure made one recommendation which has become the content of the amendment moved by the opposition. The opposition gave the government a choice to have a second objective. Most of that has actually become part of the amendment we have before us now. This needs to be seen in context of the next set of recommendations from the committee which will not only set out a broad objective for the authority but also set out specifically the classes of functions. Some of the government's other amendments point to an adoption of the committee's recommendations about the major and minor functions. They need to be read in context with the objectives. Therefore, there will be a simplified broader objective and a very explicit and streamlined description of the functions of the organisation. I direct those who have a doubt about the consultation process-and I recall our public hearing on 26 April where we talked with the industry about this section of the bill-to page 8 of the second reading speech where this is as explicit as it needs to be. It states: Under this bill, CASA will be required to put in place a mandatory consultation process before any civil aviation regulation is made to ensure that all affected persons have an opportunity to comment. CASA will also be required to prepare a Legislative Instruments Proposal which contains a summary of the proposal and its objectives ... an indication of relative costs and benefits to government and the affected public of the proposal and alternatives and reasons for the preferred approach. That is explicit; it is very clear what it is about. I think the two recommendations together cover the issue completely. There is no need for concern on the part of industry. It is probably tighter than what was originally proposed, because my colleagues and 1including the member for Hume-operated under the impression at that stage that the Legislative Instruments Bill was coming forward. We were not sure when, but it was to come forward at some time and pass through both houses of parliament. What the minister has done is give a directive to the new authority to behave as though the bill had gone through. I think that very much strengthens the position, and I am quite happy with the amendments as moved by the government.",104
227,Mr SHARP,CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION,"I just wish to clarify the issue raised by the honour in his initial remarks. He made the comment that he thought I was in some way or another trying to say that we need to take into account marginal operators in relation to costs imposed by the CAA or the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority. That is not my intent. One of the concerns I always had with Monarch Air, for example, was that the old CAA spent too much time worrying about the cost of its charges to Monarch and allowed Monarch to operate for much longer than it ought to without drawing it to a confrontation on the failure to pay its fees. For example, from November 1991 to the flight 301 Monarch crash on 11 June 1993, as I understand it, Monarch paid no fees to the CAA. Certainly, it did not pay a lot of its landing fees to some of the local councils that owned the airports that it used. Obviously, for those sorts of people, protection is not the answer. It is certainly not my intent, by putting forward this amendment, that that would not be so. I am sure the honourable member for Shortland understands that now. Basically, the opposition and the government are taking a similar path in this regard. The government has chosen to go down the path of giving a direction to the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority to come into effect on 1 July. That will be, in a sense, superseded by the instruments legislation which will come into force on 1 January next year. That will require the new authority to undertake a cost-benefit type of analysis of everything it does. We do not argue with that view, We think it is a sensible way to go. The only thing we are doing is wanting to do it directly in the form of the amendment that we have proposed, rather than doing it via a somewhat indirect path that the minister is putting forward. At the end of the day, the outcome will be the same. Our path is perhaps more direct, while the government's path is somewhat less direct. I do not see an enormous difference, but it is an amendment that we wanted to put forward to ensure that the directions to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in the form of this legislation are as clear as possible.

'(5) CASA's functions do not include responsibility for aviation security.'."". (8) Schedule 1, page 14, item 23, proposed subsection 9A(2), after ""CASA must"" insert ""exercise its powers and"".",105
228,Mr SHARP,CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION,"I move: (2) Schedule 1, page 14, item 23, after proposed subsection 9A(2), add the following subsection: ""'(3) Subject to subsection (1), CASA must exercise its powers and perform its functions in a manner that, as far as practicable: (a) is economical and effective; and (b) promotes and fosters civil aviation.'."". I think that amendment is fairly selfexplanatory. We can hardly mount a major argument against using words like 'economical and effective'. With any government owned organisation, such as this, where we as parliamentary representatives of the people of Australia are concerned to ensure the maximum benefit for the dollar, we could hardly argue with the inclusion of words such as 'economical and effective' as a requirement of the manner in which the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority should perform its functions. I think it would be very difficult indeed to oppose such an inclusionparticularly of the words 'economical and effective'. In addition to that we have 'promotes and fosters civil aviation'. I would make these points: firstly, my colleague Senator Parer, our shadow minister for aviation, will no doubt be putting a more substantial argument in regard to this. However, it is important for us to recognise that the opposition is not, at any stage, proposing that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority engage in the physical promotion of civil aviation. We do not intend for there to be a promotions department set up within the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. That certainly is not our intention. The consequence of that would be that further revenues would have to be raised in order to pay for it or, alternatively, revenues from the existing revenue base would have to be drawn upon to pay for it. Of course, those are revenues that would otherwise be directed towards things such as safety surveillance. It is not our intention in any way, shape or form to diminish the capacity of the new organisation to undertake safety surveillance. For that reason we are not, in any way, shape or form, suggesting the establishment of some type of promotions department within the new CASA. It is simply a statement reflecting the view that many people in the industry have been putting to me for a long time now-from as early as the middle of last year this view has been put to me by a number of people in the aviation industry-that is, it would be a useful adjunct to have an organisation, which is now CASA, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, recognise the need within its operations to do whatever it can to assist in fostering the industry; to assist the industry to, if you like, remain viable; to assist the industry to encourage people to participate in it. I guess this is the basic sentiment behind 'promotes and fosters civil aviation'. I make the point again that it would be very hard to reject our first point 'is economical and effective'. I imagine that anybody would find it difficult to put forward an argument that really disagreed with the need for any government facility or service to be anything else but economical and effective. It is for this reason that we put this amendment forward, recognising that in so doing it again ensures that the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority keeps in mind the need not to waste money, not to redirect resources from the aviation industry into areas that do not achieve, to maximum effect, the overall goals of everybody in the aviation industrythat is, to maximise safety.",107
229,Mr JOHNS,CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION,"Petrie-Special Minister of State, Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (5.58 p.m.)-I appreciate the opposition spokesperson's views on this, but the government opposes the opposition amendment. We argue that it muddies the waters and detracts from the clear focus on aviation safety which this bill provides. Under proposed subsection 32B(1), one of the purposes of the board is to ensure that the safety authority performs its functions in a proper, efficient and effective manner. Given this, the addition of 'economical and effective' is probably repetitious and, we think, will lead to confusion. In relation to the requirement to promote and foster civil aviation, it is unclear as to how the safety authority would do this. It is inappropriate for a safety regulatory authority to be promoting and fostering civil aviation: In particular, it confuses the clear focus on safety regulation that these two bills are designed to achieve. The proposed amendment effectively requires the safety authority to promote the economic viability of the industry, which it is also required to regulate. This is in direct conflict with the provisions in the bill enabling the safety authority to have regard to the financial viability of an operator in issuing an air operator's certificate. It would require the safety authority to operate with conflicting objectives, which have been highlighted as the root of the Civil Aviation Authority'S problems. The logical extension of this amendment would be to prevent or severely impede the safety authority from grounding an airline, such as Monarch or Seaview. Also, the amendment seeks to dilute the safety focus of the legislation. Amendment negatived.",108
230,Unknown,CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION,"Sitting suspended from 6.00 to 6.30 p.m.  agreed to: (9) Schedule 1, page 14, after item 23 insert: ""23A. Section 10: Repeal the section. 23B.

Subsection 20A (2): Omit the subsection, substitute: '20A.(2) No person may operate an aircraft in a careless or reckless manner so as to endanger the person or property of another person.'."". These amendments are very significant and go to the heart of the problems that the Civil Aviation Authority has had in the past. In the original version of the government's legislation, the old wording was changed to include the words 'potential to endanger the life of a person' or 'potential to endanger property'. The government has quite sensibly withdrawn those original amendments to the old bill and reintroduced the old legislation with regard to subsections 20A(1) and 20A(2). The purpose of this is simply to ensure that the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority places as its first and foremost priority the safety of people who are involved in commercial aviation-the travelling public. They are the people who buy a ticket to fly in an aeroplane and in the process put their faith in the system of aviation safety regulation in Australia and expect that system to have sufficient resources and sufficient direction to ensure that the sector of aviation that carries the paying travelling public is receiving the maximum safety surveillance and the maximum degree of regulation that is humanly possible. At the present time, unless we focus on the need to protect the life of another, we will fall back into the trap that the old CAA fell into; that is, directing an enormous portion, some 27 per cent, as indeed the old CAA did, towards regulating a sector of aviation which is not represented and used by the travelling pUblic. I am referring to sports aviators, people like parachutists and gliders, and general aviation-the sorts of people who, if they do make a mistake, are only likely to endanger their own lives, not the lives of others. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that we can focus and direct all of our energies and resources towards protecting the lives of other people and not trying to protect people from themselves. We do not do it in other facets of life. For example, we do not do everything we can to stop people from abseiling in Bungonia Gorge in my electorate where three or four people are killed every year by falling as they abseil. We do not do it in other facets of life. What this amendment is designed to do is ensure that we focus all of our efforts on protecting the lives of other people who engage themselves in aviation and in the process ensure that we bring our regulation in regard to the protection of persons and property in line with ICAO. I know there has already been some debate on this today, but we want to ensure that we bring our regulations in line with the sentiment and intent of the ICAO agreement, which has been used by other countriesnamely, the United States, New Zealand and the UK-very successfully to ensure people respect that regulation and to ensure that where they do not prosecutions can be carried out successfully. In the case of the United States, we have evidence that proves that this is the most used regulation-the very amendment that we propose here, which we believe is designed to maintain safety for the travelling public.  Science and Personnel) (6.38 p.m.)-The government opposes these amendments by the opposition. I would remind the House of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, which has waged quite a vigorous campaign over the last few weeks for amendment to section 20A of the Civil Aviation Act. The government has acknowledged some of the concerns raised by AOPA in relation to the amendment to section 20A contained in the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill. It is, therefore, proposed that the amendment be withdrawn and that the whole issue be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure to look specifically at the issue as part of its broader inquiry into air safety standards in the commuter and general aviation sectors. This is with the aim of striking an appropriate balance between the public interest in preventing dangerous flying and the legitimate needs of the aviation sector. Referral to the committee will provide an opportunity for proper consideration of this provision and enable suggestions for change from the industry, including AOPA, to be fully evaluated within the context of other evidence presented to the committee.",108
232,Mr SHARP,CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION,"I appreciate the response from the Minister for  acting on behalf of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). He mentioned the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association in his remarks. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association represents some 10,500 members, which, by any measure, makes it the largest single organisation of people involved in aviation in Australia today. The amendment that we propose is very strongly supported by AOPA and one which its members have taken a strong strand on over recent times. There has been, as I mentioned earlier in my speech today, a change of leadership at the AOPA organisation based around the sort of issue that we are talking of here in subsections 20A(1) and (2), which is the need to ensure that people in aviation have the regulator focusing the maximum amount of attention on people who provide a commercial service to ensure that we protect the lives of other people, rather than focusing an enormous portion of the regulator's resources on protecting people from themselves. There is no amount of regulation you can introduce to really protect people from themSafety selves. The problem with the old CAA is that it spent too much time focusing on protecting people from themselves at the expense of protecting people in the commercial and regular public transport sector. Many people would say that one of the problems the Monarchs and Seaviews have highlighted to us is that the regulator was not focusing that, enough attention on those operations whilst the same time was focusing enormous designed amounts of attention on those people who were really only likely to kill themselves, they were going to hurt anybody at all. Therefore, many lives were put at risk whilst the CAA was focusing on pouring its resources into a very small sector of the overall industry that, if anything was going wrong, was only putting the lives of the people who were actually flying the aircraft or jumping out of aeroplanes with parachutes on their backs at risk. In other words they were not risking anybody else's lives. So this amendment is designed to ensure that we can put our focus for regulation on protecting lives of other people, not trying to protect people from themselves. This brings us into line with international practice. One of the things we discovered in listening to people in the aviation safety inquiry is that many of the regulations are regarded with derision by people in the industry. Many of the old CAA regulations are simply unworkable; they contradict each other or they do not have the respect of people in the industry because they are to be ridiculous. One of the things that would enhance people's respect for the regulations is to adopt amendments such as the oneS that the opposition is putting forward here today in regard to subsections 20A(1) and (2). This would be overwhelmingly supported by there people in the industry. It would enhance their regard for the regulator and their regard for the regulations overall and, by so doing, increase the likelihood of people actually giving proper and due respect to the regulations and the regulator and complying with the regulations and the wishes of the regulator. This ensures that the new Civil Aviation Authority does not waste so much of its resources on protecting people from themselves, that it reallocates those resources to protecting the paying customers of aviation, such as those who flew on the Monarchs and the Seaviews and who put their lives in the hands of the system, expecting the system to work properly to maintain safety. By doing I think we will fulfil the expectations of at the travelling public. These amendments are to fulfil those expectations effectively, give proper respect and regard to the new if safety regulator and ensure that people in the industry will voluntarily and enthusiastically adhere to these sorts of regulations.  p.m.)-If ever I have heard a half-hearted contribution from a member of this House in support of an amendment, it is the one that has just concluded. In fact, the concluding remarks of the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) really constitute a very strong argument in support of the government view that this issue be referred to the House of Representatives the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure for much wider discussion, interpretation and report to this parliament. Let us put the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association in its proper perspective. Its latest presentation is that it really represents people who love to fly. Well, lots of people love to fly. But there are over 60,000 licensed pilots in this country; about 10,000 of them are members of AOPA. That is quite proper. It is seen a very useful organisation to have. If one reads the journal of AOPA, no matter over how long you want to go back you will find constant exhortations to people to attack whatever authority was responsible for ,aviation regulation. If you read the latest edition, is an article which is well deserving of attention by this parliament. In it the readers are exhorted not to contact the CAA if they are in trouble in the air, because they are likely to be pinged. If you are in trouble, the last one you contact is the Civil Aviation Authority. I think somebody really needs to look at the responsibility for the publication of material like that. We should not assume that all those 60,000 pilots are able, adept and of the highest level of competence. There are all sorts, and all with differing levels of competence, experience, nervous capability and judgment-and much of it is judgment. Here we have a proposal from the government which is the most reasonable one you could put. The government is saying, 'Let's leave the law as it has been for the past 35 years. Just leave it as it is.' No-one has previously raised one issue about this clause. But, since one sector within the industry has a concern, the government has proposed to send that clause back to the committeewhere it could have been raised before but was not-to have it examined to see whether the rest of those pilots, those other 50,000 pilots through the various organisations, are interested in this issue and whether there is really a problem. The government is indicating a preparedness to put it on the table of the committee charged with the responsibility to look at aviation safety matters so that it can go through the issue and report promptly to the parliament. We will do that. I certainly would argue that the members of the committee on both sides of the House have now got the competence and experience to do a good job on this,· and a quick job. Reference has been made to the United States. But the position in the United States is a bit different from what has been presented by AOPA. The AOPA provision is similar to the one which operates in the United States. We have said we are not prepared to adopt uncritically the AOPA provision without a detailed knowledge of the legal arid judicial context within which the US provision operates. I mentioned in my speech on the second reading that you need to look at the climate and all the other factors that are involved, not just the words of the legislation. What is appropriate for the US climate, what is appropriate for the US environment, might be utterly inappropriate here. So you need to look at all of the factors involved. From the research we have had done on the United States situation, the advice provided to me is that the offence is a civil one enabling a licence to be suspended. As such, the burden of proof is a civil one-that is, on the balance of probabilities-rather than a criminal one where the burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt. The United States courts have been prepared to imply a concept of potential endangerment into the offence. This concept of potential endangerment, as contained in the initial amendment, was criticised 25 to by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. But the association cannot have it both ways. If that is the interpretation the US courts are placing on it by practice of the courts-even though the words are feweryou cannot say you want the US model but not be prepared to have it clearly prescribed. So those words I have put to you really only point to the need for this matter to be best examined, and most competently examined, by the committee. In conclusion, I say to the honourable member for Hume: when you made the comment that the CAA spent too much time protecting people from themselves when it should have been concentrating on commercial aviation, you made a comparison with abseiling. For heaven's sake, you cannot compare abseiling with flying; they are vastly different. (Time expired)",109
233,Mr SHARP,CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION,"As always, the honourable member for Shortland  views that are worth commenting on. People must recognise that, if these amendments are picked up by the government, it will not mean that the general aviation sector and the sports aviation sector will· be totally neglected in terms of safety regulation and surveillance. The intent of these amendments is that those people will still continue to have regulation and safety surveillance imposed on them to ensure that they do not endanger the lives of other people. There will always have to be proper surveillance and regulation of that sector.  Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association for years, said it is ridiculous that his Mooney aircraft-his only aircraft-which has only one door into it and obviously only one door activities. out of it could be grounded for the simple reason that it does not have an exit sign over body's roof. the one and only door in the aircraft right next to his head. This is the extreme example that was pointed out to us by the former chainnan of the Aircraft Owners Association. Here you have an overzealous regulator imposing grounding conditions on an aircraft which has only one door simply based on the fact that it does not have an exit sign over the ing one and only door in the aircraft. This is an example-it can be duplicated by other people with different examples-of just how overzealous the former regulator has been in the past. These amendments are designed to try to overcome that overzealous nature of new regulator to ensure that the new regulator involves itself in matters that are really important and that it does not get matters that are not important. The AOPA amendment, as it has commonly become known around the House over the last week or two, is simply designed to focus new regulator's attentions on giving the first and foremost priority to protecting the of others. It ensures that, if a sports aviator gets in there and undertakes a risky action, is not putting at risk the life of another person. It seems highly reasonable for the public of Australia to expect the aviation regulator to be protecting the lives of innocent people. That is what this amendment is all about. It ensures that the focus of the regulator is to protect the lives of innocent people and that it does not go to the ridicuthe lous extremes that it used to under the old regulator of trying to protect people from themselves. If the honourable member for Shortland did not like my example of abseilers in Bungonia Gorge, the-e are many other examples that he may find nlore suitable. The example that has often been used is that of rock fishennen. Many rock fishennen go out there and risk their lives every day. The net consequence of their taking a risk of their own life is that 14 nobody else is likely to be endangered; they are going to risk only their own lives. We do not stop them from undertaking those sorts of ",111
234,Mr SHARP,CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION,"Yes, unless they fall on somebody's roof, as the minister has said. I cannot imagine how a rock fisherman could and Pilots fall on somebody' s roof",112
235,Mr SHARP,CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION,"That again is encompassed by this amendment because that is endangerthe life of another person or another person's property. So this amendment covers that. We are trying to ensure that innocent parties are well and truly protected by the new regulator and that the new regulator does not get engaged in the same silly activities the that the old one used to. It would focus too much attention. on protecting people from themselves at the expense of not protecting involved in the travelling public.  p.m.)-I want to conclude this ping-pong that we are having across the chamber. As I said the before, you cannot make a comparison between abseiling and flying. As the Minister lives for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch), who is at the table, just said, no he matter how you legislate-and people always set out with the best of intentions-the Civil Aviation Act is only partly about the people in the planes; it is very much about the people on the ground underneath the planes. The intention of the original legislation new was not to protect the hoons-as they were perceived-who flew in aeroplanes back in 1920s. It was to protect the people, later .in the 1930s, who were worried that these people flying around in the air were doing a most unnatural thing; that they were operating in contravention of nature; and that human beings were not meant to fly, otherwise they would have had wings. It has to be remembered in all of this that the legislation embraces all kinds of aviation activity. This legislation is not just about members of AOPA. This legislation covers all forms of aviation activity and all participants in aviation activity. I listened to the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) suggest that the activity of people flying around by themselves and enjoying themselves is as innocent as abseiling because you can only injure yourself. I draw to his attention some of the recent crashes where only the pilot was involved. I do not want to mention specific places, but he is aware of them because I spoke to him during the break about them. The legislation does not protect those people on the ground involved in pilot only crashes. This legislation and that clause has sat there Filing, P. A. for 25 to 35 years. We are not convincedand I certainly am not convinced-that there is suddenly a reason for urgency because somebody started a campaign and wanted to get some spurs, some notches, on their gun to show that they started this campaign and that this is what we can do. The extreme example the former president of AOPA referred to about the sign on the cabin is a ridiculous example. It was a ridiculous practice but, similarly, one could go to other locations and other similar events. That is not what this legislation is about. It Taylor, W. L. is substantially about the overall safety and protection of the travelling public and the protection of the people on the ground who could be injured by the operation of aircraft. All of these matters simply constitute a greater argument. I ask the honourable member opposite to join us in that. It should go back to the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. We should get everybody who is likely to be involved together. Let us ask members of the public, who have not had a say in any of this yet-the customers, the people likely to be affected-and hear what they have to say, and the member for Hume, my colleagues and I can then bring a prompt report back to this parliament. That is the best possible treatment of it. Question put: That the amendments (Mr Sharp's) be agreed to. The House divided. [7.01 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr G.B.

236,Mr SHARP,NOES,"I move: (5) Schedule I, page 35, item 141, omit the item, substitute the following item: ""141 Section 96: Repeal the section, substitute: 'Tabling of directions or notices of the Minister NA 96. Where the Minister gives a direction under section 12, 12B or 45 or a notice under section 12A, the Minister shall cause a copy of the direction or notice to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the giving of the direction or the notice.'."". The purpose of this amendment is quite clear. We recognise that, from time to time, the Minister for Transport may give directions to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. We believe that is a proper process for the minister to undertake. The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) ""to made a number of directions to the old Civil Aviation Authority, many of which people in the community would have strongly supported and which people on this side of the House strongly supported. Making those directions, if you like, forces the Civil Aviation Authority of old to adhere to the minister's direction. Nobody would disagree with the process there. The Minister for Transport may have enhanced his reputation by issuing those directions. In a sense, this amendment might further enhance his reputation by ensuring that the directions the minister has given the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority are drawn to the public's attention quickly and effectively by their being tabled in the parliament within 15 sitting days of their being given. This is a step towards open, transparent and honest government. We do not see that any reasonable arguments can be put up against this amendment. In the interests of the public knowing what the government is doing in the vital area of aviation safety and its reasons for doing it, we think that this is a perfectly reasonable and legitimate amendment. It will ensure that, if the minister does make a direction to the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority, within 15 sitting days the parliament-the House of Representatives and the Senate-will be properly notified so that the public can understand what the minister has been doing in the interests of public safety. We move this amendment knowing that there are no legitimate arguments against open, honest and transparent government. amendment should be supported on the basis of open, free and honest government.  Science and Personnel) (7.11 p.m.)-The Insert: government opposes this amendment principally because we already have open, honest and transparent government. Mr Sharp-More honest and open.  cally, the legislation, in particular subsection 49(2), will require the annual report of the authority to include particulars of directions under clauses 12 and 12(B) and direction notices under clause 12(A). This provides appropriate advice to the parliament while preserving the role of the responsible minister. The authority is accountable to the minister and the minister, in able to the parliament. In short, we think the matter is well covered as proposed. Amendment negatived.  (17) Schedule 1, page 36, omit item 149, substitute: ""149.

The arguments supporting this amendment are similar to our earlier arguments on exactly the same amendments the opposition put forward to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. For that reason, I will not delay the House any further by repeating those arguments. I will simply say that I would find it difficult to argue against the amendment because everyThis thing that a government organisation should do should be based on being economical and effective.  Science and Personnel) (7.17 p.m.)-The its government opposes this amendment. AA is minister a GBE, and the whole legislative frameamendment. work-including the proposed CAC Actprovides for it to operate on a commercial basis, consistent with the government's policy for enterprises of this nature. Under clause 20(1)(b), the board must ensure that 'AA performs its functions in proper, efficient and effective manner'. inclusion of 'economical' and 'effective' in clause 9, at best, adds nothing and may lead to unforeseen legal confusion. It is unclear what the requirement 'promotes and fosters civil aviation' means and precisely would set about meeting this requirement. Under the bill, AA's powers relate to provision of specific facilities and services with a requirement to recover the costs on commercial basis. The term 'promote'· reworld, quires an active involvement which is beyond AA's powers and functions and could result in a conflict of interest with its obligations. The government considers, with all due respect, that this is an ill-considered amendment and that the opposition needs to explain how it envisages it would work. Amendment negatived. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 10 to 14-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Proposed new clause 14A.",116
238,Mr SHARP,PAIRS,"I move: (2) Page 8, after clause 14 insert the following new clause: Tabling of corporate plan ""14A. The Minister must cause a copy of the corporate plan to be laid before each House of Parliament: (a) within 15 sitting days. after the Minister received the plan, if the Minister did not direct the members to vary the plan; or (b) within 15 sitting days after the Minister received a revised plan, if the Minister did direct the members to vary the plan."". amendment has been circulated in my name and deals with the tabling of a corporate plan for Airservices Australia, under the Air Services Bill 1995. The opposition is of the view that the corporate plan of the new Airservices Australia ought to be tabled, upon completion, within 15 sitting days of the receiving it. That is the thrust of our I know the view from the Minister for  will be that the government is not going to support this. His argument will be that this is commercial in confidence; that Airservices a Australia, AA, is a commercial operation and, The therefore, has commercial in confidence requirements that must be considered with its corporate plan and, for that reason, the corporate plan should not be made known to the public. That is an argument I can understand how AA the minister putting. But I make this point: Airservices Australia the is a government monopoly. There is nobody out there competing with Airservices Australa is. It has a unique position in the commercial if you like. It is an organisation that is not subject to competition because all of the things that it does are a monopoly, a governcommercial ment legislated monopoly. In that light, I cannot see how any commercial damage could be done to Airservices Australia by publishing its corporate plan. This is an organisation that will be wholly owned by the Australian public. This organisation is solely for the Australian public's benefit, and I can see no reason why its corporate plan-outlining its purposes, its directions, the way in which it hopes to achieve those things-cannot be made available for public scrutiny. As I say, there is no commercial damage done by revealing that corporate plan simply because Airservices Australia does not have a commercial competitor. It is a unique government monopoly providing a service that nobody else can. Therefore, no commercial damage can be done by revealing its corporate plan. Again, in the interests of open, honest and transparent government, the opposition moves this amendment, recognising that by so doing we are only requ-ring the government to provide information to the public, who are the owners of this organisation-an organisation whose existence is for the benefit of the public. Therefore, I move this amendment, recognising no doubt that the government will oppose it. But I do not think the arguments for opposing it are all that valid.  Science and Personnel) (7.23 p.m.)-Yes, the honourable member has got it correct: the government does oppose the amendment. The second facet of his speech he has incorrect, in that there is good and valid reason for not accepting the proposal. It is true that the corporate plans of governinstrumentality ment business enterprises of any kind by their nature contain commercial in confidence material. These are commercial in confidence by their nature not only to parties who they might contract with or involve themselves with but also, of course, in connection with their general influence and relationships within the commercial community. Corporate plans, therefore, are and should remain confidential to ministers, their advisers and departments. Government policy is and remains not to release those as public documents. Amendment negatived. Clauses 15 to 54-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Clause 55.

239,Mr SHARP,PAIRS,"I move: (3) Page 28, before clause 73 in Part 6, insert the following new clause: Tabling of directions or notices of the Minister ""nA. Where the Minister gives a direction under section 14, 15, 17, 45 or 46 or a notice under section 16 or 53, the Minister shall cause a copy of the direction or notice to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the giving of the direction or notice."". I do not think I will labour the House with a fulsome argument for the amendment as it is a duplicate, if you like, of the amendment we moved to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The arguments I put in regard to that are exactly the same as the arguments for this amendment. I dare say the Minister for  will propose arguments against it based on exactly the same grounds. I have moved the amendment based on the argument for free, open, honest and transparent government. We believe it is important that, if the minister is to give directions to an important government like this, those directions be made public as quickly as is possible for the ultimate benefit of the public.  Science and Personnel) (7.27 p.m.)-Once again, I find myself in agreement with the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) in our search, valiant as it is, for free, open, honest and transparent government. But, as the honourable member has predicted, the government does not support this proposal either, for similar reasons as outlined earlier this evening on another issue. The government does not support this proposal, simply because the bill will require that AA's annual report include particulars of certain directions under clauses 15 and 17, and strategic direction notices under clause 16. This, we believe, provides appropriate advice to the parliament while preserving the very important role of the responsible minister. The government does not accept this amendment.",117
240,Mr SHARP,PAIRS,"I thank the Minister for Defence Science and Person pointed that the government is not picking up the opposition amendment. I make the point that the purpose of our amendment is to ensure that where the Minister for Transport does give a direction to Airservices Australia, the new government instrumentality designed to be a major player in aviation safety in Australia, that direction is made known to the public within 15 sitting days of the parliament being given notice. The point of this is that the public does deserve to know precisely what the minister has done, in the interests of public safety. For that reason, I think the argument is perfectly valid. I am disappointed that the government will not be picking it up, but I will not debate the matter any further. Amendment negatived. Remainder of bill-by leave-taken as a whole, and agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading  read a third time. NA Republic",118
241,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," by leave-It is the Government's view that Australia's Head of State should be an Australian-that Australia should become a republic by the year 2001. Tonight I shall describe the means by which we believe this ought to be done. Honourable members will recall that to fulfil an undertaking given during the last election campaign, on 28 April 1993 the Government established a Republic Advisory Committee to prepare an options paper which would describe the minimum constitutional changes necessary to create a federal republic of Australia. The Republic Advisory Committee was chaired by Mr Malcolm Turnbull and comprised Dr Glyn Davis, Miss Namoi Dougall, the Hon. Nick Greiner, Dr John Hirst, Ms Mary Kostakidis, Miss Lois O'Donoghue, the Hon. Susan Ryan and Professor George Winterton. I take this opportunity to thank them. They consulted widely throughout Australia, carried out their work with dedication and energy and delivered to the Government and to posterity a most valuable document. In the eighteen months which have passed since the release of the Report, the idea of an Australian republic has come to occupy a central place in our national political debate: not only in this Parliament but within the political parties, in major representative and community bodies, in schools and universities, communities at large and, I daresay, around countless Australian dinner tables. In the process many Australians have come to favour a Republic. Just as many, perhaps, now believe it is inevitable. Many may regret the prospect of change and be unsure about the means by which it can be achieved, but recognise that sooner or later we must have an Australian as our Head of State .. That one small step would make Australia a repUblic. Governments can wait· for opinion to force their hand, or they can lead. They can wait for the world to change and respond as necessity demands, or they can see the way the world is going and point the way. We are approaching the 21st century and the centenary of our nationhood. As never before we are making our own way in our region and the world; For us the world is going-and we are going-in a way which makes our having the British monarch as our Head of State increasingly anomalous. The fact is that if the plans for our nationhood were being drawn up now, by this generation of Australians and not those of a century ago, it is beyond question that we would make our Head of State an Australian. Any suggestion that the British monarch would fill the role would not be entertained. This is not because our generation lac-s respect for the British monarchy, or the British people, or our British heritage, or the British institutions we have made our own, or our long friendship with the British in peace and in war. On the contrary, Australians everywhere respect them, as they respect The Queen. But they are not Australian. It is so obvious, that if we were just now drawing up our constitution, we probably would not even feel the need to say that the Australian Head of State will be Australianit would go without saying. That it does not go without saying today is an accident of history . We are attached to Great Britain by long threads of kinship and affection which, to a considerable extent, are embodied in the warmth of our regard for Queen Elizabeth. Many Australians may well feel that to substitute an Australian for the monarchy constitutes in some way a rejection of these ties. I think all of us can understand these feelings. But the creation of an Australian republic is not an act of rejection. It is one of recognition: in making the change we will recognise that our deepest respect is for our Australian heritage, our deepest affection is for Australia, and our deepest responsibility is to Australia's future. Nothing in the creation of an Australian republic will alter the facts of our heritage and our affections. Indeed our relationship with Britain may well become the more thoroughly 'modem relationship' which the British Prime Minister expressed a desire for two years ago. The development of a mature and modem relationship will certainly not be· inhibited by recognition of the truth. We are friends with separate destinies to carve out in the world. We are not as we once were, in a parent-child relationship. The people of modem Australia are drawn from virtually every country in the world. It is no reflection on the loyalty of a great many of them to say that the British monarchy is a remote and inadequate symbol of their affections for Australia. And we can be equally sure that in the 21st century the British monarchy will become even more remote from even more Australians. Australia occupies a unique place in the world and makes a unique contribution to it. Our destiny is in no-one else's hands but our own: we alone bear the responsibility for deciding what the nature of our government and society will be, what advantage we will take of our human and material resources, what kind of place our children will inherit. .It is not a radical undertaking that we propose. In proposing that our head of state should be an Australian we are proposing nothing more than the obvious. Our head of state should embody and represent Australia's values and traditions, Australia's experience and aspirations. We need not apologise for the nationalism in these sentiments, but in truth they contain as much common sense as patriotism. This is a point worth making: this republican initiative is not an exercise in jingoism; it is not accompanied by the beat of drums--or chests. It asserts nothing more than our unique identity. It expresses nothing more than our desire to have a Head of State who is truly one of us. It changes nothing more than what is required to make clear and unambiguous our independence and responsibility for our own affairs. It is a small step, but a highly significant one. The government believes that at this stage of our history it is a logical and an essential one. And it can reflect that stage in our history. An Australian Head of State can embody our modem aspirations-our cultural diversity, our evolving partnerships with Asia and the Pacific, our quest for reconciliation with Aboriginal Australians, our ambition to create a society in which women have equal opportunity, equal representation and equal rights. In this decade we have a chance which few other countries have; in declaring ourselves for an Australian republic, we can give expression to both our best traditions and our current sensibilities and ambitions. At present, under the Constitution, Australia's Head of State is The Queen and her ""heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom"". Anyone reading the Australian Constitution who is unfamiliar with the practical realities of Australian government would assume that the role of the monarch was central. In fact, the involvement of the British monarch in Australia's affairs is now very limited. The Queen's role as Head of State is in most respects carried out by the Governor General. Of the responsibilities The Queen retains, the most notable is her appointment of the Governor General which, by convention, she does on the advice of the Prime Minister. We are not quite alone among the countries of the world in having as our Head of State someone who is not one of our own citizens, but we are in a very small minority-and a majority of the countries in the Commonwealth of Nations are republics with their own Head of State. Of the 185 members of the United Nations, only 15 do not have their own Heads of State-and 14 of those 15 are former British Dominions. The Queen of Australia is also Queen of the United Kingdom and 14 other countries in the United Nations. Notwithstanding that The Queen is Australia's Head of State and fulfils that duty conscientiously, when she travels overseas she represents only the United Kingdom. Her visits abroad often tend to promote British trade and British interests-they do not promote Australia's trade and interests. This is, of course, right and proper for the Head of State of the United Kingdom. But it is not right for Australia. The right Head of State for Australia is one of us, embodying the things for which we stand, reminding us of those things at home and representing them abroad. We number among those things fairness, tolerance and love of this country. It is a role only an Australian can fill. Each and every Australian should be able to aspire to be our Head of State. Every Australian should know that the office will always be filled by a citizen of high standing who has made an outstanding contribution to Australia and who, in making it, has enlarged our view of what it is to be Australian. In these and other ways, the creation of an Australian republic can actually deliver a heightened sense of unity, it can enliven our national spirit and, in our own minds and those of our neighbours, answer beyond doubt the perennial question of Australian identitythe question of who we are and what we stand for. The answer is not what having a foreign Head of State suggests. We are not a political or cultural appendage to another country's past. We are simply and unambiguously Australian. If only by a small degree an Australian republic fulfilled these ideals then it would be worth it. Measured against other stages of our development it is a relatively simple and modest undertaking. A hundred years ago, despite their rivalries and the enormous distances which separated them, the Australian colonies came together and created a nation. In the course of a century we have evolved from a collection of British colonies; to a single nation of limited independence; to a Dominion in the British Empire; to a sovereign nation in all respects bar one. In the same century we have come through great trials of our collective courage and ingenuity. As Australian democracy and society have evolved and developed, the practical character of Australian government has dramatically changed. For example, in the 1930s the Governor General ceased to be the representative of the British government in Australia and became the representative of the British monarch alone. In the same decade it was accepted that the British monarch would act solely on the advice of the Australian government-not the British government-in relation to Australian matters; and Australia assumed responsibility for its own external affairs which had been previously the responsibility of the British government. In 1930 for the first time, an Australian became Governor General. With the abolition of all remaining rights of appeal to the Privy Council in London, in the 1980s Australian courts became the ultimate arbiters of Australian law. Also with the passage of the Australia Act, the Parliament of the United Kingdom relinquished the last vestiges of its power to make laws applying to Australia. In every instance, there was controversy. Today it is hard to imagine why the changes were opposed. And we are all the better for the changes. the 1990s we are stronger, richer and better placed in the world than ever before. At every affected. stage in our development there have been hesitations, but in the end we have always recognised necessity and where our interests lie. If at times we have been cautious taking large steps forward, it cannot be said Australia"" . that we have taken any backwards. That is what we seek with the republic: small but important step forward-the last step in a process which began one hundred years ago. We think it is time to embrace necessary change. We therefore intend to ask the Australian people if they want an Australian republic with an Australian Head of State. The change we propose has very limited implications for the design of Australia's democracy. It is the so-called ""minimalist"" option. All the essential Constitutional princidescribed ples and practices which have worked well and evolved constructively over the last hundred years will remain in place. I stress that these proposals represent the Government's preferred position. We do not suggest that it is the only position and not open to change. But it is a position reached after careful consideration of the Advisory Committee's report, and we believe it to be a wise position that will stand the test of time. ""Commonwealth"" is a word of ancient lineage which reflects both our popular tradition our Federal system, and we propose that the Australian republic retain the name ""Comand, monwealth of Australia"". Under the proposals the role of the House Representatives and the Senate will remain unchanged, as will the role and powers of States. We will still be a Federation. virtually every respect, our governmental arrangements will be exactly the same as they are now: the day to day handling of national government will remain with Ministers led by cials. the Prime Minister; the Cabinet will continue to deal with the major issues; and Ministers will continue to be responsible to Parliament and the Australian people. In Our membership of the Commonwealth of Nations headed by The Queen will not be None of these things will change, but we will have an Australian as our Head of State, and we propose that he or she be described by the about ,term ""President of the Commonwealth of The President will perform essentially the a same functions as the Governor General. As with the Governor General, except in the most exceptional circumstances, these functions the will be carried out on the advice of the Government of the day. A former Australian Governor General, Sir Zelman Cowen, made some remarks last week which I think bear repeating. They echoed those of a predecessor of his, Sir Paul Hasluck; and in fact I should think they contain a sentiment common to every Governor General since Federation. Sir Zelman the Governor General's role as ""the highest single expression in the Australian governmental structure of the idea that all Australians from all parties and all walks of life belong to the same nation"". An Australian Head of State would perform precisely this unifying role; and, it follows, would need to be of the same stature and integrity as we seek in our Governors-General. A significant element of the Head of State's role is symbolic; performing ceremonial duties around the nation and abroad. This is the and public aspect of the office: the means by which the Head of State represents Australia by his or her example and encouragement, provides national leadership. of The Head of State will also continue to perform the formal administrative duties given the to the Governor General by legislation and In which are undertaken on the advice of the Federal Executive Council. The Head of State's duties here include formalising government regulations and appointing public offiThe Head of State will assume the Governor General's constitutional duties, most of which are, by convention, performed in accordance with the advice of the government of the day. These include summoning and dissolving the House of Represey.tatives and the Parliament as a whole and issuing writs for Federal elections. The Head of State will also take over the Governor General's role as titular Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. In line with actual practice, we propose that the Constitution be amended to make clear that the Head of State will exercise these constitutional duties on the advice of the government of the day. Finally, the Head of State will retain those very few powers now held by the Governor General which, in the most exceptional circumstances, may be exercised without, or possibly contrary to, Ministerial advice. These are the so-called reserve powers. The Republic Advisory Committee identified these powers as: the power to appoint the Prime Minister; the power to dismiss the Prime Minister and therefore the·government; and the power to refuse a request by the Prime Minister to dissolve one or both Houses of the Parliament. The Committee made the point that there are a number of principles or conventions underpinning our Westminster style of government and the practical operation of our Constitution. These principles, which are not currently set out in the Constitution, determine whether the circumstances exist for the Governor General to exercise a reserve power and what action would be appropriate. Theoretically, it would be possible to fully codify or write down these conventions, assuming one could foresee all the contingencies they might be required to meet. I have no doubt that a great many people would like to see the Head of State's discretionary, or reserve, powers tightly defined-as they are, for example, in the Irish Constitution-so as to oblige the Head of State to act in accordance with express rules in the Constitution, Ministerial advice, in all circumstances. The question is, then: should the reserve powers-which are imprecise and governed by precedent and convention-be codified? Should they be delineated, cut down or specified precisely in our Constitution, or should they remain as they apply now, by unwritten convention? The advantage of codifying the conventions, whether in whole or in part, would be to bring a degree of clarity and certainty to the options open to a Head of State in different situations. However, after careful consideration, the Government has formed the view that it is probably impossible to write down or codify these powers in a way that would both find general community acceptance and cover every possible contingency. As the system evolves there needs to be some capacity to respond to circumstances quite unforeseen today. Tightly defined rules can themselves have unforeseen consequences. Were we to try, by Constitutional amendment, to set down precisely how the reserve powers should be exercised by the Head of State, those amendments, even if intended to be otherwise, could well become justiciable-that is capable of being adjudicated by the High Court of Australia and required to be adjudicated by the High Court. Hence, codification would be likely to result in fundamental change to our system of government and alter the status of the High Court in relation to the Executive and the Parliament. Over time, Justices of the Court could well be drawn into arbitrating purely political disputes whose resolution should ultimately be in the hands of the electorate. The Court would thus be exposed to public pressure and, in the inevitable event that a party to a dispute was unhappy with its resolution, the standing and impartiality of the Court could be called into question. For these reasons the Government believes that, on balance, whatever the immediate attraction of this course might be, it would not be desirable to attempt to codify the reserve powers; and that the design, processes or and conventions at present governing their exercise by the Governor General should be transferred to the Australian Head of State without alteration. We are aware that, with this option, there is a risk that Australian governments may occasionally find themselves in conflict with a Head of State who exercises political judgment without regard to the conventions. We are also, of course, conscious of the possibility of a repetition of the events of 1975, when a government possessing the confidence of the House of Representatives was denied supply by the Senate. But the question of the Senate's powers over supply is a very different issue from that of establishing an Australian Head of State. It is an issue that deserves to be addressed, but it doesn't need to be addressed at the same time. If these reserve powers are to be given to a new Head of State, it is critically important that the authority and source of the Head of State's power is consistent with the national interest and the continued effective operation of our political system. There has been considerable debate in the community about how the Head of State should be chosen. As things now stand, the Governor General is appointed by The Queen acting on the sole advice of the Prime Minister. It is clear that most people believe the Prime Minister should not have such exclusive power in appointing an Australian Head of State. The debate is principally between those who support popular election and those who favour election by the Parliament. The desire for a popular election stems from the democratic sentiment which all Australians - including all of us in this place-share. However, the Government has come to the view that if a new Australian Head of State were to be elected by popular mandate, he or she would inherit a basis of power that would prove to be fundamentally at odds with our Westminster-style system of government. It should be recognised that a Head of State, whose powers derived from a general election, would be the only person in the political system so elected. His or her powers would be nominally much greater than those of all other Commonwealth office holders, including the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, who are, without exception, indirectly elected via large elected parties. With a popularly elected President, potential would exist for the representative and democratically· elected parliamentary chambers, the repositories of the diffuse power of Australian democracy, to be gradually diminished, while the embodiment of the nation and great powers were vested in one person. That would constitute a very dramatic-and undesirable-change to a system which all of us agree has served us well. Whatever differences of opinion may presently exist about the most desirable mode of his or her election, I think there is a consensus that the Head of State should be, in some sense, ""above politics"". With this the Government agrees. The Head of State should be an eminent Australian, a widely respected figure who can represent the nation as a whole. This in fact has been the character of the role of the Governor General and it should be protected and retained in the role of a Head of State. Popular election guarantees that the Head of State will not be above politics-indeed it guarantees that the Head of State will be a politician. As Sir Zelman Cowen pointed out in his speech last week, a ""direct election of a President would ensure political outcomes""; and he went on to say that people like himself and another former Governor General, Sir Ninian Stephen, ""would not have the resources or inclination to contest such an election"". We cannot have a Head of State who is ""above politics"" if we subject candidates to popular elections-we will get instead politicians, political parties and political campaigns. And we will get a Head of State with an authority unheard of in our political system and discordant with some of the basic principles on which that system rests. We therefore propose, as the Republic Advisory Committee suggested, that the Head of State be elected by a two-thirds majority vote in a joint sitting of both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament on the nomination of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. Such a joint sitting would be a unique occasion, bringing together all the political parties, and both Houses of the Parliament, in a spirit of bipartisanship and cooperation. Obviously, before the vote was taken the non-government parties would have to be consulted to ensure that the candidate had their support. It would be impossible for any government to dictate the outcome of this process. A two-thirds majority vote of both Houses would require bipartisan support and ensure that the Head of State had the blessing of all the major parties. The RAC report makes the point that a two-thirds majority in the present parliament would require the votes of 40 more members than the Government presently has. In fact, no government since World War II has enjoyed a two-thirds majority. A Head of State appointed by both Houses would be subject to removal by both Houses if it was the opinion of a two-thirds majority that his or her conduct was inappropriate. This is why, given the difficulties of codificaof tion I have described and given that we believe the conventions governing the reserve powers will in large measure need to remain with the Head of State, it is imperative that his or her mandate does not flow from popular election but from the representative power of the House of Representatives and the proportional power of the Senate. The other brake on any wilful or misguided behaviour by a Head of State is that the process of removal should not be contingent on a specified set of facts or circumstances or conditions. The joint sitting would be unconstrained in its actions or in its decision by being able to consider squarely the behaviour of any incumbent. A further inhibition to misguided or inappropriate behaviour is the proposal that either house may, by simple majority, initiate ajoint sitting to remove or censure a Head of State. The Government believes that, taken together-the authority and source of the Head of State's powers coming from the Parliament, removal by the same means as appointment, and the capacity to censure-these elements provide effective counter-weights to the substantial authority vested in the Head of State through the reserve powers. In addition, in the light of the events of 1975, any Head of State determined upon a controversial course of action would do so in the knowledge that he or she would be confronted with the weight of public opprobrium, and will be at pains to ensure that every course of action is both warranted and capable of being defended. The Government proposes that, consistent with the convention for Governors-General, the term of office for the Head of State be five years, and that Heads of State be permitted to serve one term only. To prevent any attempt to influence Heads of State by offers of subsequent employment, we propose that outgoing Heads of State not be permitted to accept remuneration from the Commonwealth in addition to their pension until five years have passed since their departure from the office. As an additional step to ensure that the office Head of State is not politicised, the Government proposes that serving and former parliamentarians-Commonwealth, State and Territory-be excluded from candidature until five years have passed since their departure from parliament. There are other detailed issues that will also need to be addressed. For example, arrangements for unexpected vacancies would broadly mirror those currently in place. It is not our intention that the Government's proposals should affect the Constitutions of the Australian States. It would be up to each State to decide how in future they would appoint their respective Heads of State. It is reasonable to expect that if the Australian people opt for an Australian Head of State, the States would follow suit. But the question would be for each State to decide. In this regard, we were interested that a committee commissioned to examine the issue by the West Australian government concluded that, if the minimalist approach proposed by the Republic Advisory Committee were to be adopted, the position of the States within the federation would not be substantially affected. The Government is ready to have senior Commonwealth Ministers brief State governments on the proposals and we sincerely hope that all State Premiers will make constructive contributions to the public debate. The Government puts forward these proposals to provide a basis for considered public discussion. The Australian Constitution cannot be changed in any way without a referendum, and. to succeed at a referendum a proposed change must win the agreement of a majority of voters in a majority of States and a majority of voters overall. The Government proposes to put the question of a republic to the Australian people some time in 1998 or 1999. Acceptance at the referendum will mean that Australia can be a republic by the year of the centenary of Federation, 2001. Before the referendum, there will be extensive consultation with the people of Australia. But it should be clearly understood that nothing we can devise in addition to the due democratic processes will match those processes in the information they provide, the debate they stimulate or the power they give the people. The passage of the Referendum Bill through both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament will be followed by an extensive campaign in whioh arguments for and against a republic will be put. And the people's vote-and the people's vote alone-will decide the issue. In short, the Constitution requires that the Parliament, the nation's representative and deliberative body, alone can formally determine the proposals to be put to the people in a referendum. I stress this point. The Parliament alone can formally decide what is put in a referendum. At most, any suggested convention can only be a consultative device and, in obvious ways, an elitist one. There have been calls for a constitutional convention, but the limitations of that procedure should be understood. There were six Constitutional Conventions between 1973 and 1985 followed by a Constitutional Commission. It is not unfair to say that they were unproductive. And any future convention not limited to the issue of the republic and the Head of State would be a convention going over the same old ground as all the others before it. Some people have drawn comparisons with the constitutional conventions of the 1890s, but there is an essential difference between those and any current proposals. Here, we are attempting a modest change to the Constitution-in the 1890s they were attempting to write it. And among the things they wrote was the requirement that any change to the Constitution must be submitted to a referendum. That is the democratic obligation we are under today. The 1890s conventions were proponents of change. They were concerned with one .question-how to create from the separate Australian colonies one indissoluble Commonwealth of Australia. So would any convention on the republic need to be a proponent of the republic, and concerned only with one issue-the best means by which the people of the Commonwealth of Australia can have an Australian as their Head of State. The detail of the changes we propose may at first glance obscure the meaning of them. The meaning is simple and, we believe, irresistible-as simple and irresistible as the idea of a Commonwealth of Australia was to the Australians of a century ago. The meaning then was a nation united in common cause for the common good. A nation which gave expression to the lives we lead together on this continent, the experience and hopes we share as Australians. The meaning now is still a product of that founding sentiment-it is that we are all Australians. We share a continent. We share a past, a present and a future. And our Head of State should be one of us. For the information of honourable members. I present the following paper, which also contains a summary of the government's proposals on an Australian republic: Republic-Ministerial statement, 7 June 1995. Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Motion (by Mr Beazley)-by leaveagreed to: That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition speaking for a period not exceeding 30 minutes when the debate is resumed.

242,Ms WORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"Adelaide) (8.00 p.m}-This year of 1995 marks the 50th anniversary of the formation of the United Nations. I wish to commend to the House an inspiring global event celebrating this· anniversary, which arrived in Canberra today. The Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run is an Olympic style relay passing a symbolic flaming torch from hand to hand throughout the world; a hopeful and joyful expression for a· world of peace and harmony. .. First held in 1987, the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run has been run every two years since. The 1995 peace run is the largest and longest yet. Over 50 million strides will c-ry the peace torch more than 80,000 kilometres, through 83 countries. Here in Australia, a continuous relay is running from Adelaide to Brisbane with satellite events in Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. I was proud to have launched the peace run in Adelaide, and I acknowledge Fiona, whom I passed the torch to as we ran up King William Street, and other runners from Adelaide who are here in the gallery tonight. The peace run is for all. Every citizen can participate regardless of race, rank, age, gender or faith, in a true spirit of cooperation and harmony. The peace run is non-political and non-denominational and raises no funds for any cause. Its only aim is the promotion of universal harmony, understanding and - oodwill. Numerous world leaders in many fIelds have joined in the spirit of the peace run by holding the peace torch. These have included in recent weeks Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and His Holiness Pope John Paul II. I would like to take this opportunity also draw members' attention to another event in honour of the UN's 50th anniversary: an exhibition of Sri Chinmoy peace birds in the theatre foyer of Parliament House, which opened today. The peace birds are a selection from a series of over three million drawings of birds by Sri Chinmoy, representing the spirit of peace and freedom. I urge all members to visit this delightful exhibition before it closes on 29 June. . These initiatives remind us that it is important. that p-ace is promoted internationally, natIonally, m our local communities and also in our homes. We must create an atmosphere of seeking to resolve conflict through peace. We have seen the end of the Cold War but the nature of conflict has changed-there has been an increase in ethnic and religious conflict in some parts of the world. Our distance from these hot spots should not lull us into thinking Australia has nothing to contribute to world peace. Australia is a shining example of how people from different cultures, religious beliefs and backgrounds can live together in peace. I applaud the organisers and all who have participated in these efforts to draw attention to this important anniversary. Peace Run",126
243,Mr GIBSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Moreton) (8.04 p.m.)Today is a historic day not only because of the great speech that we have just heard from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the republic but also because of the receipt of the peace torch from the Sri Chinmoy OnenessHome Peace Run. I am delighted to join with my colleague the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) in welcoming this peace torch to Canberra and to the parliament. It is symbolic that my colleague the member for Adelaide was in attendance at the opening ceremony of the Australian leg of the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run in Adelaide on 19 May. I will be representing the government at the closing ceremony of the peace run in Brisbane on 23 June. I am indeed grateful to be able to join with my colleague, and with other colleagues who were in the forecourt of the Parliament this to morning, in welcoming this, and to be able to speak here in our national Parliament to place on record the bipartisan support of the goals and objectives of the Sri Chinmoy OnenessHome peace run. In fact, the Prime Minister is the national patron of the peace run. This event, in a sense, has brought all of us together, a timely reminder that the underlying aspirations which unite all of us in this parliament are far deeper and more abiding than the superficial differences that separate us. The peace run was founded by peace ambassador Sri Chinmoy, who will be visiting Canberra later this month to offer a peace concert here in the Great Hall on the exact 50th anniversary of the signing of the UN charter on 26 June. I hope that many of my colleagues from both sides of the House and froni the Senate will take advantage of this rare opportunity to hear one of the world's most remarkable peace lovers and peace servers. I am convinced that the cause of peace and the effectiveness of international organisations which are committed to peace, such as the United Nations, can only be achieved when we can dedicate ourselves with renewed commitment and vigour to the vision of oneness that is embodied in the UN charter. We are one mankind, occupying this one planet. The arrival of the peace run here today, the exhibition of the peace birds and Sri Chinmoy's impending visit to honour the 50th anniversary of the signing of this charter will hopefully serve to remind us that the search for peace is an ongoing struggle, a responsibility that falls on the shoulders of each and every member of humanity. I commend Sri Chinmoy and the Sri Chinmoy Peace Foundation for its imaginative and inspired efforts to kindle the flame of peace within us all. Australia Remembers",126
244,Mr DODD,ADJOURNMENT,"One of the most important events that I have been involved in this year is the 50th anniversary celebrations marking the end of the Second World War. Australia Remembers committees around the nation have been organising events to ensure all Australians appreciate the signifiquarter cance of such an important anniversary. Two committees in my electorate have been particularly active. Cooktown played a major role in World War II and, fittingly, the Cooktown committee of Australia Remembers has been putting in a considerable amount of effort to make this year special. Indeed, two former Australian Prime Ministers served at Cooktown-Edward Gough Whitlam and, briefly, John Gorton. I had great pleasure in being able to present Don Sinclair a $5,000 cheque for the Cooktown Australia Remembers committee. Don's work at the helm of the committee has been unstinting and committed. Jeff Brearley, with some help from Don Sinclair, has dug away to research and put together some historical notes for community interest and education and for publication in the local paper. Terry Dukes, the Cooktown airport manager, is on the committee. His assistance has been vital in organising the permanent memorial at the aerodrome. Graham Fookes, a retired commercial artist, has also put in a quite remarkable effort and painted a six-foot logo for the committee. All the committee members have put in a lot of work. Cooktown will see successful events to mark and remind us of the enormous impact of World War II because of people on the Australia Remembers committee. Cooktown will hold a full week of celebrations to mark the end of World War II, starting on 15 August. The culmination of the events will be the grand dance at the shire hall. People dressed in the clothes of the era and a 40sstyle dance band will make sure the dance rekindles a few memories and creates a few new ones. The committee also plans to erect a memorial at the Cooktown airport. Cooktown was a major airfield in the Coral Sea campaign. Local war history will be on display during the week at the Cooktown RSL. People might be surprised to learn of the significant role that Cooktown played during World War II. Not surprisingly, the Cooktown Australia Remembers committee received a of all funds of the Leichhardt Australia Remembers budget. The Port Douglas-Mossman Australia Remembers committee is also very active. Its membership consists of prominent residents who already spend a lot of time working for the community. People like Wally Gray, the president, and Jim Nuttal, the secretary of the committee, have made great contributions to commemorating an important part of Australian history. David Rex, awarded the British Empire Medal, has also been contributing enormously to the committee and has managed to convince local organisers that this year's show should carry the Australia Remembers theme. Bert Pollock, a World War II veteran, who has been nominated for Queensland's Premier Award because of his contribution to that state and to Australia, will open the show. One person, Jack Fischer, who is not actually a full member of the committee, has still managed to put in a great deal of time for the committee by designing all the displays for the Australia Remembers stall at the show. The committee has received $5,000 to help set up the many events planned. This committee will also ensure that Port Douglas and Mossman do not forget Australia Remembers with its 1940s theme ball and wartime history display. The 1995 Village Camivale also carried the Australia Remembers banner. All the people involved in Australia Remembers are committed individuals who are already contributing a great deal to their community and have volunteered their precious time to make sure this year's 50th anniversary events stand out in everybody's minds. I applaud their efforts. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 8.10 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Howard to present a bill for an Act to amend the Air Navigation Act 1920 to entrench the laws relating to the Sydney Airport Curfew and to ensure that changes to such laws occur only after public consultation and with agreement of both Houses of the Parliament. Mr Braithwaite to move That this House: (1) notes the continuing problem in the construction and building industry of subcontractors not being paid by contractors, resulting in bankruptcy, liquidations and loss of jobs; (2) maintains that the Commonwealth should set the example as a client to enter into contracts conditional upon the main contractor paying subcontractors before further payments or progress payments are made; (3) notes that State and Territory legislatures have the same opportunities, in drawing up contracts, to require a condition in those contracts that subcontractors be paid in full as a prerequisite to further progress payments; and (4) recommends to the Minister for Administrative Services that he (a) take the necessary action to protect subcontractors on all federal contracts and (b) entreat his State and Territory counterparts to (i) take similar action to protect subcontractors on all State and Terri. tory projects and (ii) enact legislation to protect subcontractors on private construction and building projects.

Does it not indicate that your charges industrial relations approaches are making home on our own domestic markets as the world's going to make it in Asia if this is indicative Prime Minister, as Hansard will confirm, in highlighting the inefficiency of the Australian opposite ought to be absolutely ashamed of that a little more notice of his own people, the on industry progress, on industry's needs for to be internationally competitive. It would have been better if the Prime Minister displayed a little more integrity in this process. commentators that day refused to pick it up, the media.

That is what he said.

Anyway, here it is, the Industry Commission in April last year-very comprehensive; this is a long line-I have got some more here and the lack of efficiency and reform in the Australian to the Prime Minister's claims and the nonsense Now listen to this, from the introduction With abundant grazing land and a favourable climate, international standards. However, efficient processing comparative advantage in livestock production. Although Australian meat is generally I wish the Prime Minister was listening-'this is largely because processors are able to buy of other countries. This inquiry has found that despite some recent operates at significantly higher cost than processing It has· also found that Australian meat exports have export markets. So let us put furphy No. 1 to rest. The Australian the world's most efficient, if not the most efficient, can be no suggestion that that is not so, when he at the moment-on returns some 50 or 60 per and continues to produce and continues to undergird of beef globally at the moment.

The people who represent beef industries, explain to their people that the Prime Minister gratuitously insulting remarks about the efficiency be exposed for what they are. I want to continue to read some of this in. what government members are responding to-with the second chamber in the House-IS months major change is necessary. The third heading report goes on to say, in part: But change has been painfully slow. To seize the significantly accelerate the changes taking place.

Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) My Department has retained the Consultancy services of MCKerlie Consulting Pty Ltd.

291,Mr WALKER,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes; S$98 million. Cooksey Report (Question No. 2339) Mr Abbott asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 11 May 1995: (1) Did the Cooksey Report on defence facilities (a) conclude that there was no compelling case in the present financial circumstances to outlay the high cost associated with moving the School of Artillery from North Head, Sydney, and that it should remain there in the short to medium term and (b) recommend that should the School of Artillery be relocated then Rockhampton was the preferred site. (2) Is· the establishment to be moved; if so, in view of the conclusions of the Cooksey Report, Why.  provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (l)(a)&(b) Yes, the 1987 Review of.Austral!as Defence Facilities (Cooksey Report) dId conSIder that, in the prevailing financial circumstanc-s, there was no compelling case to outlay the hIgh. cost associated with moving the School of ArtIllery from North Head. It also stated that, in the short to medium term, the school should remain at North Head but the review team would favour Rockhampton as a future long-term site for the school. (2) The School of Artillery is to relocate to Puckapunyal. Since the Cooksey Report was produced in 1987, there have b-en a number of significant changes in Defence which now make the relocation of the school a timely, efficient and costeffective proposal. The Cooksey Report identified that it was desirable for training establishments to be located in south eastern Australia, but in 1987 Puckapunyal was fully utilised. The implementation of the 1991 Force Structure Review initiatives, in particular the move of units to the north, has altered this situation. This proposal will prevent under-utilisation of facilities and the range at Puckapunyal resulting from the move of units to the north. Relocation to Puckapunyal will provide the School of Artillery with modem, functional training facilities at less cost than at Townsville or Rockhampton. The school will occupy Robertson Barracks at Puckapunyal which will be vacated by the 1st Armoured Regiment later this year when it moves to Darwin. This proposal will utilise existing facilities and will result in a significant saving, in the order of $20 million, in capital investment costs when compared with establishing the school in Townsville and even greater savings compared to the Rockhampton option. Any significant delay in refurbishing these facilities may result in degradation of the asset and additional funds being required later to return them to a usable state. The Cooksey Report also identified that access to suitable field-firing ranges for the use of largecalibre weapons (eg artillery) was the greatest problem for NSW - based units. The relocation will provide the School of Artillery with access to such a range at Puckapunyal. The School of Artillery will be located where there is existing Defence infrastructure that can readily provide support, unlike Rockhampton.
