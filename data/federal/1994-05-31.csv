2,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented? Mr TIM FlSCHER-I do, Mr Speaker;",11
3,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Please proceed. Mr TIM FlSCHER-This morning AAP put out a report headed 'I smoked dope too, says Fischer'. The AAP report-and I quote exactly from a doorstop this morning-says: ""If I go back into my past, yes I did smoke a cigarette, yes it was in 1968, yes I was legally-Lour E-G-A-L-L-Y-,-high on morphine at the time and yes it was in Asia . . . It was in the context of an answer in regard to World No Tobacco Day this day that I . made that comment. It was a cigarette; it was not dope. I have never smoked or inhaled pot or dope. I desire to correct the record at this time so that the truth might be known. In fairness, I finally add that just to hand is an AAP correcting report killing its first story. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1)1994-95 Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 May, on motion by Mr Willis: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr TIM FlSCHER (Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (12.32 p.m.)-It is a pleasure· to participate in this debate which deals with the budget and, indirectly, with the white paper, Working Nation, presented by the government. I note that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment,Education and Training and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), was not present in the House yesterday and is not present thus far today, although he may tum up later in the day. He has been hauled into the Northern Territory campaign to help· bail out the opposition Labor Party in the territory, as it desperately garners .votes for next Saturday'S election. I make the point ·in passing that he should be here during the sitting of the federal parliament. But he is carrying to the territory the directions of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the federal Labor Party in a way which is offensive to territorians who have the chance next Saturday of re-electing the Marshall Perron CLP government. I wish that territory administration well. It has done much to build our links with Asia. It has done much to provide real jobs in the territory to withstand the recession and point, the way to the future. ' The white paper and the budget will, in my view, have the tragic effect of squandering great nation's chance for a .sustainable recovery. That is the great tragedy of these documents. They represent a government which is taking decisions in its own narrow interests rather than looking to the mediumor long-term national interest. Both the white paper and the budget represent a typically big taxing, big spending Whitlar:nesque approach in the worse tradition of Labor. Taken together, they rely on forecasts which are beyond the wildest dreams of a deluded optimist. The government simply will not get its 4.5 per cent growth rate if it does not get the forecasted 14.5 per cent growth in business investment. The inside story about the budget is that Treasury itself simply does not believe the 14.5 per cent figure, which has already been placed in jeopardy by the events and surveys of last week It does not want to be associated with it. Indeed, in the budget papers, Treasury says: The central feature of the economic outlook is a substantial pickup in business investment. Forecasting business investment is, however, difficult since the timing of investment decisions is flexible and heavily influenced by changes in sentiment. While an increase in business investment in 1994-95 is certainly in prospect, the strength and timing of the pickup are less certain. There you have it, Mr Speaker. That is simply the Treasury saying that the 14.5 per cent business' investment figure-the crux onhe budget and the white paper ahd, in' essence; the recovery-is unreliable' and wildly optimistic. More recent surveys hilVe shown for the most recent quarter a plunge in thesupporting criteria associated with business investment. So without the 145 per cent growth in business investment the government will not get the real groWth that it aims for. If that happens, the deficit goes up even further; unemployment goes up on. its forecasts; interest rates' go up as both Bernie Fraser, the Governor' of the Reserve Bank, and the Prime Minister have warned, and the whole package falls apart like a pack ofcan;is. While I am talking about unemployment, I highlight to the House that under this Labor government the unemployment figures are becoming almost meaningless. I say' that because Labor's strategy revolves around getting people into training schemes or into the mature age allowance so they do not actually show up on the unemployment figures. It is dodging the problem; it is ing the issue; it is fiddling the books because it is totally embarrassed that in 11 years hard labour it has built an underclass in Australia of permanent unemployed in' a disgraceful way. This Prime Minister has betrayed Labor. He has betrayed traditional Labor and' the working class by creating this permanent underemployed class. Indeed, he has betrayed the nation .. Labor continues to reinvent schemesJor the unemployed, but what it cannot do is give them real jobs. Since Labor came to government it has introduced some 45 new labour market schemes over 11 years, and unemployment still is higher than 10 per cent as I speak. All have been accompanied by massive government hype and advertising; all were going to solve the problems of the unemployed, but the fact is that none of them have really delivered- I say they have not delivered, and I would be backed up by the 200,000 Australians who now, sadly, have been unemployed for two years or more. I would be backed up by the 350,000 people who have been unemployed for one year or more. I would be backed up by the 360,000 women who are unemployed. I would be backed up by the nearly one .million Australians overall who are unemployed.:' "" "","" For a moment I \Vould iike:\o op. .the .regional ,strat-gy coptained '. in - -. 'the government's white paper,; the, Wprking Nation document,and relate,H tot4e budget. It;simply confirms that th!s,KeatingLabor government has about as' much understanding ofr-gional Australia as a rabbit has' about a jet airliner. It can he-t it and it can see it, but it has no idea why it is there. ;The gOVerrullent kOows about as much, about what drives regional Australia as a rabbit knows about the theory of flight. Sadly, it has absolutely no idea. . '.' , . . .Befo-e the govelllmentgets stuck in-o' me for wanting to SPend money in regional Australia, may I-:-as the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) has also point:edout-nominate some .areas where the government . could save. masses of public money. The, white paper allocates $14.2 million for a communications strategy. We all skirtknow what that means: it meansgovemment propaganda specifically designed to prop up the Labor Party at the taxpayers' expense. The budget papers, more tellingly, reveal that public service running costs, estimated to be $11 billion, have been upwardly revised to a whopping $12 billion. The government has allocated $1.5 billion to the Aboriginal land acquisition fund, and I make no apology for standing here at the dispatch box saying that the coalition will oppose the Aboriginal land acquisition fund at the national level because it is not the real solution it is suggested it might be. It is a matter for the states. Yes, we want outcomes to health and education programs for our indigenous people who . have a right to be dissatisfied with their Circumstances in that regard, but that will .not. be resqlved' by a national Aboriginal land, acquisition' fund of half a billipn dollars, $1 bjllion or in fact $1.5 billion provided over a period of 10 years.. Let us h,ave a look at what the government should have been doing in regional Australia. The government's approach can only be described as miserable in every way, shape and form--'crumbs thrown to the poor by the emperor as he sweeps past regional Australia. The honouraQle, . member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) has reminded us that the actiop places like Bundaberg and Gladstone; it 10M 'way from Canberra a:nd the settings the bure.aucratS. An afuo.unt of $10 million next year for the whole of regional Australia is n6ta strategy; it is in more ways thanbne a 'tragedy . in terins of' the' attitude of this fedei-l Lal?or government. - t me remirid the HQ-se what $10 million w9uld buy in the infrastructure marketplace. It would buy Qne-quarter of the Friendship Bridge which, spans the Mekong River beback tween Thailand and Lao.s. This is a project an- barrel. that I support. It would buy about 10 kilometres of a four-lane highway stretching Seymour to Shepparton. It would' Kidman Way or the north-south link between Broken Hill and Mount Isa, which is of very great importance to the area. It could provide it. a road north of the Nappamerry Bridge which spans Coopers Creek. To the government's credit, the bridge has been built with some government funding, but it has failed to build a road on the northern side Of bridge, so there is a missing link. There is' a huge task, pf regional road construction alone - hich the government has walked away from by effectively halving federal road funding over two years, The honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) has spelt out the tragedy associated with the abolition of the, black spot program. That program was abolished last year by this government. The reduction in funding from $1.6 billion to around $800miHion has that funding for roads is falling away, with the exception of key sections of the Hume Highway, such as the' Yas- bypass, which nearing completion. I believe in acknowledggovernment ing progress when it is .actually being made. This is off a very narrow base.",11
4,Mr LLOYD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The Albury bypass. Mr TIM, FISCHER-The, Albury bypass is still the subject of fierce debate.Bureausome cratic endeavour is required to resolve route once and for all in favour of the internal route , . and bring : that . The Kelty report spe-ified that there should .be an expansion of the National Highway system to encompass the Pacific Highway, ring .roads a:round our cities and port link is in roads. Kelty talked about a dual highwayis a that is pretty ambitious-from Adelaide to of Cait:ns, improved linked roads from regional areas to major highways, fast' train connections ,from Melbourne to Brisbane; and I could go on. All the government has done wi-h regard to Kelty is give him a flick along ,'. his way and $10 million. In fact, with the white paper. and the budget, the Prime Minister jeopardised his much vaunted personal friendship with Kelty by - urning his on the famed Kelty report lock, stock I tum now to the trade area in the Working from Nation document and look at the financial seal the incentive schemes. ' Mr MCGauran-Kelty is not happy about . Mr TIM FISCHER-'-I agree with the honourable member for Gippsland that Kelty is very unhappy about the way the government dismissed his report on regional Austral- . is at the first opportunity it had to address it. In my view, the white paper provided the opportunity for the government to address the proliferation of export incentive programs. We have the Export Finance Insura:nce Corporation, the Asia-Pacific fellowship program, Austrade, the Australia and Asia program, the export access program, the international trade enhancement scheme, the innovative agricultural marketing scheme, the passenger motor vehicle export facilitation scheme, the TCF meant imports credit scheme. I could go on. Why the government has not rationalised is financial assistance escapes me. Has the thought of using the Commonwealth Development Bank to consolidate all aspects of financial assistance within one body or at least to tailor make these programs on a more coordinated basis? I concede that the EMDG scheme is now the subject of review. But the export market developthe ment scheme raises a number of questions. How does the government measure the effecproject forward. . ' "" , ' tiveness of the scheme? What mechanisms are in place that would lead the government to conclude that the scheme is critically important to our overall trade strategy? .. As the Australian National Audit Office recently determined, there are no measures in place, that would permit an, objective assessment of the effectiveness of the EMDG' scheme. The fact is that the majority of firms who export are doing it effectively without the assistance· of the EMDG scheme. The challenge for the government is to ensure that the scheme does not become part of a handout mentality whereby firms gear their operations to the receipt of EMDGgrants rather than using the scheme to boost their export strategies. On the issue of trade, the budget makes it dear that the current' account deficit will worsen. That, is nothing less than the failure of the government's trade policy. The whole point of the high interest rates of the late 1980s and early 1990s was to bring down the current account deficit by, amongst other things, strangling imports. The moment there is a recovery up go the imports again, or when we go to a softer period, as indicated by the balance of payment figures released yesterday,exports come down faster than imports. Labor has learnt nothing from its own mistakes. Whilst our exports are expanding in gross terms, close examination of the budget shows that the government expects exports to deteriorate in net terms. Despite the phenomenal growth rates of our regional trading partners, we are losing market share. Sure, in one sense our exports are going up, but that is not the point. We are losing market share in key nations such as Indonesia and Malaysia. In fact, we are being knocked off by many competing nations, not the least of which is New Zealand. New Zealand is providing competition in the airwith the operation of Air New Zealand, albeit 20 per cent owned by Qantas, providing very effective competition on some routes-,-but more particularly on the ground. With its dairy industry and fat lamb and other meat exports into Asia it is really taking the fight up to Australia and achieving great progress. We are doing our best in these limited tings and in the framework provided by this government, but we can do a whole lot better. We must set a framework wherein the whole approach of Canberra to our economic circumstances is far more pro-export. ,·Thewhitepaper and the budget fail region\.. al Australia because their· approach'is miserable and they simply lfavenounderstanding of ()r em,pathy with ryral andr-gion­ al Australia and the Jastr-:""emergence of a savage and severe drought which is' impacting very heavily, on farmerS-eyep in the dectorate of Calare.

""':"";' . As the Australian, people increasingly focus "" on the government's efforts, as detailed in the Working Nation document and the 1994 budget, they will carefully weigh up the rhetoric against the actual outcomes. The rhetoric sounds great but it means nothing; it is typical Keating. If I may paraphrase Shakespeare, to avoid using unparliamentary language, 'It is a tale told by Keating, full' of sound and fury, signifying nothing - Working Nation and the 1994 budget will be fairly assessed by the Australian people with anFnot F for fear but F for 'fail; one big F for fail. The budget has cast a deficit figure which, in more ways th-m one, leaves a lot to be desired. It is a deficit figure which .will be . impacted upon by the drought. It is a deficit figure cast artificially low by theprivatisation program of the government,countingaspects of that privatisation in arriving at the actual deficit figure. We have an $11.7 billion de'ficit figure which in real terms is closer to an $18 billion figure. That in tum will add to the interest rate difficulties, increasing the interest rates faced by farmers, families and small business operators--.,.that is, ifsmall business operators can persuade a bank to lendto them. Accordiog to the surveys,and notwithstanding the rhetoric of this government, the great difficulty they face on that score is continuing. Instead of an exciting, challenging, visionset- ary set of documents with this budget and with this Working Nation statement, we get more of the same from this federal Labor government. Worse still, we get the prospect that the recovery that may have been building is going to be jeopardised; We are again heading towards..a boom and.bust cycle.·The :ricb will continue to .get richer, and the wili-getpoQreJ'. ....

5,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Before I call the. next speaJ<er, I would like. to make one coml1)ent about a matter which was reflected in the speech given by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). lam finding that it is a feature· that is becoming more prevalent in. speeches made. in the parliament. The Leader of the Nation;ll Party, as, leader of a party, is given some degree of tolerance in this. regard. I point out to. members that remarks· must be addressed through the chair. 1 would like members to give some consideration to constantly referareas ring to 'you'. across the fable, because half time. I certainly have not said everything which people. - re suggesting may have come through the chair. "" Before I call. the honourable member for Bonython, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies. MrMARTYN EVANS (Bonython) (1253 poor p.m.)- Mr Speaker, those of us who have the honour to represent our fellow Australians in this, the national parliament, have a singular duty to ensure we are representatives of all the people and, that we collectively govern this country for future generations as well as - he for the present ,time: While our respective ideas on how. this should best be done might - was vary, we are each given a great opportunity to. share in guiding the growth of Australia and in handing our children a nation in better than we came to it. I would certainto take this opportunity to thank those for - hohave supported me over the years of . state and now federal. elections, and have given so generously of their time in the elections that 1I have contested during that . My predecessor. in Bonython was a very distinguished member (jf this plac,e for some that 17 years. I was privileged to work with Neal from the time in which he first won the seat back in 1977 and I have also worked closely with him over many of the years in which he represented the area. His role in the establishment of Medicare alone would ensure place in history as a compassionate and dedicated architect of a health care system which guarantees Australians health' care appropriate to their medicalcondition·and not their financial circumstances; While debate may continue at the margins about the relative share ofihe public and private sectors, almost everyone acknowledges Medicare as the most successful health system in the world. During his long ministerial career, Neal also served' this parliament in several other portfolio areas, including a very significant period all in trade in which he was able to bring his diplomaticshllls to bear on what must surely be one of the most important but frustrating of policy management, that is, internathe tional trade and the GATT round. It is very fitting that he should continue to serve his country in this context as the High Commis. sioner in London. Bonython, the electorate that we have both represented, is a rapidly growing area to the north of Adelaide. It contains a mix of new housing and older established areas which were first settled soon after the state of South Australia was founded. The industrial base varies. from the· substantial manufacturing plant of General Motors Holden to the high., tech start-up companies to be found inTechnology Park at the Levels, as well as· the Defence Science and Technology Organisation based around the· RAAF base at Edinburgh. Together the motor vehicle manufacturing and defence industries are the major employers in the region and their health is critical to that of the local regional economy. The General Motors plant at Eliiabeth, which is but a short distance from my own home, has never· seen better times; indeed, production is at record levels and demand remains very strong. A good mix of massive investment and capital equipment, including in excess of $150 million on a world class paint complex, combined with an investment"" in the people who work at the plant, have given our area a significant boost. The 'last decade has seen major changes to the motor vehicle industry. No longer is it an inefficient relic of a bygone age of nianufac:turing industry typified by lowcapitalinvestment and restrictive. work practices fostered by disinterested management and sheltered by government imposed tariff barriers. Slowly. the industry has been turned around to the point where it can compete on the world stage .. Major investment has been ploughed into technology and people are better trained and encouraged to take a pride in their work and allowed to participate in the manufaciuringprocess, rather than being part of the production line. The conservative policies of the 1950s and the 1960s left Australia with an economy based on outdated manufacturing technology and isolated from the dramatic changes that were occurring throughout the 'emerging economies of Asia. The artificial barriers of that day gave our industry, and those who managed and worked within it, a false sense of security which defied economic reality and ensured that we would not benefit as a nation from the growth in productivity which exposure to the real world has since brougllt about. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) recently joined with General Motots Holden in Melbourne in celebrating the production of·the two millionth· Holden engine. The plant at Elizabeth, which· is one of the major manufacturing plants and a.major employer within:the electorate, is also' enjoying significant levels of employment. Demand exceeds production and there is a waiting list for new vehicles. This has been brought about inaclimateof significant challenge for both management and the work force. Management has adapted to the needs of our times and an historical surge in Japanese production by greater investment in new capital equipment and in the people who operate that equipment.· This twin rejuvenation of capital·and management style has saved our traditional industrial base in the vehicle manufacturing industry from a slow but inexorable decline, something which would have been inevitable·but for the innovative and, at the time, courageous plan of former Senator John Button back in 1984. That plan set the industry on track for a more productive future with an outward looking philosophy and a capacity to take on the world and to compete. That they did, and the evidence of the success of that strategy in the long term is symbolised in Bonython by that massive new paint factory which I - m sure the Prime Minister will open shortly. However, we also live in an information age where access to information and scientific intellectual property is increasingly vital. Developed nations are in a state of transition from the smokestack industries of old to an information culture based on innovation and the manipulation of scientific knowledge . about ourselves and our world. This is an era where the production of physical goods will be secondary to the knowledge that produces them and runs in parallel with the shift to a stronger emphasis for service based industries including tourism, communications, education and health. . The next decade will see a remarkable shift in the very nature of our society and the way in which we accumulate wealth and enhance the productivity of our country. The world as we know· it will also change in ways which are quite fundamental to the very structure of our civilisation. However, these changes will not occur in a radical or dramatic fashion; they will be gradual as they are inexorable: They. "",ill""riot: be: applied ,uniformly asbetween nations {:)rj - indeed"", within nations"" most. certainly ,they will ,not' occur 6n a;just and equitable \baskasbetweenindividuals unless', we are particularly vigilant' and' pro'active'. .It is thus imperative' that technological change be set Jin a social justice context, which I wouldf;Hketodiscuss ,further,. Mr Speaker, since I, believe that it is one of the most significantissnes of our ,generation. My electorate contains some of the ,most important high, technology ,enterprises in"" South Australia and; indeed,in the nation. DSTOat Salisbury and Technology Park aUhe Levels are focal points Jar, the kinds of changes to our society about which I have spoken. They are at the cutting,ecJge of the new technologies, in the physical sense, in the equipment they develop and manufacture; Australia has enjoyed considerable success as a nation in 'develbping ; and using high technology; However; we 'have not enjoyed th- same succeSs ,in ensuring that these devices are brought to market and that it is Australia and' Australiaris who benefit from the innovation and the profitswhich flow from it. The recent science and technology budget statement presented' to this House a few weeks ago identifies the significant advances in spending on research, by· government and the commitment of the goverrtmenfto research,both for the immediate needs of industry and ona long-term basis through the universities and other 'cooperative research centres. However, whatisalsQ clear from that statement is the failure of industry in this country to so rapidly understand the benefits of research for long-term growth and the need to invest foroui' col1ectivefutiu'e through research and development. ',' The level of business investment in R&D as a percentage of our gross domestic product is still relatively low ,compared :to other OECD countries. However, it is encouraging to note that we have one of the highest growth rates in this category and, if'thistrend continues, we can expect to significantly improve our relative position in that league table: That would certainly be essential to our long-term viability, as, an economy. The taxation conand cessions of this government, designed as they were to encourage investment and 'research, havewcirkedwelI, bilt they have a cost to the public purse as well and it is essential that . industry also does its share in this regard. One further positiv,e note was the very high level of growth in external patent applications by Australians, 'one of the highest levels, of growth in that category :in the world. It is v-tlll that the spark of innovation which a patent represents is then translated into profitable,applications for the real world. this will be'ac-ieved by a combination of appropriate pqlicysettingsand acommitment by business to invest and have confidence in our future as an innovative natiOn. ' Our high standards of education and the relevimt infrastructure for this developrnent are all critical, as is, the information age transition of which I have spoken. We need to ensure'that the, system of incentives which goverrtment provides are relevant and appropriate.' Governments find it 'hard to pick winners in a technological race when we do not, even know all 6f the technologieal rules as yet Therefore, it is better to create an appropriate taxation regime along with microeconomic reform to allow the winners to pick themselves. Where we do provide assistance, we should ensure that it does not favour one type of investment, since the important industTies of the future may haye yetto be, established. . . . . This is particularly true of the states where many of these assistance packages are developed. The, computer software industry, for example, isa major growth area and onewith much more potentIal for Australia than that of the computer hardware on which those pr6grams run. However, it is relatively easy to obtain assistance for a new factory to, produce ' hardware but a, very difficult proposition to obtain assistance for a software house which may h,ave little in the way' of plant and equipment but require a massive investment in people. This is yet another example of how the information age requires a change in our normal mode of thinking about industry, investment and :incentives. The same can be said for the software which we will play on our new pay TV system when it is operational later this year. While to date all the public attention has been focused, on th- physical infrastructure 'which transmits and receives the pay TV.signlj.l, i- satellite, microwave or cable, the most critical issue in the long haul will be the control and ·development of programming. is, the programs which will determiqe the profitability and success of pay TV, not much the hardware, apd it is in the production and the worldwide distribution, of .that, gramming that the real money will be made. Far more of our attention should be focused on that area and' that part of the debate, although at the present time. I certainly stand the interest in the deliverymechanisms and who owns them because they are certainbe ly the topic of the day. . : Our telecommunications system is second to none. The changes which are occurring in that area are the same, in essence, - s have taken place in the motor. vehicle industry. Exposing telecommunications to, competition, as this government has done, will ensure that consumers benefit and that our technological base is kept at or near the leading edge. blending of telecommunications with media, information and entertainment will surely be part of our future. The issue is how that will be regulated and who will profit from it. These issues will revolve around programmonth ming once again. The initial technical details have yet to be resolved and the market will pick the winners, just as it did with video recorders-after all, who remembers the format any longer? The examination of broadband services by - e broadband expert services group, which is now under way and which will report at the end of the year, is very timely, and I certainly look f9rward to that report. ,Broadband service technology allows the delivery of a large number of voice; digital or television type signals simultaneously down the one cable or phone line to every home. In addition, these services can be interactive, allowing UJiprecedented user response such as the selection of a movie or the selection of a camera angle at a sporting event. The use of broadband services is bound to increase at an unpredictable rate and having a good understanding of the industry pl1ior to its full emergence is much better than having to react after the event: It is thiskind,·of forward be looking policy development· which"" will' be ·vital to the sound regulatory and commercial .environment as, we make the transition to a It more information based society. ' Those countries that benefit the most from so these changes will be those with the best education' standards, the best developed protelecommunications infrastructure and those with the most innovative management and work force. However, what of the down'side of this brave new world of which we have underheard so much? The information super highway will definitely be a' toll road. There will toll, booths every so often and one will certainly need to buy a car and put fuel in the tank, to continue the analogy toa rather extreme level. There will be those who cannot afford the means to access the technology and those who are not able to maintain their involvem-nt year after year. There will be those who are excluded by the very nature of the technological change we face and. those That who never become part of that information elite. This is, already evident with pay TV. The capital cost of a satellite dish and the decoder will not be insignificant, nor will the bills that come through the credit card every or so. Estimates are that by the end of the decade some 80 per cent of Australians will still rely on free to air television as their primary source of entertainment. It is for this beta reason that the government has set in place rules against siphoning or the exclusive use of certain majorevents, usually sporting, by pay TV, given their potentially superior buying power. These regulatory decisions are, not easy but they are just an example of the kind of issue we will have to face in the future. Crime, will also be part of the new technology.We will have our information super highwaymen. Whether it is the use of counterfeit decoders to obtain free use of a satellite signal or the fraudulent use of a telecommunications circuit or the manipulation of data to obtain funds or change records, the implications for our society are the same. Crime will take on new forms and have the>benefit. of much increasep anonymity. One can steal far more, from a bank with. a· computer than one ever can with a gun, and the average domestic consumer will ;be the loser of that in the end. The Secret Service in the United States alone estimates that :the total volume of telecom. munications fraud is ,about.$2.5 billion. Some industry sources have .put the figure as high as $9 billion. ; The other threat is to privacy. Computers can be the best way to disseminate informaprice tion and, indeed, it is the ease. with which individuals can communicate their ideas without the help of the mass media that is of the benefits of this technology. But until people know just how these systems will work and just what their limitations are, whole new range of crimes will be committed to do that. against people in institutions- Our laws will certainly need revision if we are to deal offences which can be committed without victim and the criminal. ever meeting and across national borders. The implications of the telecommunications revolution will be repeated even more so the biotechnological area, as. with genetic manipulation, presenting us with even more areas. serious moral and legislative dilemmas. The potential of a single company to patent life forms-and I would draw the attention of House to a company in the United, States which last year. was given a patent over forms of genetically manipulatyd cotton no matter how that manipulation 'took placewill have significant implications for all Some of these potential issues include access to new forms of plant and animal with much greater productivity or other desirable traits. Whereas we have always been free to breed a better wheat, for example, use of patents over the gene code will seriously restrict this on an international level deny those who are, not ,able to afford stock access to that technology. The same will be true of advances in medical technology involving genetic engineering. Those countries who are not in the race will· find themselves with nothing to trade. The' international community will need to take a very active role in the regulation of these issues they so quickly assume transnational proportions. The start·up costs of the new technology are high. But, just as the initial cost has prevented a small but significant group of Australians from gaining a telephone connection even now, the initial 'costs of gaining access to many ,new fOrms of information distribution. wilJ also. be high. The same will be true· for drugs and medical interventions which we have yet to even understand. The of exclusion will be even higher, though, for the individual who is not part of that system: Social isolation and exclusion one from wealth and intellectual property, which will be part of the information age, are a definite social cost which we should ensure is a limitedto the extent that we have the capacity Government cannot undertake to give every with person a high paying job, but we can and the must undertake, through such mechanisms as the white paper released a few weeks ago,· to ensure, that everyone has a fair opportunity. The same social justice considerations must in be part of the changes which are now taking place in the scientific and telecommunications The cost of exclusion goes well beyond those 'financial matters. Individuals can be the denied employment or insurance on the basis of a genetic assay that predicts they will be all susceptible to alcoholism or heart disease. These are social justice isslJes that go beyond finance and lifestyle considerations and go to of us. the very core of our existence as human our beings, that will confront us as legislators stock with moral dilemmas, the like of which we have not yet contemplated, in the context of a rapidly changing society in a transition to the an information based economy. Australia can and must be at the leading and edge of that and the ancient curse of 'May new you live in interesting times' could never ' have' been more apt. I look forward, to the prospect of being part of the process of change in our society. In cooperating with my parliamentary colleagues, I hope to be. a contributor to the process of resolving some of the issues on. which I have touched briefly since during the limited time available today. Honourable members-:-Hear, hear!",15
6,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I call the honourable member for Higgins.,20
7,Mr MELHAM,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The battlers' friend. MrCOSTELLO (Higgins-'-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (1.11 p.m.)-He will be battling shortly-very badly-let me tell the House. Amidst all of the self-admiration that is going on among members of the Labor Party backbench, they should bear in mind the utter' failure of their budget strategy. The bottom line of this budget is that the government is going totax more, spend more and, at the end of the day, owe more. It takes more from taxpayers, spends morethan it has and ends up leaving Australia with a bigger debt. It will owe more at a time when, according to the government, we are supposed to be entering a new golden age of growth unsurpassed since the 1960s. In the midst of this huge golden age of growth, what happens? The government is running up debt. It is putting Australians further behind the eight ball. It is putting the future of young Australians further into hock. This budget was a wasted opportunity. The government squibbed the hard decisionsabsolutely squibbed them-and it squandered an opportunity to really do something for Australia. The most damning indictment that came in relation to this budget recently was the. statement of Mr Don Mercer, the chief executive of the ANZ Banking Group. He said in the Weekend Australian: Failure to seize the opportunity of strong economic growth to cut the Budget deficit more rapidly is going to leave Australia with higher domestic and external debt than is necessary or desirable. Mr Mercer went on to say that the federal government's budgetary settings had put Australia 'back on the path to boom and bust'. When we woke up.the day .after the budget, just about every headline in Australia read, 'Gamble, gamble, gamble, gamble'. It was a gamble that this government took with the future of all of those who need a better go in Australia. All of those who have been cut out and left behind; the people of Australia who have had to suffer the mass Keating unemployment of the recession we had to have; those in the' widening. gap between the rich and .the poor; people in the development, as the noted social scientist Hugh Mackay says, of an underclass in Australiansociety---'all of those people who really deserved abetter opportunity and a better response from this government. . Let me make it clear: the reason why the government is building debt is not that it is winding back tax revenue. It is not winding back tax revenue at all. The' government is taking more' in the forthcom,ing year than it took in the l-t year. It has not broken faith with the electorate with the perfidy that was shown in last year's budget where, after being elected on a no new taxes policy, it introduced taxes across the board, but it has new tax increases still coming on stream. The tax on wine, which was 20 per cent and which went to 22 per cent in 1993, will go to 24 per cent on 1 July this year and then to 26 per cent on 1 July 1995. The price of leaded petrol increased by 3c per litre in August of 1993. In February 1994 it went up another 2c. In August of this year it will go up another 2c. This government cannot say it is not increasing taxes; it is. Its argument is that it is not in this year legislating tax increases. It is not in this year legislating tax increases because it legislated them last year. It would be like the government putting down a .tax program of increases over 'a whole decade and then saying, 'You have not increased taxes in any of the remaining nine years.' His a question of legislating down the future track so that the tax increases come on stream and then trying to pull a confidence trick over the Australian electorate and saying, 'We are not increasing taxes.' This government is increasing taxes. The total revenue that the government will be collecting is increasing by. 7.9 per cent. Tax revenue to the government will be higher as a percentage of the economy, of GOP, next year than it has this year. There is a 7.7 per cent increase in the take from sales tax, a 12.6 per cent increase in the take from petrol excise and a 130.7 per cent increase in the take from fringe benefits. Does anybody in Australia know how fringe benefits tax works with its complexity? Is there anybody on the other side of the House, or on this side of the House for that matter, who with complete confidence Jcan sit down and workout when. the taxappHesandwhen it does not? It must be one of the most complicated taxes invented. When people are in an argument with the Taxation Office, are they able in a complex situation to insist on their rights? course they' are not. They are in a situation where, in order to assert their rights, they have to g9 through the legal processor pay money; and so many people just pay up.· The government is extending the fringe benefits tax bit by bit, with more increased complexity and regulation, making it a burden. on the back of small business and using it as a cash milch cow to take revenue out of business and to increase the revenue take that it will be getting froni this budget. Make no mistake about it: this budget increases taxes and it increases the government's revenue take. Then what does the government do with that? Is it a question of the government taking people's taxes and trying to do something to alleviate its debt? Is it a question. of the government prudently trying to save the gold travel passes. resources of the Australian people? Of course it is not,. because the government then turns around and increases outlays as well. In real terms, allowing for inflation, that a 2.9 per cent increase in - nitlays in the forthcoming year excluding asset sales. Outlays are 20 per cent of the Australian economy, GOP. Five years ago it was 16.8 $14 per cent. There has been an increase in the amount of take bf GOP directed to outlays about three percentage points' over the last five years. That is where the deficit comes from-from the creep in take in percentage terms of the Commonwealth in relation to its outlays. Let nie make this point clear: it is Commonwealth's own purpose outlays. The Commonwealth cannot say that the states bear any responsibility in this. It is' the Commonwealth's own purpose outlays that have been increasing. Whilst the Commonwealth has been screwing down the states, winding them back and preaching· restraint to them, it has been wantonly increasing its own 'purpose outlays. One can see that from· Budget Paper No.1, page 6.24, chart 13, general governindustrial ment and purpose outlays. The Commonmenthas wealth's own purpose outlays increase in its take of GOP at the same time as the states' is decreasing. The difference is the wanton ever gap:-the wanton expenditure on the government's own purposes. while preaching restraint to the states.' Make no mistake about Of it: if this government were serious about taxpayers' money, it could engage in savings. The overseas travel budget for federal government ministers increased by abqut 32 per cent over two years. There was $400,000 in avoidable expenditure for the Lodge, and $261,000 on the . carport. We remember the attempt to get the Thai teak table. We remember the attempt to get the Gould prints. We remember the absolute French lemperyonic' extravagance of this Prime Minister in relation to his official palaces and his official settings. The governmenthas dished out $170 milIion in fees to outside consultants. Staff fraud in the Department of Social Security cost $1.7 million in 1993. There is also the matter of retired MPs' The government wants to spend $50 million on plans to change the national flag. It wants to spend $86 million unnecessarily in charis ging rent to the Australian National Audit Office for the benefit of the Australian Labor Party. There has been $65 million handed over to trade unions over the last decademillion last year. There is $23 million for the fitotit of the new building for the Departof ment of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Last year's budget forward estimates in relation to Public Service costs show that they were to be $1 billion less than this year's budget-just the running costs of the Public the Service. The government cannot manage. People cannot trust this government with money and people cannot trust this govern. mentwith money in relation to its own purpose outlays. It is very hairy chested and very' strong. when it comes to lecturing the states, but in relation to its own running costs of the Public Service we see these break-outs in expenditure. We see the break-outs in running costs and staff salaries and all of the relations proposals that the governintroduced. So, at the' end of the day, although.this government takes.more, it spends more and it owes more. The headline figure in relation to the deficit is $11.7 billion, but it is no such thing at all. That is after taking into account the asset sales of $2.4 billion and the repayment of state debt. Just allowing for those alone,the headline deficit figure would be about $15:9 billion; . . . This government sells off assets and treats it as revenue; as a negative' outlay. It is getting rid of a capital asset and effectively treats - t asrec-i'rent expenditure. It is this idea of' selling off the family silver to pay the champagne bills. The family silver can only be sold once,but the champagne bills .keep flowing in for this government and' its approach to the taxes of the people of Australia. If people want to get a much clearer idea of the bottom line, they should look at the Commonwealth's financing task. The Commonwealth has a financing task of $20.4 billion in the forthcoming year. At the end of the year, Commonwealth debt will hit $95 billion; four years ago it was $30 billion-a threefold increase. All of this is at a time when we are supposed to be in a golden age of recovery; As a result, public debt interest increases and the servicing cost of that debt becomes a dead weight around future budgets. In a time of economic recovery the government should be putting grain into the storehouse. It should be reducing d!!bt and saving up against th¢ next downturn, but this government lives as if there is no tomorrow. In a time of recovery it is still winding up debt. Since the beginning of. the recession three years. ago,. the Commonwealth has had a deficit of $38 billion and it has another $28 billion to go, even in relation t() its own so called deficit reduction strategy. This is a government living as if there is no tomorrow. It is winding debt up· at a time when the economy is supposed to be in recovery.. What is it going to do. when the economy turns down? No wonder Don Mercer is talking about wasted opportunity. No wonder the people of Australia are concerned about their tax rates- No wonder business is concerned about interest rates. No wonder Bernie Fraser is out there saying, 'We've got to get :more money going. to business, ' . and warning about the pOssibility of interest rates going up. Who is spending as .iHhere is no tomorrow? Who is making the call on the savings ,Of Australia? It is the government. . We had the FitzGerald report in relation to savings; 'What did Vince FitzGerald say? He said that Australia has to save more. Who has been the persistent dissaver? This government has,. Rather than le-ding byexample,·it is pulling Australia down by example. Nothing has characterised the Keating regime more than a drive into debt and a drive into foreign debt. Honourable members. are·going to hear more about this. They are, going to hear .an .awful. lot about the Keating government's drive. into debt. We had the FitzGerald report warning us: Our. foreign financiers are already building premiums into the terms on which they are prepared to finance us-and, like an overgeared corporation, we are becoming gradually .more exposed to financial or other external shocks. A high level of external indebtedness makes Australia more vulnerable to international financial' markets. But do not take my word for it. Listen to what the then Treasurer said in May 1987. Mr Latham-Read the figures; debt servicing is down.",20
8,Mr COSTELLO,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I know it embarrasses you, but listen to what he said. In May of 1987 Treasurer Keating said that we will: ... free ourselves and our young people from the dictates of international financial markets. We are clawing back Australia's financial independence. But to see this process through we cannot relax for a moment. To do so would risk slipping back down the slope of international indebtedness. He said that when Australia's net foreign debt was around $86 billion. It is now $172 billion. That was how in May of 1987 he. was going to .free Australia from the dictates of the international financial markets. He was going to claw back Australia's financial independence. What happened in the meantime? He doubled the exposure. He went in the reverse direction. No wonder we never hear the government talking about foreign debt now. No 'wonder it is, a subject that provokes interjections designed to try to drown out the facts. Of courSewecahnot hearanyth'ing about that now because nothing' has characterised the Keating regime more thana drive into debt. You are going to hear more about this. You are going to hear about the FitzG.erald report. Ymf are going to hear about the need for savings; You are going to hear about the need to take the' weight of debt and public debt interest servicing costs. You are going to hear about all of those problems that, you are trying to ignore, all of the problems that you are trying to take off the political agenda, of the problems that you have run out of answers to. You are going to hear about all of the problems that you have tried and failed to solve and which have defeated you. You are going to hear about them because they ate so important to Australia's future; Although this government is saying it will have a current account deficit of $16 billion this year and $18 billion next year, we do not concede for a moment that running up debt and current'account deficits is something that can be connived at, something that can be overlooked or something that can be taken off the political agenda because it is so important to Australia's future. You sedt in the budget figures. You see it in relation to this budget in public debt interest figures. You see it in relation to the investment climate. You see it in relation to our export performance. You see it in so many areas. After the government squibbed the tough decisions, after it squ'andered the opportunity to do much better, we have the situation where the government is punting on business investment, sweating and hoping that somehow the business sector will rescue it from its problems. This call to get the business sector going again is really a, call by a government that has not played its part to be rescued in relation to business investment. What is business facing at the moment? It is facing rising interest rates, confirmed by the Prime Minister yesterday. We have a Reserve Bank governor who is warning us about rising interest rates. We have had the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) wandering like a steer through the ch.in a shop of small business introducing new industrial relations laws which were going to set Australia up for a decade. How long did they last? They lasted eight .weeks. Would it not have been better if he had not introduced them, rather than introduce them and have to eat humble pie and back off within eight weeks? Would it not have been better to, have ail industrial relations regime which was small business friendly, employment friendly, growth friendly and investment friendly? The only thing he ever thought about was making it ACTU friendly. That is the way he got into all those laws which have embarrassed him so much and which have embarrassed Australia as well. This is a government which is ratcheting debt higher, a debt which will leave Australia more exposed and more fragile in the next downturn. This is a govef!lment which is not engaging the problems of Australia. This is a government which, .whatever it thought it could ,do, has tried' and failed, This is a government which has squibbed and squandered Australia's opportunity. This is a government which is punting on business investment figures; This is, a government whose budget is gambling with our future and the future of the Australian economy when it should have, been doing much, much better.",22
9,Mr CHYNOWETH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I take this opportunity to congratulate the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans). This is another success story for the Labor Party. I note, however, that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) did not even have the courtesy to congratulate the member on his first speech. But, of course, this is a person whom' Jeffrey Kennett called a dog. I have no idea what Jeffrey meant; who knows how Jeffrey is getting on at the moment. Those in the gallery probably noted that all the, members of the opposition were tucked in behind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. That was so that on television it looked as though there were a lot of people there. There were really only about eight people there, and then a couple of people",23
10,Mr FILING,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is highly disorderly for a member to address his remarks to the public gallery. I ask you to have the member address the House.",24
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Jenkins)There is no point of order. . . Mr CHYNOWETH-For the majority of affairs;In tIme that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition sI?oke there were about eight people behind hIm, - ll for the television camera. A couple came In at the end so they had to put up with only two or three minutes of the speech \ViII because they could not listen to all ont. That shows the sort of gobbledegook he was talking about The budget is a great budget. It is one that many people have congratulated us on. I have had four calls in my office from people who have had problems with the budget, who were actually querying various aspects of it. All the others were congratulatory calls. The Treasurassessment, er (Mr WiIIis) has done a great job, and congratulate him and all the members of the executive on putting together a budget that am sure will be an advantage to many people throughout Australia. . One aspect I - ould like to speak on today IS veterans affatrs. I have many veterans in my .electorate of Dunkley and they have receIved some excellent benefits. There is over $8.9 biIIion given to improving aged care support to veterans and war widows. There is $2.2 miIIion allocated in 1994-95 and this is extremely important as veteransargetting on in age. The majority of veterans are from the Second World War and by the year 2001; 65 per cent of those veterans will be over 75 years of age. It is· important that we look after those men and women who fought in that war for without their sacrifices we would not be here today and we would not be able to speak in· such a free and open way. I have always stood up for veterans,and I can assure the House that in this budget the government is also looking after them. In the - rea of aged care support, the budget has Improved care for widows and veterans with dementia. It has improved funding (Quorum formed) . ·fhequorum was called by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). He used to be a ,deputy whip. No wonder the opposition has hIm on the back bench. He has Interrupted everybody's lunch. I thank all honourable members for coming into hear my great speech. ., I will continue my speech on veterans this budget there has beentremendous assistance from access to special conta-ts through news-sheets. All these things WIll be sent to our veterans. I am quite certain that their conditions will· be improved. There be a $20.6 million assistance package for younger veterans. This is mainly for veterans . who fought in the Vietnam War. There will be the establishment of a national centre for war related post-traumatic stress disorder. This money ,:""iII be set aside for the management of SOCial, psychological and medical problems. There will be coordination of inpatient and out-patient support services for the treatment and rehabilitation of I !hese vet.erans. There will be significant Increases In resources to enable the expansion I of the role of the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service. I assure honourable members that the Vietnam veterans will be very thankful for that. I would like to move on to another area the Victorian grand prix. Today is a special day, World No Tobacco Day. I would like to connect that with what Jeffrey Kennett is doing in Victoria with tobacco advertising. Some people may not be aware of this special day. It has also been a week for confessing. The new shadow health minister, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) was confessing that she used to smoke.Sh- has now given it up. Imust do a bit of confessing myself. I had about three cigarettes behind the shelter sheds at Moorabbin tech when I was a kid. I a- afraid that I am in the age group to have mIssed out on all the marijuana and things like that I have not had any of that. I am a little too old. Everyone else has had a go, by the sound of it. I received a letter recently from the AMA. This letter said: We need your help to safeguard the health of for hostels. young Australians. . We do this for a number of reasons. There will be 10 million. deaths worldwide .every year between now and the Year 2010 from tobacco related diseases while in Australia every day some 250 children smoke their first cigarette to replace the 54 adults who die from their addiction.· . Tobacco kills one third of its consumers on average 21 years earlier than their non-smoking counterparts. There is no safe level of consumption. The association of tobacco and glamour sporting events is a powerful one for promoters of cigarette consumption.: A recent survey has shown that tobacco and alcohol brand names and logos can receive up to 30 per cent of viewing time during broadcasts of sports events despite tough restrictions. The study suggested that the .effects of incidental exposure could have almost the same impact on young viewers as direct advertising. Tobacco sponsorship allows blatant aavertising of tobacco products. That was a letter from the AMA asking us for assistance. I am about to give that assistance. The caucus environment, sport and tourism committee moved a motion which was unanimous to write to the AMA congratulating it on its stand and to take up its fight in this House. I hope that my contribution today will make some people give up smoking. I hope those who do smoke will break that very addictive habit. Some 18 billion people will watch the grand prix. That is a huge number of people. It will be broadcast to 102 countries. So a great number of people will be watching that event-a lot of them will be smokers but a lot of them will become first-time smokers because of the advertising from the grand prix. I think the French bought out the grand prix some years ago at a cost of $100 million to make it a cigarette-free event. That is a huge amount of money. That is how much the cigarette·companies put into it. According to the Victorian Anti-Cancer Council, the Australian Medical Association will not need to raise the $12 million required to keep the Australian Grand Prix from being sponsored by a tobacco company, as it stated some time ago in a press release. The event will probably be sponsored by an alcohol company-probably by one of our beer barons. One has to look only at the cars and at the hats and clothes the drivers wear to see the logos of the tobacco companies spread over them as they are being interviewed. They have Marlboro or Winfield logos stuck on their heads or around their necks somewhere that will· get on TV. I suggest a bit of lateral thinking. Some time ago I was watching a show on television concerning the Strehlow collection-an Aboriginal collection of paintings and. various artefacts. In this particular show the paintings on the wall of the home in Adelaide .were somehow blanked out. That stuck in my mind so I inquired into that matter. The way it was done was that the video was' taken and someone physically painted out those paintings. That cannot be done to the grand prix because it is a live broadcast. However, with new technology and computers, I think we could probably do it. I would like the government to sponsor a competition and give a prize of $5 million for someone to come up with a software program that will do this live; that will have the speed to do it as this broadcast goes out. The broadcast comes from the television station and would go through a computer. The computer would automatically blank out or tum into some sort of coloured pattern the advertising for the cigarette companies. This would stop the advertising to countries such as Australia and France that do not want it. However, those countries that allow advertising could send it out without the computer enhancement. I believe if a significant prize or incentive were given to a computer company to come up with this it could be done. We could do it in real time these days with themassive amount of power that some of these computers have. The computer would probably cost millions of dollars. However, that computer could be used by the CSIROor someone else· when this grand prix was not in operation. I am surprised and disappointed that the state government in Victoria under its Premier, Mr Jeffrey Kennett, has promoted and is about to promote tobacco advertising. It is disappointing that the shadow health minister should say that she would allow advertising to go ahead even though it is not part of the Liberal Party policy. The Liberal Party in Victoria said it was going to do a lot of things before the last election. As soon as it got in, it changed mind and things happened that it said would not happen. The shadow minister is saying, 'Tobacco advertising is okay. However, it not part of Liberal policy, so we will not ,allow it.' What would happen if it ever got into government? I can tell honourable memso-called bers what would happen. It would get a great grant from the Philip Morrises of this world, and within a short period advertising would be up and going again. I believe all cigarette advertising, overt or covert, should be banned immediatewithoutwork. ly. One of the reasons I speak so strongly about this matter is that my father died recentobjective ly. He died because he had emphysema, jobs, which came about through cigarette smoking. I have personal experience of it and I believe, as I said before, that thousands of people every year will die through this disease; this addiction that comes about through nicotine. Nicotine is a powerful drug. It is powerfully addictive and some say it is even more powthis erful than heroin. Therefore, I sympathise with those people who smoke. I urge them strongly to get off the habit. I urge the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) to find some way to stop this broadcast by cigarette companies, not over the grand prix in Victoria but also league in New South Wales, where Winfield is a big promoter.  Another budget, another wasted opportunity. It seems to be the theme song of this government. Of all the budgets which this government has presented to the parliament so far, I cannot recall one which tackled the fundasay: mental problems facing business, the comIt is munity and the country in general. In presentour ing their budgets, successive Treasurers have tried to convince us that this is the one. This is the budget thatwill in fact save Australia, is their normal theme. We all recall former Treasurer Keating's 1989 budget as the one which would 'bring people. home the bacon'. What a monumental failure that was. We finished the financial year an inflation rate of eight per cent, falling not manufacturing production and necord high interest rates. In the 1990 budget, the then its Treasurer assured us that economic policy waS working. It definitely worked. It plunged Australia into the worse recession in 60 years: is The 1991 budget promised to create 'a'sound climate for investor confidence in the coming recovery'. In the months that followed, that sound climate saw investment fall to an all time historic low. The 1992 budget saw the, government telling us that Australia was once again on the move. The unemployment figure certainly moved after that budget; it either moved to almost one million Australians ' What about last year's budget? Its primary was; to quote the Treasurer, 'Jobs, jobs.' In the last financial year we did not see any jobs. We saw a green paper, a white paper, a budget and lots of fudging on the issue, but no jobs. In selling that budget, - the Treasurer described the economy as being ,'like a jumbo jet rumbling down the runway and poised for take-off'. I have to say that is probably the longest flight in history. His budget is still sitting on the tarmac. The new Treasurer (Mr Willis) appears to be much more moderate in his language, but the grandiose claims are still the same as those of his predecessors. I will quote to the only House the Treasurer's budget address: rugby The budget that I present tonight will: maximise economic growth; reduce unemployment; promote social justice; and reduce the budget deficit, without increasing taxes. . The Treasurer said all that. He went on to a budget that seeks to consolidate and improve economic performance whilst ensuring that all Australians share in the benefits of that progress. These are very big statements, yet in reality they mean little. Indeed, they mean so little that they amount to nothing more than an attempt to defraud and mislead the Australian This budget is no different from all the rest. with It makes some big claims, but it cannot deliver because it does not tackle the key issues or problems facing this country. This budget does not tackle the issue confronting families and .the breakdown in our family nucleus. It tackles neither. the problem of structural unemployment created by rigid labour markets nor the problem facing small business or rural or regional Australia. It makes no effort to curb the burgeoning government bureaucracy. Because of this, the community will suffer from this government's failure. The people of Australia who cannot find jobs will have to pay higher taxes to fund the inefficient bureaucracy and will have to cope with higher mortgage repayments; When interest rates rise-and they will-they will have to suffer the results. While the government has failed the community in this budget, it has at the same time embarked upon a massive spending spree to implement the measures announced in the Working Nation statement The bill before the House appropriates funding for the 1994-95 financial year to a number of programs and other measures announced in the budget. In addition, it appropriates funding to Commonwealth departments for salaries and running costs. Thirty per cent of outlays worth $29.8 billion are appropriated by this bill. Total Commonwealth outlays for this financial year are up. An amount of $120.6 billion will be expended by the government in 1994-95, which is an increase of 5.3 per cent on the 1993-94 budget. A quick look at the budget documents shows that this increase is not unusual. Indeed, the rising cost of government seems to characterise this government. In 1984-85, for example, total government outlays were $64.7 billion. Successive yearly increases of between four and 10 per cent have seen expenditure leap to its present high level. This represents a 46.4 in 10 years. Increases in government expenditure in the next financial year are across the board. However, expenditure in some areas will grow at a much faster rate than others. For example, in housing and community amenities, expenditure is forecast to grow by a massive 20 per cent over the course of this financial year. Expenditure on labour market and employment programs will leap by 17.5 per cent, transport and communications by 13.4 per cent and industry assistance by 12.9 per cent. To some extent, this ballooning expenditure is the consequence of an inefficient bureaucracy, a wasteful government and wasteful government expenditure. However, a continually increasing number of public servants are also responsible for gobbling. up much of the taxpayers' money. The number of bureaucrats has increased from around 375,000 to 381,100. Given the government's new approach to assisting the unemployed and its-commitment to collecting more taxes, these figures will swell by at least another 4,000 in the next few months. It all leads one to rather cynically remark that in the last few years the government is the only business in this country that has taken on new labour. The rest of business has been shedding labour to pay for government taxes and charges. There is scope to cut government expenditure without compromising the role of government or cutting back on programs. The business community has cut back over the last four or five years without compromising its levels of service. If the business community can do it, there is no reason why government should not and could not do the same. The scope of some restraint is certainly there. Let me outline to the House some recent examples of wasteful expenditure which should be addressed. It costs the Department of Industry, Science and Technology around $70 to respond to each letter written by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook). Multiply that by· 15,000 letters and we are looking at a significant amount of money. The bureaucracy as a whole dished out $170 million in consultancy per cent increase fees in 1992-93. The Department of Social Security spent some $800,000 on staff conferences and workshops in locations such as Cairns and Magnetic Island. Another $50 million has been allocated to a program to change the Australian flag. Fraud in the Department of Employment, Education and Training is of major concern. Stamping down on this would yield significant savings. The use of government credit cards should be brought under control and fraud eliminated. In addition; there is considerable duplication between federal government departments arid between the federal and state governments. Housing, health and education,' for example, are three areas where such duplication exists. 1994-95. The House would be aware of the rather cumbersome process that sees similar funcaccount tionsperformed by over 10 departments .. The Commonwealth, for example; allocates the funds, sets the guidelines to determine how they will be spent, and then monitors how, where and. why the money· was spent. Each state' and territory, for its part, runs own health, school and public housing sys1993-94 tems within the Commonwealth guidelines. States and territories· put in bids. and make frequent reports justifying how they spend their money. I will illustrate the cost of this procedure. The federal department of education spends around $160 million a year monitoring programs of the state departments of educacontribute tion-that is $160 million without even $14.2 employing a teacher. Surely a better, more efficient system can be found; one which gives taxpayers better value for their money. With Commonwealth outlays' rising, the . critical question to be asked is how it will be paid for.' In pondering the answer to that question, we must also consider the massive $6.5 billion which the Working Nation statefigure ment will eventually cost. This is where government's claims become even more transfer outrageous. Government members tell us that increased expenditure will be funded by economic growth and that the improved growth will then be reflected in higher tax is a cop-out. When this government cannot find the money and wants to duck the hard decisi()ns, it trots out its old stand-by: 'It be funded by economic growth.' We have heard it time and again. In looking at the revenue estimates,. appears that economic growth will work budgetary miracles. It will fund expenditure generated by Working Nation. It will fund some of the sops given to interest groups. It will reduce the size deficit. Revenue from taxation is forecast to rise by 7.4 per cent, from $94 billion to $103 billion. Income tax froln individuals will account for some 49:9 per cent of total revenue collected and will increase from $50 billion last year to an estimated $54 billion in Company tax and fringe benefits tax will for a further 15.7 per cent of tax collected. Sixty-seven biIIion dollars will be collected in taxes on business in 1993-94, rising by a whopping eight per cent to $75 billion in the next financial year. Fringe benefits tax in particular will deliver a masits sive windfall to this government. Over the financial year, $1.4 biIIion is expected to be colIected. This rises by 126 percent for funding to $3.2 biIIion in 1994-95. Sales tax will generate 10.2 per cent of total revenue, rising from $10.3 biIIion to $11.5 billion in 1994-95. Excise accounts for 11.3 per cent and customs duty for three per cent the of total revenue. Collectively, they will $15.4 billion to revenue, up from biIIion in the previous year. Interest and dividends make up the remaining 5.1 per cent. In spite of the increased income, the government is still faced with a huge budget all deficit. The deficit is listed in the budget documents as coming in at $11.7 biIIion. But, like many other aspects of the budget, this is a fl.lrphy. If we take out asset sales, the payments from the Reserve Bank and the of state deficit payments, the budget deficit is closer to $18 billion. If we add this to the $96 billion which the government already owes, we are looking at some pretty horrific debt levels. Interest on public debt receipts. This will rise to $7.5 billion in 1994-95 alone. Economic growth is forecast to increase by 4.5 percent over the course of this financial will year. This is a rather high figure which has been viewed with scepticism by business and ' economic commentators alike. At this point, ""it I would like to quote from some of those reports. In regard to this matter, Alan Wood new levels of of the Australian wrote: The fundamental issue is whether we can sustain this growth performance over the medium term,as of the budget the Budget assumes. . . A careful reading of Treasury's lengthy discussionofthis issue in Statemel)t Two of the Budget papers suggi!sts .that the odds are we won 'f. Too many things have to go the.Government's way and its own policy performance in key areas is not good enough to guarantee they will. For example, we have to be prepared to accept that the business cycle has been abolished and growth can run on. at 4 to 4.5 per. cent a year without inOation or balance-of-payments problems. An article in the Australian Financial Review stated: By choosing to do nothing, the Government has produced a Budget based on faith, hope arid charity. Faith that the ambitious forecasts of stronger economic growth, surging business investment and continued low inflation on which its deficit reduction strategy relies so heavily will be fulfilled. . The article went on to state: And charity froin the financial markets and business, who must take the Government's growth forecasts and deficit projections on trust and accept the validity of an only marginal improved deficit reduction path. The article weilt on: They must also ignore the fact that it is using bulk of its Budget ""growth dividend"", the higher revenues and lower outlays flowing from a stronger economy, to fund new spending rather than cutting the deficit faster. The strategy is economically risky, the more so because it may undermine the very business investment growth which it is predicated. It continues: The central risk in the Budget strategy is that it relies on achieving an era of consistent high growth and low inflation not seen since the 1960s, rather than making structural changes in the Budget, to achieve better outcomes. The quotes go on and on. An article from the Canberra Times reads: Don't plan your future on the basis of the Budget ""projections"" for the years thereafter. It's not a bad thing for a Government to set itself goals but, given the recent record of failed budget forecasts even for the year ahead, the forward projections should be seen for what they are: expressions of hope based on guesstimates, good intentions and an assessment of what the electorate wants to hear. Even if the figure comes in at 4 11z per cent, which is doubtful, it is still a far cry from the rates of growth in many of the dynamic Asian countries. Countries such as Singapore, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand have had growth figures of between eight and 10 per cent. The governmenLis - ontinually peddling the line that our.growth rate is at the top end of the OBCD countries. The government has failed to realise that we are competing against the Asian countries· whose markets· are growing faster than ours. . A 45 per cent growth rate i·sirrelevarit, given that we need to grow at least 4 3/4 per cent. every year over the balance of the decade to get unemployment down to five per cent by the year 2000. But there is some doubt about our ever reaching this growth level. Let us look at some of the factors underlying the government's gamble on growth in this budget strategy. Perhaps the most ambitious of these is the business investment target. According to the budget papers, business investment is expected to increase by a massive 14.5 per cent. In contemplating this mammoth targeuhat has been. set, the House should consider that business investment is currently hovering around a 20-year low. .It increased by one per the cent in this financial year and 0.8 per cent in the previous financial year. Business investment actually fell 13.2 per cent in 1991-92. This forecast has been treated with extreme scepticism by the business community. I wish to quote from some reports on business investment. An article in the Financial Review reads: The Government is banking on a dramatic surge in business investment to underpin 1994-95 economic growth of 4.5 per cent at the same time: as maintaining recent gains in inflation and the current account. . But the most striking and contentious prediction is that the long-awaited surge in business investment-the missing element of the recovery sO farwill finally occur. Other organisations, such as the Chamber of Commerce, and individuals have commented on this matter- The Chairman of the Institute of Company Directors tax policy committee, Mr Simon Marks-Isaacs, expressed grave concern about the budget's predictions for growth in business investment. He said: It's going to be very hard to fund the level of private sector investment the Government· has projected over the next year. Gary Brack, the Executive Director of the Australian Employers Federation, expressed concerns about investment projections in the budget. There are a number of very good reasons for all of us to .be very sceptical. Capacity utilisation is still hovering around the high 70 per cent level. Until businesses use up their excess capacity they will not invest in new plant and equipment which will enable them to increase output. This situation will be exacerbated by very sluggish consumer demand. That demand is expected to remain low and is witnessed by the forecast of only a 0.25 per cent rise in business Business will' also be discouraged from undertaking additional investment by the threat of increased interest rates. To this end, I noted with interest on the weekend the comments of the Governor of the Reserve Bank who suggested that interest rates would rise by the end of the year. His warning that borrowers should factor the extra costs into their borrowings will weigh heavily on the minds of business owners currently contemplating new investment. The government's decision to discontinue the investment allowance will do nothing to encourage investment either. Businesses may also be discouraged from expanding their operations and employing additional staff as a result of the current industrial relations laws. The budget figures are phoney. They do not cover the real problem of investment in this country. They ignore the fact that there was a five per cent reduction in business investment in the March quarter and that business expects investment to fall by 7.2 per cent in 1994,..95. Government borrowings and the budget deficit will skyrocket, the current account deficit will increase and, without doubt, interest rates will rise. Australia simply cannot afford that risk. The ramifications of those things happening in this budget are very grave.",24
12,Mr LES SCOTT,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I congratulate the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) on his first speech in this place earlier today. It certainly gives me great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No.1) and to support the 1994-95 budget. There can be little doubt that the signs of economic recovery are well and truly evident today, despite the best efforts of some members opposite to deny that fact. The primary purpose of this budget is jobs: jobs for the long-term unemployed; jobs for disadvantaged people, jobs ,for youth-in short, jobs for the people who have been most seriously affected by the recession. Through the twin strategies of the Working Nation document and the budget, the government will effect' real reform in the areas of labour market assistance and job creation and at the stocks, same time pursue responsible economic growth. Over the last 10 years, the government has reformed the way the economy works, turning it into a more efficient and competitive economy enabling Australia to make its way in the world. Now we are faced with a period of stable growth and low inflation-the goal of Australian governments for the last' 30 years. We face a bright future of prosgerity in this nation. However, the task before the government now is to ensure that the recovery will benefit everyone, including the most disadvantaged job seekers in our society. The 1994-95 budget seeks to consolidate and improve our economic performance whilst ensuring that all Australians share in the benefits of that. progress. This budget· is unique as it represents a new benchmark in budget reporting and government accountability. But, most of all, this budget is unique because it operates in conjunction with the Working Nation white paper on employment and growth. This scheme is without doubt one of the most ambitious, comprehensive and well thought out plans to reduce unemployment that this nation has ever seen. The strategies outlined in Working Nation will help the unemployed take their place in contemporary Australian society with dignity and independence. In my electorate of Oxley we have areas of significantly high 'unemployment, but we also have a number of competent and vigorous development groups and community organisations that enjoy good relations with local industry. I have devoted a great deal of time to finding ways of promoting employment growth in my electorate and nationally as well, as is the case with my colleagues on this side of the House. In May last year, I established a local employment advisory group to assist in ways which could help the government's employstated ment task force-'-jointlychaired by my ly colleagues the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) and the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford)-to help the unemployed. The members of my local ment levels. advisory group met with local employers, training providers, officers of the Department of Employment, Education and Training and members of the trade union movement to gauge the effectiveness of current government employment policies in my region. The No. 1 priority of this government remains assisting those unemployed back into the work force. Along with my colleagues this side of the House, I have a very strong commitment to that initiative. My.electorateresulting with its well-established training network, including the Regional Development Corporaallow tion, three skillshare programs, group training schemes and private trainers-is well placed to pick up on the initiatives outlined budget and in the Working Nation statement. I will certainly be encouraging the pick-up those initiatives as much as I can. I call on all Australians to look at positive things in this budget. When we look at the budget we ought to look at the whole budget, the whole picture. The problem is that those opposite look at its bits and pieces home in on negatives instead of looking at big picture, which is absolutely important. They know that but they will not admit it, and that is nothing unusual. I am pleased to be able to say. that the period of jobless growth that marked the first year and three-quarters of the recovery is now behind us. More than 230,000 extra jobs have been created since April last year and the unemployment rate has fallen from 11 per cent to 10.3 per cent and will go lower with the plans outlined in the budget and Working Nation. Real GDP is forecast to grow by 4.5 per cent and another quarter of a million are expected to be created, resulting in unemployment rate of 9.5 per cent or thereissue. abouts by the middle of next year. It is true that the latest business investment figures did not show the immediate increase, but the government's forecast of 14.5 per cent growth is not overly optimistic, contrary to what was by the opposition last week. Particularwith the added incentive of favourable tax regimes for business over coming years, the benefits of increased profit margins and productivity will show up in higher investAmong these added incentives, the budget includes the provision of accelerated depreciation allowances, the development allowance for large projects, the general investment allowance, a 150 per cent write-off for research and clevelopment expenditure, and the reduction of company tax to an internationally competitive rate of 33 per cent. All these on incentives will reduce the government's tax revenue by nearly $3 billion for 1994-95, in a substantial benefit for business. This further reduction in the tax rate will business to expand and take on more workers, as will the generous incentives offered· under the employment and training in the initiatives in Working Nation. While labour market programs play an of important role in assisting the unemployed,to get back to work, it will only be through the 'private sector investment that sustained employment growth of the level required to substantially reduce the unemployment rate will occur. The reduction of the company tax and rate to 33 per cent, along with the developthe ment allowance and a package to encourage export development by small and medium sized firms will provide further incentives for business to invest and will provide further job opportunities. With inflation at its lowest level for 30 years and interest rates at their lowest level for 20 years, these measures will be of great assistance to business. I encourage business to take full advantage of them and to give the people who desperately need jobs a chance of employment. As I said before, the most important of the government's"" aims is to reduce uneIT)ployjobs ment. Members need not be reminded of the an urgency with which we must address this I am pleased and proud to say that Working Nation has confinned our faith in the determination of this government to devote. all its effort to getting Australians back to work. As a nation, we have to ptovide real hope to the unemployed; and Working Nation does that. In refonning the labour market assistance programs it will focus on an area where problems have been perceived in the past and will make the delivery of labour market assistance much more effective and more relevant. Indeed, the refonns of labour market assistance in Working Nation could justifiably be called a revolution in training methods. One example of this brave new world was exhibited in my electorate last week. Last Tuesday morning the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) was good enough to include a visit to Ipswich in his busy schedule. He announced funding for at) innovative new project in ""Ipswich. He announced that the Ipswich Regional Deve1opment Corporation, the IRDC, would receive $2l3,300 towards the establishment of a pilot project which is sure to provide a boost to community efforts to improve local job opportunities throughout the region. This funding will support an innovative project, developed by the IRDC and called a transition centre. For the benefit of honourable members who may be unfamiliar with the concept of a transition centre, I will just enlighten them little. The aim of the transition centre is to provide long-term employment by creating new industries. The aims of the concept are to identify potentially commercially viable products for process development as import replacements; identify finns willing to produce and market proven products; undertake product and process development work using teams of long-term unemployed; and, finally, to transfer proven, successful products to industry, providing full-time employment for. the former long-term unemployed. So I certainly welcome the minister's visit and his announcement of this initiative. It is this emphasis on long-term planning and creating new opportunities that distinguishes the. transition centre from former labour market programs which, despite the undoubted best intentions and efforts ofthose running them, often focused on short-tenn employment goals. Unlike these schemes, the transition centre aims to create·sustainable employment for the long-tenn unemployed in the Ipswich region by establishing industries that will focus on import replacement. Fqllowing the successful completion of the pilot project, it is estimated that a fully operational centre. will assist up to 200 locill long-term unemployed people every year. : """" The exciting aspect of this project is how it will integrate the entire local community. With private sector support and patronage, local employment opportunities"" and markets can be identified and explored as potential income-generating options for the region. The centre will provide a facility to develop and manufacture goods and provide training and work experience for the long-tenn unemployed. The goods and services produced at the centre will be aimed at replacing imports, rather than competing with Australian producers. The significance of this project cannot be overstated. It has huge potential and will hopefully represent a change in Ipswich's place in the natiqilal scheme of things. The region will be well placed to be at the leading edge of the employment and training initiatives outlined in the white paper. If this a project proves to be successful, as I am sure it will, the concept will be transferred to other areas around Australia, .radically transfonning the way employment measures are implemented. Import replacement on a sustainable basis will create much needed new jobs, because many products fonnerly manufactured in Australia have been replaced by imports, with the strongest period of this trend being in the 1970s and 1980s. In addition to the transition centre funding, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training also announced that the project will receive an additional $164,000 under the jobskills program to provide training and work experience support to help thelong-tenn unemployed make the transition into the work force. I would like to"" continue in this vein, concentrating on the employment and training initiatives in Working Nation which will be funded by the 1994-95 budget. The job compact, for example, will guarantee long-tenri unemployed people training or employment or both. Fundamentally, it will provide a job to those who have been out of work for 18 months or more. The white paper also outlines the government's plans to identify those at risk of becoming chronically unemployed and to give them prompt assistance. Individual case management of these people, and those who have been out of work for between 12 and 18 months, will help them overcome barriers' and be given access to labour market programs that will provide t-em with vocationally relevant, transportable skills. As opposed to leaving people out in the cold on their own in the labour market, the job compact will directly assist nearly half a million Australians through individual' case management. Under the job compact, of course, people who have been on an unemployment allowance for 18 months or more will be assisted in a whole range of areas such as individual case management, training and support to ensure they are job ready, a job for six to 12 months, primarily in the private sector, and, for eligible people, a training wage to make them more attractive to employers and to ensure that the job is combined with training, leading to recognised and transferable skills. New work opportunities will encourage local proposals for employment generation, especially in regions where employment opportunities are limited. Intensive job search assistance and referral to suitable vacancies at training. the end of the job compact placement are also included. In addition to this form of assistance, the government will help the unemployed by making changes to the way labour market assistance isdelivered-ahdthat is an important area-as' well in assisting our unemployed. There will be a better tailoring of the assistance provided to the needs of each individual job seeker. There .will be a competitive market in the field· of labour market assistance, with public and private sector agencies competing to provide labour market assistance with other services. Anew body will be established separate from the CES to be known as the Employment Service Regulatory Agency to promote the development of community and private sector case managers and to ensure fair competition between the CES and the other agencies. The CES will be strengthened so that it is more responsive and effective in a strengthening labour-market and so that it can play a key role in the delivery of the job compact and the youth training initiatives. There will be greater responsiveness to the needs of local employers and closer integration into regional development plans. The Department of Employment, Education and Training will develop direct links with regional organisations totailQr programs to the needs of regional areas. Young people are the future of this nation. The current levels of youth unemployment are far too high. As I am sure honourable members all know, two of the major reasons for this is their lack of experience and qualifications and the relatively high costs to employers in training young workers. The white paper· will address these problems with the innovative youth training initiatives. Under this scheme, young people will receive intensive case management to assist them on their way. The number of entry level training places will be increased by 50,000 by 199596, - with a long-term aim of this rising to 65,000 thereafter. Young people will also receive intensive job search assistance and new income support arrangements to encourage. young people to stay in education and With the greater numbers of married women in the work force and the greater proportion of part-time work today, several changes to the social security system will be made in the proposals contained in the white paper. At the moment married' couples are treated as a single income unit under social security provisions. This has created disincentives to work because when one person earns an income any income earned by the other partner is largely offset by reductions in social security payments. I welcome those changes in the white paper and the budget, particularly in relation to .the parenting allowance. I think that will be of great assistance to families;. particularly in this the International Year of the Family. It iscertainly fair to say that the Working Nation white paper on employment and growth is indeed the most original, innovative and comprehensive document this country has seen. It will attack the problem of unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, on a very wide Jront covering various sectors of the economy and policy. It aims to address the most.crucial issue facing not only Australia but most of the developed world-the issue of unemployment. To do this is to ensure a brighter future for the disadvantaged in our society and to encourage harmony and prosperity for the greater. proportion ()f Australians. It provides answers to the questions this nation is asking itself. But, more importantly, it provides a genuine sense of hope and encouragement.",30
13,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"'-Order! Before I call the honourable member for Mackellar, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House' to extend her the usual courtesies.",34
14,Mrs BISHOP,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mackellar) (2.23 p.m.)Thank you, Mr Speaker. After 12' years of Labor government, why are we falling further and further behind the rest of the developed world? Whydo our workers have to work harder and harder for smaller and smaller reward? Why do our householders find it continuously more and more difficult to make ends meet? Why is our crime rate reaching extraordinary proportions? Why are we becoming tenants in our own country? There are hundreds of these questions which are now concerning the majority of individuals that make up this great, or formerly great, country' of ours. Ido not believe that the Labor Party has set out to destroy our nation; nor do I believe that the current Labor Party is made up of people who are of below average intelligence. I actually believe that they genuinely wish for a better lifestyle for the future of this nation. But I also know that under their philosophy this cannot be done. There are only two basic philosophies on which political principles can be based: the philosophy of individualism where every - individual is entitled to reach their maximum potential, where every indiVidual matters; and collectivism where government is for groups and where the,individual can be sacrificed to ,the group. ,It is the totalfailureof collectivism and'the growing success of individualism: that determines the success Qrotherwise of a country's destiny; Every remedy employed by the Labor collectivist government is based on two assumptions: first, that the Australian people will . accept a further restriction on their liberties in order that negative trends might be averted; and, second, that every solution requires an increase .in, the centralisation of power and more control by government. In our economy, for example, every attempt at a solution has required more power and control by bureaucracy or government at the expense of the individual. The continuous rise in tax of every sort imaginable, government plans and controls restrict individual decision making. All result in the inability of small, new enterprises to establish themselves. Yet we know that it is only through these enterprises, through these new employers willing to risk their time and their money, that future productive employment is possible. Unfortunately, collective interventionism, even with the greatest of goodwill, cannot solve this problem because it is the problem. Solutions lie in a' philosophy structured around the individual, a theory for the individual and not enforcing the individual to adopt to a collective theory: With the best will possible, I invite the Prime Minister'(Mr Keating) and the government to look at the results of how these philosophies affect various countries and how their living standards are ·affected. In fact, I would implore the Prime Minister, 'Learn from these collectivist mistakes because you simply cannot be allowed to make them all yourself. As an honest Australian, which I believe you are, if you c(j,nnot carry. out all the nation demands of you, then resign.' Implicit in a collectivist government is the idea that the government must plan our future as we are either too dumb or too irresponsible to plan it for ourselves. In an individualistic . economy, mediocrity bankrupts itself. Under a: collectivist government, mediocrity bankrupts' the whole community and, under this collectivist system; workers get. poorer as the dosage ,is increased. What does all this mean? Itmeails that the government is now totally lost and is grasping at,the discredited spending, our way out of trouble' theories'of Keynes. OUT, .Prime Minister has now decided to outspend Goldberg, Bond, ConnellandSkase altogether. Mr Keating will deliberately run a multibillion, deficit, the largest planned . deficit our history. The factis, if the Keynes theories worked at all, even partially, our 'deficit spending would be enough not only. to employ every man, woman and child in Australia but also to meet our. international responsibilities. But the government, bound by itscollectivist. philosophy, increasingly interferes with business through more demands, rules. and regulations affecting every aspect of production and the market. And all this is regarded as recovery. As long as we continue to run a huge current account deficit, we will have to pay for it by further foreign borrowil)gs or foreign equity-that is, we will 'be forced to accept increased foreign control of our business and our country. The living standard of our workers will continue to fall. Yes, the .lower costs achieved by a lower standard of Iiv:ing allow us to reconstruct some industries buton a lower standard. As we celebrate a recovery, we continue to fall further behind the rest of the developed world. We can learn a good lesson from the comparisons that are available to us. Let us have a look at those comparisons between Australia, New' Zealand and the United Kingdom. The OECD indicators of living standards-namely, GDP per capita and private consumption per capita-are used to assess Australia's performance relative to that of New Zealand and the United Kingdom; While New Zealand's positiofl' in the top GDP per capita countries improved between the early 1970s and the early 1990s and Britain's remained unchanged, Australia's position fell by five places, from 12th to 17th. The average increase in, OECD countries. in GDP per capita in this same period was 505 per cent. Britain and ,New Zealand both exceeded this, average by scoring an increase of 515 per cent and 615 per cent respectively. Australi!l, on the other hand, managed only 377 per cent. While Australia had a substantially higher living standard in the late 1960s relative to theUKand'New Zea:land, this comparative advantage has all but disappeared: In 1972 New Zealand's GOP per capita was half that of Ausfralia 's;in: 1990 it was three-quarters. in Similarly, Britain's GDP per capita was' 76 per cent'of that of Australia, but in 1990 it increased to 99 per cent. , Au-tralia 'has scored even worse using the consumption .per capita as an indicator of living standards. The OECD average increase in consumption per-apita, again between 1972 and 1990, was 390 per cent. Britain and New Zealand both exceeded the average, achieving increases of 437 percent and 740 per cent respectively. Australia, on the other hand, achieved a below average growth of 342 per cent. Furthermore,in 1972 New Zealand's consumption per capita was 49 per cent of that of Australia, while in 1990 the percentage increased to 90 per cent. In 1972 Britain's consumption per capita was 82 per cent of that of Australia; in 1990 Britain surpassed Australia with a 106 per cent increase. The Australian people, very simply, deserve better. . Collectivism is a. victory for dogma over sound reasoning and the resulting social planning is a continuous disturbance of business. Thus the essence of collectivism endows a selected group with rights superior to the rights of the individual. Ownership remains private, but the state regulates. This means that the private owners are still held responsible for economic difficulties caused by government regulations. We can 110 longer' simply apply reforms. It is not possible to reforIll that which is intrinsically wrong. Individualism is about freedom-freedom to achieve, but always, with respect for other individuals, for their intrinsic worth, irrespectiveof status. What matters is that all reach their maximum potential. The philosophy of individualism and the principles. of free enterprise offer us a different way-a way back to prosperity. The principles of free enterprise are as immutable as the laws of gravity. First, nothing in our material world can come from nowhere, nor can it be provided free. Second, everything produced is produced by the people and everything that government gives to the people it first must take from the people. Third, the only valuable money that government has to spend· is that taxed or borrowed out of people's earnings andsavings. Fourth, all productivity is based on three factors: natural resources, human energy, both physical and mental-and tools. The tools factor is the only one of these three factors that can increase without limit, and tools and a free society are only created when people channel part of their earnings and profit into new tools of production. Fifth, the duty of a free enterprise government is twofold: it is to provide those things which the private sector cannot or will not provide; and, secondly, to provide those things for people who cannot provide for themselves. When a government oversteps these limited duties it does so at the expense of the individual freedom. In 1918 Dr Rasin, who became the first minister for finance in the first Czechoslovakian Republic and whose theories are currently earning the Czech Republic the title of 'the miracle country', said: . .. the best qualification and experience for serving the people is to understand that all indirepresentative, viduals are different, with different desires and needs and that our mission is to allow them the maximum freedom to fulfil those desires and needs, which will not only vary but continuously change. Then the process of serving, becomes a process of expanding freedom where and whenever possible. The answer for us must be to stop trying to control and change the Australian individual and instead change the system to· suit the individual-serve him and her-for the administration of government must be conducted for the benefit of those that it is to serve, and not vice versa. And, yes, we do require some understanding of higher principles, the ability to distinguish between wanting to do something good rather than the fear of the consequences of doing something bad; wanting to heal the sick, as distinct from enjoying the status Of doctor; wanting to serve the people and the country, as opposed to merely exercising political power. I do love this country and its people. I know that an individual free enterpriseeconomy will· benefit all the people. I believe that the natural effort of every Australian individual to better themselves is so powerful that it alone, without assistance, is capable of lifting this country to wealth and prosperity. I will continue to campaign relentlessly so that the Australian people will understand the philosophy of individualism and the principles of free enterprise. This means telling the truth; credible programs, not populism; realism and not false promises; optimism and selfconfidence instead of the dreams of state paternalism. It has been an honour to stand at the dispatch box in this House to present my maiden speech. It is an even greater honour that I stand· and represent the people of Mackellar. Mackellar is known to its residents, of which I am now one, as God's own country. I want to thank everyone who helped me in my endeavour to be here, but I particularly want to thank my family, my friends, my col.,. leagues, my staff and the magnificent Liberal Party volunteers who not only worked tirelessly through the longest by-election in the world but·still continue to help. Jim Carlton gilVe great service to the people of Mackellar and, as their newly elected I undertake to similarly serve. I undertake to be accessible, to fight the battles for my constituents and to be their representative in Canberra, to serve them and, through this parliament, to serve the nation. We who stand for freedom, creativity, hope and love, we who revere each individual, will always be the enemy of collectivism. That is why we oppose state imposed regimentation and all public invasions of each individual's freedom. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",34
15,Mr LATHAM,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I congratulate the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) on her first speech in this chamber. She joins an interesting and varied class of 1994, arising out. of the five by-elections that were held earlier this year: the honourable member for FremantIe (Dr Lawrence), the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) and me on this side of the chamber and the honourable member for Mackellar and the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) on the opposition side. I congratulate the honourable member for Mackellar on joining me and the honourable member for Bonython on delivering her first speech. I look forward later today to the first speech to be delivered by the honourable member for Warringah and the first speech to be delivered· by the honourable member for FremantIe later in the week. On a more partisan note, I judge members by the electorates they repres.ent, and better the fair dinkum contemporary Australians that I represent than the shellbacks opposite. Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1994-95 offers a stocktake on the government's progress with structural reform of the budget and microeconomic reform across Australia. This government-a long-term government by Australian standards-shows no sign of reform fatigue. For this government, economic reform never ends. Labor in the 1990s has embraced an ethos of continuous reform-and so we must. After World War II, Australia joined a small group of nations, including Canada, New Zealand and Norway, which bridged the factor and wealth-driven stages of development. National wealth was generated from rich natural resources, avoiding the need to upgrade productive capacity. Without industry upgrading, economic policy gambled on favourable terms of commodity trade. The national focus turned inwards, with public policy geared to preserving the status quo. The telltale signs were diminishing competition, adversarial labour relations and industry protection. Thirty years of coalition government primed Australia for high consumption, low savings, high debt and low competitiveness. This was the politics of a complacent country. This remains the true meaning of the legacy of Menzies and Fraser. As .the new.Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) lays claim to this legacy, he inherits all the elitism and complacency of their failed policies. Patriarchs, never knowing the meaning of struggle, never act with the urgency ·or hard edge of reform and innovation. Only Labor has pushed the rigour of international competition into the Australian economy. This government has achieved in one decade more structural and micro reform of the Australian economy than in the previous eight decades since Federation. Since 1983, it shifted policy from a closed and sheltered economy to the model of an open and competitive trading nation. This has meant making available the tools by which Australian industry and commerce can compete successfully on world markets. In summary, that policy has involved removing fixed exchange rates, financial regulation and industry protection as artificial constraints to competitive advantage; introducing labour. market flexibility through award restructuring, enterprise bargaining and the training wage; increasing the national commitment to a skilled and competitive work force through education and training; establishing an internationally competitive taxation system; and increasing economic efficiency through reform of the waterfront, coastal shipping, rail freight, aviation,. telecommunications and government business enterprises. Indeed, since 1988, productivity in the 50 major federal and state GBEs has increased by 10 per cent per annum. The Australian economy is now 30 per cent more internationally competitive than it was 10 years ago. For the first time in 30 years, Australia is enjoying high non-inflationary growth. This recovery breaks the cycle of boom and bust based on housing investment that is so much a feature of our structural problems. Across the four quarters to June 1995-each opposition member should check the statistics in Budget Paper No. I-business investment is forecast to grow by 20 per cent while home building activity will decline by five per cent. This is the first time in Australia's history that recovery has been sustained more by business investment than a housing boom. Just as important has been the growth in manufactured exports. Australia no longer rides the roller-coaster of world commodity prices. Manufactured exports increased by 12.5 per cent per annum between 1982 and 1992, four times faster than agricultural exports. High vahie added· manufacturing exports have grown ata rate of 19 per cent for the past seven years. These improvements have helped stabilise the current account deficit. The cost of servicing the national debt last year as aproportion of GDP was lower than 1986. The netdebt servicing ratio-that is, the ratio of net external debt to total exports-in 1984-85 Was 12.5 per cent. In December last year, it was 11 per cent. As opposition members echo the call of Malcolm Fraser to campaign on debt, they should remember those figures. Australia now has-in the only figures that matter in relation to servicing the national debt--:a lower. ratio than it had in 1986. In comparing debt servicing to total exports,the figures are better than in 1984-85. So this empty piece of rhetoric about high national debt cannot be sustained once we look at the most important figures, which are those concerning debt servicing. All this is· the product of continuous Labor reform. Last month the government delivered. a white paper with quality written all over it. For the first time in Australia, it was an attempt to make the labour market more responsive both on the supply and demand sides. That is, it contained initiatives to make the long-term unemployed jobs ready and regions with high unemployment rates jobs available; Equity remains an essential part of economic adjustment. Unless all parts of society are cared for, reform will be delayed by social concerns and resistance; The depth of these achievements· is not always understood in this parliament, or throughout the nation, or even overseas. On his recent visit to Australia, for instance, Lee Kuan Yew stuck to a very stereotyped script. I quote: East Asians are highly competitive themselves to win life's marathons. To compete in the same marathon Australians must be weaned from welfare dependency and become self-reliant and competitive. Lee spoke of a relaxed society, too reliant on its resource wealth and restricted byinefficient work practices and attitudes. While representative of the postwar decades, the decades that the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) and other opposition members left behind in 1983; it is not true of Australia in the 1990s. In recent years Australia has shown itself to be no· less adaptiveto,and certainly more tolerant of, change than any other nation. While crediting the intense work ethic and sense of obligation in East Asian culture for its capacity to adapt to market· competition, we should not sell short Australian culture and experience. The adventure and achievement of Australian history has been downplayed because it lacks the great upheavals, the domestic wars and the national saviours ofEuropean and North American history. Our history and national development have been a story of collective achievement. Which other people or nation coming from the· ,despised origins of convict settlement could have developed such vast and harsh terrain to emerge at the turn of this century as the world's most affluent nation? This was the work of an . independent and pioneering culture. Which other people or nation overcoming the insecurity of isolation could have emerged in the 1970s and 1980s as the world's best example of multiculturalism and social tolerance.? This was the work of a culture living out its ethos of a fair go. Which other people or nation for so long locked into a closed e«onomy could open up to international . competition without unravelling its commitment. to the welfare state and decent work, standards? This is the work .of an adaptive and egalitarian culture. As a test of modern civilisation, through nation building, social tolerance and economic change, no other culture can match the Australian achievement-not European, not American, not East Asian .. Our challenge is to keep leading the world in a civilised way. Paul Kelly puts it best in his conclusion at peoples training 'The End of Certainty': The cha\Iengefor Australian leadership is to intemationalise the economy within a framework of social justice and equity thereby retaining the deepest and oldest Australian values. This is what the public expects and demands. The task of leadership now is to create Ii synthesis between the free market rationalism needed for a stronger economy and the social democracy which inspired the original Australian Settlement ideals of justice and egalitarianism. Only Labor can provide this style of national leadership. Our values and policies are set in the mainstream of society. The Liberal Party's values, forged in Toorak, Vaucluse and on the hills of Adelaide-and never knowing the meaning of struggle-are set in an Australia long past. Liberal Party members are clinging to moribund symbols of the monarchy and the Union Jack, uncomfortable with migrants and multiculturalism, wanting to deny Aboriginal Australians access to native title, and more interested in states rights th-m human rights. Far from fostering individual choices, they want to impose their preferred institutions, such as the nuclear family, on all individuals, and hoping, if they ever get the chance, to tum the welfare state and labour relaw>ns over to the free market forces. On questions of constitutional rights-that is, the republic-land rights and human rights, the Liberal Party and its policies are anything but liberal in the classical sense. This is an outfit whose members see social work not as a means of working with and helping the poor but as a chance to send their wives to society lunches dressed up as charity. In this parl,iament, only Labor looks and sounds' modem, with an agenda for modem social democracy. Only Labor has embraced the ethos of continuous reform for economic performance and social justice. This makes an important point about how to best judge the success of economic policy and these appropriation bills. Competition of any kind is never staticnot between firms and not between nations. In an isolated and closed economy, international comparison counts for little. In an open and competitive. economy, it is the only test of national success. International competition demands continuous reform at a rate faster than that of competitor nations .. Australia cannot afford to lower its expectations or outcomes for micro-economic policy. The government needs to keep alive all options for micro reform, including those which challenge the conventional wisdom of. Australian politics. Most of the government's achievements in the past decade would have been regarded as outside the expectations of a Labor govern. ment in 1983. These policies for financial deregulation, tariff reduction, labour market flexibility, lower taxes and privatisation have revealed Labor as a party more interested in outcomes than methods; that is, taking any means to the correct end. We are all pragmatists now. In 1983, for instance, Bill Kelty forecast how 'a decentralised approach to wage fixation would destroy the fabric of the trade union movement'. Today he promotes workplace bargaining as a means by which unions can extend their relevance and coverage. In the spirit of pragmatism and continuous economic reform, it is both rewarding and necessary for the parliament and the party to set an agenda for the remainder of the 1990s. Time does not allow me to deal with all aspects of policy, such as outlays, taxation, industrial relations and infrastructure reform. I will focus, however, on aspects of education and training and management reform. Governments have their greatest impact on the economy when they lift the quality of human resources. The education system should stimulate competition between students, producing new standards of excellence. Nations which relaxed their standards and grades in the 1970s, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, are yet to recover their advantage in skill development. This government has lifted our national commitment to education and training as a key source of competitive advantage, yet in Australia we still have too much education for education's sake. All parts of the education and training system, even universities, should take a vocational focus linked closely to the needs of their regional economy. The role of government is to provide a close connection between firms and quality education institutions. The German and Swiss apprenticeship schemes are an outstanding example of a system in which millions of young people combine applied education with on-the-job training. In an internationalised economy, the rapid pace of technologiCal change and capital movement requires greater responsiveness to the skill development needs of industry. In the old and closed Australian economy, manufacturing jobs were mostly unskilled, with skilled employment in the commercial and serviCe sectors. In·the open and competitive economy, the internationally traded goods sector will increasingly employ skilled labour. Factory workers are already starting to wear lab coats instead of overalls. Most unskilled workers will find employment in sectors not exposed to international competition,'such as retailing and basiC services. The government's training agenda can be advanced in two significant ways. First, the school education system needs to play a stronger role in making young people jobs ready. The introduction for years 11 and 12 of traineeships and extensive work experience announced in the white paper should be extended to years 9 and 10. There is a strong correlation between students not suited to a formal and acaderriic school curriCulum and long-term unemployment. The government's substantial investment in DEET trairiing programs is, in many cases, correcting problems which arose at a much younger age in the school education system. The cost-effectiveness of government outlays, federal and state, would be substantially improved by placing these students at years 9 or 10 into a curriCulum and style of intensely vocational education. Second, the training agenda in Australia and a substantial increase in government investment may lapse into a form· of new protectionism; that is, failing to provide incentives - for firms motivated by market competition to lift their investment in work force skills. Too .rilany small businesses in Australia regard training as something governments fund and provide. Tax concessions for. training would offer better incentives and outcomes. Governments cannot control the competitive advantage of nations; they can only influence it. There is too little focus in Australia quality of private sector management. Many of the benefits of high profitability in the late 1980s were wasted on wild speculation, unrealistiC salaries and pumping up dividends. Australian management lacked the hunger and judgment to· stake out quality investment returns for the .medium term. ,. Reports by the Australian Manufacturing Council show that only 10 to 15 per cerit of the manufacturing enterprises that could be exporting are actually doing so- MCKinsey has identified how the success of regional Australia relies heavily on a dynamic and outward looking business culture. The 1993 world competitiveness report ranked Australian management 17th out of 22 countries in an assessment of the means by whiCh companies are managed in an innovative, profitable and responsible manner. . On this measure we ranked ahead of just Italy, Turkey, Spain, Greece and Portugal. I am pleased to report that Australia's highest ranking of fourth was for the stability, quality and effectiveness of government-led of course. by the national government. Clearly, if - stralia 's business leadership .upgraded its own performance as strongly as it expects governments to change policy, economiC conditions would be.substantially improved. Management skills in Australia have lagged behind the pace of economiC change. The old closed economy denied Australia new generations of international· business management. This is also an issue of cultural conditions: Australians, while gregarious, confident and for all of OUT qualities, have not been risk takers. This is what Robert Hughes in The Fatal Shore called our 'defensive optimism'. From Australia's origins, innovation and rebellion, while not always punished, have too infrequently been rewarded. Australia has a sound record of product innovation, having led the world in mediCal research, biotechnology, marine research, radio astronomy .and aspects. of engineering. Too often, however, invention has not been supported by risk capital and marketing. In an open and competitive economy, risk taking must be seen not just as necessary but normal. The government's reform program will on the inevitably lift the standard of Australian management. Quite simply, only dynamiC managers that are capable, innovative and outward looking will emerge from an intensefaith, ly competitive business environment. It is important to use government programs and educational institutions to accelerate this adjustment process and continue the drive to quality assured management. The Industry Commission's inquiry on strategies for .imAustralia proving business management may develop further reforms next year. Labor and only Labor is upgrading the Australian economy with continuous reform. The Liberal Party can change leaders every day of the week if it so wishes, but it cannot solve the structural problems in the party. It is an outfit without the hard edge of reform and out of step with the values of modem investment in productive capacity. Australia. Any party rooted in the values of the 1950s and 1960s will fail and inevitably collapse. As sure as night follows day, that the way these outdated and old-fashioned Tories are headed. I commenced my speech by making some remarks about the first speech by the honourable member for Mackellar. Honourable it members need only read that speech to under""' stand how outdated and old-fashioned those tions Liberal Party values have become. The eral Party does not defend the rights of individuals; it imposes the Liberal Party world view of the traditional nuclear family and constitution on individuals. It denies proper laws and rights for homosexuals in Tasmania and denies individuals other human rights .. This party time after time shows that it not for the individual; it is for socialengiAustralia. neering and thrusting upon the people of Australia the sorts of values and stereotypes that it regards as important. Election election, these values are dismissed by Australian people. The Liberal Party can change leaders,- but it .will values and policies, and the people will record the same verdict at the next election and many after that.",36
16,Mr MCARTHUR,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I acknowledge the presence in the gallery of a large number of my who have come all the way from Colac to be For here to hear their representative put his point of view on the federal budget. The tal thrust of the 1994 budget is based upon hope and some charity: faith that heroic economic indicators will tum into reality over the next 12 months; hope that the recession that we had to have is now moving. towards a sustained recovery; and considerable charity to those 900,000 unemployed people around who will be receiving further government largess in an endeavour to take them off the dole queues. Some $6.1 billion will be allocated to this scheme to reduce the unemployment' numbers and relocate them somewh-re else. Australia's fundamental problems remain: a massive overseas debt of $172 billion, a current account deficit of $18 billion every ye-r or thereabouts and a lack of . The 1994 budget forecast a growth rate of 4.5 per cent. Again this is an heroic and is optimistic prediction, given the current world trading arena and Australia's poor growth records over the last decade. Inflation is projected to remain at 21/4 per cent. The opposition hopes that this will be the case, but is not too sure that it will .. The long-term bond markets, reflecting inflationary expectaand future interest rates, do not share the Liboptimism of the government's forecast. The current account deficit is projected to be $18 billion. This has been reinforced by the the poor trade figures released yesterday which indicate that we are $1.6 billion in the red yet again. The government's budget deficit of $11.7 billion will put pressure on is the short- and long-term money markets in",41
17,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Order! It being 3 p.m., the debate is interrupted. In accordance with after standing order lOlA, the debate may be the resumed at a later hour. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the not change its debate is resumed. NA Interest Rates",41
18,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Treasurer. I remind the Treasurer that on 28 constituents April this year he said: the foreseeable future one wouldn't expect that we would be likely to be seeing any movement in fundamenofficial monetary rates ... Does the Treasurer now share the view of the Prime Minister who has indicated that he expects interest rates to rise as the economic recovery continues?,41
19,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What the Prime Minister said was that at some stage of the economic recovery one must expect that there would be some movement in monetary policyMr Costello-No. He said interest rates. He said interest rates would go up.,42
20,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Movement in monetary policy means increases in interest rates, in case you have not understood that yet. Mr Costello-'-Don't try to walk away from it.",42
21,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition! Mr Costello-Say it.,42
22,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,",-The Deputy Leader of the Opposition should know better.",42
23,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The shadow Treasurer apparently does not realise that tightening of monetary policy means increases in interest rates. Mr Costello-Higher interest rates.,42
24,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"lam glad you understand it. Let me get this quite dear. What the Prime Minister was saying was that at some stage of the economic recovery, there could be expected to be some movement in monetary policy which would mean there would be, presumably, a tightening of interest rates. That would mean that we would have monetary policy playing a role in terms of anti-inflation policy. What the opposition apparently would like us to say-or what it thinks we should be saying-is that at no time in the future. will there be any movement in monetary policy; basically, interest rates should remain frozen; and monetary policy should have no role in the process of controlling inflation. That is apparently the opposition's policy. What it is doing is picking up on the comments of the Reserve Bank governor who quite properly and responsibly is saying to the banks and to their customers, 'Bear""inmind that at some stage of the recovery it will be appropriate for us to move monetary policy, which will mean that some higher interest rates will apply because that will be necessary to control inflation.' That is at some stage in the future. That means that there would be the proper use of an instrument of economic policy by way of moving interest rates. Of course, we have had tremendous reductions in interest rates. Official rates' have come down by over 13 per cent since their peak at the end of the 1980s. That has brought us to a situation where we have the lowest interest rides since the 1910s. What is being said, quite responsibly and properly, by the Reserve Bank governor, by the Prime Minister, and by me is that, at some stage, we can expect that there will have to be some increase in interest rates. That is at some stage. Mr Downer-Why don't you say so?",42
25,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We also say, particularly for your benefit, that it is not going to happen in the near future because there is no need for it to happen in the near future. Monetary policy will play its role in terms of anti-inflation activity by using a policy instrument which should be used for that purpose. At the moment, in case you have not noticed, we have an inflation rate of 1.4 per cent, one of the lowest rates in the Western world and the lowest rate for about 30 years. So we are looking at inflation rates which are historically low, and in 1994-95 we are looking at an outcome of some slight increase in inflation, but still to be no greater than the level of our major trading partners-a little over two per cent. We are looking at rates of inflation which are historically low but at some stage-as the recovery goes on, as we get to higher capacity utilisation levels and as there is more and more employment reducing unemployment and more pressure developing in the labour market-one must expect that there would have to be some anti-inflation action taken which would require tightening of policy. The appropriate flexible instrument to use for that purpose is monetary policy; '. All we are saying is, 'Bear in mind that,at some stage of the recovery, there will need to be a tightening of monetary policy to ensure that we do not let inflation increase.' We are determined to hang on to a low inflation outcome'-a major structural change for the great benefit of the Australian economy in the present circumstances. It is important for us to hang on to, that low inflation rate and all the appropriate instruments of policy will be used. to make. sure we do that. All that is being done is giving a proper' warning that this is going to happen at some stage or other. But it is not going to happen in the near future. It will, only happen when we see inflationary expectations increasing and· we see the first signs of inflationary take-off. That is some way off from here. Taxation: Employee Share Acquisition Schemes",42
26,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Has the Treasurer seen media comment with respect to the new taxation arrangements for employee share acquisition plans· that· were announced in the budget? Can he provide any further information to the House on the new arrangements?,43
27,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I can advise the honourabie member that there have been important announcements in the budget about employee share ownership schemes. The changes that have been made are important ones because they address two problems we had with pre-existing .arrangements. Previously we had a tax deferral scheme. which goes back to the 1970s. We also had a tax exemption scheme which was brought in in 1988. Neither of those schemes waS satisfactorythe tax deferral scheme because it was wide open. in its capacity for tax deferral, it was unlimited as to amount;, unlimited as to time for tax deferral and, most importantly, it could be utilised not for buying shares' or giving employees shares in their own company but as a general tax preferred.· instrument for investment in all sorts of other companies, including overseas companies, real estate, et cetera. That seemed to us to be a total misuse of the concept of a tax concession for employee share '. ownership. The. other scheme, the tax exemption scheme,· provided for a $200 tax exemption but on such a restricted basis that it was virtually unused. . What has happened in the budget is that we have sought· to tighten the tax deferral arrangements SQ that their misuse in acquisition of shares outside the employee's own company would cease. The open-ended nature of them-in terms of the period of tax deferral and the amount of money involved per annum-would be restricted so that they would be more confined to their appropriate purpose and be somewhat limited as to the extent which could be made of them. We had people making inquiries about taking the whole of their salary by way of such tax deferral. arrangements, so that had to be stopped. On the other hand, we were concerned to make sure that there was an appropriate encouragement to increased employee share ownership in this country-not just for senior executives but for all of the work force in companies. We therefore moved to increase the generosity considerably of the tax exemption scheme so that the $200 limit becomes a $500 limit for the tax exemption. The 10 per cent discQunt limit, which was there before and which required employees to spend $1,800 to get the benefit of the $200 tax exemption, has now been changed to a 100 per cent discount possibility. This means that employees can get $500 worth of shares in their employer's company each year, if there is such a scheme and the employer is prepared to engage in it, without their outlaying anything. , So, if the employer sets up a scheme of that kind, there is $500 worth of tax free shares in the employer's company. That possibility now exists as a result of this change. Also, the capital gains tax arrangements which previously clawed back some of the discount will be changed so that there is no clawing back of that discount when the capital gains tax comes into operation on the sale of the shares. This is an absolutely major change in the way in which employee share acquisition schemes can be utilised in this country. There is now very considerable encouragement to non-discriminatory schemes across the work force providing very substantial benefits to wage earners in terms oftax exempt rights for shares in their companies. The benefits of this have been remarked on by a number of observers. I will just mention a couple of them. Mr Geoffrey Lehmann, who is a partner in Price Waterhouse and writeS in the Australian, said: The Government· deserves congratulations Jor its proposal regarding the taxation of employee shares. They will give Australia an arrangement for taxing employee shares which is world competitive. Robert Gottliebsen, commenting in the Business Review Weekly, said: . . . within two years, most listed companies are likely to be paying $500 a year to each employee in the form of shares. . . He went on: Within a few yellrs, Australia will go from having one of the developed world's lowest percentages of share ownership to one of the highest. Indeed, by 2000, a big proportion of the population will have received more than $2500 worth of shares, Which by then may be worth much more than issue price. I can't think of a move more likely to change the culture of the country and lead people to understand wealth creation and its benefits to the nation. Mr MCGauran-You are a bit late waking up to it.",43
28,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Gippsland!,44
29,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The change in the culture is important. The reason the government is prepared to take this substantial step is to ensure that the employees have, in terms of their consideration of their company, a much greater sense of involvement than they would otherwise have. This will have clear industrial relations benefits, as well as having considerable savings benefits for individuals and for private sector savings as a whole and clearly will assist employees and employers to develop better industrial relations. It is an exceedingly sound move and one which will be of great benefit to the work force and the nation. Interest Rates",44
30,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Now that we know that interest rates are set to rise, can the Treasurer confirm that a one percentage pointGovernment members-Oh!",44
31,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He has just said it. Can the Treasurer confirm that a one percentage point rise in interest rates would make the average new home borrower $71 per month worse off? Can the Treasurer assure Australian home owners that their mortgage rephyments are not set to rise in the months ahead as a result of these rising interest rates? .,44
32,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have just said that there is no likelihood of increased interest rates in the near future. Halt of th- question disappears on that basis. You should listen to the answers that were given. Mr Costello--':That is not what you said. Mr SPEAKER . . . . . Order!,44
33,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Let me spell it mit again. In the near future there is no likelihood of increased interest rates. Understand that-no likelihood in the near future. Mr Downer-What did the Prime Minister say?,44
34,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order. The Leader of the Opposition!,44
35,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'-They simply say, as I said, that at some stage of the economic recovery . monetary policy will be utilised. It . is not going to be utilised in the near future. The opposition is trying to make out that we are about to have some staggering use of monetary policy to increase interest rates. I say again: there are no plans by the government or the Reserve Bank to increase interest rates in the near future. Pay TV",44
36,Mr LEO MCLEAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. In light of the recent announcements that. pay TV will be available in this country later this' year, can the minister inform the House about the steps that he has taken to ensure that Australians continue to enjoy a high standard of sports coverage on free to air television?",44
37,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Today I put out a list of events which, I believe, should be protected for free to air television. It is a list of events for which pay television .will not be able to secure the rights before free to air television has in fact secured those rights. The list reflects the fact that the government is strong"" ly committed to ensuring that Australians continue to have free access' to important events which have traditionally been shown on free to air television. It will ensure that major events such as the AFL grand final, AFL mat-hes, the Melbourne CuP. and others will continue tobeprote-ted for fre- to air television. . . No-one should be s-rprised, by this list because as far back as 1991 the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, made the following statement: Strict siphoning rules would ensure that important programs, including national and' international sporting and cultural events, will continue.to be available on free to air. That is what the then minister said back in 1991. In the explanatory memorandum of the bill he made it clear that 'the siphoning process should ensure on equity grounds. that Australians will continue to have free access to important events'. Today the government has honoured that promise. Today the government has ensured that the· promises made in 1991 when decisions were made on pay TV have now been kept. The challenge for pay TV has always been to increase the diversity of programming. PayTV has not been about forcing Australians to pay for events that they can now watch on free to air television.",44
38,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is not right. You don't have to pay for the Olympics.,45
39,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Some of the people on your side of the House do. believe you' should pay to watch the Olympics but those of us on this side of the House are going to mllke sure that that will not happen. It has been' predicted that, even after five years, four out of five Australians will not have access to pay television and this siphoning list is t6 ensure that Australians continue to have' access to the sporting events that they are used to. I want to clear up one misunderstanding. This list is not a list of events that cannot be shown on pay television. This i.s a list of events that cannot be exclusively on pay. That means that if events are on this list, such as football matches, from Aussie rules to rugby league, they can be shown on free to air and they can also be shown on pay. The fact that I have listed these events for the next 10 years simply reflects the current commercial realities. Channel 7 already has the. pay TV rights for the AFL through to 1998 and Channel 9 has the rugby league rights through to 2001. By setting a period of 10 years we have ensured that we are going to influence the next round of negotiations for the AFL and for the rugby league. Mr Downer-What about the arts?",45
40,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition interjects and says, 'What about the arts?' I know you have had a few other things on your mind lately and you might not have had a chance to read the ABA report on this issue, but the ABA did say that in the research it conducted the events Australians were concerned about were sporting events. In fact, for events such as ANZAC Day and the entombment of the Unknown Soldier exclusive television rights are not sold for those cultural events, so it is nota matter of needing to protect them; Mr Downer-That is not a cultural event. What about the opera?",45
41,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member opposite says that he does not believe an event such as ANZAC Day is an event of national importance or of national cultural significance, which is a bit of a difficulty.",45
42,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting',45
43,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I simply make the point to the Leader of the Opposition that exclusive rights are not sold for ANZAC Day. Mr Downer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I think, in answering a question, to grossly misrepresent an interjection like that is highly offensive. I think the minister should withdraw those comments because it is patently untrue that I interjected those words.",45
44,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the point of order: it is not intended by the standing orders that the point of order be used as a point of debate. There is ample room in standing orders for a position to be.taken on misrepresentation at the end of question time. Because he is stung, childish and embarrass-d is no reason to tolerate it.",45

48,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of .order: the conventions of this place state that a .lie is llot parliamentary. A lie was stated and you are the expert at this sort of misrepresentation. I ask that it be withdrawn. The minister told a: lie., '",45
49,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister was responding to an interjection. Mr Thckey-But he did not respond to the interjection; he told a lie.,46
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-,.Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat or he can keep walking. The Leader of the Opposition raised a point of order in respect of a comment that the minister made in his answer. The minister was responding to an interjection, as I heard. it at the time. The Leader of the Opposition believes that the information conveyed was inaccurate. There was a second point of order raised about certain use of terminology. I might just point out to the honourable member for O'Connor that I could quite clearly hear a number of members on his side using similar words but I have chosen to ignore that at this stage. The minister will return to the basis of the ques':' tion. Mr Thckey-Has he withdrawn?",46
51,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He has not said anything ing that is unparliamentary. He is not required withdraw. Mr Nehl- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.

53,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Everyone can read the Hansard tomorrow. Opposition members-Withdraw! MrLEE-Everyone can see the tapes: The Leader of the Opposition said that ANZAC Day was not part of Australia 's cu1ture-it was not a cultural event: Mr Downer-'-That is a lie.

This anti-hoarding amendment will ensure that free to air broadcasters will actually show the events the rights for which they have acquired. If they do not, those events will be taken off the list. Mr Downer-That is disgraceful.",46
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has the call. - Interest Rates Mr COSTELLO:"":""My question is directed to the Treasurer. Given the fact that the Reserve Bank governor is warning. home buyers to factor into their borrowing .decisions the possibilities of higher interest rates and low wage growth, will the Treasurer please help them to do so by explaining what he means by 'the near future', and whether it is a question of weeks or months before interest rates rise?",46
58,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is a tawdry attempt to beat up an issue which the opposition knows is not an issue. Let me repeat: there is no likelihood of increased interest rates in the near future. Mr Costello-Weeks or months?,47
59,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have already said, the timing for any movement in monetary policy is dependent on what happens to inflationary expectations. Mr Ronaldson-What do you mean by it-weeks or months?",47
60,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Ballarat!,47
61,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is what it is aboutkeeping inflation under control. It is not the only policy instrument, but it is obviously one that can be appropriately used for that purpose. It is what is driving the official interest rate increases that have occurred in the United States, whose interest rates were lower than ours and have been moved back from an accommodating to a fairly neutral stance. Our rate has not moved in that time because we did not go as low as them and we have lower inflation than them. We are now in a position where our monetary policy' will be used for the same purpose as in the United States when it is appropriate to move it. That time is certainly not now. When that time is will depend on what happens to inflationary expectations. Asset Sales",47
62,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Can the minister inform the House of recent progress on asset sales within his portfolio? Can he inform the House of the implications for achieving current budget· targets?,47
63,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"lam delighted with the progress that has been made in fact in the last few days with the government's asset sale program. On Sunday we concluded a very successful float.of CSL, with· gross proceeds of some $299 million and an issue price to shareholders of $2.30. The sale attracted a . broad level of support from all investor groups, particularly the smaller investors who will be very important players in floats such as Qantas in the next financial year. That float has achieved the government's objectives, which were to ensure a broad, independent and largely Australian ownership base. It was a good result for CSL, the shareholders and Australian taxpayers. Today I have been able to announce important progress in another asset sales area, that of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline. Novacorp International of Canada, together with Petronas of Malaysia, has been selected as the preferred purchaser of the remaining 49 per cent of the pipeline. The government has also reached agreement with the Cooper Basin gas producers on the resolution of their rights in the context of the sale, subject, of course, to the approval of their boards. These two developments mean the government is confident of achieving the 30 June sale date for the pipeline despite many predictions to the contrary. That is not to say there are not a few potential glitches along the way. I have participated in the progress of this pipeline sale for some time now, and the way in which the whole operation is hedged about is that there are about 1,000 gremlins running at it all the time. Most of them have been beaten off to this point. Of course, a lot hangs on the successful pass'age of the legislation through the Senate, but we have reasonable confidence in the assurances that we have been given in that regard as well. Gross proceeds from the pipeline are expected to be in the range of $520 million to $540 million. Net proceeds will be a little below $500 million after allowing for compensation to be paid to AGL and the producers. The Commonwealth will assume a debt of around $190 million. With those two asset sales, combined with those undertaken earlier in the financial year, we will achieve the budgeted target of some $2.4 billion in asset sales for this financial year. Constantly there has been criticism in the media by the opposition that the government's asset sales objective is a moveable feast, that it is capable of appearing in each successive budget' but no achievement is realised, and therefore is capable of being declared for the next year as well. In fact, the government has a· proud record .of successful. privatisations, privatisations which have not only incorporated a substantial return to the taxpayer but also have incorporated a whole series of other objectives in terms of strengthening the companies concerned, giving them a very substantial ownership base and improving the efficiency of the enterprises. These are good developments which give us confidence that the government's asset sales objectives for the forthcoming year and the subsequent years will be capable of achievement. I conclude by giving my thanks to the long suffering and much abused-and now all deeply affected with the flu-task force of the Department of Finance, which has successfully negotiated through these arrangements. Taxation: Fringe Benefits",47
64,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Assistant Treasurer aware that the fringe benefits tax is despised throughout rural and regional Australia because of its complexity and unfairness? Is the minister aware that a CIon curry cattle operator has to pay as much as $80,000 ailOually in fringe benefits tax and has to employ an accountant who spends half his time simply on fringe benefits tax? Will the government seriously address the issue of the complexity of the fringe benefits tax and the perverse impact it has on remote Australia?",48
65,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those of us with memories longer than that of the honourable member who asked the question will remember that the fringe benefits tax was brought into put fairness back into the taxation system. Prior to the introduction of the fringe benefits tax, many people could arrange their affairs so that they could take some of their income in cash and in benefits and pay tax only on the cash component. As you would be aware, the Treasurer has announced in the budget that we are having a review of the fringe benefits tax because we are aware that there are people in the business community who are complaining about the compliance costs of some elements of the fringe benefits tax. I am undertaking the review of that fringe benefits tax. I have written to over 100 interested parties seeking their .views. Mr Bruce Scott-Any mining companies?",48
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Maranoa asked the questi<?n. .,48
67,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"After I receive those views, we will consult with people who believe they have a genuine grievance with respect to the fringe benefits tax. The Treasurer announced that, when we undertook this review of the fringe benefits tax, we were not doing it with a view to getting rid of the fringe benefits tax but to lowering compliance costs. That is the aim of it. I can assure you and the whole House that when we review the fringe benefits tax, after receiving the submissions on 17 June and then talking with interested parties around Australia, we will take notice of the views of people who are affected by the fringe benefits tax. They will have their views taken into account. Let me finish on this point. One thing you should always know about the fringe benefits tax is that it is always optional. We do not put a half-nelson on employers around this country and force them to give fringe benefits to their employees. We do not; it is a choice they have. They can remunerate their employees with cash or they can do it through cash and fringe benefits. But if they choose the fringe benefits route, they pay the tax on them. That is fair to the taxation system. I am sure that the review will take account of the issues raised by the honourable member. Education",48
68,Mr HARRY WOODS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Minister for Employment, Education and Training inform us of progress on the implementation of the white .paper initiatives to increase the number of entry level positions? What has been the reaction of the Australian community to those white paper initiatives?",48
69,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the. honourable member for his question. Indeed, the reaction from the community has been to very well receive the government's white paper initiatives. That includes not only the business community and the trade union movement, but also community groups. In the last week or so, I have had the opportunity, including in the electorate of the hori:ourable member for Page, who has asked the question,to meet and discuss with comml,lI)ity based regional.organisatiol)s as to they can access the benefits under the white paper.. I am pleased that we have from his electorate in the gaIlery today the mayor of BaIIina, the mayor of the Richmond River Shire and the secretary of the Northern Rivers Regional Organisation of Councils, which is an organisation that was very quick off the mark to take advantage of these initiatives and· get jobs for its regions. I also had the opportunity to visit Queensland, the western suburbs of Sydney, the inner Sydney suburbs and the northern and eastern suburbs of metropolitan Melbburne- In relation to all of these groups, we have not only been able to discuss initiatives with them, bQt in a number of cases approve funding .to enable these groups to get going in accessing the programs. Mr Charles-You are the bagman.",48
70,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So the commlmity response has been velJ: strong indeed. Mr Charles-Bag money.,49
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for La Trobe! Mr CREAN.,.. - In addition, so far asadvancing this agenda, I should notify the House that today the advancement of the training wage is occurring. The Industrial Relations Commission has the matter listed today. Discussions with employers have been very productive. I remind the House that the training wage is a significant breakthrough because,· for the first time, it introduces traineeships for adults to link the training to an enterprise focus so that businesses can identify their particular needs. Most importantly, it ensures that, where this wage is accessed, it is linked to genuine and accredited training. .I have also announced the establishment of the NETTFORCE, the national employment and training task force, which is chaired by Mr Lindsay Fox. It is built upon the success of the Kelty-Fox discussions with regional Australia. I attended the first meeting of NETTFORCE. Two important initiatives that it has undertaken to advance entry level training are, firstly, the rationalisation and, secondly, the extension of traineeships. how Importantly, it will find a means for fasttracking the accreditation of these traineeships. If a traineeship is approved in one state, that will be sufficient for the NETTFORCE to approve its application in other states to enable entry level traineeships to be taken up. On the question of the extension of the traineeships,1 can also indicate that we are working together with NETTFORCE and employer groups to develop traineeships in areas where they have not existed in the past, in particular areas associated with environmental care and restoration; in rural Australia and, importantly, land degradation; in the development of a new traineeship for domestic services; and, importantly; in the area of sport. J confirm what is contained· in the sports pages of the Ase today. I have had high-level discussions with the Australian Football League to develop a means by which it can also access these programs if it is committed to developing traineeships that combine sport, administration, umpiring and other activities. I hope that this at least gets bipartisan support in this House, because· a number of clubs have already indicated their commitment to it. One is Essendon, which I know the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, :the honourable member for Kooyong and my coIleague the honourable member for Holt would be. very pleased about. Of course, the North Melbourne Football Club is very keen to support this,and six other clubs are also participating. If successful, this can provide a model by which the traineeships in sports can be extended to the other codes, whereby we can tap into real opportunities in the community to give young people the opportunity to play the game they want and to gain invaluable train. ing whilst they are at it. It summarises the steps to date. We have not stopped with the policy announcement. We are about implementation and we are about getting outcomes. The commitments that have been made by regional community-based organisations suggest that they at least do understand the benefits, even if those on the other side of House are not prepared to acknowledge them. Taxation: Fringe Benefits",49
72,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer. Many employers are confused about the scope of their fringe benefits tax obligations. Can the minister advise under what circumstances an employer can be subject to fringe benefits tax when· a perSon is doing voluntary work?,50
73,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If I take the question the way it is presented and take the literal meaning, my answer is that if they are doing voluntary work then they are not an· employee; therefore, they would not be subject to fringe benefits tax. Opposition members-Ha,ha!",50
74,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! It was obviously a very popular answer. Tobacco: Sports Sponsorship,50
75,Mr CHYNOWETH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. Given the speculation over recent days on tobacco sponsorship of sport, can the minister advise the House on the government's position on such sponsorship and on the call to revise the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992?",50
76,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I want to make it very clear at the outset that I have not yet actually received a request for an exemption from the ban on tobacco advertising under the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992. There has been significant media speculation, fed by the Premier of Victoria and, to a lesser extent, Premier of South Australia. The media has speculated-and it has been fuelled by this information-that naming rights, for instance, for the Australian Grand Prix could in future years be held by a tobacco company. That would result in national year-round promotion for that tobacco company similar to that received by Fosters when it had naming rights for the grand prix. Clearly that was not what the parliament intended when it passed the act in 1992. In making any decision under the tobacco advertising act, however, I have to have regard to the purpose of the legislation; the to make it very clear that, in my view, and clearly in the view of the parliament, the act was designed to limit the· exposure of the public. to messages, particularly those. that linked glamorous images with smoking. The aim of the act is clearly to improve public health. That will be achieved not by expanding advertising but by phasing it out. I want to make it very clear, particularly to Mr Kennett and Mr Brown, that I will not allow a significant level of tobacco advertising at future grand prix events. I do not anticipate that I would be inclined to exercise my discretion under the act to grant such an exemption, and I underline those words: I am not inclined to exercise my discretion to allow such an exemption because an exemption it would be. Should I exempt any event, I am currently disposed to apply very strict conditions to those events to curtail the extent and impact of any advertising; otherwise the act would become a farce, and I do not think that is what the parliament intended. Mr Tuckey interjecting",50
77,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say to the honourable member who is interjecting that it is very important that the words be correct in this case because I have to administer an act. I am sure he appreciates that the parliament would not want to have its views challenged. After 1995, as honourable members will be aware, all of this sponsorship will be phased out. The only exemptions will be those where it is genuinely the case that removal of tobacco sponsorship would result in the loss of the the event. I must say that I have not been impressed by the activities of some organisations and event organisers reaching first for the tobacco sponsorship dollar and only secondarily considering other enthusiastic sponsors. From my point of view, we must, as has been recommended jointly by the Doctors Reform Society and the Australian Medical Association, ensure that the intent of the act is fulfilled and that, if necessary, we examine tightening up the provisions so that we do not see an expansion of tobacco advertising and sponsorship in this community, the effects of which on this World No Tobacco Day should I want be clear to everyone. T-xation:, Fringe Benefits",50
78,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer. As the Assistant Treasurer is undertaking a reviewofFBT, will he corifinh that, if a travelling salesperSouthern son has dinner with a colleague, his meal is exempt from PBT but, if he dines with a client, FBT is paid on his own meal? If he has lunch with a client and gets, a qiscount the entire meal, FBT is charged on his own meal. However, if he again uses a discount card to entertain a client but gets a free meal, no FBT is paid at all on his own meal. Cim the Assistant Treasurer confirm these ludicrous effects of the FBT legislation?",51

Southern Bluefin Thna MrSNOW-Is the'Minister for Resources aware of a meeting held in New Zealand of the Commission for the Conservation of Bluefin Tuna? What impact willlhis have on the Australian tuna fishing industry? Mr BEDDALL...,..I thank the honourable member for Eden-MonarofoThis question. I on recognise his long-term interest in the southern bluefin tuna. When we came .into parliament together, he was raising issues about the southern bluefin tuna then. It is correct that last week in Wellington, New Zealand, the first meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Soufhern Bluefin Tuna took place. It was an Australian initiative tei get the convention off the ground. The convention gives a binding legal basis to the management of the southern bluefin, tuna. The delegation included representatives from both Australian industry and conservation groups. One of the problems of trying to manage this resource is the scope of the tuna's migration. As honourable members would know, it spawns in the sea south of Java and migrates to areas as far afield as the coast of Africa and the honourable member's electorate. This is an extraordinarily valuable resource. Because of its commercial nature, particularly to the Japanese market, it is prone , to overfishing. A fresh southern bluefin tuna can bring around $100 a kilogram, which means that a fish can range in price between $15,000 and $20,000 a fish. In recent times there have been scientific reports into southern bluefin tuna. It still remains severely depleted. The spawning stock is at its lowest level butthere are good signs that, from the cutbacks we made in 1988 and 1989, there will be some flow-on effects in reversing the parent stock decline. In view of the scientific report, we have agreed to keep quotas at last year's level: Australia at 5,265 lonnes, Japan at 6,065 tonnes and New Zealand at about 420 tonnes. , Our major priority' is 10 get all southern bluefin tuna nations to agree to these limits on catches so that the stock can recover. In recent times other nations, including Korea, Indonesia and Taiwan, have extensively fished for bluefin tuna. I will be having discussions later this year with the Korean and Indonesian governments to ensure that they come into the fold. I will be talking to Japanese government officials about a method for determining where the fish have been caught so that we can ensure that stocks are not overfished. Rural Industry",51
85,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Mr Ronaldson-You're safe, George.",52
86,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He looked a bit worried.,52
87,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You had better ask him a question or you will be asking no-one. , Mr ANDERSON-The answer might be more confusing than the question. With the drought worsening across the nation, many crops unable to be planted and the value of the Australian dollar rising, is the government aware that many farm families are struggling to stay on their farms and, tragically, many will not succeed? How is the government proposing to address these mounting economic and social problems for people on the land?",52
88,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Deputy Leader of the National Party well knows, the government has in place rural adjustment schemes which are the cornerstone of government assistance to the rural sector. Mr Bruce Scott interjecting Mr Tim Fischer-What about the wool industry?",52
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Maranoa and the Leader of the National Party!,52
90,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, I will try to give you as much information as possible. RAS is in place to ensure that, in times of difficulty, the rural sector given the assistance it deserves. It is a very valuable contributor to the Australian economy. As the opposition well knows, there are two forms of RAS: the normal RAS scheme and one for exceptional circumstances. Mr Tim Fischer-That does not apply to wool.",52
91,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the National Party interjects about the circumstances surrounding wool. It is true that on 30 June the special circumstances will cease. The price of wool' has significantly increased. Nobody is saying that it is as buoyant now as it was before the decline in wool prices. Wool is over 600c per kilogram-the highest it has been for a considerable time, when these special circumstances came in. The Leader of National Party also knows that farmers, including wool growers, are always able to apply for RAS under normal circumstances. Mr Bruce Scott-Not many are getting it. They are not viable..",52
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Maranoa!,52
93,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,If the difficulties continue in drought areas-this particularly relates to Queensland and northern New South Walesthen the government will respond to the problem with the state governments concerned. Small Business,52
94,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Treasurer aware of reports that the budget failed to do anything for small business? Can he advise the House whether those reports are accurate and, if not, what steps were contained in the budget to assist small business?",52
95,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Werriwa for his question. I am aware that there was a speech given after the budget at the National Press Club by the then shadow Treasurer, now Leader of the Opposition, in which he made some quite extraordinary claims, one of which was that there was nothing in the budget to provide for increased living standards or for higher wages, and another that there was nothing in the budget for small business. Let me say inferentially is that, in. relation to real wages, the budget is based on an assumption of real wage increases of 11/4 per cent in ,1994-95 following a real wage increase in this current year, and that real household disposable income...,...that is real, after inflation-will rise by 33/'Iper cent. Yet the opposition leader, as he now is, was trying to tell the nation that there was nothing in the budget about improving living standards or increased real wages.. The claim he made that there was nothing in the budget for small business is just as outrageous as his first claim, if not more so. There is an enormous amount in the budget for small business. The budget contains a package of industry policy expenditures which will cost around $500 million over four years. Much of that expenditure is relevant to small and medium enterprises. There are also some important tax changes. One important area for small business has been access to finance. Prior to the budget, we had taken important steps to assist in that direction. In relation the non-callable deposits with the Reserve Bank, which the banks have to have, we made them pay a full market rate, so that the banks received an additional $140 million. A condition of that was that it was additional lending for small business. We also gave a $30 million capital injection to the Commonwealth Development Bank, which was paid yesterday. There was a $20 million per annum subsidy to the Commonwealth Development Bank so that it could lend on a more concessional basis. We also had the Reserve Bank undertake a lot more activity on small business. These measures were introduced prior to the budget. . In relation to access to finance we introduced in the budget measures to improve the finance skills and knowledge of small business operatives and capital providers. There was an extension of the Export Finance Insurance Corporation facilities to improve the availability of working capital and finance to small and medium sized exporters. We funded an advertising campaign to increase small business awareness of the Commonwealth Development Bank. That is important because when small businessmen come to the major banks for a loan and the banks do not accept them, only the Commonwealth Bank is referring them on to the Commonwealth Development Bank. The other private banks are essentially not doing that. We are trying to advertise the existence of the Commonwealth Development Bank so that small businesses will be aware of this facility. We facilitated discussion between banks and small business representatives to address the concerns of small business. We supported a pilot business angels scheme designed to match potential investors with small businesses requiring equity finance, as distinct from loan capital-debt finance. We also changed the conditions relating to the pool development funds. These were announced a couple of years ago. They have not been made great use of. They are a means of providing tax concessioned equity finance to small business. The tax rate on those has been reduced from 25 per cent to 15 per cent, and other changes have been made to liberalise their use. Those to measures were just in relation to access to finance for small business. In relation to research and development, the budget intrbduced a new support scheme totalling $48 million. over four years for specific early commercialisation in small, high technology firms which are able to demonstrate that they have the capacity to manage such a process successfully. Also, the threshold for the full 150 per cent concessional deduction for research and development has been reduced from $50,000 to $20,000 so that it is more accessible by small business. The threshold for participation in research and development syndication, which enables small businesses to get together for research and development purposes and to access the tax concession, has been lowered from $1 million to half a million dollars. In addition to that, there are a number of other steps. The national industries extension service, which we run in conjunction with the statesMr:s Sullivan-This is a long answer!",52

I am sure you have been saddened by the demise of the koi that was brought about apparently by disease which the Joint Hpuse Department staff were unable to control because of the rapid growth of algae. Would you recommend to the House that it investigate the use of safe ionising radiation to control the algae growth so that we could once more enjoy the koi in the courtyard?,55

NA Industrial Relations Mr SPEAKER"":""""I have received a letter from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The continued failure of the Keating Government to recognise the importance of industrial relations reform to the modernisation of the Australian economy. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members reqUired by the standing orders having risen' in their places",55
124,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Only a fool, or somebody who has no real commitment to the future of the Australian community or the Australian economy, would deny the fact that the modernisation of the Australian economy is far from complete, But this country stilI has a long way to go before it has a world-Class competitive economy. This country stilI has a long way to go. before it can produce levels of competitiveness and a productivity performance which will enable it to effectively compete in the Asia-Pacific region. Therefore,it is quite remarkable that, at a time when everybody-when people can get above the hurly-burly of political debateacknowledges the fact that further modernisation of the Australian economy is necessary, this government should take a number of steps which' actually work against the mod'ernisation of the Australian economy. I refer, in particular, to the Industrial Relations Reform Act which came into operation only eight weeks ago.' Let us be absolutely clear. This was not an industrial relations reform act; this was an ACTU pay back the obligation act. This piece of legislation elevated to an art form the winner takes all theory of Australian politics. If ever you wanted any proof of that, you have it out of the mouths of two of the leading trade union officials in Australia at the present time. Mrs Sullivan"":""""What did they say?",56
125,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What did they say? Jennie George, the Vice-President of the ACTU, in that famous interview on the PM radio program a few months ago, was told about employer objections to the legislation. Do you know what Jennie George had to say? She said, 'What they have to understand'-'they' being the employers- 'is that we won the election and they lost the election.' That is the measure of the Industrial Relations Reform Act. This act was not a nice balancing act between the interests of employers and the interests of workers agonisingly worked out by honest broker Brereton. This was a piece of cheap political payback to the unions because they bankrolled the government's dishonest re-election in March of last year. That is what this was all about. It was not about anything else. That is why this legislation has been flawed from the very beginning. In parliament yesterday, despite what he has told us day after day, week after week, in the eight weeks that have gone by since the legislation came into force, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) got up and said, 'In response to the representations of the employers, we are going to make a few changes to the unfair dismissal provisions.' You should have heard Stan Sharkey on The World Today at 12 o'clock. Stan Sharkey runs the Combined Forestry, Mining and Energy . Union of Australia. In Victoria last week- the principal spokesman in that state for Stan Sharkey's union, the CFMEU, had this to say about a small business that was trying to negotiate a deal with its work force outside the reach of the union-what he said encapsulates what he thinks of the alleged freedom under the act-'If any company thinks it can do a deal without us, we are going to come down on them like a tonne of bricks.' People in the building industry would recognise that as being more than a metaphor. Being set upon by a tonne of bricks in the building industryMr Costello-By some concrete shoes ..",56
126,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There were plenty of tonnes of bricks and concrete shoes flying around the building industry, particularly in Victoria over the last couple of years-indeed over the last 10 years. What we have is a piece of legislation that was not conceived in the national interest. I can accept that we lost the election last year and that the Labor Party won the election. I can accept that the Labor Party was hardly going to embrace Jobsback, the industrial relations policy of the coalition. Why on earth, in the name of common sense and the national interest, did the government decide to' introduce an act that made the situation worse at a time when it needed to make the Australian economy more flexible and more productive? I remind honourable members of the OECD report on the Australian economy that was released a few weeks ago-the one that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) impetuously described as 'Eurocentric' when he was in Thailand. He called it Eurocentric because it said' a few nasty things about his economic programs. That report had a number of interesting findings about the Australian economy. The most interesting finding was that the productivity growth of the Australian economy in the five-year period between 1987 and 1992-when yours truly, who normally sits there, was the Treasurer for four and Prime Minister for one of those five years-was only 70 per cent of the OECD average. The ultimate exarn paper that any national economic manager sitS forin this game is that of .productivity growth, because without productivity growth we are dead in the long run. The government can borrow from overseas until its creditors extort it with interest rates that are too high. The government can send the country broke by going into debt but, at the end of the day, if it does not lift productivity it is dead. Under this bloke, first as Treasurer and now as Prime Minister, our average productivity growth over the five-year period has been only 70 per cent of the OECD average. The major reason why our productivity growth is low is that we have a highly regulated, rigid, inflexible labour market. So what do those people opposite do in response? They get re-elected on a scare campaign and then, having wrecked productivity with their rigid industrial relations' system through the· 1980s and having as a consequence forced this country into enormous overseas debt, they deliver this country into the hands of the foreign bankers and the foreign bureaucrats of Geneva so far as the industrial relations laws of this country are concerned-and I will come to industrial relations in a moment. They then make the situation worse by deciding to bring in an industrial relations act which actually imposes penalties on small businessrnen who want to take on more staff. That is what your Industrial Relations Act does. Even with the changes that the minister announced yesterday to the unfair dismissal provisions, which undoubtedly improve them somewhat, you have still left the ontis of proof on the employer to establish that he or she has not unfairly dismissed an employee. You still leave hanging the Damoclean sword of very heavy liabilities on small businessmen if they get rid of incompetent staff. How on earth do you believeMr Adams iriterjecting, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Lyons!",57
127,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let him rabbit on. I do not mind: How on earth can small employers in this country be expected to take on more staff if disincentives are being built into the system? That is the first thing you did. The second thing you did was to completely wreck the protection that small business has under the secondary boycott laws. Once again the unions have been placed above small businesses. What is wrong· with a law which says, 'If I wreck your business with a boycott I can' be sued, and if a union wrecks your business with the same boycott it can also be sued'? What is wrong with both of us being liable? That, of course, is too much for you. What you have said is, 'If I wreck your business you can be sued, but if a union wrecks your business it cannot be sued.' That is what you have done. That is justice Keating style in Australia in 1994. You have done nothing about the cancer of compulsory unionism in Australia. You carry on in your demented politically correct fashion about all other forms of discrimination, but when it comes to discriminating against somebody in the workplace you say, 'That is different; you can't touch that because that involves the unions' monopoly power over the industrial relations system of this country.' This government has taken as a base the low productivity of the' Keating treasuryship years between 1987 and 1992-and people can shake their heads as much as they like; the fact is that it is here in black and whitewhen Australia's productivity growth was 70 per cent of that of the OECD average. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) get up and carry on about how terrible things are iil America, how dreadful things are in the United Kingdom with all those homeless people, but the simple fact of the matter is that in the. main exam paper of economic management they have at very best a C-plus in productivity. Australia is a very long way behind the rest of the world so far as productivitygrowth is concerned. To make matters worse, we have a Minister for Industrial Relations who, when this act was proclaimed, said that all of the complaints being made by small businessmen were absolute scaremongering. Eight or nine weeks ago he said that any employer who behaved fairly and decently had nothing to fear, but yesterday he got up-do you know why he got up yesterday?-because two of his major business mates from the Business Council said to him, 'Look, Laurie, this act is going to stop the employment of people by small business. We have a white paper which is going to spend $6 1/2 billion ,of taxpayers' money to try to cajole and subsidise small businessmen into employing unemployed Australians, and as fast as you are spending our money to do that, in the same breath, you are passing a law which actually imposes disincentives on small businessmen who want to take on more staff.' I cannot think of anything more crazy. My suspicion is that when the minister went on the Laws program a couple of weeks ago he got such a bollocking from small businessmen who were complaining about the impact of this piece of legislation that he decided at the last minute that he had to do something about it. What we end up with is the anguished cry of Stan Sharkey on The World Today. Stan said, 'They didn't tell us about the changes. We thought we had it all wrapped up. They didn't tell us about it. We gave a half a million to their election cam- . paign and he did not consult me about the changes.' Stan was really saying, 'We thought we had 100 per cent of this act tied up. We paid $500,000 to get what we wanted and they had the temerity to change five per cent of it. We are now left with only 95 per cent.' So it is only a 95 per cent payback. That is Laurie's commission, is it? To my mind this isa vivid demonstration of what a payback this piece of legislation was. To add insult to injury for the Australian people, the main legislative pillar of this act is the illicit use of the external affairs power by the Keating government. I say to the minister at the table, the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (MrJohns), and I say to all of those opposite, that there is one issue that is a real sleeper, particularly in provincial Australia: the growing awareness by Australians that this government has handed over the sovereignty of this country to foreign bankers and foreign bureaucrats. There is a growing number of Australians who are starting to recognise the hypocrisy of a Prime Minister who belly-aches about our alleged lack of independence because we are a constitutional monarchy, who wants to denigrate our· Australian flag, and who wants to wreck a constitution which has given this country 100 years of stability, cohesion and tolerance-all in the name of producing a proudly independent Australian nation. But all the time he has been saying that, and all the time he has been in government, he has been busily handing over power to foreign bureaucrats and foreign bankers. There is something repulsive in the idea that the battleground of the validity of this Industrial Relations Act is going to be some kind of committee of the ILO in Geneva. I think that is repulsive to Australia'sindependence. I do not care whether it is the government or the ACC!. I can understand why the employers are going ofEto Geneva to plead their case. If the government says, 'That is the forum you must shop in,' they have to go off to that forum. It is an affront to the national independence of Australia that we are in the handsofforeign bankers and foreign bureaucrats. The great constitutional legacy of this Prime Minister-the great self-proclaimed Australian nationalist, the strident republican . of Australia-is that he will have done more to pawn our independence than any other national political leader we have had.",58
128,Mr JOHNS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Petrie-Special Minister of State, Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (4.18 p.m.)- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER Mr Downer-Where is the· minister? Where is· Laurie?",59
129,Mr JOHNS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Laurie is running the transport portfolio, and I. will look after IR for today. I can agree with one .elementof the argument of the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard)-that the .. modernisation of the Australian economy will depend on our performance in productivity. But we and the conservative state governments agree on one thing: that enterprise bargaining is the tool that will drive productivity in the Australian economy. New South Wales has aconservative government; Victoria has a conservative government, although an inadequate one; and there is South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. They all agree that enterprise bargaining is the mechanism that we will all use to produce greater productivity in the Australian economy. In the last couple of years we, the Commonwealth, who have an impact over federal awards in Australia, have got on with the business of developing an enterprise bargaining system that is producing productivity. State governments, which handle state awards, have tried to get on with the business of developing enterprise bargains in order to produce productivity but have patently failed. So how is it that the member for Bennelong's own colleagues in conservative stat.e goverri., ments, who would love dearly, I am sure, to follow their own rhetoric about the production of good businesses in Australia, have failed to develop an industrial relations system that is producing productivity in this country? That is his problem. He is angry that when he was Treasurer he did not understand the industrial relations system in this country; that he developed an enormous rate of inflation without productivity to cover it. He hated the award system and he hated the inflexibility of the award system at that time. We recognised that the award system, which covers the working conditions of Australian workers; was so inflexible as to inhibit productivity in Australia. It;killed him as Treasurer. When we came to government we not only freed up the award system but also sought to place industrial relations and bargaining between workers and bosses at the heart of enterprises and to develop productive enterprises in Australia. Let us look at the scoreboard which shows the results of the Commonwealth and its ability to drive the system to productivity those of the conservatives in the states. These figures were produced just two· weeks ago were presented to a council of labour ers ministers around Australia. In the Commongovernment wealth sector, over one million workers who are covered by federal awards are covered enterprise agreements; 48 per cent of all workers under federal awards are covered enterprise agreements. So, to the extent that Labor and conservatives agree that enterprise bargains. bargaining is the way to produce better and more productive enterprises in this country, we have 48 per cent of the game sown 48 per cent of workers covered by federal awards. Our conservative opponents, who supposed to be mouthing the rhetoric of the honourable member for Bennelong, have done very little. Let us have a look at the scoreboard of the the problem. conse:vative states. In New South Wales the number of workers covered by enterprise to agreements under state awards, which is the area it would cover, is not 48 per cent but five per cent. Five per cent of workers in New South Wales under state awards are covered by enterprise agreements. That is a pathetic record for a conservative government that supposed to be concerned with productivity. In Western Australia the coverage is six per cent. The Western Australian. Minister for Labour Relations; Mr Kierath, was unhappy bargaining. when the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) suggested that it was only six per cent. He said, 'You're wrong, it is seven cent.' There you go: seven per cent of ers in Western Australia are covered by enterprise agreements. In Tasmania, where there is a conservative government, just one per cent of workers are covered. In South Australia the system is so new that virtually no-one is covered by That is a problem. enterprise agreements under the state award system under the new South Australian government. In Victoria no-one is covered by enterprise bargaIns because they have individual conboss, tracts, and individual contracts have remained secret contracts and compacts between an individual employer and an individual employee. There is IlO way we know not only and whether there is any decent productivity in the bargain but also what rights and privileges and have been taken away from individual workin Victoria. So the conservative Victorian has,· if you like, destroyed enterprise bargaining in that state. Workers have by jumped out of the Victorian system, which is now all but destroyed, and jumped into the by federal award system so they could get into a system like ours that can produce enterprise So the scoreboard of those who are running industrial relations systems that can provide upa productive workplace in the country is clear: 48 per cent coverage under federal are awards governable by the Commonwealth's IR system and an average of less than five per cent under state awards governable by, in the main, conservative state governments. That is The New South Wales labour minister came us last week and said, 'It remains the case . that there are seven different industrial relations systems operating in Australia which differ and impose conflicting requirements in . some important areas.' I agree. There are seven different systems: the Commonwealth is and the Queensland state system are developing enterPrise agreements which are good for productivity, and another five are not developing systems· that are good for enterprise Maybe the conservative states would have an argument if they had a single alternative per system which was better or worse than oursworkwe could argue the toss-but they do not. There are at least five different state IR systems around this country at the moment. The Commonwealth and Queensland have a single system with a single set of rules, but the conservatives have five different systems. Why have we been so successful in getting enterprise bargains up in this country? Because we have a single rule that says that, if people go into an enterprise bargain with their the boss cannot pay them less than their award previously stated. It is called a no disadvantage test. Mr Anderson-In other words, it is not enterprise bargaining.",59
130,Mr JOHNS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You do not understand. Bargaining means,two sets of people have to agree. If you want to get millions of workers into enterprise bargaining, they need to feel safe about the bargain. The no disadvantage test provides the safety to enter the agreement but does not stop the productivity. The no disadvantage test .operates in the Commonwealth system and in Queensland where, of course, we have had the greatest success under enterprise bargaining and the greatest impact on productivity. The no disadvantage test does not apply' in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmani- South Australia has a weakened no disadvantage test. I suspect it is wide enough to drive a truck through, but at least the 'no substantial disadvantage' is used. The conservatives do not understand why an employee would enter a bargain where patently they are likely to lose current terms and conditions. If there are a set of rules a no disadvantage test that allows people to enter the bargain, get a pay rise and produce for the employer a greater output, both sides win. Win-win situations are being achieved in over a million cases in the Commonwealth system. Over a million employees have been covered in the Commonwealth system; 48 per cent of all workers under federal awards are covered. The problem is that the states have a whole different· set of rules. Let me illustrate how some of the criteria in state systems are just so different. I would love to have a single unified IR system in this country, as would the conservative minister for IR in New South Wales. But she cannot achieve it because four of her own mates cannot agree on similar rules. Each state's rules are different on the duration of bargains. The Commonwealth and Queensland rules are the same. We all agree that enterprise bargaining per se is a good method, except for Victoria, which concentrates on individual non-published bargains or contracts-which are a disgrace. The question of union involvement varies enormously, but by and large the Commonwealth prefers and' encourages the trade union movement to become involved in enterprise bargains. Why would we not? The trade union movement has over 90 years experience in bargaining, If you were going to bargain with your boss about your future working conditions and wages, you should buy yourself some experience in bargaining. Go to your trade union and seek that 90 years of experience so that you will get yourself a reasonable deal. You would be bonkers not to do it. We encourage trade unions and the trade union systemThe difficulty for the trade union system with the Industrial Relations Reform· ACt is enterprise flexibility agreements. These are agreements, which are now being' written, where trade unions do not have substantial coverage in the enterprise or have no coverterm age. In that circumstance the trade union cannot veto an agreement. It can have an input, it can have a say, it can attempt to sign up members in that enterprise-and good on them-in order to say, 'We will do the job and for you, we will help you bargain this situation,' but at the end of the day they have no veto whatsoever on EFAs. On the matter of Able Demolitions and Excavations in Victoria, the CFMEU-the union that might otherwise cover workers in that enterprise-is putting the weights on to ensure that the 10 employers in that company get a decent deal. I will bet that at the end of the day Able will come up with an agreement and make sure that the CFMEU is either party to the agreement or has' a great input on behalf of the workers in the drawing up of the agreement. But it has no veto over the agreement. That was an enormous step and challenge for the trade union movement. It was imperative that the Commonwealth deliver the ability to spread enterprise bargaining to non-union workshops. We have done it and we have succeeded. Other things that are enormously different between the states include the question of union involvement. We are relaxed about it. The states, by and large, have no requirement or role whatsoever for trade unions throughout their systems, except that they are a bit gentler in New South Wales. South Australia has .a limited role for unionists. Queensland's system i- the same as the Commonwealth's system. In the Commonwealth, groups are required to register agreements, apart from private ones-and that is their business. In Victoria there is no requirement to register individual agreements, so no-one would know if someone was ripped off or poorly done by. No-one would know. That is no way to run industrial relations. It is better to have these agreements published or publicly available so people can understand and can compare what the other mob is getting. Why would we not have a law that says these agreements ought to be registered with the commission, published and made available? The states, by and large, .do not even agree amongst themselves as to whether the agreements ought to be published, but the Victorian case is the worse. It says, 'No, it does not matter. It is between you and the boss, and no-one need know any different.' That is the sad part of IR in Victoria. The rules about establishing an agreement, the variation for review, the publication of agreements and the question of consultation between the parties are different in the states. Only the Commonwealth and Queensland have a simple, single set of rules in order to run IR at the Commonwealth sector. For instance, there is a public interest test which operates in the Commonwealth which is a similar .concept to the no disadvantage test. Only the Commonwealth and the Queensland systems have that public interest test. New South Wales will not have it. Victoria will not have it. (TIme expired)",61
131,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Gwydir-Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia) (4.33 going. p.m.)-What a sad, outdated, class warfare, 'us and them' based approach to industrial relations,.. - a 'keep the bosses and workers apart' approach-that we have just heard from the previous speaker, the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns). Government members talk about us wanting to drive down wages, but what in the name of good· fortune has been happening under 11 years of Labor? on Labor's model is the failed model. It is the model that has no place in a modem and sophisticated society. It is the model designed to keep people apart so that no spirit of mutuality, recognition of mutual self-interest or cooperation develops to enable us to tackle our problems together. . Let me pose a couple of questions to the last speaker, who does not show me the courtesy of remaining. Thank you very much. I stay for speakers who follow me. I will even stay fot the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis). If our productivity improvements under this· marvellous new arrangement that the government has put in place are so wonderful, why is it that productivity improvements in Australia are lagging so badly behind OECD averages of improvement? Even worse, why are they falling behind the Asian improvements even more than OECD averages? Secondly, if we are doing so well, why is it that the government is proposing alterations to its legislation just eight weeks after it was introduced? More importantly, the government has jettisoned real enterprise bargaining agreements not by just heavy-handing the states but by structuring the process in this country to make enterprise agreements basically useless and very unattractive to employers. The government could have everyone in the work force in this country covere.d by workplace agreements. It could have 100 per cent coverage, yet we still would not have an efficient and productive work force, because essentially what we are getting is not a real enterprise agreement, not a real spirit of mutuality, not a real boost in .productivity arising out of more sensible relationships in the workplace. It is interesting to note that even that fellowMr MCGauran-Oh! The minister is",62
132,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He does not want his arguments rebutted. Even those people that the government assumed would never desert .it-the MTEA-have now decided that the system must be finally abandoned. Why? The fact is that our industrial relations system is a dinosaur. It is a dinosaur being kept alive a life support system and, in the interests of aU Australians, it ought to be switched off. l'he sooner the better, because keeping dino alive is quite simply counter to the overwhelming need to boost productivity in this country. The Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank warned last year that business and jobs would be lost if we lost our productivity. He might have added the obvious point that prosperity and living standards would also continue to decline if we do not make those reforms and tackle the tough issues. Without reforms, we will all lose-those in jobs, those lucky enough. to have them; those who are looking for jobs; and those who will look for jobs in the future. The greatest irony of all is that the Labor Party keeps crowing about the way it protects its constituents and the way it looks after the workers. Who are the great losers out of the policy approaches and prescriptions that we see under this mob-the very people the government says it is most concerned to look after and protect. When it comes to talking about Labor's objectives and its understanding of boosting productivity and the linkages between that., more jobs and prosperity, I make this ob-ervation: do not listen to what Labor says; look at what it does. While, on the one hand, we getrecognition of the importance of the business sector's role, on the other hand we get a vindictive attitude towards business. It has copped it non-stop for supporting us in the last election and for calling out for decent reforms. We g-t diatribes of the sort that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) talked about-this really mature attitude,. 'We won and you lost, so hang the interests of Australians; we will just pursue the interests of the mates, the privileged and the entrenched.' It is class warfare language. The government, from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) down, derides business and belts it around the room. It then turns round and says, 'But of course we are relying on you to provide the restoration and prosperity to tum the economy round, to give people jobs and to provide us with a tax base for our big spending policies. There is a vindictiveness against employers on the one hand and on the other hand a submissiveness to the union movement-both ignore the real interests of the country: Remember the shock and the horror that we all felt after the last election when the Prime Minister said with absolute conviction, as did the previous speaker, that enterprise bargaining and agreements are the way ahead for the nation, critical for jobs and prosperity and for our place in the world. He said that the primary objective of this government in this term would be to put real enterprise bargaining into place. He saw the need; he knew the truth, and he spoke it bravely until the ACTU howled. Then the government rolled over. It hesitated only long enough to askwhich way it should roll and whether it should roll once, twice or three times; The token resistance was just that-very token. Now, just eight weeks after the resulting frightful legislation was introduced, having been essentially drafted and announced not by the government but by the ACTU, we find that it has to be altered because it is not working. It was always doomed to failure. At a time when Australians need jobs, it provides disincentives for people to employ others. At a time when Australia needs a more flexible workplace; it gets in the way of effective enterprise bargaining. At a time when Australia needs to be mote productive, it places absurdities like the no disadvantage test in the way. Before the honourable member for Brisbane says, 'You are all about driving down wages and conditions,' I simply reiterate the point that workers in this country only have to consider their lot over the last 11 years. They have gone backwards and lost jobs under the current system. The poor have become poorer while the wealthy have become wealthier. It is very interesting that one group I am sure the government never expected would desert it, but which has, is the MTIA. The government has put this ridiculous unfair dismissal arrangement in the way. Bert Evans had this to say: The main perception by employers, therefore, of the new termination code is that it imposes excessive ' regulation on the employer. It requires close adherence to a procedure involving counselling, written warnings, detailed records of interview and generally becoming bogged down in a time-wasting exercise for the purpose of being able to. demonstrate to a tribunal that the employer has bent over backwards to ensure fairness in the treatment of an employee in circumstances which might lead to termination of employment. Moreover if the employer makes one small mistake in that process, there is the prospect of compensation being awarded which may run into thousands, perhaps millions of dollars. From the point of view of encouraging the employment of more .people this is, to say. the least, bad psychology, and sends the wrong kind of message to firms contemplating taking on more people. Its message is: We want you to help us reduce unemployment, but be warned-if in future you may want to terminate the services of the people you are now taking on, it may be very costly; essentially, think hard before you recruit! Mr Hawker-Who said that?",62
133,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That was from the MTIA, the long-time supporter of the government's model of a centralised systemthe club. We had quite adequate protection measures and we ought to return to what we had. What is happening now is that the opportunity for the creation of new jobs is simply being washed away. The other great problem we have in all this is that real enterprise agreements are not spreading. Again, the MTIA makes the same point. In fact, it needs to be remembered that less than 30 per cent of the private sector productive work force isunionised. It wants to be able to do things without heavy-handed interference from outside. The Queensland company Stratic Pty Ltd makes aluminium windows. It wanted an enterprise agr:eement, and it had a nonunionised work force. It signed something and everybody was happy with it. The union got involved, forced a rewriting of the enterprise agreement and partially unionised the work force at the same time. That is largely why the ACTU wanted this arrangement The company's finance director said: ""We have never had a union on site ... I have worked on site with unions. It has created a massive wall between management and. their people, and I am concerned about knocking that wall down."" That is where we must go. The first thing we have to do for industrial relations in this country is bring the decision making process back on board. The honourable member for Bennelong touched on international treaties and signing away our sovereignty. We have signed well over 2,000 of them since 1955 while the Americans have signed only 364. So we need to bring our sovereignty back here. The second thing we must do is build a real spirit of mutuality that acknowledges our need to work together and put aside the class division-the 'us and them' attitudes-that union leaders so love because it entrenches their position. We must develop a true sense of mutuality in this country if we are to move ahead. (Time expired)",64
134,Mr BEVIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I hope in the short time available to me that I am able to cover at least three of the points raised by the two speakers from the opposition-namely, productivity, the ILO and the question of conflict in industrial relations. In each of those areas, which were the main planks of their argument today, they have misinterpreted information or misled the people of Australia in their comments. I will first go to the question of productivity. The question of productivity is clearly linked to industrial relations. That fact has been recognised by the trade union movement, . employers and the government. The opposition has stated it here today; it is a statement of the obvious. I was rather intrigued by the calculations the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) made about our economic growth compared with that in the OECD. If I recall his comments correctly, he was referring to the period 1986-91. .",64
135,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The years 1987 to 1992.,64
136,Mr BEVIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He says 1987 to 1992. It is interesting that he chose to select those years. I have gone over those figures a few times in the last year or two. They certainly have not jelled in my memory as he put them today. I dug up those figures and found that.,-surprise, surprise-in the other years in which there has been a Labor government, which the honourable member for Bennelong chose to exclude from his analysis, there is a totally different picture. Let us go back to the starting date when we took office in .1983. The legacy we were left with when the honourable member, for Bennelong' was Treasurer in charge of the economic growth of this nation was a growth in GDP of 0.7 per cent. In that year, when the honourable member for Bennelong was the Treasurer with direct responsibility for these matters, the OECD average was 2.9 per cent. We were' a fraction of the OECD average when he, had personal responsibility for it. He conveniently excluded from the calculations he, presented to the parliament today those early years when we were in office. In 1984, our first year in office as a Labor government, we produced economic growth of 71f2 per cent. The OECD average was 5.2 per cent. In 1985, not a year selected by the honourable member for Bennelong, we recorded economic growth of, 4.9 per cent against an OECD average of 3.6 per cent. Let us tum to more recent years. In 1992, we had economic growth of 2.1' per cent against an OECD average of 1.6 per cent. Perhaps more important are the forecasts for the future; 'in other words, the assessment OECD has made of the impact of these new reforms that we have put in place. What will be the impact of those 'reforms as we move f9rward? How does that compare with our OECD partners? The projections for 1993 show that the assessment of the OECD was for 3.4 per cent economic growth against an OECD average of 1.2 per cent. Since this publication which I have printed, the figures have been revised upwards. The publication I have shows an expected growth in our economy in 1994 of 3.4 per cent against 11n OECD average of four per cent. So the OECD's assessment of our performance in recent years and the future shows us very much on a par with the average. If we want to make productivity the test, the other interesting comparison is to look at those countries where the sort of fundamentalist, right-wing policies that those opposite espouse have been implemented. For example, if we look at the record in the United Kingdom, where the Thatcherite policies in industrial relations are akin to those proposed here by the Liberal and National parties, we find a very interesting outcome. The United Kingdom's economic growth has been markedlybelow Australia's economic growth, virtually throughout that entire period. Its future is not looking any better. In 1992, while we were recording a substantial increase in our GDP of about two per cent, the United Kingdom was still going, backwards with a negative figure of minus one per cent. It was expected to come out of that recession in 1993 with a gr9wth of 1.3 per cent compared with the Australian performance of about three per cent In 1994, when its economy starts to pick up, it is expected to grow at 2.4 per cent. I remind the House that in the same year the OECD expects us to grow at 3.4 per cent. So the country which has most closely adopted those policies has ended up with an economic growth rate that is much worse than ours. I will quickly tum to the question of the ILO conventions and the concern about sovereignty. Last year, we enacted legislation to adopt a number of the provisions of ILO conventions which we as a nation had ratified. the These things which appear to be the cause of great heartburn to the Liberal and National parties touched on such radical proposals as equal pay for equal work. In other words, it does not matter whether people are male or female; those who do the same job get paid the same money. Many people think that has been the case in Australia for a long time. It has not, and the statistics show that it has not. Despite the fact that it was put into awards in most cases in the late 1970s, it has not been the practice because it has not been adequately addressed through the industrial relations system. So we legislated for it. We said that men and women performing equal work should get equal pay. That is one of those terrible international conventions that the opposition is riling about. Another one was maternity leave. We put in a legislative entitlement for women to take leave from their employment when having a child.' Again, it is not a radical position. But there are still cases where women in employment who fall pregnant are sacked, with the reason for their dismissal being that they are having a child. We have legislated to put an end to that. The other thing we legislated for was a minimum wage. Again, it is an area we would expect to be already covered by the industrial relations system. By my estimations, it probably will not have a great impact on many shopfloors; nevertheless, we have ensured there is now a legal minimum. The final one was fair dismissal. In federal law we gave the right to employees to have recourse against an employer for unfair dismissal. This has existed instate industrial commissions throughout the country for as long as I can recall-certainly for many decades. That provision for reinstatement and for appeal - against unfair dismissal is not a new right in Australia. It was a new provision in federal law, but it was not a new right for workers in this country. Unfortunately, it has been used as a beat-up by the opposition and by some employers in an effort to rally some support around an industrial relations agenda which it has on at least two occasions put to the Australian people ,and had rebuffed. 1I have spoken to a number of small business people in my electorate who have had concerns about this matter. They have read some of the propaganda that has been put out and not understood what the legislation provided for-or, for that matter, what the state awards already provided for. When they understand the arrangements that are in place, they do not have a problem with the legislation'. I go back to the quote that the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) read from the MTIA pamphlet. The introduction to it referred to perceptions. I agree; I think there is a perception out there that these things occur. But that perception is not matched by the reality. That perception is fostered, cultivated and fuelled by the inaccurate and inflammatory rhetoric which those opposite have pursued throughout this debate. Let me tum now to the question of conflict in industrial relations. It has been painted in this debate as a situation in which there is a class war which the government has been cultivating. Anybody who has been involved in industrial relations for more than a decade knows what nonsense that is. As someone who was involved in industrial relations under a National-Liberal government in Queensland and under a Liberal Party government here federally, I can tell the House that there was a time in the 1970s when it was confrontationist. It was all knee-jerk stuff. That· has gone. The litmus test, the statistical test, is the number of days lost in strike.· I do not have time. to go into a whole lot of the examples that I could cite of where it has been working extremely well. in companies all around the country. ' MrAnderson-That's because we've got a recession.",64
137,Mr BEVIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is nonsense. During the period in which unemployment rose under the Fraser government, the number of strikes went up. In the same years that people went out of work, the number of people on strike went up as well. That is just a nonsense argument from people who do - not understand the situation. Thefact of life is that industrial disputes now are about one-third of what they were. That is a two-thirds cut. That is not a sign of a confrontationist system; that is a sign of a mature system that this government, together with employers and the ACTU, has negotiated and has had in operation. Of course, there are plenty of examples people can cite of things going. off the rails, but by and large the system has worked damn well. It is a nonsense for the opposition to protest otherwise.

141,Mr MCARTHUR,BUSINESS,"The federal government preaches financial prudence yet continues to raise taxes, often· by surreptitious means, and spends. more on its special projects close to Labor heartland. The optimistic prediction that investment wi11 increase by 14 per cent over the next 12 months is not supported by the data that is hOW emerging. Business leaders remain un convinced that it is time to reinvest and create jobs. Likewise, world investors looking at Australia question the capacity of Australia's economy to grow at 41/2 per cent when other Western nations are growing at 21/2 per cent. Key Western economies which have had a major influence in Australia's trading pattern are showing varying degrees of growth, which supports the proposition that the sustained world recovery is yetto come to reality. The American economy grew by three per cent in the last 12 months. Likewise, the Japanese economy had almost no growth. Germany, with a11 its abundance of resources and skills, could only record a growth rate of 1.9 per the cent. China is emerging from the straitjacket of socialist control and growing at the phe-; nomenal rate of 13 per cent. But it faces considerable inflationary pressures of 13 per cent, which could bring about some major dislocations in the next two to three years. Singapore has a solidly based economy, with remarkable and sustainable growth rates of between six and 10 per cent over the last decade. India could be the quiet achiever of the Asian subcontinent. With a new financial regime directed by the erudite finance minister, Mr Manon Singh, India is moving towards a more open and competitive Western style capitalist economy. Its population of almost 900 mi11ion people provides a springOrders board for manufacturing and consumption that has often been overlooked by Western investors. The shackles of central bureaucratic government and the doctrine of socialism have been cast aside in favour of a more free enterprise and open wealth-creating attitude to running India's national affairs. The Labor government could well take heed of India's direction in developing policy initiatives for Australia to improve its living standards; The key thrust of the white paper on unemployment was to spend more money on training programs to camouflage and relocate the unemployment numbers. The white paper is a blatant attempt to make the unemployment figures look good for the next election. What the 900,000 unemployed Australians want is long-term sustainable jobs, not shortterm mickey mouse training programs from which there are no real jobs. Added to the white paper is the huge dilemma facing employers with the Brereton industrial relations legislation which has just been debated in the matter of public importance. Only now are the employers waking up to the horrendous implications of the uniondominated complex industrial relations package which discriminates against employers' ability t6 stand-down employees. Government incompetence in running the Australian economy is often the major factor in job losses, not employers. A case in point is that the Keating-led recession forced employers to sack people. least the Minister for Industrial Relations Brereton) has been forced to amend the unfair dismissal section of the legislation employers to have some confidence that if they give a job opportunity to young people then they also have the right to change the job opportunity in reasonable circumstances and changed financial arrangements. I tum to the investment climate in Australia, which the government has placed so much emphasis upon. Investment has no firm for improvement. At a time when profits are rising, interest rates are lower, demand is increasing and business confidence has imronment proved, the investment climate remains static. Unless there is a breakthrough from investment drought, a growth rate of 4.5 cent is most unlikely. If the past five years growth in investment were used as a guide, investment would only increase at cent in the coming years. All the evidence would suggest that there is a lot of faith and hope in the assumptions of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) that investment will be the key to a recovery in job prospects. In world terms, Australia's living standards are not rising at a comparable rate with other Western nations. The fun'damental question that needs to be asked is: why not? How come Australia is slipping down the standard of living ladder when the less Asian nations are rapidly climbing the ladder of economic progress and prosperity? . I tum to the observations of a conference convened by the Treasury in November 1993 to discuss the World Bank's report entitled the East Asia miracle, economic growth and public policy. This seminar focused on the eight economies of Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia Thailand to draw out some policy lessons for other economies and, of course, A1,lstralia. East Asian economies have enjoyed high and sustained rates ofgr<?\V1:h-ince the 1960s. Real growth average hasoeen about 5.5 per cent since 1965. This growth has been underAsian pinned by three key factors: firstly, high rates of investment, particularly by the privatt< sector; secondly, high and rising endowments of human capital; and, thirdly, improved At productivity. Obviously, these nations started (Mr from a very low standard of living where poverty was rife and the basic essentials were to enable of a most primitive kind. In developing a public policy to ensure continued growth, the World Bank noted that in this region the economic fundamentals of providing a stable macro-economic environment, along with a reliable legal framework to promote free enterprise activity, were very important. Obviously, in Australia, the Mabo basis High Court decision and the consequent parliamentary legislation have raised a major question over the stability of the legal envifor Australian and overseas investors. In terms of the public policy direction, the this World Bank noted that the government per intervened only when market forces had obviously failed; otherwise public policy encouraged market forces to allocate resources 8.5 per in the most efficient manner. These Asian nations were driven by a clear. government philosophy that it was important to export competitively. No real growth for the internal economy could be sustained unless export income provided the basis of this expansion. The seminar highlighted the role of central governments in cooperating with the private sector to bring about growth rather, than developing the heavy hand of bureaucratic control and authority from a well-endowed central government. Education in Asia is the springboard to improving living standards in the 21st century. Whilst the current Labor government pays lip-service to education and training in Australia, there has not been a basic cultural shift of the Australian people towards recognising the intrinsic importance of education and training as the vital cog in advancing and Australia's standard of living. Unlike Australia, the Asian nations place great 'emphasis on using their own savings to improve their productive capacity. Investment policies in East Asia relate to encouraging private investment in public infrastructure. nations try to ensure that interest rates are at the lower end of the scale to encourage genuine business opportunities. The World Bank noted that some governments introduced mandato.ry pensio.n schemes and restrictio.ns o.n co.nsumptio.n, especially the use o.f credit fo.r purely co.nsumptio.n purpo.ses. The current Australian Labo.r go.vernment co.uld well heed this lesso.n. ' Likewise, the fo.rmer state Labor administratio.ns o.f Western Australia, So.uth Australia and Victo.ria are wo.rked examples o.f .mindboggling mismanagement o.f using credit fo.r political and co.nsumptio.n purpo.ses. These go.vernments have no. regard fo.r the simple eco.no.mic lo.gic that, ifgo.vernments spend mo.re, people pay mo.re taxes and there is less mo.ney left fo.r private investment. The Wo.rld Bank understo.o.d that the Asian tigers were no.t led by such mirages o.f instant prosperity at the hands o.f bo.rro.wings appro.ved by the gno.mes o.f Zurich based o.n Australia's fabulo.us and as yet untapped reso.urces. In terms o.f labo.ur markets, Australia. is co.nstrained by a centralised wage fixing system do.minated by the unio.n mo.vement. One hundred years o.f a regulated and fixed labour market has do.ne no.thing to. create jo.bs. Ho.wever,in Asia the unregulated flexible labo.ur market has seen a high level o.f jo.b creatio.n and a much mo.re flexible wage structure. Changes to. eco.no.mic co.nditio.ns have generally been .mo.re flexible in the Asian natio.ns because o.f the labo.urmarket arrangements. In summary,the Wo.rld Bank repo.rt estimates: The high rates of investment and the rapidly growing human capital accounte9 for some 60 per cent of East Asilm growth. Efficiency gains accounted for most of the rest. Interventionist policies had limited impact. The presentgo.vernment sho.uld be aware o.f that particular po.licy po.sitio.n. The federal Treasurer co.uld well heed this advice: the expenditure o.f o.ver $6.1 billio.n o.ver the next fo.ur years in an attempt to. so.lve the unemplo.yment problem will be a fruitless exercise if the success o.f Asian natio.ns is any glide to. what sho.uld be do.ne in Australia's best interests. Pro.fesso.r Helen Hughes, who. is the directo.r o.f the full emplo.yment pro.ject spo.nso.red by the Institute o.f Applied Eco.no.mic and So.cial Research at Melbo.urne. University and the Institute o.f Public Affairs, has so.me very supportive co.mme.nts to.. make o.n the World Bankrepo.rt. Tn my view, Helen Hughes is a very sensible and respected co.mmentato.r o.n emplo.yment and i,nvestment matters .. · She makes the o.bservatio.n that Singapo.re, which she has studied sin<;e 1965, 1:tas managed to. so.lve its major unemplo.yment pro.blem. Its living standards have been transfo.rmed in o.ne generatio.n. Urban areas have, full emplo.yment. Unemplo.yment is belo.w three per cent of the wo.rkfo.rce.

Private bo.rro.wers were no.t cro.wded o.ut o.f capital markets .. As financial institutio.ns and markets were established, lo.w interest rate. po.licies were pursued. Access to. foreign funds was fo.r highly pro.ductive public and private investment and no.t fo.r co.nsumptio.n. This last view is a very key assessment o.f the success o.f the Asiannatio.ns. They did no.t bo.rro.w mo.ney from fo.reigners fo.r co.nsumptio.n purpo.ses which o.ther Western natio.ns, such as America and Australia, have do.ne to. their great disadvantage. Professo.r Hughes also. no.ted that the so.cial welfare has no.t suffered by being kept o.ut o.f the wo.rkplace .. Emphasis o.n individual respo.nsibility fo.r welfare has co.ntributed to. high savings rates. While individual savings are the basis fo.r so.cial insurance,safety nets are being built fo.r the po.o.r but they are no.t asso.ciatedwith the wo.rkplace so. that they do. no.t impede eco.no.micflexibility. The 1994 federal budget is in stark co.ntrast to. this po.sitio.n, .in that 36 per cent o.f the budget expenditure relates to. so.cial security and .welfare. As Helen Hughes so. rightly po.ints o.ut, the green and whitepapers o.n jo.bs sho.uld have po.inted the way by being abo.ut full emplo.yment-no.t abo.ut thepreservatio.n o.f unemployment. The thrust o.f the budget and the white paper is a stark reminder o.f the difference between the Australian Labo.r go.vernment and the mo.re dynamic Asian go.vernments· which are seeking po.sitive and co.nstructive metho.ds o.f creating jo.bs fo.r their people. The former Singaporian Ambassador to the United Nations, Mr Koh, sUm1Ilarised the attitude and, policy position of the Asian nations in a succinct article to the News Weekly on 15 January 1994. He espoused the 10 values that east Asia represented. The first was that east Asians believe jn the extended family, community and nation-not individualism as practised in the weSt. The second was that east Asians believe in strong families. The third was that east Asians revere education. The fourth was that east Asians believe in the virtues of savings and frugality. The fifth was that east Asians consider work a virtue. The sixth was that east Asians practise national teamwork, and unions and employers view each other as partners-not as class enemies. The seventh was that there is an Asian version of a social contract between the people and the state. The eighth point made was that Asian governments attempt to make every citizen a stakeholder of the country; for instance, 50 per cent of Singapore citizens own shares. The ninth was that east Asians' want their governments to maintain a morally wholesome environment in which to bring up their children. The final point was that good government in east Asia wants a free press but does not believe that such freedom is an absolute' right. I ask the House: can Australia learn some lessons from its successful Asian neighbours?",68
142,Mr CLEELAND,BUSINESS,"MCEwen) (5.09 p.m.)It was interesting to hear the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) talk about previous state Labor governments. I think I heard him say that state Labor governments increased expenditure which caused an increase in taxes. The honourable member for Corangamite comes from the state of Victoria and he lives in a rural area. He' should well know what is happening in Victoria. Under a state Liberal government which is applying the policies outlined in Fightback, expenditure has been drastically cut in Victoria, but taxes have gone up. Under the state Liberal government, the average family in Victoria is now paying in excess of $1,500 in additional taxes as a result of the state Liberal government's, whilst the educational services, ambulance services, kindergarten services, health services, et cetera are being slashed to bits. I not quite sure from what angle the honourable member for Corangamite is coming from. Mr MCArthur-I raised'Asia.",71
143,Mr CLEELAND,BUSINESS,"The honourable member said that Asia is the source of all our problems and that we should follow Asia. That is fascinating because Asia has massive .tariffs. The average tariff regime in Asia is 50 per cent. Obviously, those on his side of politics support theiricrease in tariffs iri Australia; He obviously supports wages of $3 anholir and he obviously supports massive cuts in education.That is where he is coming from. I will take Thailand as an example. Because of increased prosperity in Thailand and because the base wage' is starting to rise, multinational firms are leaving because their wage levels are too high. It is $5 an hour. God help us! The other problem facing the Thai economy is that it lacks education. The highly skilled industries in South-East Asia can' no longer operate because they do not have an educational base sufficient to train enough people. They do not have enough engineers, enough technologically trained people. So those opposite should not come in here and give us this nonsense about the magic pudding that is Asia. Asian countries still have major problems. We will not find any solutions to 'our problems by forcing people into poverty as many Third World countries do. That is a nonsense. I also listened, with great interest to the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). Into the debate he dragged roads-thebete noire of the National Party. He said that we have to spend more money on roads. That is fascinating. I could not help but hear what he was saying, and as I came into the chamber I thought that I must talk about roads in my speech.' ', The Commonwealth government actually increased the amount of road funding granted to Victoria. What did Victoria do with it? Some $90 million went to the public transport system; it did not go into road building at all Victoria picked up a bit of a bonus because of the changing relationship and had an excess $3 1/2 million for road funding in rural areas in Victoria. What did thegovemment do am with this extra money? It put it into consolidated revenue. I am happy to talk about roads and the approach of the National and Liberal parties towards road funding. Those opposite have a real problem because the Liberal state governments are applying the Fightback philosophy of the Australian Liberal and National parties in the states, and Victoria is the classic example. ' The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) talked about debt, taxes and the deficit-exactly 'the policies of Mr Jeffrey Kennett and Mr Stockdale in Victoria; When in opposition in 1992 the current ViCtorian government campaigned strongly and attacked the level of debt in Victoria. That is exactly what those opposite are doing, It said that it was going to cut debt. Since being in government; it has added $2.5 billion to the Victorian debt level. Why? It did this to sack people; In effect, it borrowed $2.5 billion and put 50,000 people in the public sector out of work. That is what those opposite support. tUs all in Hghtback. The Victorian government has borrowed money to sack people. What happened to the $2.5 billion worth of nonsense. ' redundancies? A billion dollars has gone to Queenslimd., At no cost Queensland picked up the skilled management people that have been sacked by Kennett and Stockdale.' As well it will have the benefit of their redundancy packages. Victoria i's nOw faced with the additional debt of $2.5 billion,. These are marvellouseconomics--really brilliant! . ,Those opposite speak a lot of nonsense when it comes to debt. They can read. They are not illiterate. They know that Australia has the lowest public sector debt in the that OECD. Why can they not stand inthi's House and admit that public sector debt in Australia is low in any comparative sense, We have a high non-public sector debt, but who is to health. responsible for that? It is the mates of those opposite who are responsible. The private bu'dget? sector does the borrowing, not the government. The high debt level is not government debt. It is the opposition's mates who borrow the money, not the 'government. 'Those opposite should not talk about public sector debt when they know it is the lowest in theOECD. In fact; if we take the gold reserves into account, the, Commonwealth is in credit. Those opposite should talk common sense, in this place, not nonsense. "" "" The deficit is verY' important Those oppos::' ite want a lower deficit, but they will not tell the Australian ,public what they ai-egoing to cut They kflow and I know that if we willit to lower the deficit we have to reduce services. We have to sack people, as the Victorians do, or we have to reduce education, health' standards or benefits to the unemployed. That is whatthey are on about. That is what happens when the deficit is reduced. That is what has happened ,in Victoria. They have ripped info all of those areas. They have ripped into education, the ambulance serviceMrMCArthur-There is no credit left:",71
144,Mr CLEELAND,BUSINESS,"The honourable member says there is no credit left. H- cannot even read the Victorian budget. The Victoria government is running a $400 million surplus this year and it is still cutting services and still putting people out of work. That is the policy of Fightback. He should not talk What have they done with the deficit in Victoria? Education is a good example. In 1991-92 total Victorian government spending on education was $4.625 billion. This fell to $3.22 billion in 1992-93, a 30 per cent fall. It is projected to fall further to $3.087 billion in 1993-94, a further four per cent fall. What is the effect of that? The honourable member should know, because he comes from a rural area. Fifty rural schools have been dosed and there are still more to come. But that is okay; is iriline with Fightback. That is in line with the philosophy' of, the 'opposition - cut the deficit; close rural schools down. Let us have a look at what the Victorians have done ' Mr MCArthur--What about the federal",72
145,Mr CLEELAND,BUSINESS,"To cut the federal deficit, we have to cut services as well. Those opposite are quite happy to do that. Do they not understand that if they, do not spend money they cut things? To cut deficits-, MrMCArthur-You are a big taxer.",72
146,Mr CLEELAND,BUSINESS,"I thank the honourable member for his interjection. I am happy argue the issue of tax. Those opposite do seem to understand that the. only way to meas-re· tax in comparative. terms is as a percentage of gross domestic product. It is only constant. measurement of tax revenue. Let us have a look at what the Labor government has done; It has reduced the percentage of tax to gross domestic product every year it has been in government. As a result Australia, .in comparative. terms, is lowest taxed country in the OECD. I know leaders those opposite do not like that,but it is a we have to learn to live with. We are now lowest taxed country in the. OECD. Tax as percentage of GDP will fall as a result of budget. If those opposite cannot get it through their thick heads and understand that this the way to measure tax, then I am sorry them. It is wrong that they go out and tell lies and try to convince",73
147,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Mr Rocher)Order!,73
148,Mr CLEELAND,BUSINESS,"I did not refer to a relentless particular member, Mr Deputy Speaker, would have withdrawn the comment immediately. It is wrong that they tell lies about level of tax when they know it is. not true .. It others. is just not on, Taxes, as a percentage of domestic product, are falling. Those opposite come into this House and try to raise.taxes a. problem. That must mean that they would decrease taxes. After listening to the speeches of the shadwill ow Treasurer, the Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser)-the shadow minister for financepublic the. honourable member· for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for forests. Corangamite, my understanding is that the opposition's. policy m-st be to cut taxes. they will not tell us what taxes they are going to cut. We know they are going to cut taxes, which will reduce revenue. So their first policy is to reduce revenue. The next thing they will do is reduce the deficit. Opposition speakers have said today that the deficit is too high. They will cut taxes, which will mean a cut in revenue. Their next policy is to cut' the deficit. To do that they will have to cut expenditure. It seems me that we are going down the .Victorian to path. We can expect cuts ineducatiohand not cuts in health services. Will anyone in the opposition tell us what they will cut? No, but I live in hope. Then they say that they are the going to cut debt. We have the lowest debt in theOECD; I am not quite sure how they are going to cut it. So they ate going to reduce debt levels, reduce taxes and reduce the deficit. That. is what Fightback said. Those opposite are telling us all· the time the that Fightback is dead, but whenever· any of the opposition parties speak in this fact House they refer to what Fightback says. The the honourable member for Corangamite, who is a so supportive of these proposals,should be a this . little concerned when he looks at what is happening in rural hospitals in Victoria. In the is Australian on 3.0 May 1994, Mr Buntine, the for Senior Vice-President· of the Australian Association of Surgeons, had this to say about Victorian hospi taLservices: Victorian pUblic hospitals, both metropolitan and rural, are close to breaking point due to a continued reduction of their budgets following the or I introduction of ""casemix funding"". All Victorian public hospitals have suffered· but the some have been more seriously affected than gross The AMA in Victoria has reported that it expects 50. rural hospitals to close. Mrs Tehan as is suggesting around 20 rural hospitals. The net effect of the opposition's policies, as applied by Stockdale. and Kennett. in Victoria, be that we will lose jobs in local government and in rural hospitals. We have lost jobs in rural schools. We have lost jobs in niral administration, in the department of conservation and in the area of lands and There have been massive job cuts in those areas in all rural parts of Victoria. For But what pqrpose is this done? Already the· Victorian budget is running in surplus. It has a $400 million surplus this year, if we take away the bodgie accounting and the $1.4 billion Public Service superannuation transfer. Mrs Bishop-To hear a member from Victoria talking about bodgie bottom lines is ajoke. .",73
149,Mr CLEELAND,BUSINESS,I do not think you to should interrupt. The only thing thicker than your skin is your head.' Do not> interrupt in here.,73
150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Mr Rocher)Order! That is unparliamen-ary.,74
151,Mr CLEELAND,BUSINESS,"I withdraw. I must say that that was courtesy of Senator Gareth Evans. Nevertheless, what the opposition says is an absolute nonsense. Quite frankly, what members of the opposition have said in the speeches they have made in this place today is clearly in line with Fightback. It is clearly in line with a philosophy and policy which will reduce taxes, reduce the deficit, reduce debt and which will cause massive job losses to the public sector in Australia. Mrs Bishop-No, to create jobs. You. created the job losses.",74
152,Mr CLEELAND,BUSINESS,"Mr Kennett has not created any jobs-I can tell those opposite that. Have a look at Victoria: 70,000 jobs have gone as a direct result of the application of Kennett's policies. Why do those opposite not have some honesty and go out and support these policies? Tell the Australian people-no cliches-what they are going to cut, what jobs are going, what service is going to be cut. What we have heard from the opposition in this House today has been nothing but nonsense, nothing but dodging the truth, nothing but fudging on where it stands on debt reduction, deficit reduction and taxes. When we get some policies out of the opposition-we know we will probably not see any policies because the present leader says, 'Do not expect policies from me. We are going to talk about generalities. We are going to sit back and say nice cliches.' The honourable member opposite talked about cliches today in her maiden speech. The opposition does not talk about positive actions. We do not know where it stands on any of these cuts. We are more than happy as an opposition-correction, as a governmentMr Bruce Scott-It won't be long. It's not long away now.",74
153,Mr CLEELAND,BUSINESS,"The opposition has been saying that since 1984 and I am still here. It managed to roll me once in 1990 but, good heavens, that only lasted three years and I am back to annoy it again. I can tell the opposition that I will be here for a long time yet to annoy it. I do not mind who it throws at me. We will quite happily debate the opposition on policy. But, please, get 'some; I ask the opposition to bring in sOll)epolicies so that we can at least debate it on policy instead of cliches. That is all we have heard in this debate today.. The honourable member for Bennelong knows. what I am talking about. He is a policy. man. He must feel very lonely on the front bench at the moment.",74
154,Mr HOWARD,BUSINESS,I have never understood anything you have said.,74
155,Mr CLEELAND,BUSINESS,That is because you . never listen. We ask the opposition to bring forward some policies so that we can at least have a decent debate in this place for once.,74
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"Mr Rocher)Order! Before 1 call the honourable member for Warringah, I remind the House that this is his first speech in the chamber. I ask honourable members to extend to him the usual courtesies.",74
157,Mr ABBOTT,BUSINESS,"On the corner of Castlereagh and Hunter streets in Sydney stands a monument to mark the site of the first Christian service in Australia. The preacher, the Reverend Richard Johnson, took as his text: 'What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me?' It is just a small stone obelisk hardly noticed by the thousands of passers-by and dwarfed' by skyscrapers, yet its message of faith and hope is fundamental to our nation's success and the key to Australia's future. The congregation at that first service was poorer, sicker, and less trained than any conceivable group of modern Australians, yet there was nothing small about what they were to achieve. Our challenge, 200 years later, is to have hearts that are just as big. So at this opening of my time in parliament, I place on record my deep conviction that, nourished by the past and inspired by our great ideals, there is no limit to what Australia can achieve. Also, I want to record my deep conviction that our Australian story should fill our hearts with pride and our eyes with tears. It is a story of the dispossessed and the outcast, redeemed through the innate goodness of humanity-'-a society challenged by nature; tested by war, enlarged by other cultures and blessed. by such· peace, prosperity and tolerance that we are now the envy of the earth. . Almost 100 years ago, the founders of our constitution· echoed Richard·Johnson's sense of gratitude when they instituted this mighty Commonwealth, yet they declared themselves, in the words of our constitution, to be' humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God'. We have so much, yet almost everything we have . we owe to someone else. If I can achieve anything at all in this place,. I will owe it to the people of Warringah who have sent me her-. If I can amount to anything at all in our national life, I will be indebted to my great predecessors whose shoes lstruggle to fill: Michael MACKellar, who stood for the humane and the decent; Edward St John, who never shirked a fight in a good cause; and Sir Percy Spender, one of our greatest statesmen and international public servants. Bounded by water on three sides,boasting some of Sydney's largest tracts of urban bushland, containing a significant concentration of high technology industries, often set in green and open parks, Warringah is almost a Garden of Eden. Mackellar might be God's own country but. Warringah is God's. own garden. So it is my job to make more perfect what is already one of the best places in the world to live. In particular, it is my job first to help Warringah's. 13,000 families with children who are heavily burdened by government policies and, second, to help find a solution to our transport problems which mean that Warringah is indeed the best place in the world to live, but only until you need to go somewhere else. When authority first came to the Warringah district, the· inhabitants showed what they thought of government policies by spearing Governor Phillip in the shoulder. I hope I can be a similar goad to government, at least until such time as government serves my electorate better. One of the depressing features of modem Australia is the low esteem in which governments· and politicians are generally held. . . Shortly after the by-election, some kind supporter gave me polling data which ranked the ethics and honesty of various occupations. Lawyers rated 30 per cent for ethics and honesty; stockbrokers ranked 15 per cent; and I was terrified to see that federal parliamentarians ranked just 10 per cent. Notwithstanding this, I feel very honoured to be here because newspaper journalists-my previous tradescored just eight per cent. . Perhaps we politicians have mostly ourselves to blame because we have neglected what government does well to indulge in what government. does badly. The best way to restore politicians' standing is to have governments which meddle less and lead more; to have governments which stick to their traditional job of providing transfer payments and sponsoring national development but which stop playing the busybody in every nook and cranny of·society. Above all, we need governments which believe in Australia and Australians as much as in the trappings of office, the dictates of ideology or the minutiae of policy. Loss of faith is a social problem extending far beyond politics and fat beyond Australia. Throughout the Western world we are living through a pandemic of doubt and introspection in which people are questioning their God, their country and even themselves. Nothing is safe from the corrosive cynicism of modem times: neither political goodWill nor institutional benevolence nor even parentallove. Our challenge is to answer uncertainty with conviction and to refute doubt with faith. This is not a matter of logical argument. No-one can be persuaded to believe. People must be· inspired to believe; they must be pieked up· and carried· along by other peo. . ple--'-people who believe with heart and soul that no defeat is final, no unhappiness permanent and no evil invincible. Modem Australia is rightly concerned about unemployment, crime, family breakdown and social disintegration. But we are becoming preoccupied with problems and not answers. We must see each problem in its true setting: unemployment together with the new opportunities of abetter trained work force; crime against the background of the greater complexity of modem life; family pressure against the higher expectations of people living longer; and social alienation against greater individual rights. It is absolutely vital that we Australians keep seeking solutions to all the difficulties in our homes, workplaces and neighbourhoods. But the real antidote to fear is hope, and the difference between despair and confidence is often just the very decision to try to make a difference-a decision based on a balanced appreciation of our true position. . For the first 180 years or so of our national life, Australian government was an exercise in nation building. Government directed work gangs, encouraged settlers·and rewarded explorers. In more modem times, government has launched the immigration program, which has helped to make our society so diverse arid exciting; it has established the Snowy Mountains Scheme, which powers our cities and waters our farms; it has funded the universities, which are the basis of our technological edge; and it has sponsored much ·of the national development, which is the foundation of our prosperity. Yet some time in the recent past Australian government developed a strange affliction. Since Labor came to power in 1983, government has become a means for applying bandaids to social problems rather than an instrument for giving cohesion and purpose to our national life. Our government has policies to bring peace to. Cambodia and to keep Antarctica clean. It has policies for unemployment and for making the sick well and· the lame walk. But it has only bits arid pieces of a policy to ensure that our nation will enter the next century in better shape than it is now. The government is like a householder who keeps fixing walls and mending floors, in a medley of styles often entirely at odds with the original design, plastering up the cracks without working out how the foundations are constantly shifting. ,. In the quest to solve social problems, government reaches into our schools,our workplaces and even our bedrooms. Government tells us what we should think, whom we should like and how we should feel. But it has by and large given up trying to touch our hearts and make us realise that we Australians are a great people with a great destiny.. The best that this government . can .do to· lift people's gaze above the humdrum is tear a comer off the flag, undermine the Crown and attack the very constitution itself. This is the opposite, the absolute opposite of nation building, because ·it is guaranteed to tear Australians apaq .rather than bring us together. Yet there is no mystery in Australia's needs or voters' wants- There is no secret about what governments should do. As Edmund Burke said; governments are human contrivances to satisfy human wants. People expect governments to work-and I hope honourable members opposite recognise theseliries--'-'for the betterment of mankind, not just here but wherever we can lend a helping hand', as Ben Chifley said in .his 'light on the hill' speech. There are some things which only individuals can do; there are other things which only governments can do; and there, are many things which people can dobetter,provided governments help. So let people run their own lives and let government do what individuals cannot. I stand for active government, not big government I stand for .government which gets off people 's backs, not government which opts out of the future because it cannot face hard decisions. I stand for· government which backs Australia's families with 'real policies and not just platitudes. Th-s government says that 'it is in· favour of the family, all the time pursuing policies which make family life harder to sustain. At present, for instance, a single taxpayer on $30,000 a year aftertax has about $445 a week to live on. A taxpayer on the same $30,000 a year but with - dependent spouse and two dependent children has just $495 a week to live on-and that is after tax,after the dependent spouse rebate and after family allowance. In other words, three extra people to clothe, feed, house, educate' and transport and just $50 a week extra with which to, do it. Family policy needs to begin with a rec()gnition that our existing tax and welfare system turns middle income families with children into Australia's new poor. Families are best helped not by argument over· definitions but by policies which help the children-the children who. are this co.untry's greatest asset ando.ur .mo.stgo.lden ho.pe. . One way to. help families with children is to change the tax system to. take acco.urit o.f taxpayers' responsibilities as well as their inco.me. A fami1y-friendly tax system stresses se1f-help and individual responsibility. But the pro.blem with inco.me splitting, at least in ,its simplestfo.rm between husband and wife,is that it helps highiilco.meearners mo.re than lo.w inco.meearnersand co.uples witho.ut dependants as much as the.se with.the respo.nsibility fo.r children. While vo.ters have sho.wn an innate mistrust o.f radical change to. the tax system, everyo.ne understands and hardly anyo.ne o.bjects to. a cash payment So. o.ne alternative to. inco.me splitting is to. raise the current level o.f family allo.wances to. such an extent that they beco.me, in reality, a family wage; in o.ther. wo.rds, to. pay. the principal carers o.f children a substantial sum far in excess o.f current family allo.wance, a sum which ackno.wledges the realco.st o.f raising children. Paying. the principal carer a family wage o.f, fo.r argument's sake, $100 a weekfo.r the first child. wo.uld virtually co.ver the Co.st of child care, if the principal carer wanted to. co.ntinue in the paiQ wo.rk fo.rce. Alternatively, if the principal carer preferred to.' be a full-time mo.theror father, $100 a week wo.uldmake a big difference to. the family budgetand quite po.ssibly eliminate the need· for both parents to. wo.rk just to. make ends meet , Many have a philo.so.phical preference fo.r tax splitting rather than a cash payment. But a family wage is quite different from welfare. It is a reco.gnitio.n· o.f respo.nsibilities, no.t need. It is a payment fo.r services, no.t a hando.ut. It means that perso.nal cho.ice co.uld replace eco.no.mic necessity as a Tl,ltio.nale family - ecisio.ns. One beauty o.f a family wage system, unlike a tax rebate, is thl,lt it wo.uld take o.ne public servant, just o.ne, and a co.mputer to. administer. Payments wo.uld start the mo.ment a birth is reco.rded o.n .the Registrar o.fBirths, Deaths and Marriages database and finish. 16 years later. The budgetary Co.st o.f introducing a family wage o.f $100 a week fo.r the first child and $30 a week fo.r each subsequent child wo.uld be abo.ut$7.5 billio.n a year. It is wo.rth remembering that this . was the approximate size o.f Labo.r's One Natio.n perso.nal inco.me tax cuts, which were to. be funded entirely o.ut o.feco.no.micgrowth. The Co.st o.f no.t providing mo.re help fo.r families is mo.re family breakd.o.wn; greater call o.nthe welfare system, increased cdme and further so.cial instability. The vast majo.rity o.f families wo.uld be much better o.ff under a family wage policy. Fo.r in-tance, a family with three children o.n $30,000 a year no.w receives just $30 a week in family allo.wance. Under a family wage po.licy, this family wo.uld receive $160 a week. The vast majo.rity o.f families, the.se with two. o.r fewer children, wo.uld be mo.re than $90 a week better o.ff.. It is po.ssible to. help families in ways which invo.lve no. radical surgery to. o.ur system, ways which are financially respo.nsible and ways which avo.id debilitating debate abo.ut definitio.ns. But it takes a go.vernment that is co.mmitted to. the lo.ng-term welfare o.fso.ciety to. do. so. rather thana go.vernment which is preo.ccupied with the short-term management o.f pressure groups. Go.vernments which live in fear o.f to.mo.rro.w'sheadline are incapable o.f any change-even change which gives the o.verwhelming majo.rity o.f Australians exactly what they want. It is abundantly clear, fo.r instance, that the people o.f Warringah are heartily sick o.f clo.gged roads. So. I co.ngratu. late the New So.uth Wales transpo.rt minister, Bruce Baird,fo.r establishing a co.mmittee to. investigate alternatives and to. reco.mmend a so.lutio.n. It seems that a ro.adtunnel under Military Ro.ad with a better crossing at The Spit can be built with just $30 millio.n o.f taxpayers' mo.ney. By co.ntrast, the mo.st fo.r publicised mass transit system is estimated to. require a taxpayer subsidy o.f so.me . $600 millio.n and is predicated o.n higher po.pulatio.n densities in the peninsula. It wo.uld. be a tragedy fo.r the people o.f Warringah if an . anti-car mentality sto.pped develo.pment which wo.uld help all Warringah co.mmuters, including the.se who. travel o.n public transpo.rt, especially if that develo.pment do.es no.trequire any extension o.f medium o.r high density ho.using to be financially viable and does not preclude the construction of a mass transit system. The government's job is not to lay rails, shift and pour concrete. The government's job is to make necessary development happen. Say the word and private enterprise will do the job and very possibly build and operate huge infrastructure projects at no cost to the taxpayer. Australians rightly object to higher taxes because they observe that most government spending disappears down a bottomless well. Government often seems like an evening out-it costs a fortune and in the morning there is little to show for all the expense. But it is my hunch that people would be less hostile to paying tax if they were more confident they were investing in lasting assets rather than $200,000 carports, $170,000 barbecues and $63,000 bicycle accidents. For most of Labor's decade, we have enjoyed the day by mortgaging the m01Tow. The $6.5 billion currently spent servicing the Commonwealth government's own debt could pay for a host of national development projects, including a Warringah mass transit system. Mr Speaker, standing before you in this chamber, which is heir to 700 years of parliamentary tradition, I feel like a very small boy in a very big school. To my parents and to my grandparents;. to my sisters, who have made me what I am; to my wife, my mainstay; to my priceless friends; to my party, which has given me the privilege. to serve, I give my heartfelt th;mks. To the Jesuits who first encouraged an ideal of public service; to Bob Santamaria, who sparked my interest in politics; to several editors, who honed my way with words; to John Hewson, who introduced me to this place; and to John Howard, who has been the contemporary politician I admire most, I hope I can be true to the principles you taught. May God and the ghosts of great men give me strength. May those who have laboured greatly to build this nation fortify my resolve to make a worthy contribution in this House. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",74
158,Mr DODD,BUSINESS,"I take this ·opportunity to congratulate the. honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) for his· first speech in this House, The budget and the white paper are good for Australia,are earth good for my electorate of Leichhardt, are certainly goq4 for·the Far North Queensland rtfgion of Australia and.are certainly g0q4 for the future genlerations. of Australians . and world visitors who will visit .my electorate because the budgetcqntained .a. Daintree rescue package which provided something of a sustainable future for all Australians. In speaking to the Daintree rescue package in the budget I take the opportunity to congratulate the new Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories; Senator Faulkner, who has done an excellent job in bringing this package to fruition- It is something that not only Senator Faulkner is concerned about but also I know the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself has a great deal of commitment to. He has visited the region and the particular area that is under threat. T know that· the Prime Minister has· a particular commitment to save this region of my electorate. I must also pay tribute to the cooperation of Mr Mike Berwick, the mayor of the Douglas shire, for his work in this area. . But why did we have to reScue the Daintree in this budget anyWay? The reason is that a vital area of the wet tropics region was not listed and included in the wet tropics. The National Party government, the notorious Bjelke-Peterseil government, in the 1980s allowed' subdivisions in the Cow Bay and Alexandra Bay· area. After that, . parts of the area were advertised-and are still advertised today-to 'Buy your own piece of rainforest'. Many well-meaning people actually did that. Subsequent events· meant that the Commonwealth government has had to act. The Commonwealth government is totally. committed to the preservation Of the wet tropics region of Far North Queensland. The Daintree region can be considered as the birthplace of the world's flowering plants. It was from this region that the world's flowering plants evolved and then spread to the rest of the planet. I think the people in this House have seen posters and films of the natural beauty of. the' wet· tropics of Far North Queensland, if they have not already visited it themselves, and I know that many honourable members have visited it. Everyone is aware that this is where the rainforest meets the reef; Rainforests are very significant, not just for all these reasons. In addition, thebiodiversity of rainforeSts is also importantto preserve the world's gene pool. The Labor government has been committed to preserving the Far North Queensland wet tropics rainforest. Most importantly, in 1988 the whole region was nominated for. World Heritage listing. That again was opposed by the National Party. Subsequently, the Commonwealth with the Queensland government set up the World Heritage Management Authority. The Commonwealth has previously given $1.5 million to the authority for· the purchase of seven properties and the redevelopment of the Alexandra range lookout. So we had previously made thesec9mmitments before this budget. We also funded the reconstruction of the Cape Tribulation road i!l an environmentally responsible and sustainable manner. The World Heritage listing was so successful that it now can be said that the wet tropics, in particular the area north of the Daintree to Cape Tribulation, is being loved to death. The road, which had to be sealed for environmental reasons as much as anything else, will obviously increase visitor traffic. InfrastruchIre-such as roads,walking tracks, toilets and interpreting facilities-has not kept up with the rapid visitor growth in the area .. Since the World Heritage listing it has been increasingly clear that there is a hole in the heart of the wet tropics-that is, the Cow Bay and Alexandra Bay area that I referred towhere small pockets of enormous ecological significance are vulnerable. Visitors to the wet tropics-visitors from overseas and other parts of Australia-are horrified by the 'For sale' signs right along the Cape Tribulation road and especially in that area. As I said earlier, the people who moved into that area in the 1980s are generally committed environmentalists. They did not move into that area to destroy it. Nevertheless, we do need a rescue package in that area, and I congratulate the government on its initiative in the budget. But; importantly, the rescue package will not only have money for infrastructure and buyback-it is not just a buyback scheme-but also look towards cooperative agreements involving the Douglas Shire Council, the wet tropics and landholders. Suggestions have been made that there may be a possible rebate given on rates in relation to preserving the area. Currently, the reverse occurs: you can reduce your rates by clearing the land. That is not a situation which ought to continue. I think that the chairman of the Douglas shire, Mr Mike Berwick, is aware of that. This package. is of enormous signi ficance. It is important that the rescue package and the fine detail of it be finally determined with community consultation. The Commonwealth has provided $20,000 to the Douglas Shire Council to develop strategies for this region. The package has the overwhelming support of the people in the. region. It was totally supported by the Daintree Rainforest Chamber of Commerce. It is worth quoting a letter that was written to the Cairns Post by Dr Hugh Spencer, which appeared in last Saturday'S edition. Dr Spencer is a tireless worker for the preservation of the rainforest and is the Director of the Australian Tropical Research Foundation at Cape Tribulation. It is worth reading his response into Hansard because it is very significant: We can only hope springing from this most welcome developmel]tand he means the rescue packagethat the next major change in the new and improved Daintree will be a heightened sense of community, which will give strength to those fearing the proposed tourist onslaught, and perhaps bring out the enormous wealth of skills and knowledge that lies hidden in the region. In this regard, the efforts of Ross Craig, headmaster of the Alexandra school, should get wide 'Support. I would endorse that notion. It can be seen that the decision to fund the rescue package in the budget was a mOst significant one. It is one that has obtained praise for the government from the conservation movement right throughout Australia. It is one that has obtained .praise for the government right throughout my electorate because there is a general· consensus in my electorate on the importance that the preservation of the wet tropics region, and in particular that region north of the Daintree River, has for· the tourism industry. There is an enormous amOl,mtof tourist interest in that area. People come to Far North Queensland to· visit the Great Barrier Reef, but increasingly they are also coming to yis.it the wet tropics region. Tht':budget,not o-ly because of the rescue package but a]so .beCause. of the general. of tl,.e white paper, . is very good for my electorate in terms. of regional development. The white paper, as I said, provides an excellent blueprint for future regi()nal development in Australia:. The recent MCKinsey report and the Kelty report referred to the growth that has occurred in Far North Queensland. There is no' doubt about that, and I think that the government ought to take credit for it. It is interesting that people are very quick to blame the federal government for the regional , decline in some areas of Australia. The converse of that, of course, is that the government should be congratulated on encouraging development in Far.North Queensland through the Daintree rescue package, which has encouraged sustainable development in Far North Queensland. The prospects are that the white paper will continue that sustainable development. Both. the MCKinsey and the Kelty reports highlight the need for future infrastructure development in Far North Queensland. Compared toothe!,' regions, in some ways we are very well served. Everyone knbws about the Cairns airport. The MCKinsey report highlights the reason why Cairns has such a progressive and vigorous international airport. It is because of the work' that took place between all sectors of the community: the Far North Queensland Promotion Bureau, the local cOUlicils- and the chamber of commerce. In the 1980s the whole community got behind getting an airport for Cairns.·There was public sector involvement; the airport is still run the port authority. Some people say it is privatised airport; I am not sure whether is a proper description of it but it is certainly not run· by the FAC. It may provide a model in the future for other airport development Australia. As I say, I am not sure whether isa privatised airport, because the public sector has been a vital part of its developonly ment.. The MCKinsey . report highlights the good things we have, but it also highlights the need for future infrastructure development in Far North Queensland, as did the Kelty report. . Obviously,the roads in my electorate are not good. There is still need. for development of the Bruce Highway to .Cairns and in the thrust north of my electorate, in the Cape York Peninsula. Only a couple of weeks ago I was in the Torres . Strait islands; where the roads are appalling, so there is still need for road developmeht-We have good port' facilities but they constantly need to be. kept 'up to date with the rest of Australia. That is also important. Both Kelty and MCKinsey-remember that the MCKinsey report is not just some sort of academic subjective report by some. pie-in the-sky academic; it was formed by talking to business people-highlighted the need in Far North Queensland for educational facilities and cultural facilities. I am very pleased to note that today there was an announcement about the plans for the new convention centre in Cairns. A convention centre is very important not only for the future development of the tourism industry in Far North Queensland but also for the cultural development of Far North Queensland. The other point that I usually try to include in every. speech I make in this House is the importance of the development of the Smithfield campus of James Cook University in Cairns. It is very important that Cairns develop its own university campus for the reasons I have said-ncit just for edudttional reasons but for the cultural spin-off that is brought to a region by a university. All these things make the future for the region that I represent look very rosy indeed. Those .doomsayers in the opposition who keep on saying that Australia is going down a path by towards economic decline ought to look at a Far North Queensland, ought to look at the that cooperation that is highlighted by the MCKinsey· report between the private sector . and the public sector, and ought to look at the in growth and optimism that is shown by busi,. it ness in the region. In conclusion, I totally support the bill before the House because not the budget but also the white paper will provide it foundation for Australia's continued growthJnto .the next century. . MrCOBB (Parkesj(6.00 p-m.)-I guess when' we all heard'the Treasurer(Mr Willis) deliver his first hlldget this year we filed out of the.House thjnking it'was a well politically cTilfted hudg,et' that handed arouhd a lot of money' and did not upset any people. When we got pack to our rooms and started to arialysewhatthe budget meant, we got ,a totally different, picture. To me"" ihis year's budget.is the most dishonest and, deceptive budget I have ever seen. I' would like to illustrate that point. In the opening paragraph of the budget the Treasurer said: The Budget that I present tonight will ... reduce the budget deficit, without increasing taxes. On page 2 he again talked about not increasing taxes when he said that in achieving tpe budget deficit outcome 'we haVe not in': creased general taiation'. , Mr Bruce Scott,-He misled ,the parliament. ' Mr COBB--'-Ido not think we could get anything plainer than that. In the next' sentence he said: This Budget contains no new taxes and no es in tax rates. In the following sentence he said: The only measunis which add to reVenue are those which improve tax ""compliance, ot are directly related to cost recovery for government services. In that sentence we can see that he is already starting to shift ground. We got back to our rooms and we read thatPAYE tax collections this coming year will' increase by a very substantial 8.1 per cent, that sales tax coIlec- departure tax;; tions will increilse by eight or 10 per cent and that fringe benefits tax will increase this year by an absolutely massive $1,830inillion-an increase of 131 per cent. If that is not a tax increase- I do not know what is. This budget is riddled with tax increases. In fact, the increased tax collections this year will be the greatest in a decade or more. It is quite staggering that the Treasurer, who we thought was a person of someintegrity,can fall so - hort on' his promises in the fir!)t couple of ,pages. I can point to numerous tax increases. On pageD of the budget statement the Treasurer. said: ... this Budget increases cost recovery by ,$25.3 million, via an increase in the excise on avgas and avtur ... These' fuels are used particularly in country areas of Australia. That increase will put upward pressure on airline ticket prices for airlines suth as Hazelton that fly into my electorate, and it will putupward pressure on freight increases where goods aretraiisported bYait-,:-a a,ear increase in a tax, if ever there was one. The Treasurer onpagei20fhis speech said: '. "", . From 1 Jamiary . '1995 the departure taxthis is on people flying out of Australia---, will be replaced by a $27, charge for international passengers . . . The charge is presently $25 and it is going up to $27 - a clear increase in tax. I guess that is a fairly minor increase. After the performance of the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) in question time today, where he clearly misled the House, I went back to see what he said about this. Would honourable members believe-I have'his press release here-that . on the very same day the budget was brought increasdown, 10 May 1994, he put out a press "" release? Guess how the press release is headed-' Abolition of departure tax'. We had just heard from the Treasurer in the budget that the departure tax was to be increased from $25 to $27 and the minister issued a press. release,' on .the' very same day, headed 'Abolition of departure tax'. I will readthe first two paragraphs: The Federlll Minister for Tourism, Michael Lee, today welcomed the Budgetdecision to abolish the , .' Mr Bruce ScoH..., - He increased it.",78
159,Mr COBB,BUSINESS,"For heaven's sake, he has increased it. He went on to say: It will be replaced by a new international passenger ' movement charge. which will be more convenient for tra ve llers. Perhaps it will be more convenient for travellers, but to head his press release 'Abolition of departure tax' is nothing more nor less than dishonest and deceptive. There is a classic example of where the Treasurer and the Minister for Tourism, I believe, have misled the House. In the area of health, the Treasurer, on page 9 of his speech, said: ... a furtherthis is not ongoing expenditure--'$500 million will be provided over five years expand and extend Aboriginal health programs. Let us be quite clear about this: a further $500 million will be provided to expand and extend Aboriginal health programs .. What is the .clear impression left in the minds of members of this chamber and the Australian people after a statement like that? Access Economics has done an analysis of this supposed extra $500 million for the Australthis? Ian Medical Association and others have their own analysis. One estimate. by Access Economics is that about $415 million of that is just ongoing expenditure. When we take out this little fiddly announcing the figure over five ye-rs and reducing it down· to one year, the $85.5 million extra comes down to $17.1 million in one year. I even read another analysis that $12 million out of the $17 million had been pinched from the health budget. We had Senator Richardson, as he then was, on night after night travelling northern Australia to find out for the first time what conditions were like in AbOriginal camps around Australincreased is, all but weeping tears of blood saying this is a dis-grace for Australia. After 10 years in government, he was saying that this was disgrace. There is no doubt it $1,087 million over five years. Of course, when he stepped out of the job and handed over to the present Minister for Health Lawrence), it was to be $800 million over five years. That was soon watered down the Expenditure Review Committee to $300 million. Then the Prime Minister (Mr million. Keating) stepped in because it was becoming so embarrassing and it was artificially lifted to this level of $500 million, which turns to be about $85 million over five years or million extra a year. One would think after all this hoo-ha and fanfare that something would be done propercent ly for· Aboriginal health. Not only has· this government ditched the original proposal that it received an the credit for but it has created a very cruel illusion amongst Aboriginal people that there is going to be extra money spent. The first National Indigenous Conference on· Alcohol and Drug Abuse to be held in Australia cried out for assistance and asked the government what it could do. What did to the government come up with? It came up with absolutely no support whatsoever. What is the crux of Aboriginal health in this country compared with the health of the rest of us? A figure that highlights it more than any other is the fact that young Aboriginal males have a death rate 10 times higher than the comparable group in society. Why is If we had to pull out one cause, I guess done everybody in this chamber would turn to alcohol and substance abuse. Here we have the first National Indigenous Conference on Alcohol and Drug Abuse being given no support when it was asked for. I think the trick of government falls down there. Another cruel illusion in the Treasurer's speech was in the area of medical research and breast cancer. In many ways, this was the cruellest hoax of all. Again, most of us filed out of the chamber with the impression that TV many more millions of dollars-if not hundreds of millions of dollars-would be spent on a major attack on.breast cancer with funding for research. One figure that mentioned was $209 million over four years for a national breast cancer program. Again, a when we look at the figures, we see that it is is. He promised a cruel deception. During 1994 the National Health and Medical Research Council will receive (Dr $117.11 million. Next year that will be boosted to $127 million once the ongoing by funding component is taken out. So it is barely getting another $9 million or $10 When .inflation is taken into account and the fact that it cannot even keep up with the administration costs, virtually not one out more real dollar will be spent in this area. $17 The people of Australia have been deceived; At present we are spending $1.4 million on breast cancer research. That is about one per - of the total health research budget. Despite newspaper articles that were written in Australia about increases on breast cancer research, I cannot see one extra real dollar being spent in this critically needed area unless thepriQrities arerejigged by thQse whQ detennine them. There was an annQuncement that a nati-nal' breast cancer centre would be set up-Qr, as the minister describes it, 'a natiQnal breast canGer clinic'. A tQtal .of $16.4 milliQI) .over fQur years will be put aside tQ develQP this area. As the Minister fQr Human Services and.Health says,. 'This year's federal budget features a majQr attack .on breast cancer.'· . , Once we start tQ lQQk at this centre, clinic, .or whatever it is, nQbQdy can' give us any answers. This has CQme tQtally .out .of the blue. NQne .of the experts in this area knQW anything abQut it, whatsQever. They have already been quizzed by the parliamentary cQmmittee that is lQQking intQ the treatment .of breast cancer andnQt .one expert knQws anything· abQut it FQr example, ProfessQr Judith WhitwQrth,' who heads the medical research cQmmittee, has gravecQncerns abQut hQW this mQney will be spent. There are nQ patients ·fQr this centre,nQ research has been dQne by the centre, and we dQ ,nQt even have a venue fQr the centre. The centre will apparently have nQ cQnnectiQn with any hQspital in Australia where research is being dQne. SQ the questiQn has tQ be asked: what will the centre do? SQ far we have been told that it will cQllect and distribute. the research that has already been dQne. The mind absQlutely bQggles-,.$16.4 milliQn, mQney that is desperately needed fQr breast cancer research, will be spent in this fashiQn. On tQP .of this, a breast cancerfundrajsing fQundatiQn will be set up. Again, nQne .of the hundreds .of experts .on breast cancer research around Australia has been cQnsulted abQut this .or seems tQ knQw abQutit. An amQunt .of $3 milliQnQver three years is tQ be puiaside fQr this. We are tQld that it will beheaded up by the Prime Minister's wife, Annita Keating. Perhaps that is a gQQd idea. I dQ nQt know. When I first heard about it, I thQughtthat it had all the hallmarks .of a PQlitical exercise a la Hillary ClintQn. The gQvernment is spending .only $1.4 milliQn .on research. Suddenly it plucks $16.4milliQn .out .of the air fQr a breast cancer centre .or clinic, to dQ nQbQdy knQWS what, .and $3 milliQn .out .of the air fQr a fQundatiQn. I hQpe the government is mQre fQrthcQming ..on details, ·because I WQuld nQt like tQ see desperately needed funds in this area frittered away fQr improper reaSQns. While I am .on - he matter .of health, let us cast .our minds back tQ the periQd befQre the last elec:;tiQn .of March 1993. The gQvernment WQn by telling the people a lQt .of fibs .or by not telling them what it was going tQ dQ. The Minister fQr Health, SenatQr Richardson, as he then was, prQmised $25 mllliQn fQr each year .over. fQur years .tQ reduce the number on hQspital waiting lists. There are between 100,000 and 120,000 people in this cQuntry waiting tQ get intQ hQspitals· fQr QperatiQns such as hip replacements. What happened after theelectiQn? SenatQr Richardson, as he then was, was called befQre Estimates CQmmittee C two mQnths after the electiQn and asked when this mQney WQuld be fQrthcQming. He said: ... I do propose to make sure itthe $100 milliQnis efficiently spent in reducing waiting lists. We all knQW what happened tQ that promise. It is anQther .one that has gQne by the bQardyet anQther broken promise by this gQvernment. It is very sad tQ see this SQrt .of thing happen, particularly when it invQlves people's health. If the gQvernment has nQ intentiQn .of doing these things, I say tQ it, 'FQr gQQdness sake, dQn't make the promises in the first place.' . It particularly concerns me and my electQrate that the gQvernment cut federal rQad funding in the bUdget. In the budget brought dQwn in August last year, federal rQad funding was cut from $1,600 milliQn tQ $1,000 milliQn, which was a big enQughcut. But what has happened in this year's budget? Mr Reith-It has gQne dQwn.",81
160,Mr COBB,BUSINESS,"It has gQne dQwn again by anQther $200 milliQn tQ $800 milliQn. In .effect, the' mQney that will be spent .on federal roads in this cQuntry will be halved within a tWQ-year periQd ,.or less. This will cQntinue f-rever. ,As I gQ around thecQuntryside, people are telling me that they are cQncerned abQut the landacquisitiQn fund fQr which $1,500 milliQn will be given tQ the AbQriginal PQPulatiQn. Is this anQther cruel hQax? We cannot find too much in the budget about it. People ask me how the government will pay for this $1,500 million which has been plucked out of the air. I can point to im area. where it will be paid for quite easily. Within two years it will be paid for by the reduction in road funding. In the next two years, five years or 10 years there will be hundreds of millions, if not thousands of millions, of dollars saved in this area. Money could be spent on roads in my area such as Kidman Way, between Hillston, Cobar and Bourke, where there are nearly 200 kilometres of unsealed roads; the north-south highway that travels through Broken' Hill to papers. Tibooburra and on into Queensland is desperately in need of sealing; and we need crossings at the Georgina River in Queensland. The east-west highway, which is now sealed between Bourke and Brewarrina, needs at state least another $3 1/z million for sealing east Brewarrina. Another road needs upgrading urgently between Dtibbo and Newcastle-a vital road link from inland New South Wales to the eastern seaboard. I ask: how can state governments, whose budgets are being cut back on a yearly basis, afford to pay for things when the federal government will not pay for them? It is an absolute the federal road budget has been cut by half. It should be headlines right across Australia. Mr Nehl-They've dumped the Pacific Highway.",83
161,Mr COBB,BUSINESS,"The government has dumped they the Pacific Highway. I have not even seen one paragraph about this drastic reduction in the budget anywhere. Finally, I highlight that the federal government has also hit wool producers for six. It completely abolished the $20 million wool promotion funding and has totally eliminated the exceptional circumstances funding for wool growers .who have 65 per cent of their income due to wool production. That is to be cutout on 30 June this year. We desperately needed that funding to continue for at least another 12 to 24 months so wool growers could get back on their feet again. For the government to have shafted wool growers like this in their hour of need is an absolute disgrace. The government stands condemned for this budget. (Time expired)  p.m.)-Yet again we heard sloganeering from the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), backed up by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), that federal road funds have been cut by half. They ask,'Why did we not get any headlines around the country? Why has it not been heard of or reported on?' The very simple answer is that it is not true.",84
162,Mr COBB,BUSINESS,"It is true. Look at the budget  basis to it. I said on the previous occasion in a debate about road funding from federal and sources that every time road funding for of non-national .highways is raised by those opposite as an issue in this parliament they are really saying to the people of Australia and their constitu.ents, 'We as members of the National Party have no confidence that our National-Liberal Party colleagues in the New these South Wales government will provide any additional expenditure on roads where we feel disgrace that it ought to be spent.' Those opposite come to this government, which has passed the money on to the state government, and clamour here, knowing full well-this is the fraud that is practised upon their constituents-that the roads about which speak are the responsibility of the New South Wales government. That decision was arrived at at a Special Premiers Conference in August 1991. Then Premier Greiner and then Prime Minister Hawke came to an agreement with all other premiers about the sharing of road responsibilities. The notion of sharing road responsibilities is very simple: the National Highway is the responsibility of the national government. We pay every cent of the' cost of building and maintaining the National Highway system. The other moneys have just been passed over to the state governments to spend as they will. National Party members ought to go back to their colleagues in the New South Wales government, and then be fair dinkum with their constituents and admit to them their impotence as members. You clamour with this fraudulent argument. You are decent men. You know that what are saying is untrue. You do not demur from what I am saying. You are all silent. You agree with what I am saying. Go and tell constituents and tell your National Party Liberal Party colleagues in the New South Wales government that you want some extra money that it is getting from the federal government spent on roads in your electorate. Mr Deputy Speaker, to suggest",84
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"Order! The honourable member will ment address the chair, not other members in chamber.  Speaker'. How could I dare speak addressing you, sir. Mr Deputy Speaker, to suggest that federal roads funds have been cut by half in this current budget is a· patent untruth, and those opposite know it to be the case. I return to the overall budget. When I speak about the budget this evening, I am referring to the budget and the white paper that was presented to this chamber on 4 May 1994. The budget before. us is a sound and solid budget. It is a budget that builds on progress and past Pllin of industry restructuring and recession. Many Australian families have shared in that pain and difficulty, as have many that have been involved in the process of restructuring our industry, seeking out new markets with more competitive billion products and looking at ways of improving our productivity and efficiency. This budget has been well received by employees and employers alike. I do riot think I can recall a budget that has been better received than the current budget. The general feeling in the community is that it is aposiaccommodation; tive budget that builds upon the progress made in recent times. It can see the major thrusts of the budget and the measures to maintain and accelerate growth in the econexcise omy. There is recognition of the needs of regions, and it provides incentives to small and medium businesses to become more effident and expand and to seek out new markets for imports as well as exports. There is a determination in the thrust of the you budget to provide employment opportunity and independence to the long-ter.m unemployed. There is the provision of the natiomil your land fund and Aboriginal health programs. and Overall, these items will involve new expenditure of $1.2 billion in 1994-95 and $7.1 of the billion over the next four years. If one looks quickly across the main features of the budget, one sees that this is the first budget in the history of this n.ation that been. introduced prior to the commenceof the financial year to which it relates. the That is an. excellent move. It brings the national public accounts into line with the major industrial countries and with normal without private sector practice. The budget deficit of $11.7 billion is a decrease from the budget of the year expiring, which is expected to be $13.6 billion. The rate of economic growth is forecast at 4 1h per cent, which compares with the anticipated and known four per cent that is· occu-ing in the current financial year. The budget deficit will fall to 0.9 per cent, or less than one per cent of gross doinestic product, by 1996-97 cori1pared with previous estimates of 1.2 per cent.. the Unemployment will reach 9.5 per cent by . June 1995 compared with ·10.3 per cent, which is the existing level. The Working Nation policies that are referred to-the. white paper that was presented to this parliament on 4 May-...,provide for expenditure of $6.5 over four years, partially funded by a real drop in social security spending.· The white paper provides $169 million over four years iii thearea of mental health; $209 over the next four years for the national breast cancer campaign; $63 million over the next four years to help the homeless find and $135 million over the next six years for athlete preparation for the 2000 Olympics. An important measure in the transport area is the reduction in the level of by almost 2c per litre. A drop in the level of excise on fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene will considerably ease. and relieve the shipping and mining industries. . The budget refl-cts th-t this nation and the economy are strongly into recovery and experiencing a rate of economic growth that is faster than almost any other industrial country. The Tr-asurer (Mr Willis) summarised it very well in. presenting the budget when he said: The Budget that I present tonight will: mllximiseeconomicgrowth; reduce unemployment; promote social justice; and reduce the budget deficit; without increasing taxes. We have noticed since the, night the budget was presented that, there' has been some argUment,particularly from the opposition, about the rate of increasingbusines- investment in the coming year. We expect it to increase by 14.5 per cent. . Let us turn'to see what otherniajorspokespersons in the private sector ate saying. The National Australia Bank, is predicting an increase in business irwestment of 17 per cent; 1;3ankers Trust prediCts an increase of 15 112 per cent; and CS First Boston predicts an increase of 14 percent. If anything, the 14112 per cent appears to be a very safe estimate for an increase in business investment in 1994-95. Similafly, the 4112' per cent growth rat€1 th- economy is based on the government's expectation that business will start investing. I believe that business has opportunities in the growing economy, where there is increasing demand, a stable set of interest rates and a stable inflation rate. Industrial disputes their 'lowest level in 20 and 30 years. This is an ideal climate for an increase in the level, business. investment. The special m-asures that encourage and assist small to medium businesses to improve their performance have been long overdue. We in the Hunter region,which links to the central coast region of New South Wales, have ,long wanted to see, these measures implemented. The major cry that comes from small businesses is their difficulty in getting finance and equity through people investing in small business. I cannot help repeating what I hear so much from small businesses in our region: banks really are about lending to safe risks; banks are about large businesses"" not· about small businesses. If you area small, business person and you have any level of risk, the bank does not wantto know you. I haVe seen such caSeS in recent times. I noticed that the National Australia Bank had an enormous increase, jn profit. I am also aware of the, National Austrlllia Bank's ruthless 'treatment of some of my constituents. . Small business ,people have been through a very tough period. Any ,business getting through this tough period of recession has proven that, it has the resource, the capacity and the level ofmanagement to get through. The ruthless treatment of small business people by soine banks underlines the need to ensure that we give special recognition to the financial needs of small bUSiness. ' , Included in the measures mentioned in the white paper is the liberalisation ,arrangements for infrastructure bonds, extending them to new industry ,sectors and picking up matters relating to sewerage and the provision of water related services. That is in addition to aviation and the other measures mentioned previously. The measure' that should be able to help small to medium businesses considerably is in the improvement of the conditions attaching to' pooled development funds. Pooled development funds must invest in small and medium sized companies that have total assets of not more than $50 million. The main constraints on a pooled development fund's investments are at are that, the pooled investment fund must invest by way of newly issued ordinary of shares; invest in companies that will establish . a new business, substantially expand produc:tion or supply capacity or expand and develop markets; and not invest in retail operations ,or property, development. The attractions to investors to' lodge or deposit moneys in those pooled development funds are that the pooled development funds are 'taxed at 15 per, cent on profits derived from investment in small and medium sized businesses and 25 per cent on profits derived elsewhere. One has to underline the point that income . derived by investors from selling shares in pooled development funds is exempt from income tax. Unfranked pooled developthat ment fund dividends in the hands of sharebe holders in a pooled development fund are staff. exempt from tax. Franked pooled developto ment dividends are also exempt unless sharement holders· elect to be taxed on the dividends through the imputation system. Those financial measures will go a long way to helping funds to beavaiIable to small to medium businesses. There is an easing of the administrative and compliance costs faced by industry; helping small firms to gain access to finance. There is up to a $5,000 grant to help exporters seek expert advice in organising finance foi-exports. There is better provision of information to busiriessabout government services available to business. In the Hunter region we are well ahead the game with the establishment of the II1dustry Development Centre as a single contact point for all the advice that one needs about growing one's business, access to government programs and where one gets information on best practice, work change training, quality assurance and all of the matters related improving the efficiency and performance of one's business. The government will also provide specific measures to assist employers to take up other white paper initiatives relating to the services provided to businesses the Commonwealth Employment Service by providing targeted assistance to small busithought ness. I turn to the area of long-term unemployed and making sure that people get access to employment. In the little time that is available to me because of the limited time for debate on the budget I want to express my very strong support for the preference being given to long-term unemployed and to the introduction of the job compact and the enhanced wage subsidies to employers. There is very little reason now for many public authorities and many major and medimillion. um employers not to take on people who been long-term unemployed. There is very little reason for them not to be embracing youth training allowance initiative or the national training wage; The level of assistance is from $120 per week up to $260 per week to assist iri the employment of people under national training scheme. They· ought to assisting those people and employing more There is very little reason for them not be indulging and engaging in the employof additional staff and giving people who have not had the chance· to.. work a chance to get back into the work force. The last matter I mention is the provision in respect of regional development. Both the best practice program and the regional infrastructure program provide an opportunity for regions to get in there and improve the performance of local government and to share and participate in regional projects that will enhance the performance of the region as a whole and not be simply a matter of pulling out the bottom drawer and dragging ouf one's of best projects or one 'spet projects. I congratulate the government on providing access to the Veterans' Entitlements Act for wartime merchant mariners. This has been almost a 50-year struggle. There are only about 31/2 thousand of them left, but at last, after that. long time, we are righting the to wrong; I commend the government for it. I look forward to making my remarks in respect of that legislation when it comes before the chamber. I commendthe budget to the House.",85
164,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,"O'Connor) (6.36 p.m.)by Before the honourable member for Shortland  we might have a quick discussion on the. impassioned' remarks about road funding that he made at the beginning of his speech. For the record, for a reason. that I think he tried to explain, the budget figure for expenditure on roads. which the Commonwealth now limits to its own expenditures on national highways, is of the order of $800 inillion. Of course, as he points out, there is now also an allocation of funding to the states in their general purpose· grant-identified for their road expenditures-of approximately· $350 If we stop the equation there, the have arguments of the honourable member for Shortland are basically correct. Notwithstandthe ing the huge increases in government tax on fuel, expenditure on roads is about the same. What the honourable member for Shortland failed to tell the House is that when we get down to the final overall funding by the Commonwealth of state governments we find that it .. has been reduced by about $300 million. Overall, the states have got less. They are now faced with the dilemma of having less. money and are asking themselves where they must ·spend that $350. million. It is in general purpose funding. They have no obligation to actually spend it on roads, although the Commonwealth said, 'That's what we gave it to you for.' That is what he is carrying. on about. He is blaming the states-when the government is starving them to death! With less money, they have to answer the parents who want schooling and the people who want health care and hospitals. The simple fact is that it. is an exercise with mirrors. The simple fact is that the road system will. suffer because of the overall reduction in funding to the states. That is the truth of the figures. In my contribution tonight I want to look the 1980s .and the early 1990s.FundamenThey tally, that 10 years from the early 1980s now was the period of the Labor administradreds tion throughout Australia in state and federal government. The one commOll factor between all of those areas is financial misman-gement. Mr Deputy Speaker Dobie, the voters in your state of New South Wales were. the to realise what was going on. They sacked that government and installed a Liberal state government, which immediately found itself highly unpopular as it commenced to sort the mess in public transport, the mess on the wharves-the rriesswherever people lookedWhile and the financial mismanagement which had more to do with putting people's photographs up around the place telling them how much of the public's - oiley they were spending is fundamental to these administrations that they measure excellence. by· expenditure .. simple fact is that New South Wales was first group· to recognise this financial mismanagement. Of course, it sacked that government. More recently, the people of Victoria have eventually recognised the outrageous· fiscal mismanagement of successive Labor governground ments under Cain and Kirner. Today the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr are Chynoweth) and the honourable member for MCEwen(Mr Cleeland). railed against Je(f I<ennett, the .Premier of Victoria,saying that he has killed off 70,000 jobs. But it was the previous· Labor administration that killed· off those 70,000 jobs. I point out to the honourable member for Dunkley from time to time that the Victorian government did not adopt appropriate financial measures with. respect to the public transport area.. It sold .its trams rather than reorganising its work force. It also sold all the rolling stock on its railways. Today the people of Victoria pay rent of about$800 milIiona year to Japanese financial institutions in order to rent rolling stock which their parents paid for tl1rough their taxes. That is .. just what happened in Victoria. Western Australia had another approach called the WA Inc. An estimated $1,000 million was paid out to entrepreneurs and at crooks by successive Labor governments. encouraged their union friends to bank . to with them, but they then had to spend hunof millions of dollars bailing that bank out so that the church, the unions and others could recover their money. Who paid for that? It was the taxpayers. Who-waited for schools, roads and all these other things while that first exercise went on? It was the taxpayers. I refer to the situation in South Australia. What a imess that was! Politicians with no business background simply wanted to be out bank managers and amongst the high-fliers, but they blew the state's economy to shreds; these successive Labor administrations in all those states conducted their affairs so badly, they were never remonstrated with by this federal government. When the Prime . .It Minister . (Mr Keating) was Treasurer, we asked him about corruption with respect to The WA Inc. But he did not want to know about the it, even though he knew all about it. While all of these things have been going on in the states, there has been this charade that somehow or other things are better here in the Commonwealth. Let us have a look at the fundamentals. I have a business backand I quite frequently find myself having to convince those bank managers who so frequently criticised in this place that I am worthy of a loan. I appreciate their qiIestionsbecause they know whether or not the proposed amount can be repaid. They know that I cannot rely on the hard work of 17 million Australians. I have to do it on my own. These bank managers are very interested in my bottom line. They ar€(interested in how things will look at the end. of the financial year, Let us have a quick look at the bottom line of this budget. The government will have to be a lot more honest with the bank manager than it has been with the Australian public: The bottom line is minus $11,700 million. Business would consider this form of borrowing a loss. The accumulated losses are $95,000 million. There is an interest bill of close to $7,000 million, which is outrageous when one considers how much that money could do for the needy of this country instead of being paid to the bankers and the money lenders. Let us look at that bottom line of $11.7 billion. That is achieved after selling $2.5 billion of the family silver and knocking off substantial assets which will probably be substantially owned by foreign investors. The Leader of the House, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), was boasting about his sale of CSL. But what did we read in this morning's paper? The maximum allocated, which was 20 per cent, has gone to foreign institutions. The recipients of all the compulsory superannuation that the government rips off small business did not bother to buy. Obviously, a few mums and dads got in there, but the simple fact is that CSLhas been sold to foreign investors and our other assets will also end up in the hands of foreign investors. That will contribute to our current account deficit, as Ross Gittins pointed out today. For decades we have been balancing our trade accountexports of goods and services versus imports of goods and services. But every month we spend between $1,000 million and $2,000 million in order to pay our existing interest bill to the rest of the world and to pay the dividends on their investments in us. So the bottom line has added to it $2 11z billion due to the sale of the family silver. There is another sleight of hand. We are going to bring forward into this budget an extra quarterly payment of $3 billion in company tax .. In future years, unless the government brings forward another quarterly payment in the next year, that tax will fall away. The government can only go so far with that particular proposal. That in itself is probably the greatest attack on the other fundamental of this budget, which is industry investment. If the government rips an extra $3 billion off the corporate sector, where will it find the money to invest? Clearly, it is a contradiction. More importantly, another $1 billion is being grabbed out of the fringe benefits tax system. We heard some pretty funny explanations from the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) today. We all know that people can be volunteer workers but, if they are given free rent in a house, that is subject to FBT. But he did not even know that. Finally, there are some pretty optimistic growth expectations. There is nothing wrong with growth; I welcome growth. The budget tells us that it will be 4 11z per cent. What is drivirig it? It is not business investment because we have just learnt that that. is dreadful. It was negative in the last quarter. It is being driven by government expenditure. The figure of $11.7 billion in borrowings and spending is about three per cent of GDP. The sale of those government assets is another 0.5 per cent of GDP. So 3 1h per cent of the government's growth is coming out of its own expenditure. It is like a businessman going down the road, borrowing $100,000, banking it and then going to his bank manager and saying, 'I am travelling pretty well; my turnover is up by 90,000 grand.' But it is down by 100,000 grand because he has injected borrowed money. There is no difference between the way the government is run and the way a business is run. in that regard. It is an outrageous situation to argue that we are travelling so well when 75 per cent of the growth is coming from money borrowed by government at the cost of future generations. I come back to the selfish approach being supported in this parliament. The honourable member for Shortland said that the people of Australia like this budget. Of course they do. They do not understand that their kids have to pay for the generosity of the Prime Minister and his Treasurer (Mr Willis). These people pat themselves on the back and say, 'We're into social justice. We're putting a couple of hundred million dollars away for land for Aboriginals. It makes you feel good.' But what they are not saying is that kids who do not even vote yet will have to pay the money off. That is outrageous. It is outrageous that politicians are prepared to do that to future generations. It is outrageous .that .this generation has become so selfish that it is happy to let its children pay for the $60,000 million additional debt that this government has incurred since it came to office and got into the business of borrowing money to buy votes. It is a .shame. I hope the next speaker in this debClte is prepared to admit that it is a shame. I doubt it. The honourable member will get up and stick her chest out and say, 'We have performed a miracle. We have kept taxes where they were.' That is a fib. She will say, 'We have given all these things. We have got this wonderful process of natural justice. We have proposed this wonderful process of looking after the unemployed with $6 billion over the next few years.' It will all be funded by the kids of Australia. If you are proud of that, stand up and say so. I am not. It is outrageous. But the situation is worse than that, because we are not going anywhere. We talk about growth and taking the entire growth dividend in taxes; we forget that growth itself puts demands on government. We cannot have growth and not build new roads. We cannot have growth and not build new powerhouses. Where does that money come from? The government is paying off the debts of the past. There is no proper commitment in this budget to infrastructure. It is. about buying votes and I do not know whether there is an absolute commitment to the end result. It gets worse than that. Where does the government expect the growth to come from? It keeps telling us that small business is going to get it out of trouble. Today we heard the Treasurer explain all the wonderful initiatives in the budget. It isa load of rubbish! He read"" the list of initiatives and the honourable member for Shortland repeated it. They are all attempts to fix the problem at the margin. None of them do anything to fix the fundamental problem. I will give the House some examples. We will have the situation of pooled development funds which have to invest in· small and medium enterprises; About half of those small and medium enterprises are not even incorporated, so how can a pooled development fund buy shares in them? How can the business angels become partners? How can the Commonwealth Development Bank take equity in a partnership and have the total responsibility for all the debts, the joint and several liability that comes from being in a partnership? It cannot do it. The government has not fixed that yet. Since 1989 the government has been trying to put a small business corporation together that little businesses can use. It has never achieved that. It introduced a closed corporation bill in the Senate and a bipartisan committee laughed it out of the room. It was more complex than what we have now. What did the government do in the budget? The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has said he is going to lower the cost of entry for people getting into small business corporate structures. What happened? This budget put those costs up by 20 per cent. The government has not yet created a vehicle whereby very small businesses can attract equity but it has two theories as to where the money will come from. What about. the medium sized enterprises? They have problems too. They are corporations but they have not got a market. With the way the regulatory structures have been created for the Stock Exchange, these enterprises need hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars, just to be listed. Where can a small to medium sized enterprise attract equity capital when a market is required but the entry cost is probably more than it has ever had in cash. Why has the government not done something about that so that these other processes can work on their own with no help from government? I was interested to hear the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) make that point. The role of government is to create the structures and finance will find a way in. The same applies to small business. Let it get out there and multiply. It is a bit like the AIDS debate. The government says, 'Go out and multiply but do not forget your condom. 'The condom, of course, is increasing taxes and of increasing regulation ..·The government has doubled them in the last five years. It has small business with the most outrageous arrangements in terms of industrial The greatest insult this parliament has ever thrown at the small business community, the people the government is imploring to get out of its financial mismanagement, was to say that they had to have unfair dismissal provisions in the law. Why insult small business people? Nobody values their workers more than small business people. dom sack anybody unless, of course, they are totally inadequate in the·workplace. They desperate to get good people and they do everything in their power to keep them . why put them in a situation where the hopewomen's less and the malingerers cannot be sacked. A lot of honourable members run busineswomen. ses. Some 90 per cent of people' who my business come and say they are leaving. I cannot really remember the last time we told someone to leave. It does not work like that out there. But the union bureaucracy had get its reward. (TIme expired)",87

167,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,BUSINESS,"Appropriation Bill No. 1 means good news for northern TasmanTasmania, is, which is the area I represent. Increased health funding, lower fuel oil excise, the young homeless, agricultural resource initiatives and restructured unemployment allowances are the hallmarks of this bill. Up to $252 million in federal government funds will be available under the rural adjustwomen's ment scheme to assist our farmers, my farimproving mers,improve productivity and technical skills. The fanners of northern Tasmania will directly benefit from this initiative and they . are pleased to hear about it. The entire rural adjustment scheme will be better designed to address regional adjustment needs. The needs the rural sector will be tackled on a holistic basis. Stronger links will exist between the hit rural adjustment scheme and other state and federal government farm improvement prorelations. grams, including landcare.. The fanning sector of the entire nation will benefit from this initiative. It will ensure that it we, as a nation; will have a self-reliant, competitive and sustainable farming sector by the year 2001. We are in 'a new age. We have left the dinosaurs behind and we are heading for a bright new future for all-positives, They selpositives, positives. I am particularly pleased that this appropriare ation bill makes provision for new funding initiatives in health and, more specifically, .so dramatic funding' increases in the area of health. Breast cancer has become one of the biggest killers of Australian The bill provides for assured funding leave for mammography screening, enhanced research efforts and an innovative approach to the vital issues of improving treatment. Some $41.8 million will be spent on screening into 1994-95. That is an increase of $14 million on the present level of funding. Projections show that by 1995-96 more than in $85 million will be spent by all governments each year to screen some 860,000 women in the group most at risk. The particularIy pleasing aspect of these undertakings' in regard to women's health is the solid assurby this government that the same high he standard of treatment be available to all Australian women wherever they live. The women of Tasmania, and especially northern will have the same access to quality services and treatment that exist in help for major centres throughout Australia. I recently had the' distinct pleasure to launch in Hobart the Cervical Cytology Register, which is another example' of the federal government's commitment to address health needs and to the challenge of health services for the women of Australia. We as a government have recog':"" nised the need for clear information about personal health issues supported by research; that women want to participate. in decision making and have ownership of. their own personal health; and that health services must acknowledge wQmen's emotional, social and physical needs and, above al1, take them seriously.. We have announced a rapid expansion of the national breast screening :program. We have committed $236.6 mi11ion bver the next five years to that program. The states and territories wi11 be asked to add a further $205 mi11ion to create a holistic approach cancer· 'on a two-tiered governmental basis. Most of that money wi11 be spent on direct service delivery to women. A network of screening and assessment services is being established across the country to provide free mammography and fol1ow-up services through to diagnosis of breast cancer. The.other major women's health screening program is the organised approach for preventing cancer of the cervix. It isa four-year progr::.m that has been jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the states to the tune of $32 mi11ion. This year alone in Tasmania, the Commonwealth has committed more than a quarter of a mi11ion dol1ars to the program. That will fund screening and other vital services, such as an education strategy, and the. registry which I unveiled last week. But the sad fact stm is that, each year in Tasmania, 10.· women die of cervical cancer and another 30 are diagnosed. Education is vital. We must improve understanding about cancer of the cervix and we must dispel many of the myths surrounding it. The campaign wi11be able to target particular groupings of women in Tasmania who may have special needs, such as women from nonEnglish speaking backgrounds. The campaign will encourage them to screen regularly and so reduce their risk of cancer of the cervix by early detection and treatment. The registry will be vital in fol1owing through the work of this campaign. It will be an invaluable service that reminds women when their pap smear is overdue and will improve follow-up and management of women with detected abnormalities. The fact that women are going to have regular reminders .is a very important component of that registry; as I heard when talking to the various women at the launch last week. Another crucial part of the program wi11 be aimed at improving the reliability of pap smears. Despite recent media attention suggesting otherwise, the fact remains that the pap smear is the only effective test available as yet to detect pre-cancerous changes in the cel1s of the cervix. It annual1y identifies a quarter of a mi11ion abnormalities-that is no mean feat-and prevents over 700 cases of cervical to breast cancer from developing. Quality assurance is an integral part of the organised approach. The,program is committed to· implementing the recommendations of the quality assurance report cal1ed Making the pap smear better, which was released in April 1993. The recommendations of that report are aimed at improving the quality and the reliability of smear taking, testing, reporting and supporting services. They address the need for adequate undergraduate and continued training in cytopathology, and the need for comprehensive and continuous monitoring of outputs, together with feedback to operators which, of course, is the essence of quality control. Women should draw much comfort and reassurance from the comprehensive measures planned to ensure the reliability of pap smears. While no diagnostic test can be perfect, women rightly expect the highest duty of care. The measures that we are introducing through this appropriation bi11 will go a long way to reducing avoidable deaths. One of. the most pleasing aspects of this appropriation bill are the measures which it . incorporates for veterans. My electorate of Bass has a very large and very active veteran population. Some of my most enjoyable nights have been spent at the Vietnam veterans' annual dinner in Launceston. The inconsistencies in the determination of disability pension claims will be removed. The sum of $20.6 mi\1ion over four years will be directed at problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder, which includes funding for treatment centres. There will be increased counselling and there will be direct research into the needs of our younger veterans-a group that has been left aside for so long. The money from this appropriation biIl· will be directed to the areas of the veteran community that truly need· increased support. This biIl appropriates funds for the programs of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, programs which will lead .. this country out of economic recyssion and into economic resurgence with a motivated,relevant and skilled work force. My background lies in the field of direct training as a preparation for people to enter the work force. For five years I ran a jobclub. Jobclub was a federal government program aimed directly at the unemployed. In my five years with jobc1ub 600-odd people came through my program. To date, I am still meeting up with many of those students in the street. They are saying, 'Silvia, thank you very much for the jobc1ub, for what it did for me; I am still in work.' It is still working. I took the first jobc1ub to Tasmania. It has been of such benefit and such need that more have got going. In Launceston alone we now' run three jobc1ubs. They are all finding a good percentage of positive outcomes. I also ran many skills based programs that were direct tenders from DEET. There were youth training programs and specific individual courses and programs on things such as industrial cleaning. We had a computer bank and we taught office skills and computer operating skills-all much needed skills to ensure a very skilled work force. That is what these programs are all about. This government intends to train people with the relevant skills to make them ready for work. The work is out there for those people who have the skills. We will develop a highly skilled and flexible work force. The emphasis needs to be on the word 'flexible'. This will be done through a better national training effort. Additional funding for this purpose will bring the total Commonwealth contribution to over $1.5 billion for the period 1993-97, thus reflecting the government's determination to ensure that this nation has an accessible, high quality vocational education and training system. We need it. Our youth needs it. Our long-term unemployed need ,it. This, nation needs it. North-eastern Tasmania is also particularly excited by provisions in this bill for the development of a national regional development strategy. Northern Tasmania is one of Australia's most dynamic regions in terms of regional development. We have one of this country's 1ll0st active and energetic regional development boards in the Northern Tasmanian Regional Development Board. It is innovative, it is active and it looks far into the future. I pay particular attention in this instant to the efforts of the executive officer, Mr Tom Black, and, the chairman, Mr Michael Courney, for the special, ongoing and positive work they have done and are still doit'lgin this area and wish to do in this area in ,the future for the··future benefit· of all northern Tasmanians. The federal government will spend $150 million over four years towards the national regional development strategy. I can , assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that northern Tasmania will be, capitalising on everyopportunity that this strategy presents. The factors I have outlined here this evening ,are the as-:pects of this appropriation bill which ,stand out. They are good for northern Tasmania and they are good for the nation. I commend the biIl to the House. MrCHARLES(LaTrobe) (7.10 p;m.)-I am delighted tonight to have the opportunity to comment on the government'sbiJdget for . 1994-95. Australia today finds itself at a crossroads. We have come through two decades of modernisation of the Australian economy, two decades of change, two ,decades of supposed reform which suddenly; with this budget, has ground to a halt. This, it has been said frequently, is an election budget. I suspect that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) got a bit of a shock ,at the beginning of last week and, as a result of that shock, he is now rethinking his plans for a Christmas election this year. Notwithstanding that, the budget is a cop-out. Australia was for a very long time a· very wealthy but very isolationist country. We lived behind high tariff walls and we sold to the world that which it needed from us,being our metals, minerals and agricultural products, and we sold them at good· prices. Following World War II when Australia got its act together and started to manufacture and diversify its industrial base, we had what is now known as the golden age of full employment. There was employment for everyone, a job for every household. For every Australian who wanted to work there was employment and a high standard of living. During that golden age, the time of the 1950s and 1960s, it was said that Australia enjoyed one of the highest,. if not the highest, standards of living in the world. . Those days are well and truly gone. We find ourselves today, in terms of the developed world, down near the bottom of the ladder on almost all of the economic and social indicators. We are no longer one of the wealthiest nations in the world"" We now fight to survive. During the last decade, the last 11 years of Labor in power, we have seen a diversification of income spread in this country which has meant that the wealthy are wealthier and the poor are poorer. There is no doubt that isolationism and protection cost this country dearly. We develmassive oped, behind that high tariff wall, many of attitudes and problems that we still live with today. Industry is unresponsive to the need change because it was protected and lacks innovation in terms of development of new products that both this nation and the rest the world might well consume. We were slow to take up the results of research. Although we spend a reasonable amount of income on research, the majority of that spending is government spending. It comes from taxpayers' funds invested on behalf in primary research. Far too little that research winds up in new, innovative products which go into applied research and, finally, into commercialisation of products which are sold and consumed in the market. We developed poor attitudes to quality. I think the automotive industry is highly descriptive of the kinds of problems that developed in Australia through the era of protectionism.The automotive industry would go to government and say, 'Look, our costs are up. We're having a very difficult time competing. Please would you increase the tariffl'.The government would say, 'Yes; you've definitely got a problem. We'll hike the tariff up so that Australians pay more forimported motor cars; therefore you can raise your prices and get more Jor the cars you produce.' The union would go along to the then Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and say, 'For heaven's sake, the prices of motor cars have gone up, so we had best have a pay rise.' The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission would say, 'You're right.. We'll give you a pay rise.' Then the automobile manufacturers would go back to the government and say, 'Look, the commission just gave our workers a pay rise. Our costs have gone up again. We'll have to have an increase in tariffs.' So it went on and on and on. Behind that tariff wall, we developed some horrible attitudes and terrible quality. However, I have to note with some pride that I am the proprietor of a new Australian motor vehicle, manufactured by Holden. It now has 11,000 kilometres on the clock and it does not yet have one fault, not one, which I could report to the manufacturer. That is a turnaround in quality in a very short the number of years. The industry is to be congratulated in that respect. I think the industry for thanks John Button. I have to say that his plan has worked reasonably well. Behind that high tariff wall we developed poor service of attitudes and a terrible response to public requests for service. We developed no international marketing skills to help us when we our national finally had to compete. So this government decided to eliminate protection, but it started to eliminate protecthe public's tion from the tariff end. It forgot about the of labour market. It left the labour market protected but removed protection from industry without giving it the compensating offsets and reductions in costs of compliance from government agencies, in costs of services supplied by government instrumentalities, in costs of regulations, in costs from taxes. It forgot to give industry half a break. It simply said, 'We'll remove your tariffs. Now you have to compete. Go out and compete and survive the best way you can' - under a still regulated labour market and with still all the constraints imposed by governments. It has not worked very well because what. has happened is that we have lost one hell of a lot of good Australian companies that are no longer in Australia. They now are in other countries or have disappeared altogether. So our problems, which we face when we examine this budget, are severe. Our problems start with debt. We are a highly indebted country now. Our current account deficit is driven by the fact that we have to pay interest on the money this nation has borrowed far in excess of our ability to service it. So we continue to spend tomorrow's money today on today's social policies. That is really what this budget is all about. This budget says that we will continue to run a high budget deficit; we will bring in new programs to try to deal responsibly, in a social manner, with the term unemployed. And how will we pay for it? We will not pay for it· with any selfsacrifice by government or the bureaucracy or government departments or government agencies in reducing their costs or their spending. No, we will spend our grandchildren's money for these desirable social programs to try to bring the long-term unemployed back in touch with real jobs in the work force. That is the wrong way to go about it- We need permanent jobs if those people are going to do any more than come into touch with the workplace. Whatthey want is real jobs. The job market has changed dramatically in the last 20 years. We no longer have many jobs for unskilled people. The most disadvantaged in the job market are those who have poor literacy skills, those who have no English or very poor English skills, those who have little or no vocational training or those whose training suited them for one occupation which is no longer required as industry has restructured. While the government gave support to the automotive industry, in terms of its restructurmedium ing as tariffs have fallen, it has given almost no support to the manufacturing industry. My state of Victoria has particularly copped it as a result of those government policies. The government has also given some support to the textile, clothing and footwear industry, that is obviously not enough. Thatindustry is absolutely decimated all over this country. The government's budget still props up government spending on government programs and servicing of government through the bureaucracy. The government is not going to reduce the number of bureaucrats as a result of this budget. It will increase them because more people will now be needed to deal with the new programs to· deal with the long-term unemployed. As. I said, I support some of those programs. I think they may be positive, but they will only be positive if we build real jobs in a real economy. One of the biggest problems we face in Australia is that we do not save; we spend. Since the 1980s, under this Labor government, we have been on a spending binge. We long- have spent on ourselves. We have not just spent our money and our earnings and what we have worked for but we have spent our children's money and our grandchildren's money. That is causing us terrific problems today beca:use we do not have the savings to use to invest in new productive ca:pacity. If industry. is to grow, as it moves out in the world, learnshowto compete in other countries and how to export-the problem is to get them to invest in new productive capacity in Australia-several things need take plate. First of all, we need to generate some savings, because if we need to borrow all of the money for all of that new investment, we will only rapidly increase our debt. We are seeing that at the moment. The government talks about a huge recovery-massive economic growth figures of about 4112 per cent on average not only this year but also next year and the year after-and about Australia being the fastest growing nation in the OECD. It seems to me that that growth is coming toa screeching haIt very quickly. Anecdotal evidence in my electorate tells me. that about 12 months ago small and sized business owners were talking about investing, building, making new plans and exporting new products. All that new activity-'-and some of it did take place-is now slowing dramatically. That frightens me because that means that the unemployment but statistics in my area are going to stay rather static. We may hide some of those figures with some mickey mouse accounting techpetitive-halfway niques by putting some of the older or longthe teon unemployed beyond the reach of normal unemployment statistics by· putting them special benefits. We may hide some others through some of the job programs and some of the training programs, which would mean that they would not be counted anymore. What frightens me is that industry is not investing. If industry started to invest in a real hurry, which would be desirable, 'we do have the savings to be able to invest with equity. We will invest, once again, by going into debt. So we will build more debt and next year we will need more dollars to service lot of work. the debt, which will feed into the current account deficit, and so the spiral goes Interest rates will go up to try to contain explosion. The costs of industry will go up. Industry's construction and new purchasing will contract and then we will be back into the same old boom-bust cycle. because have not built a sustainable platform from which to go forward. If the government had really been .fair dinkum when it first started to reform the banks and open up the money market, it also would have reformed the labour market to rig of protectionism in the labour market. savings. Every time the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) comes into this place has cause to talk about his miraculous Indusinvest trial Relations Reform Bill 1993 he talks about protecting the· workers, protecting work force, protecting everyone who has job, at the expense of those who do not have jobs. What he does not understand is that all complications of his legislation and all the negatives implicit in his unfair dismissals court mean that industrycloes not have incentive to. invest, hire, develop new ducts, be innovative, teach itself new markethave ing skills and go out and build new markets. Australia has a lack of savings. Our debt too high and government spending is continuing. The government's budget is, without ·imagination.. We are indeed at the crossroads. We are sort of halfway in modernising the Australian economy from being isolated to fully comout of the. dark. ages into new enlightened era. But this government has chickened out. The Prime Minister has on gotten cold feet. He reckons he wants to win another election and the way to do it is to try to make everyone happy-let us not have an unhappy budget; let us not tell people that we cannot.afford to spend what we are spending; let us just spend it and let the debt be worried about tomorrow. It looks to me as·if this tired, not woIl1 out, discredited Labor government is about to give over to the coalition to let us try to fix up its now 11 years worth of mess. That is fine with me, but it is going to take a . The first thing we are going to have to do on. is reform our unique industrial relations any system. We are going to have to free up the .labour market and get rid of protectionism in the labour market as we are trying to get rid of protectionism in the industry market.· We we are going to have to use tax vehicles to encourage savings. We are going to have to simplify the taxation system in order to let individuals plan a little better. Along the way it might be nice, too, if we' could have a real increase in real wages so that people had get more earnings they could use to devote to It might be a good idea if we encouraged and industry, through the taxation system, to in new productive capacity. That is really what we need. We need new industry. the We have lots of bright, innovative, dynamic a people out there in'the Australian marketplace. We need to have them developing new products that they can sell here and export the overseas to get us out of this debt crisis .. We need education for management. I was thinking the other day that we need a bit of the lateral thinking. We have the Trade Union proTraining Authority, TUTA. Why do we not a management training authority, an MTA? Maybe we need one of those. I hear is Labor members on the other side of House talk from time to time about the fact that all our problems in the labour market are due to managers who have no managing skills, who would not know how to negotiate an enterprise agreement if it ran over them. Maybe they would not because they have not had 'a chance to leamhow. Why? It is because we have so many fixed rules and regulations about how that market works that they have no experience. Maybe we need a management training authority. We will think about that one. That would be a bit of lateral thinking, would it not? , 'We need to teach Australians andAustralian industry how to market effectively and internationally. It is important that as we develop new products we learn how to take those all over the world-into Europe, Asia and the developing countries. We have to help develop a real industrial base again because we need market diversification in Australia. We still rely too much, too heavily; on our mines and agriculture. Australia lived off the sheep's back and off coal, iron ore, copper, tin, lead, zinc and alumina for far too long. We need a solid manufacturing base built on quality, reliability, innovation and service. We need training for our people so that Australians can effectively work in the developing marketplace so that there will be good, permanent jobs for them and so that they can live a satisfactory lifestyle. The government could do, a better job of helping Australian industry by buying Australian andencouraging its 40,000 purchasing officers to' buy Australian at whatever price and when other indicators are equal to overseas supply. The government's budget stands condemned. NA",91
168,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"-""';Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Launceston Post Office",97
169,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Bass) (7.30p.m.)We hear a lot of rhetoric about committees, et cetera in this House and I would like to bring to the attention of the House a particular committee in my electorate. The committee is called KOPO, which stands for 'Keep our post office'. Last year I brought to-he attention of the House that the committee had got up and running to save the Launceston post office. That committee is still fighting enormous battle and is slowly, I do feel, winning ground. It certainly has not been easy. It isa bipartisan committee. It is made up of various members of state and local "" government,and I stand on it as the federal representative. There are various representatives frOm, local groups,including the National Trust. It is chaired by Mr Don Wing, who is' a member of the Tasmanian Legislative Council. Th- post office in Launceston is well over 100 years old. Australia Post wishes to sell it to; I presume; the 'highest bidder. In this instance, the people of Launceston have their hackles up and have said, 'No; it is our building, we part 'own it. The people that came before us helped build part of that post office, so we claim some sort of ownership.' Therefore, the committee is trying to save it one way or another. That determination has been enhanced by the fact that one of the heritage buildings in Launcestonhas been sold in recent years arid has become a shop front, to the detriment of the heritage value of the building. We do not wish to see the Launceston post office become a retail outlet, a restaurant or anything else. The committee and various committee members got busy and collected many' thousands of signatures from local Launceston people over a relatively short time; so the message was coming out bright and clear. In this instance, we are petitioning members of the parliament. ' Today in the gallery we have a former Deputy' Prime Minister and Acting Prime Minister of this country, Mr Lance Barnard. I would Jiketo pay tribute, to him for the effort he puts into the various things that are happening in his old electorate. He is on the post office committee. He is workingassiduously to ensure that the post office is retained in Pllblic ownership. He also works very hard to look after the veterans within the electorate of Bass. He also works very hard in the area of group training. This is a man who gave much of his life to the electorate of Bass. Even now at the fair age-may I say, as of 1 May this year-of 75 he is still working, and on a voluntary basis. In fact, he is located an within my office system and I am extremely proud, as the member for Bass, to have him help me in many instances. Many of the people that he lobbies on behalf of are the children and the grandchi1dren of the people he represented when he held the seat of Bass in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. It is people like Lance Barnard and members of this committee. who are doing the base groundwork and, in many ways, are the unsung heroes of Australia. They have a commitment-in Lance's case, he has a commitment to the people he once represented-to the area in which they live. We want to retain a good environment for the people we represent. That is where I c;ome in. I will work continuously to save the post office for the people of Launceston and for the people of Bass. It is a beautiful building. In February when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was there, he reiterated my thoughts and said that it was a· beautiful heritage building. I know he is extremely sympathetic to our cause. Launceston is full of heritage buildings. We are the third oldest city in this country. We wish· to retain the heritage buildings and continue our,support for those committees. I commend this committee to the House. MCDonald's MCHappy Day",97
170,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Last weekend I, along with other politicians, business leaders and community workers, was privileged to participate in the MCDonald's MCHappy Day where people at more than 400 MCDonald's stores across the nation worked to raise money for charity. One dollar from every Big Mac sold at the Caloundra McDonald's, and indeed every other MCDonald's store in the nation, went to the Ronald MCDonald Children's Charities and the Variety Club of Australia. I found it a uniqueetors ly humbling experience to participate in such an important promotion .. Along with other people, I arrived at the MCDonald's storeMr Ruddock-I don't believe it.",98
171,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member for Berowra is not helping his colleague.,98
172,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Initially, I was put to work out the back to learn in a production line how to produce the MCDonald's burgers. I was very impressed with the large number of young people working there; They had been given· jobs on. a training wage basis. I was also impressed by the very efficient means in which they produced a very good product. It is obviously a very desirable product because the many people from Caloundra came to.buy the product that day. Having graduated from the ptoductionline, I then went behind the counter. It was very interesting because the cash register' had all sorts of MCDonald's products indicated on it and it was necessary to press the right button to make sure that the customers were happy. After being trained to do that, I was sent out to make sure that the customers were happy. I felt like a graduate of one of the very many training schemes of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in that I learnt to make the hamburgers and to serve them and then went around to make sure that the customers. were happy. I was very pleased that members of parliament and other people in public life across the nation participate every year in this important project.. So often business gets pilloried and criticised for not carrying its weight. The MCDonald's operation really ought to be congratulated for implementing this very important and worthwhile community project which every year 'produces many dollars for charities throughout Australia. In fact, last year more than half a million dollars was raised throughout Australia for charity. I hope that this promotion continues. It is a wonderful opportunity for members of the community to work together to ensure that the disadvantaged receive assistance. It is absolutely great that a company.like MCDonald's is prepared to sponsor an arrangement like this. I would like to congratulate the propriof MCDonald's Caloundra for the work that they did and, indeed, the Caloundra community generally for the. very strong support they gave to the MCHappy Day promotion last weekend. Farm Forestry: Gilmore Electorate",98
173,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise OIi this occasion to indicate to the House that we in the seat of Gilmore have been successful in obtaining a grant for a feasibility study of farm forestry. Mr Speaker, as· you are a resident of. the south coast of New South Wales, you would be aware that from Sydney's south there has been a swelling up in the support of those who are against ocean outfalls; Durlng:a launch by the then Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), last year of the coastal policies of this governprovide ment, you are on the public rec()rd as showing your support for clean wat-rs and fOT the movement towards using effluent and effluellt management in a manner conducive to the long-term benefits. of the environment and the people in the economy. May I suggestto you, Mr Speaker, that you will be· very pleased with the work· I have been involved in with ShoalhavenEmployment and Training Incorporated. We envisage a third corporate entity. We envisage using effluent management services in such a way that we can create a new industry. Most pepple know that there is little venture capital in this country and,that in many)nstances the entrepreneurs of this country have let it down because they are no- prepared to put money into investments that will take 20 or 30 years to mature. The approach we have taken with farm forestry and efficient effluent management in the Gilmore area is to look at the three major components of the process. First, capital infrastructure is required to deal· with· the sewage and tum it into the major by-product, which is water-the solids are a very small part of it; the· problem we have is getting rid of the water. The traditional .method on the south coast, as you, Mr Speaker, would be aware, has been to pour it into the ocean. That is unacceptable. A recent survey by the Wollongong University of the Shoal haven people showed that 76 per cent were against that, 72 per cent were prepared to pay more to avoid it, and 52 per cent were prepared to pay up to $5 a week to stop it. On the basis of that, we are looking to have a third entity· created which would involve three players-the Shoalhaven City Council, the land owners, and the corporate sector. It is my vision that these three players will be able to forestall the necessity for venture capital.. As long as the effluent management services are running in the black-in other words, the charges that are levelled on Shoalhaven city residents cover the costs of pump'"" ing that water out and the capital infrastructure that has been put in-then we are in a position. where the capital from growing trees which will accrue to that community will in the long term a massive capital gain for that - entity. . We are now in the process of having a feasibility study to see whether technically trees can be grown using effluent. While that may seem strange, because it has been studied to death all around the world, there is some need .to do it on·· a local basis to test the compatibility of the Shoalhaven City Council areaI know that you, Mr Speaker, will be very pleased to follow this through. I know you will be interested in seeing whether the same sorts of approaches can be taken in your area-I know you are a· keen swimmer, I know you are keenly involved in the surf lifesaving movement, I know you are a surfer, and I know you are concerned about the environment and the quality of water. The fishing industry based in Wollongong and all down the south coast will be in a much better position when we have clean seas in which fish can be caught and exported· to Japan, Korea, et cetera. I commend the program being introduced. I thank DEET and the government for having so many wonderful programs. The reason this got up was that it had ticks across all of those policy areas. Farm Forestry Labour Market Programs",98
174,Mr VAILE,ADJOURNMENT,"Just briefly I might mention to the honourable member for Gilmore (MrKnott) that with the project that is being undertaken in his electorate, and it is a very commendable one, they might save themselves a great deal of money if they contact the CSIRO and a company by the name of Cassiro, who have spent millions of dollars developing the exact technology that the Gilmore project is looking at to establish a strategy. The technology exists; it is on the shelves at CSIRO. The honourable member might want to ask them about it. That is not what I wanted to speak about in the adjournment debate tonight. I wanted to highlight to the·House a number of anomalies that are being exposed through the application of labour market programs mainly because of the inflexibility of a lot of the programs the government has running at the moment. These have been brought to my attention recently by a number of constituents. The first is the relocation allowance, which is fairly widely advertised by the CES and involves unemployed people who may have prospects of finding employment outside their area. If that employment is found and established by the CES, then there is a grant available for the relocation of that person their family. But it is not available to people that go and find a job for themselves. I have had two constituents in this situation. One fellow left Taree and moved to Tumbarumba, where he had got a job as a car salesman. He came back to the local CES office to apply for the relocation allowance and was told that it was not available because there was one person listed at the Wagga··Wagga office of the CES as being an unemployed car salesman; It did not matter that the car de'aler in Tumbarumba had already employed this other person a couple of years before and would not even seriously consider employing him again. The fact remained that that family had to relocate themselves from Taree to Tumbarumba because the man found the employment himself. I had another case just last week where a young fellow had been unemployed for some time and found himself some work as a station hand doing farm work and fruit picking in the Orange area. He had been told by the CES that there were funds available for relocation if he found work outside of the area but they did not tell him that if he found the work himself, not through the CES, he would not get the fundirig. So he went ahead and got the job; he is at Orange working and his family is back in Taree because they cannot afford to move. . He did not get the relocation allowance because a number of people were registered on the lists in the Orange office of the CES, which maintained that they could be taking that job rather than bringing someone from outside. The question that should be asked is: why were those people not put onto that work in the first place? So there is a fairly large anomaly there that really needs to be addressed by the government. We frequently see that people are finding employment for themselves, because the CES is not finding it for them, yet what the government puts forward as a good assistance scheme for relocation is not available for people who find work for themselves. The third case arose only last week. A constituent of mine, Mr Rod Scott-Young, through his own ingenuity went and found and himself permanent employment with a local jeweller and jewellery manufacturer. Because of the jeweller's concerns as' far as the current IR legislation on unfair dismissal is concerned-which we have seen the minister tum around on to a certain extent this week-he wanted to have this chap work for a couple of weeks in a voluntary capacity to see that his work was going to be up to standard and he would then put him on full time. That was not acceptable to the CES. He was not able to retain his benefit while he was working in a voluntary capacity because it was maintained that he would not be available for other job applications or interviews with other employers elsewhere. Again there is not enough flexibility within the system. Provided he measured up during those two weeks, he would have had permanent employment. The employer was only safeguarding himself against being locked into a situation where he may have been liable under the new federal industrial relations act as far as unfair dismissal is concerned. The employee was quite happy to go along with that provided he could maintain or keep receiving his benefits for'that fortnight while he proved to that employer that he would be a worthwhile employee. He would have ultimately been given permanent employment, been taken off the unemployment benefit, and thus made a saving to the Commonwealth . Because of the rigidity of the rules and regulations, he was not able to do that. (Time expired) . Drug Related Crime",99
175,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"There is no doubt that in Australia drug related crime abounds. We spend large sums of money policing this, one might say with very little effect. There is quite clearly a very simple remedy. If we were to decriminalise the use of these drugs and make them available from chemists on prescription at a nominal charge-it would be at no cost to the taxpayer because the nominal charge would cover the cost of production-and simultaneously erase the penalties for using these drugs, we would attack crime at both ends: we would remove the high rewards that exist and increase the penalties. It is self-evident that this would work. It is amazing to me in our society that we do not try this. One has to ask why. It is quite clear that ever-rising penalties people who supply drugs simply raise the profit margin of the shadowy people in the background who are never caught. The only way to deal with those people is to destroy their markets. There would also be the advantage of supplying, in the case of the opiates, a very pure heroin or morphine. At the moment, this is cut with all sorts of noxious substances, many of which are very dangerous to health. The realities about heroin are that the main by-product is constipation, which can be remedied by taking another drugcaffeine in black coffee. It is a nonsense to say that people on heroin are unable to fulfil their jobs in the work force. There is no doubt that many people are able to take this drug recreationally. and perform quite well-much more effectively than they can on alcohol. I am told that we spend in the vicinity of $450 million a year on policing these hard drugs. Something like 290 people a year die from overdoses. Quite frankly, I have no sympathy for the people who die from overdoses of these drugs. I am certainly not prepared to spend that money to save their lives, particularly when for every one who dies-voluntarily, in my view-from heroin overdose probably two or three women die screaming silently in boredom or frustration in the community from overuse of analgesics. No-one cares about them, because they do not go out and rob shops to fund their habit. Quite clearly, if we are serious about this problem, we have to take another whole fresh look at it and return some responsibility ""to people. For years now we have had this nonsense of marijuana. Marijuana was freely available in this country until 1959; it was prescribed in chemist shops. I have never had any effect from marijuana. I have had much more effect from a strong cigar, which I have also now forsworn. I want to also look at tobacco and the nonsense that is talked about tobacco smoking. I believe tobacco is injurious to health, but I believe that people who take the decision to smoke tobacco know what they are doing and they recognise those risks. It should also be recognised that if people smoke for cigarettes and die before the age of 60 they actually save the taxpayers money. Ms Crawford-No, they don't. It costs us all in medical bills.",101
176,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"We would save a lot in pensions, because pensions are paid until the age of 75. Just as an aside in terms of health-I have a lot more to say-I travel regularly on aeroplanes. Probably no-one in this House and very few people in Australia travel more than I do. I never had any ill effects in aeroplanes when people used to smoke cigarettes in them. Since the airlines have stopped cigarette smoking in their planes, I suspect they simply do not clean the filters out as often as they used to because they do not have to and, therefore, the germs build up continuously. Every time 1 go on an aeroplane now on any lengthy flight I am plagued with sinuses which affect my quality of life. I do not know whether it is the lack of cleaning of filters or whether tobacco killed the bugs in the filters, but clearly this is a side effect of smoking which is detrimental to the health and welfare of a good number of people. Essay Competition",101
177,Mr RICHARD EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"Itgives me great pleasure to present to the House the comments of this year's winner of the Qantas/Cowan essay competition. Honourable members will remember that last year I initiated an essay writing competition for secondary school students, who were invited to write a 2,OOO-word essay on a set topic. As a side comment, it is interesting to note some of the comments of last year's winner, Nathan Barnes of Morley, who identified a number of initiatives the government could employ to reduce youth unemployment. Last year Nathan wrote: The very high level of youth unemployment can be put down partly to the lack of skills and experience, but the main reason is the relatively smaIl differential between youth and adult wage rates. In the guise of preventing 'exploitation' of young people the trade union movement has been able to keep wage rates higher than the market rate. This has the effect of making adult workers a more attractive employment proposition, and maintaining high youth unemployment. The foresight and understanding of Australia's present economic malaise by this young Australian is to be commended and congratulated. The Cowan essay competition is a unique and valuable work experience for young people in my own electorate to participate in our parliamentary process and to gain a valuable insight into the day-today workings of the parliament and their local federal politician. I would like to congratulate Monica Muski of Alexander Heights, a year 11 student from Morley Senior High School, on her winning entry. As part of her prize for winning the competition, Monica travelled to Parliament House to witness the budget proceedings. This year's essay topic was 'What should Australian politicians be doing to help Australian families?' It is a topic particularly relevant for this year, the International Year of the Family. I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues some of Monica's comments about what Australia's parliamentarians can be doing for Australian families. She writes: The family unit is the fundamental building block of our society ... Politicians as the leaders of the country have the power to change public facilities for the better and to distribute funds to areas they are needed most in order to help improve the standing of Australian families. Social Security and other financial assistance to families is just such an issue. There are many loopholes in the system and large amounts of money are misdirected. to individuals who have no real need for it. On the other hand, there are others f<;>r whom this assista!lce would be greatly benefiCial, however they' either have no idea that. such money exists, or they do not know where and how to apply to obtain it. . . ,. Health is another issue that many families have to deal with. Medicare,. although proyiding. a reasonable service for those not privately, insured, proves to be an extra payment for serviceS not necessarily needed for those who are insured. Providing those who have private insurance with large discounts from the Medicare Levy could encourage many to take ,up private insl1rance and ease the strain on Medicare payouts. Womens health is also a very important factor. Many women's illnesses, if detected early can be cured with minimum trauma and financial pain to the patient. However iffound later, the illness costs a huge amount in both financial and emotional terms to the entire family, not to mention the drain of government services such as Medicare. The - nsw-r to this is simply to remember that prevention IS better than cure, and that with regular checkups many women would not have to face the trauma of major illness. More womens heath care fa-iJities which are especially catered for female clIentele could be established. These health care units would not only provide people with a valuable resource but would also be a reminder and actual physical proof that the politicians of Australia care about Australian families and that they are willing to do something to assist the families of Australia. There are·many things that the Government can do to help the families of today. Let us hope that in this year-the year of the family-most of these projects will be fulfiIled to ensure the healthy growth of our nation's families. Mr Speaker, 1 think you will agree that the comments of Monica Muski, a young Australian who obviously cares deeply about her country and its future, deserves attention as do the hopes and fears of all young Australians. I would like to thank the secondary schools in my electorate for their continued support for this initiative, the local newspapers-the Wanneroo TImes and the Eastern Suburbs Reporter-for their continued publicity of the event, the Parliamentary Educawhere tion Office, and especially Qantas Airways, for their very generous support and sponsorship of the competition.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Aboriginal Organisations: Grants for Cattle Stations (Question No. 549) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 27 October 1993: (1) Do the figures provided in the answer to question No. 174 (Hansard, 31 August 1993, page 593), indicate that total sums of $2364014 and $2 113 309 were provided in 1989-90 to 1991 -92 for development of Noonkanbah and MilIijiddee Stations, respectively. (2) Do offers of acceptance in respect of funding for the two stations in 1989-90 to 1991 c92 indicate that total sums of $2 870 950 and $2 344 119, respectively, were to be released(3) Are there funding shortfalls of (a) $506 936 for Noonkanbah Station and (b) $230 810 for Millijiddee Station; if so, (i) what are the reasons for the shortfalls and (ii) will he instruct departmental officers to investigate the shortfalls and discuss the matter with the management of the respective stations. "" Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question was originally published on 15 December 1993 in weekly Hansard on page 4137. Following the receipt of a consultant's report a more comprehensive and definitive response to the honourable member's question is now provided: (1) No. The total suins provided in 1989/90 to 1991/92 for development of Noonkanbah and Millijiddee Stations, respectively, are $2,339,173 and $2,376,139. However, the figures provided in the answer to QON 174 indicate the total sums released to be $2,660,334 and $2,395,629 as the respective amounts of $321,161 and $19,490 were returned to AJ'SIC due to the organisation's failure to spend these amounts according to the purpose for which they were allocated. (2) An investigation of all records concerned with funding to the Noonkanbah and Millijiddee stations has revealed that offers of acceptance for these two stations from 1989/90 to 1991/92 indicate, respectively, the total sums of $2,407,470 and $2,376,139. (3) (a) There has not been a shortfall of $506,936 for Noonkanbah Station. Rather, it would appear NA that there was a shortfall between ATSIC's letter of Offer' and Acceptance and'subsequent release to this station of $68,297 in the 1990/91, financial year. (i) The reason for this shortfall may be due to the confusion caused, by the return of unexpended funds at the end of the financial year, the subsequent deferral of funds to the next financial year and the apparent variation in the allocation provided to this station for the 1990/91 financ,ial year. Oi) This matter has been investigated and a response to concerns raised by the Commonwealth Ombudsman on behalf of the management of the respective stations has been prepared to reflect the above advice. (b) There have been no shortfalls between ATSIC's letters of Offer and Acceptance and subsequent releases for Millijiddee Station. Ayiation Authority: Monarch Airlines (Question No. 627) Mr Sharp asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 22 November 1993: (l)Was the regional office of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) required by the manual of air operator certification to undertake a planned surveillance audit of Monarch Airlines before the crash of a Monarch Airlines aircraft near Young, NSW; if so, was the audit conducted and if not, why not. (2) Was the aircraft operating after essential equipment had been removed without authorisation; if so, (a) did the CAA know this and (b) was the Minister informed that the CAA knew. (3) How many hours had the co-pilot flown (a) on the type of aircraft involved in the crash and (b) in total.

(to) What is the usual period during, which an aircraft is permitted to operate under permissible unserviceability. ' (11) Is it a fact that the aircraft which crashed was ,engaged' in regular public transport, under permissible unserviceability applying indefinitely; if so, did this ,conform with the guidelines. (12) Diet the airpraft which crashed operate'with an unserviceable autopilot; if so, would a privately operated Piper. Navajo be allowed to operate with an unserviceable, autopilot for the same ,I.ength of time as did the Monarch Airlines aircraft. (13) Did Monarch Airlines insure its passengers; if so, what level of insurance applied. (14) Is passenger insurance compulsory for airlines engaged in regular public transport. (15) Was the CAA aware of Monarch Airlines' insurance status. (16) Is the CAA insured against (a) liability for failure to discharge its responsibility to regulate aviation and (b) personal liability on the part of directors; if so, in each case, tO'what level. (17) How many non-cOllformance notices have been issued to Monarch Airlines since November 1992.",101
178,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourlength able member's question IS as follows, based in part on information provided by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the Bureau of Air SafetyInvestigati,on (BASI): (1) No. The manual merely sets out recommendfor ed level of scheduled surveillance for flying operations. Scheduled surveillance by supplementary surveillance which is in response to particular situations. Both types of surveillance were carried out by the Flying Operations section of the Bankstown District office on severaloccaoperated sions prior to 11 June 1993. (2) The CAA's understanding is that at the time of the crash VH-NDU was operating with the autopilot amplifier and controller removed. ' (a) From the CAA's investigations no officer the CAA knew at the time that VH-NDU was being matters operated at the time of the crash with those nents removed. (b) The CAA have not advised the Minister that the CAA knew at the time that VH-NDU was being operated at the time of the crash with those compoTransport nents removed. (3) The Bureau of Air Safety (BASI) advised that the co-pilot had flown: (a) 41 hours on type (b) 951 hours total. (4) The CAA advised that the only requirement contained in the Permissible Unserviceability for the second pilot was that the pilot had to hold an instrument rating, which the second pilot did in this case. (5) BASI have advised that the pilot was endorsed for the Piper Navajo aircraft in November 1990. ' (6) BASI have advised that available evidence indicates that the co-pilot was employed on the basis that he would receive remuneration for the duties he performed during the flight. (7) BASIhave advised that the co-pilot was on a list, held by the airline, of pilots available for casual employment as co-pilots. (8) The CAA advised that its Airworthiness Instruction Number 5-26 provides guidelines for granting approval of Permissible Unserviceabilities under Civil Aviation Regulation 37. ' (9) The Authority advises that measures taken with respect to the aircraft VH-NDU were, in accordance with the Civil Aviation Regulations. Guidelines for the issue of Permissible its Unserviceabilities were available for the information of Authority staff. : ' (10) The CAA advises there is no ""usual"" period. Depending upon the item which is inoperative and the nature of the conditions imposed the period can be quite long. There was nothing unusual about, the of operation of the Permissible , Unserviceabilities applying to VH-NDU. (11) The CAA have provided the following answer. No. The Permissible Unserviceability applying to VH-NDU at the time of !he crash was a month expiring on 16 June 1993 or until the required components were available whichever is often replaced , occurred first. (12) The CAA have advised that at the time of the crash the autopilot of VH-NDU was unable to operate. It is not a requirement for a privately Piper Navajo to have an operational autopilot. (13) As the Monarch Airlines accident occurred while the aircraft involved was on an intrastate of flight between Sydney and Young, NSW, such as the airline's liability for the carriage of compopassengers and insurance fall within the jurisidiction of the NSW Government. In conformity with Commonwealth legislation covering aircraft operators engaged in interstate Regular Public (RPT), NSW law establishes a carriers' liability limit of $180,000 per passenger for intraInvestigation state RPT operations. (14) The Commonwealth does not require compulsory passenger insurance for airlines engaged in RPT operations. However, as noted in my response to part (13) above, the NSW Government requires compulsory passenger insurance for intrastate RPT operations. (15) 'The Authority was not aware, nor was it required to be aware of the insurance status of Monarch Airlines. (16)(a) Yes, to a limit of US$I,5oo,000,000.00. (b) Yes, to a limit of A$20,000,000.00. (17) The Authority advises that three NonConformance Notice items were issued on 18 Match 1993. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: Engagement of Former (Question Nos 772 and 779) .

Australia-New Zealand: Aviation (Question No. 967) Mr J ull asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 3 March 1994: Are Australia and New Zealand negQtiating a free air agreement to' Qperate between and within both cQuntries; if So', (a) what is the status Qf negQtiatiQns, (b) when will the agreement be finalised and (c) what are the main Qbstacles to' reaching agreement.",108
180,Mr BRERETON,A BC D,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Australia and New Zealand have agreed Qn the elements Qf a single aviatiQn market between and within both cQuntries. . (a) In August 1992, both GQvernments agreed Qn a program Qf progressive IiberalisatiQn Qf dQmestic and trans Tasman air services.

(c) As Qutlined in (a) .the single aviatiQn market between, and within, both .cQuntries will be in by NQvember 1994, as agreed by the two' cQuntries in August 1992. . AIDAB: ·AIDS Research Programs (Question No. 1080) Mr Richard Evans asked the Minister of Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, upon notice, on 3 May 1994: (1) Is the Atistrlllian InternatiQnal DevelQpment Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) evaluating the feasibility and wQrthiness Qf a project to' fund AIDS educatiQn programs Qr AIDS' research programs' in IndQnesia; if So', (a) at what stage are the evaluatiQns, (b) has the gQvernment made a fQrmal commitment to fund projects of this kind in Indonesia, and (c) when is a formal decision to be made concerning the project? (2) Does the government, through AIDAB, fund medical research or AIDS education programs in overseas cQuntries; if so, (a)which cQuntries,and (b) what sum is provided to each country? MrBilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A feasibility design study was carried out Qn the 'IndQnesia HIV/AIDS and STD Prevention and Care' project in OctQber 1993. The five year project is expected to commence in January 1995, with the Australian contributiQn cQsted at $17.7 million. The project's Qverall goal is to prevent the transmission Qf, provide quality of care for suffers Qf and minimise the impact of Se:x.ually Transmitted Diseases (STD) including HIV/AIDS. In contributing to' this goal the project will enhance the capacity Qf Indonesian institutiQns to design and implement effective multi-sectoral STD and HIV prevention and care strategies at natiQnal level and in three identified provinces (East Nusa Tenggara, Bali and South Sulawesi). Several preliminary activities including the shQrt term secondment of a Department of Human Services ancl Health officer to Indonesia have been undertaken also'. HIV/AIDS education activities will be incQrporated into mQst project compQnents. A project research unit will be based at the Indonesian Institute Qf Sciences (UPI) and will focus on the social, economic and legal aspects Qf HIV/AIQS in Indonesia (a) A field appraisal has recently been cQmpleted and with some modifications the project design document was appraised positively. 'Expressions of Interest' to' implement the project have been SQught from prospective contractQrs in the CQmmonwealth Purchasing and Disposals Gazette Qf 11 May 1994. (b) The gQvernment has made a fQrmal cQmmitplace ment to' fund the IndQnesia HIV/ AIDS and STD PreventiQn and Care project. (c) I formally approved the project on 11 April 1994. . (2) The Australian Government's main focus in this area is Qn HIV/AIDS infQrmation and education programs. Since there is no' vaccine or cure fQr HIV/AIDS, primary prevention is at present the only way to fight the disease. Australia, as a dQnor cQuntry, has the advantage nQt Qnly of being located in the region, but also' of having credibility in terms of its success in limiting the spread of HIV domestically through its comprehensive strategic approach to education and prevention. The main emphasis of Australia's development cooperation program, which is administered by AIDAB, has been to promote the ability of communities and people vulnerable to HIV to identify, 'understand and respond to the many and varied implications of the virus. AIDAB has also supported strategies to mobilise and assist support groups for the care of those pefsqns already infected; Support is provided through bilateral project funding for Australian indigenous NGOs arid globally throjlgh the WHO Global Program on AIDS and theUNDP HIV and Development Program. The focus of AIDAB's programs has been: informatioI;! and educatipn, specifically for those persons involved in high risk behaviour and for the general public; training for national and provincial health workers; .training for peer educators and non-formal counsellors, and assistance for govemJtlents in formulating national HIV/AIDS strategies."" Australia has also, provided funds to the WHO's Global Programme on AIDS, which includes clinical research and drug development as part of its mandate. (a) & (b) Total expenditure for HIV/AIDS prevention and care activities. has grown from $425,000 in 1987-88 to an estimated A$6.7 million in 1993-94, as ipdicated below.

(2) How many non-Australian pilots came to Australia to work as pilots under these rules in (a) 1988-89, (b) 1989-90, (c) 1990-91, (d) 1991-92, (e) 1992-93 and (t) 1993-94. Mr Baldwin-The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I am advised that: (1) There are two visa classes under which foreign pilots may be granted pertilission to undertake employment in Australia. The first is the Employer Nomiriationvisa class which provides for entry for permanent residence and enables employers in Australia to recruit highly skilled workers from overseas where t-ey have been, unable to meet their - eeds from the Australian labour market or through their own training efforts. The second is the Specialist visa' class which provides. for entry for temporary residerice and enables employers in Australia to sponsor workers with trade, technical or professional skills not readily available in Eslimated Australia. 1993-94 The Migration Regulations which prescribe the expenditure legislative requirements for both. the Employer ($m) Nomination and Specialist visa classes contain 0.03 safeguards' which are designed to protect the 0.31 employment prospects of Australian citizens and permanent residents. These include a labour market 0.38 requirement under which prospective employers 1.71 may be required to provide evidence of having 0.20 teSted the'labour market. There are also require0.36 ments that· applicants have, suitable skills for the 0.20 position, that prospective employers have a satisfac0.90 tory record ()for cominitJtlent to training and that 0.02 the positions will be paid in accordance with 0;02 Australian leve1s.ofremurieration and conditions of employment. ,. . 1.40 0.90 .0:25 (2) The numbers of visas issued to pilots in the 6.68 Employer Nomination and Specialist visa classes are - follows: .

Energy Consumption (Question No. 1115) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 4 May 1994: '(I) What plans does, the Government have to aggregate energy consumption for electricity users to facilitate their participation in the national grid for electricity? (2) wiil local government authorities be able to aggregate their electricity accounts in order purchase electricity competitively? Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) At this stage the Government has no plans to aggregate energy consumption, for electricity users. The reasons for this are as follows. Heads of Government made a commitment in July 1993 to introduce a competitive electricity market in south eastern Australia from 1 July 1995. It is proposed that such a market would enable individual customers to purchase their electricity directly from producers (generators) as well as from distributors. At the present time, it has been suggested that a 10 MW load should define the eligibility of customers to purchase electricity directly from the market; consumers having a load less than 10 MW would continue to purchase electricity from their local distributor. At the February 1994 meeting of the Council of Australian Governments, Heads of Government requested that the National Grid Management Council (NGMC) report on 'options and desirability for reducing the initial threshold level of customers permitted to participate in the ty market (noting that Vietoria has considered Employer lowering this threshold to 50kW by 1988),: Specialist It needs to be understood that the issue of aggregation is essentially one of access by custom18 ers to a competitive market. I support the general 120 principle that the market will operate with' greater 187 efficiency the larger the number of participants and therefore support a reduction in the threshold limit ;181 for access. I also support the general principle that 218 a group of customers should, be able to aggregate 210 demand so as to purchase bulk amounts of electricity in the market. I would expect that the NGMC would be providing advice to governments on the technical issues associated with the reduction in the threshold and the aggregation of demand, and that such technical advice would form the basis of decisions by Heads of Government. In particular, the feasibility of aggregating demand will depend on metering requirements and associated metering costs. A further practical issue to be considered is the financial effect of aggregation on state governments. (2) If local government authorities means electricity distribution councils then such councils will be able to aggregate demand and purchase directly from the market. If local government authorities means other, non-electricity; local government agencies then such agencies will be treated on an to equivalent basis to any other customers. Domestic Violence (Question No. 1140) Mr Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 9 May 1994: Further to the answer to question No 938 (Hansard, 3 May 1994, page 130) relating to applications under the domestic violence exemption to the twoyear relationship rule for permanent residence, how many persons are covered by the provision. Mr Baldwin-The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I am advised that the domestic violence provisions are available to all applicants for permanent residence on spouse grounds. Over the last three years applications for permanent residence on spouse grounds have averaged 8050 each year. As I indicated in my recent answer to Question No 938, since November 1991, 69 claims have been made under the domestic violence competitive electrici- provisions.",112
