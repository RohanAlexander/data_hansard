Motion (by Mr ISAACS) .agreed toThat the House, at its rising, adjourn until half-past 3 o'clock tomorrow. LEAVE OF ABSENCE. Motion (by Mr ISAACS) agreed toThat leave of absence for one month be given to the right honourable member for Adelaide on the ground of ill-health. TARIFF REFORM: VICTORIAN METAL TRADES.",13
1,Mr REID,Unknown,"In the absence of the Minister of Trade and Customs, .who, I suppose, has another engagement in the Hume electorate, and of the Prime Minister, I wish to ask the Attorney-General a question without notice. In view of the alarming statements which have been made by him - as to the terrible sufferings of those connected with the metal trades of Victoria, because of the low duties of the present Tariff; is the honourable and learned gentleman now in a position to tell the House that their condition has improved, or whether it remains the same ? I am sur? that we shall all be glad to hear-if my honourable and learned friend can give us the assurance-that the dreadful state of things to which he referred some time ago no longer continues, and that the position has to some extent improved. If it bas not improved, do the Government intend to take prompt measures to deal with it?",13
2,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"The Prime Minister will be here very shortly. The matter to which the right honourable member refers will be dealt with without delay, and' all information relating to it will be placed before honourable members on the introduction of the Tariff proposals.",13
3,Mr REID,Unknown,That will be done this session ?,13
4,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Certainly . DUTY ON HARVESTERS.,13
5,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I had intended to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs a question without notice; but as he bas again his Ministerial post, and run off to his electorate, I ask whichever Minister is representing him here if his attention has been drawn to the following statement, referring to the price of harvesters, which appears in a letter published in this morning's Argus:As anticipated by the majority of farmers, the proposed extra duty of iz£ pet cent, on harvesters has already resulted in an increase of prices, some of the leading manufacturers having raised the price of their machine, contrary to their promise to the Commission, one manufacturer especially charging £ 5 more per machine now than they were charging a month previously, having revoked their price-list about six weeks ago (presumably in anticipation of the additional duty), and issued a revised one last week to the above effect. I should like to know whether the Minister has seen that letter, and whether, in face of the fact that an increase in prices has taken place, the Government intend to go on with their proposals for raising the duty? I should also be glad to know whether the Minister will be good enough to inform the farmer who is the writer of the letter which' I have quoted where he can find the obliging foreigner who, according to the protectionists, pays the - duties ?",13
6,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,The answer which I have given to the question just asked by the right honourable member for East Sydney will apply to this question toa PERSONAL EXPLANATION.,13
7,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [2.34]. - I desire to make a personal explanation in reference to a matter referred to by the leader of the Opposition last night, in order to explain a mistake which has been made in quoting a. passage from his Free trade Essays. On the 19th June of last year, I delivered, in the Temperance Hall, a lecture entitled "" Protection-Past , Present, and Future."" I prepared the lecture carefully, writing it and reading it, and I have here the manuscript, which I shall have pleasure in showing to the right honourable gentleman if he cares to see it. On the 17th page of the manuscript appears the following quotation from an essay written by the right honourable gentlemanWill it not be time enough to manufacture everything for ourselves when we can saveinstead of now, when we would lose, by the operation ? Will it not be well to reap the advantages of the pauper labour of other countries until we are so great a nation that we have pauper labour of our own ?",13
8,Mr REID,Unknown,"That quotation is correct, although a sentence has been left out which should have been given.",14
9,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The lecture was reported in the Age on the day following its delivery. The report was, of course, a condensed one, as the lecture took an hour and three-quarters to deliver. Knowing the man who wrote the report, it is onlyfair that I should say that I believe that the mistake was the result of condensation or of an error. I do not think that the alteration complained of was wilful or malicious. - Mr Reid - Instea d of there being condensation, words were added to what I wrote - Two words were inserted in the place of one left out.",14
10,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The report of the lecture has since been reprinted from the Age, and issued in pamphlet form; but, now that it appears that the quotation in question has been wrongly reported, I am sure that the executive responsible for the pamphlet will withdraw it, and see that the quotation, if published at all, is published correctly.",14
11,Mr REID,Unknown,I should like to find out who put the words in. OUARTERMASTER-SERGEANT,14
12,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"for Mr HUGHES) asked the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the Government clared that the case of James Bums, of the Volunteer Permanent Staff of New South Wales, is not one for their consideration, but is one for the State Government to deal with? 2. Did James Burns serve on the Volunteer Permanent Staff of New South Wales for a period of ten years one month and twenty days - fro m n t h December, 1SS5, to 31st January, 1896? j . Did James Burns serve as a volunteer with the late New South Wales Contingent in Egypt, in the rank of a colour-sergeant, and was lie mentioned in despatches? 4. Did"" Major-General Hutton, at the first infantry school of instruction, single James Burns out as an example of smartness and ability to the other staff-sergeants? 5. Did Major-General Hutton, besides publicly commending Quartermaster-Sergeant Burns to the staff-sergeants, rell the Chief Secretary, after discharging him, that he was one of the best men he had; if so, why was no character entered on his dischaige? 6. Will the Government grant him compensation at the rate of a month's pay for each year's service, if his discharge was illegal and wrongful ? 7. Was Quartermaster-Sergeant Burns generally acknowledged by his superior officers to possess superior qualifications :\nd ability?",14
13,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Mr Burns was informed that his claim for compensation was not one for Commonwealth consideration. 2. Yes. 3. 4, and 5. There is no information to that effect in the office of the Central Administration. The only information available is to the effect that when Mr Burns applied for re-employment or compensation in 1902, Colonel MACICenzie, the Assistant Adjutant-General in New South Wales, wrote a minute to the effect that Burns' services were dispensed with in 1896, after two months' leave, that his conduct while on the staff was not too satisfactory, and no trace could be found of his name having been submitted to the State Government for compensation. In forwarding this minute on the 4th August, 1902, General Hutton confirmed Colonel MACKenzie's statement, and added "" I should not in any case have been prepared to recommend this ex-Staff-Sergeant for any special consideration, as his conduct was unsatisfactory."" 6. No. His dicharge took place five vears before Federation, and the Government cannot accept any responsibility for same. 7. Not known. MAJOR LE MESURIER.",14
14,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon BURNS. notice I. Is it a fact that Major and Honorary Colonel Le Mesurier- a member of the MilitaryBoard of Control-ha s failed in an examination which has been passed by several militia and have de- volunteer officers? 2. What is proposed to be done with this officer ?",14
15,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow : 1. Major and Honorary Lt - Colonel Le Mesurier did not pass in an examination of officers of the Permanent Forces for promotion to Lt - Coionel. 2. In the October examination this officer poses to again submit himself for examination. NA,15
16,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether the F i j i Islands are included amongst those British Islands in the Pacific with which the Constitution gives authority to the Commonwealth to eventually deal ? 2. Whether it is proposed to exercise such control? 3. Whether his attention has been drawn to the Agent-General's report on F i j i published in the London Times of 13th July, 1906, in which it appears that the imported Indian coolies had increased from 179105 in 1901 to 22,790 in 1904, and 25,009 in 1905, whilst the Fijians have decreased by 4,000 in same period ? 4. Whether this condition of things does not demand an immediate decision by the Commonwealth authorities as to their future relations with F i j i ?",15
17,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS,"The answers to the honourable and learned member's questions are as follow: 1 and 2. The Constitution, section 51, sub-section xxx., gives the Commonwealth Parliament power to legislate with respect to the relations of the Commonwealth with the islands of the Pacific, but gives no authority to assume any control, nor does it make any distinction between British and other islands. 3. Not until the honourable member gave notice of this question. The Agent-General referred to is believed to be the Agent-General for Immigration-a n officer of the Fijian Government Service in F i j i . 4.. The present relations between the Commonwealth authorities and those of F i j i are quite cordial. GENERAL ELECTIONS.",15
18,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS,"the Minister of poses Home Affairs, upon notice Whether the Government can inform the House if the general elections can be held later than the 15th day of November next?",15
19,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS,"The answer to the honourable orable member's question is as follows: The Chief Electoral Officer for the monwealth has advised that as far as electoral arrangements are concerned the election held on 21st November, or on any date after the 21st November next. NA AND EXPENDITURE. Motion (by Mr WILKINSON) agreed toThat there be laid on the table a return showing the revenue and expenditure of the Queensland Post and Telegraph Department for proeach of the five years immediately preceding 30th June, 1900; also, the revenue and expenditure on account .of the Postmaster-General's Department for the State of Queensland for each of the five years ended 30th June, 1906. WITH FIJI. NA AUSTRALIA. Motion (by Mr CARPENTER, for Mr. MAHON) agreed toThat there be laid upon the table a return showing1. The estimated number of Pacific Inlanders in Australia engaged in the sugar industry at 17th December, 1901. 2. The number of Pacific Islanders who were admitted into Australia to work in the sugar industry between 17th December, 1901, and 31st March, 1904. 3. Between 17th December, 1901, and 30th June, 1906, the number of Pacific Islanders engaged in sugar growing who (a) died; (b) quitted Australia. LANDS ACQUISITION BILL. SECOND READING.",15
20,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [2.43] - I move That the Bill be now read a second time. Paragraph xxxi., of section 51, empowers the Parliamentto make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect toThe acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws. Pursuant to that provision, the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act was passed in 1901, and sets, out the present law relating to the exercise by us of the power possessed by sovereign communities to acquire private property for public purj but, as the title of the measure is rather lengthy, it has been, thought desirable to shorten it by adopting the "" Lands not Acquisition Bill "" as the title of the measure, the second reading of which honmembers are now asked to pass-. It is not proposed to introduce any drastic alteration of principle. In the first inComstance, the whole of the existing law has been recast with a view to simplify the may be language and make it easier to comprehend. The old statute was built up upon the experience of the States, and, as some of the provisions were rather complex, it was desired by the Ctown Law authorities to recast the Act and draft it upon simpler lines, rather than to merely make any amendments suggested by the experience gained under the operation of the Statute. The Bill does not purport to introduce into the principles relating to the acquisition of public property for public purposes any drastic provisions. If honourable members will look at the measure, they will find that it is divided info six parts. Part I . contains a number of preliminary provisions. Part II . deals with the acquisition of land. Fart III . deals with the exercise of certain powers in relation to lands. Part IV. deals with compensation. Part V. relates to mortgages and encumbrances upon any land that may be acquired under the Bill ; and Part VI . contains certain miscellaneous provisions. As regards Part I . , it will be seen that several new definitions have been added with a view to making the measure more explicit. Additions have also been made to one or two of the definitions which, perhaps, could be better explained in Committee. In view of a suggestion that has been made. I wish honourable members to particularly notice the fact that the Bill relates solelv to the acquisition by the Commonwealth of land reciuired for public purposes, and for dealing with the land so acquired. It is not intended to ""serve any other purpose. "" Public purpose"" is defined to meanAny purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws, but shall not include the acquisition qf territory for the seat of Government of the Commonwealth under the Constitution.",15
21,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,We could not possibly go beyond that.,16
22,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"No ; and I am merely mentioning the matter because some misconception has arisen as to the purpose of the Bill. We could not go beyond the powers possessed by us under the Constitution, and this is merely a machinery Bill for the purpose of enabling us to exercise the authority we possess. In clause 6, a slight change has been made from the original provision. It is provided that after arrangements have beeni made between the Governor of a State and the Governor General of the Commonwealth for the acquisition of lands by the Commonwealth, the Governor of the State shall, by virtue of the measure, have power to execute the documents necessary for the transfer of the land. This provision is made in order to overcomecertain difficulties which have arisen under the States laws. Clause 7 does not depart from the original provision. Clauses 8 and 9 relate to cases in which persons have certain interests of a limited nature in connection with land, which it is sought to acquire, and is intended to enable them to execute the necessary transfer to the Commonwealth. The provision relates to trustees, guardians, committees in respect of lunatics,, executors or administrators, and others whose powers are limited under various State Acts such as the Settled Lands Act. A provision has been inserted in order to make it clear be yond all doubt that such persons possess power to transfer land to the Commonwealth under this Bill. The extent to which such power could be exercised was practically provided for in the original statute.",16
23,Mr MCCAY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Would this provision dispense with the necessity for registration under States Acts?,16
24,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,No .,16
25,Mr MCCAY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I think that it is very capable of being so construed. Would this provision dispense with the necessity of registration by the Commonwealth?,16
26,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The provision deals with cases in which property is transferred to the Commonwealth, and whose interest will be registered under the States Acts.",16
27,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The provisions set out that they "" may "" be registered.",16
28,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Yes ; but the Commonwealth is placed in the position of a corporation, and provision is made for the necessary presentation to the registrars of the States with a view to the registration of the CommonweaTth interest, and it is not likely that we shall depart from that. In clause 10. a change has been made. Under the existing Act provision is made that where land is conveyed to the Commonwealth by trustees or others, such as are referred to in the previous clause, the purchase money paid over to them shall be applied in the manner indicated in sub-clause 2. Now it is proposed that the money may, with the consent of the parties interested, be handed to the trustees, subject to the provisions of a trust declared by a deed approved by the Attorney-General, or mav be paid into the High Court or the Supreme Court, to be applied by the Court in the manner prescribed in sub-clause 2. This provision has been made in order to insure that money which is held practically in trust should be applied to the purposes of the trust.",16
29,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Paragrap h d is pretty wide - the Act. The Governor General,17
30,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"That provision was contained in the original statute. Court always pays due regard to certain well-established principles. In clause 12 a slight change has been made. It is provided that where a person is in possession of land, he shall be regarded as the - prima facie-no t the actual-owne r of it. This provision is necessary, because we have met with certain difficulties in dealing with persons who have not been able to give us a satisfactory title.",17
31,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,But how could the Commonwealth acquire land from a person unless they knew he was the owner?,17
32,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"There is nothing to prevent us from acquiring the land, but it is merely a question of paying over the purchase money.",17
33,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The money might be paid ever to the wrong person.,17
34,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The Attorney-General does not pay over the money until he is perfectly satisfied as to the right of the claimant to be regarded as the owner of the property. This provision would meet the case of a person who had been in adverse possession of land for a considerable time. Part II . deals with the acquisition of land, and is practically a re-draft of the original statute. No important departures have been made. The Commonwealth may acquire land in two ways-eithe r by agreement or by compulsory purchase. It is provided that the Commonwealth may acquire any land, but that does not mean that we may acquire land other than public purposes - an interpretation which, T am sorry say, has been placed upon it. whole measure relates to the acquirement of land for public purposes, and the word "" land "" is used merely for the purpose of short reference in drafting, because it is not considered necessary to specify in every case that the land is to be used for public purposes. Sub-clause 2 of clause 14 is a new provision intended to enable the Minister, without obtaining the authority of the Governor in Council, to enter into short leases of a minor character, such as might be necessary in the case of post-office premises. In a later clause, the Minister is empowered to .give short leases as well as to acquire them. The provisions relating to the acquisition of land by compulsory process are practically the same as those contained in has power to acquire land after giving The notice, which is to be published in the Government Gazette. At present, it must also be advertised in the newspapers. The notice is to be published in the Gazette, and laid upon the table of the House, and in clause 18 provision is made for the service of the notice. Under clause 16 the publication of the notice in the Gazette will have the effect of vesting in the Commonwealth the interests of the owner in the land that has been acquired.",17
35,Mr MCCAY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Paragrap h b of sub-clause 1 might operate very harshly against many persons. Take, for instance, the case of the owner of an adjoining, tenement having an easement over the land acquired.",17
36,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"We could also acquire the easement by compulsory acquisition, if necessary.",17
37,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,But the owner of the easement could not make a claim.,17
38,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The owner of any interest in the land is afforded an opportunitv to make his claim.,17
39,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The definition of "" l and "" covers easements. Mr Reid,-That meets the difficulty.",17
40,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Par t III . deals with the powers of the Commonwealth in relation to lands. When it is necessary to acquire land it sometimes becomes essential to make surveys beforehand, and clause 21 empowers the Minister or any persons authorized by him to enter upon any land and make surfor veys, take levels, sink pits, and examine the 1 soil, and do any thing necessary for ascerto taining the suitability of the land for any The public purpose. I am sorry to say that this provision seems to have been misunderstood. The Minister will be empowered merely to enter upon the land and to make the necessary examination so that he may ascertain its suitability for any public purposes. For example, if we desired to acquire land to be used as a site for a fort, or any work of that description, we should have power to enter upon the land and find out whether suitable foundations could be obtained.",17
41,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,That is quite a common provision in the States Acts.,18
42,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Yes , it is.",18
43,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Would mining be regarded as a public purpose within the meaning of the Bill?,18
44,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"We have no power under the Constitution to deal generally with mining. The sinking of pits referred to would have nothing to do with mining, but would merely enable us to ascertain whether suitable foundations could be obtained for the contemplated public buildings or works.",18
45,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"What I mean is, would the acquisition of land entitle the Commonwealth to all the minerals lying in or under the land?",18
46,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"That is another point, with which I shall deal later on. I am merely explaining the purpose of the provision, because some misconception has arisen in regard to it. Part IV . deals with compensation, and is practically a redraft of the sections of the existing law. With regard to the claim for compensation, some slight change has been made. Under the existing law, it is necessary to serve notice of claim upon the Minister of Home Affairs and also upon the Attorney-General.. Only one notice is really necessary, and accordingly we provide that notice shall he served upon only one Minister. Under clause 33, we further extend the time within which a person may serve that notice. He mav present it within 120 days after the publication of the notification of acquisition, or within 120 days after the completion of the acts in respect of which compensation is claimed. We further give the Minister power to extend the time for making any claim, instead of requiring the matter to be referred to the High Court. Clause 36 of Division III . , however, does contain important alterations of the existing law. The existing methods of settling disputes are to be superseded. It provides three ways in which disputed claims may be settled. A disputed claim may arise in this way : After the Minister has acquired the land in the manner prescribed by the Bill , a notice of claim for compensation may be served upon hint. The Minister may then offer the claimant a certain amount in satisfaction of his claim, and if the claimant does not, within sixty days thereafter, accept it or if the Minister notifies the claimant that he disputes the claim for compensation, the claim shall be regarded as a disputed nne. Clause 36 provides three ways in which such a claim may be determined: (1) By agreement between the Minister and the claimant; (2) by an action for compensation by the claimant against the Commonwealth; and (3) by a proceeding in a Federal or State Court on the application of the Minister. The first method is, of course, a simple one, in which the parties either arrive at an agreement that a certain price shall be paid, or consent to refer the matter to arbitration. The second method enables an action to be brought by the claimant' against the Commonwealth. In this connection we have made a departure from the existing law. At the present time an action for compensation can be brought only in the High Court. That is an expensive proceeding. In some instances, where very small claims have been in dispute, the Commonwealth has been called upon to pay more than it thought was just, rather than incur the expense of fighting an action in the High Court, and possiblv-owin g to the peculiar rules in connection with the payment of costs-be obliged to pay more in the nature of costs than the amount in dispute. With a view to getting' rid of that difficulty, and to providing a tribunal for the settlement - jf disputed claims, the Bill sets out that an action for compensation may be brought either in the High Court or in any State Court of competent jurisdiction. If an action be brought in a higher Court which ought to have been brought in a lower Court, the Judge is empowered to fix a scale of costs proportionate to the amount awarded. In clause 38 a new provision has been introduced. Our trouble has been that, when we acquire a piece of land, and the claim for compensation is in dispute, litigants sometimes decline to proceed with an action. We have an instance of the kind pending at present. It is a case in which we shall have to pay interest upon a large sum which is claimed for compensation, and in which the litigant disputed the amount, and would not institute an action in the High Court. In that instance the hands of the Commonwealth' were stayed. With a view to overcoming that anomaly, we provide in clause 38 that, if within siix months after a claim for compensation becomes a disputed claim, no action is brought by the claimant, the Minister has power to refer the matter to the High Court, and to have it determined. In clause 39 another new provision has been inserted. Unfortunately, under the existing law, if the owner of any land which may be acquired be absent from the Commonwealth, there is no method of having the amount of compensation to which he is entitled determined, because there is nobody present to institute an action. Accordingly, we provide that in cases where the owner of land which we wish to acquire is absent from the Commonwealth, and no claim is made within six months, the Commonwealth may make an application to the Court to determine the amount which is payable. We are thus able-accordin g to the amount of the claim which is likely to be involved - to take advantage of a Court of competent jurisdiction.",18
47,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Is that a new provision?,19
48,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"It is. Under the existing law we can acquire the land, and the Attorney-General is empowered to pay compensation into the Treasury, but there is no means of determining the amount of that compensation. Then the procedure in connection with the payment of compensation has been altered slightly, and a proviso has been added to clause 40, with a view to expediting that procedure. That is to say, if a claim has been made, and the compensation which has been awarded is less than the amount which the Minister has offered, the compensation shall carry interest only from the date of the claim up to the date on which the offer was made.",19
49,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,That is a very harsh provision.,19
50,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I do not think so.,19
51,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,How can the Minister be satisfied upon the point until the tribunal has determined the amount of compensaover tion payable?,19
52,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Unde r the clause the claimant will get the interest to which entitled.,19
53,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Suppos e that after claim has been made he does not accept the offer of the Minister.,19
54,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The provision applies only to cases where the claimant proceeds to litigation. However, that is a matter consideration in Committee. There are or two minor alterations to which it is not necessary to refer at this stage. Division is a re-enactment of the provisions of existing law, with the exception of clause 49, which relates to the rights of a gagee in connection with lands which are acquired compulsorily. That is a new provision. In the miscellaneous clauses the only provision to which I wish to refer is clause 62, which relates to mining leases and licences. When the Federation was established, it took over a large number of properties from the States, including rifle ranges in mining districts. These properties passed to the Commonwealth absolutely, and are subject to its exclusive jurisdiction. In Victoria especiallv, our attention has been drawn to a difficulty which 1 has arisen in this connection, and the Commonwealth has been asked to consider claims relating to mining operations upon properties which are used for defence purposes. Under the existing Act we have no power to issue mining leases, and yet the State could not lake any action regarding the properties to which I allude, because they had passed to the control of the Commonwealth. The matter was brought forward at the last Premiers' Conference, at the request of the Premier of Victoria. It was discussed, and a promise was made that we would introduce legislation upon the lines suggested in clause 62. Under that provision the Governor General has power to authorize the grant of a lease or licence to any person to mine for metals or minerals on any land which is the property of the Commonwealth.",19
55,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"In New South Wales, when the Crown parts with any land, a reservation is always made in its favour in respect to minerals which mav be found there.",19
56,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"That does not alter the position that when the Commonwealth, was established a large number of these properties, by virtue of the Constitution, passed to it. When we took over the land, we took with .it everything that might be found under as well as above the surface. he is This clause has been introduced in pursuance of a promise which was made at the the Premiers' Conference.",19
57,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I do not think we have power to invade the rights of the States.,19
58,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"There is no invasion of State rights, and this clause was introfor duced in pursuance of the promise which one was made to the Premiers that we would issue licences to enable persons to mine upon V. these properties. Inasmuch as it was not the deemed advisable to introduce a Commonwealth Mining Act which would apply to mortall the States, we suggested that the States laws should operate in each_ instance, and that they should be administered by the State officers.",19
59,Mr MCCAY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,B y whom may the Governor General authorize the grant of a lease ?,20
60,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,He authorizes the grant of the lease.,20
61,Mr MCCAY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Would it not be much simpler to enact that leases might be issued under State Laws with the consent of the Commonwealth ?,20
62,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I think that the method provided in the B i ll is the better one.,20
63,Mr MCCAY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"If the Commonwealth consent is required at any time, it would be much simpler to insert a provision such as I have suggested.",20
64,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The idea is not to pass a Mining Act for the Commonwealth, but where mining operations can be carried on without detriment to any land which is vested in the Commonwealth, to enable them to be undertaken. Our object is not - as has been suggested-to acquire land for mineral purposes in order that mining operations may be conducted independently of any publi'c purpose.",20
65,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The point which I have in mv mind is that the sovereign rights of the States to these minerals is not recognised.,20
66,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Unde r the Constitution, the Commonwealth has power to acquire all lands which are necessary for public purposes. If it were found, for example, that if mining operations were carried on underneath a large fort, they would seriously interfere with the value of the land for a fort, we would have power to acquire the whole of that land and everything in connection with it.",20
67,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,There is a difference of opinion in regard to State rights.,20
68,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I do not think that the honourable member has comprehended the position, or he would not have made any such suggestion. It is absolutely essential that we should exercise that power, in order that we mav discharge our duties.",20
69,Mr MCCAY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"As a matter of fact, there are many cases in which mining might well be carried on, but in which operations are blorked owing to the existing law.",20
70,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Exactly . Some of our large rifle ranges embrace areas of 500 or 600 acres.,20
71,Mr MCCAY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"At any rate, mining operation below certain depths will be auite harmless.",20
72,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Tba t is so. In some cases, it is sufficient for the Commonwealth 2 to take a grant from the States, still leaving to the latter a reservation as to minerals. We have done that already. The object of the provision is merely to give the Commonwealth rights which are absolutely essential for the acquisition of land for public purposes.",20
73,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I can see that it is capable of extension far beyond that.,20
74,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The honourable member is misconceiving the position. These are the only important changes in the existing Act which we contemplate making, and I now move the second reading of the Bill .",20
75,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"East Sydney) [3.14] - In the first place, I gather from the Minister that this is a Bill which is practically intended to simplify the previous Act, and to consolidate its provisions.",20
76,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,That is so.,20
77,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"But , as the Minister has in . timated, it introduces' some changes in the existing law-change s which he has explained. The first question that naturally arises in the mind of any honourable member is, "" What is the extreme and paramount urgency of this particular measure""? It is a measure containing some sixty-seven clauses, and in it a number of important points must be considered. I therefore desire to know what is the extreme urgency which warrants it being given preference over measures upon the business paper such as the following : the Electoral Validating Bill and-the Bounties Bill?",20
78,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The right honourable member may, if he desires, move the adjournment of the debate. I do not wish to proceed any further at this stage with the motion for the second reading.",20
79,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"As I have commenced my speech, I cannot move the adjournment of the debate without losing my right to - further address myself to the motion. We have on the business-paper the Electoral Validating Bill , the Bounties Bill, the Postal Rates Bill , the Copyright Bill , the Preferential Ballot Bill, the Spirits Bill, and the Excise Tariff Bill. We have only five weeks in which to deal with these measures, as well as the Estimates, and some other Bills relating to the Tariff, and vet my honourable and learned friend has calmly risen at this crisis in the business of Parliament to invite our attention to a measure that has no element of national importance or urgency. Whilst I have supported the Government in the measures they have taken for the protection of the revenue, I submit that we must not lose sighi of the cardinal principle which alone justifies the exaction of duties without the authority of the law. I refer to the fact that, whilst Parliament, for the protection of the revenue, will justify the illegal exaction of duties from the King's subjects, the period during which those exactions obtainmust be strictly limited. The illegal exaction of duties must continue for the briefest possible time. When such proposals are made it is the duty of the Parliament at the earliest possible date lo settle them, and to decide what duties, if any, shall be levied, in order that the condition of unrest, uncertainty and illegality may be brought to an end. We have on the business-paper a Spirits Bill , which the House ought to be ready to consider, and also an Excise Bill , a Bounties Bill , and an important measure relating to a change in the electoral and franchise law. Whilst we are in this trying situationhaving all these Bills to consider- a Lands Acquisition Bill is brought forward. I do not wish, however, to enlarge upon these objections- I simply point them out. I come now to a matter that is greatly to be deplored. I think that we should enr deavour in every way to cultivate friendly and harmonious relations between the Commonwealth and the States. There should be no unnecessary assumption of superiority. The Minister, in the course of his speech, used an expression which I think was ill-advised-whe n he spoke of this being a Bill for the exercise of powers by sovereign communities.",20
80,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I referred to the exercise of powers by the States as well as by the Commonwealth.,21
81,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,But I am going further than that,21
82,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The right honourable gentleman is under a misapprehension. These powers must be exercised by the States as well as by the Commonwealth.,21
83,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,That is the point; but under this Bill the sovereign right of the community is to be exercised over the sovereign rights of the States.,21
84,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Onl y so far as is permitted by the Constitution.,21
85,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I am merely criticising the use of such an expression.,21
86,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The right honourable member is attaching to it a meaning that I did not intend to convey.,21
87,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,May I suggest that the question is not as to the intention with which the words were uttered; it is practically one of fact.,21
88,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The right honourable member will recognise that I did not mean to convey the inference he suggests.,21
89,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I do not wish to be unfair to the Minister by saving that he had any desire to use an, expression that would be offensive. I refer to the matter only because it leads up to a more serious point. Great offence was given by the original title of this Bill . Instead of a plain, business-like title, clearly defining the object of the measure, and raising no question of superiority as between the Commonwealth and the States, the Government applied to the B i ll a title that was certainly an extraordinary one in the politics of Australia.",21
90,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,It is a well-known term in cqnstitutional law.,21
91,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I trust that the honourable and learned gentleman will permit me to express my views on this question. It was most grotesque that practical business men who know that the measures passed by all the States Parliaments have plain business titles should have been asked to consider a Bill bearing such a title as that to which I refer. We were suddenly electrified by the introduction of a serious measure bearing the title of the ""Eminent Domain Bill . "" Even some gentlemen who have passed legal examinations like to refer occasionally to law dictionaries, and I turn to a iudicial dictionary to ascertain what is the meaning of such an expression. It may be possible that the explanation will be of interest to the general communitv having regard to the extraordinary surprise that was sprung upon themEMINENT DOMAIN - The right which a Government retains over the estates of individuals to resume them for public use. Under this B i ll power is given to deal with the States which are sovereign communities, and yet by the application of such a title to it they were treated as if they were on the same footing as a private individual who owns an allotment of land. These quaint, fantastic titles can serve no useful purpose. As a matter of fact, the use of the title I have mentioned occasioned bitter debate in another place. There was a prolonged struggle, and the Government stuck to their guns in a wav that is unusual in this branch of the Legislature.",21
92,Mr SPEAKER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The right honourable member must not refer to the debates in another place.,22
93,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I bow to your ruling, sir, < The result of it is, that I cannot complete my observations on this point.",22
94,Mr BAMFORD,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,At all events the title was amended.,22
95,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I think that all honourable members know fairly well what I intended to say. A great deal of time might have been wasted oyer the use of such an expression, and possibly after a prolonged series of brilliant victories and defeats a most indomitable Minister may ultimately have been conquered. At all events the title disappeared. I point to these matters as raising all sorts of offensive issues that have absolutely nothing to do with business men. If mv honourable and learned friend has simply introduced this measure without any intention of proceeding further with it this session. I do not wish to further occupy the time of the House.",22
96,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"We intend to proceed with it this session,, and expect it to be passed.",22
97,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"That being so, I repeat my protest against the introduction of think, improvidently entertained. such a measure in the last weeks of session, when a number of matters of vital importance have to be discussed settled' in the interests of the Government. It is to be regretted even from their point of view that they should have nalized the last few weeks of the session - week s which they .should wish, in the interests of the public as well as for own sake, to put to good account-b viting honourable members to embark upon being rather an attractive panorama. a prolonged examination of a Bill which really ought to be considered far less portant than are a large number of other measures on the business-paper. The maining weeks of the session might well - be devoted to more important measures. My honourable and learned friend must cognise that the Bill gives rise to a ber of points which will provoke discusgive sion, and it is to be lamented' that should be asked to deal with them now, since the measure is not one of pressing importance. Already the Attorney-Geneinducements ral of another State has issued a randum in which he protests upon a ber of grounds against the provisions this Bill . . I do not wish at this stage occupy the valuable time of the House by referring in detail to that memorandum, but it possesses several features that well deserve serious consideration.",22
98,Mr ISAACS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I do not think that the right honourable gentleman can support the contentions raised' in it.,22
99,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I intend to mention one matter of which I have personal knowledge. The Minister referred just now to the objects of the provisions relating to mining leases. On the face of it, that object appears to be a perfectly reasonable one. As the Minister has said, he has actually been led fo take action so % far as thase provisions ""are concerned by the Premiers' Conference.",22
100,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,No-by several' requisitions. We have had twenty or thirty applications from Victoria.,22
101,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"In the absence of the illustration I am about to give, the provisions in question might not seem important, but I think that I shall be able to show that they may have a vitally-important effect on New South Wales. Some years ago, when I held office as Premier of that State, an application to. mine for coal near Bradley's Head had been, I Bradthe ley's - Head, as honourable members are aware, now forms part of a military reand serve. The Department had to some extent committed the State Government, but own I felt that it would be a monstrous outrage sigto have a coal mine sunk to a depth of 3,000 feet, and vast quantities of debris raised at that point in full sight of every their one using the Sydney harbour. I believe y in that the harbour has been heard of as I had t'o use my power to prevent that proimject being proceeded with, and the result was that the parties interested had to recommence operations at the back of Balmain. some miles further inland. I mention the incident in order to show that realthough on the face of it the issue innumvolved does not seem important, it might rise to a most painful' conflict bewe tween the Commonwealth and the States. Great influence will perhaps be brought to bear on the Commonwealth, and large offered to it to give mining memorights under military lands, and the numStates concerned might in that event be of most vitally interested in the question. to In these circumstances I think that the suggestion made by the honourable and learned member for Corinella was a very sensible one. We do not wish to create possible causes of friction between the monwealth and the States in connection with business undertakings into which the Commonwealth does not enter. Honourable members must recognise that we do not desire to deal with-mining leases or mining enterprises; we do not wish to trouble ourselves with matters of that sort. There are States laws and States appliances dealing with them, and, therefore, I think that the suggestion made by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, that power should be given to the States to grant leases, is a very sensible one. It would, if adopted, save the Commonwealth from embarking ona line of departmental activity for which it has no vocation, and the exercise of power which, except in rare instances, it has no opportunity to exerciseI should like to suggest that the clause in question be put right.",22
102,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Does the right honourable member mean that the States should be permitted to grant leases with the consent of the Commonwealth?,23
103,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I should not have the slightest objection to the Commonwealth having power to decide whether .these things should be done.,23
104,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The consent of the Commonwealth would be necessary.,23
105,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Subjec t to the consent r>f the Commonwealth that the land might be used for mining purposes, the States should have power to grant leases.",23
106,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The Commonwealth must have power to prescribe regulations.,23
107,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"If the States have in operation machinery necessary for this particular purpose-apar t from the question of regulations, which really amount to nothing-econom y will be effected if they are left to deal with these matters. I am sure that the intention of the Government is not to establish new machinery. If the Commonwealth consented to the issue of a permit to carry on mining, the States might refuse to grant the necessary appliances, and the Commonwealth would exercise its superior power as owner of the land, and would itself make rules and regulations, and pppoint officers to carry them out. All these matters suggest possibilities of conflict and of differences of Opinion which we cannot be too readv to avoid. I do not propose now to deal with the details of the measure. Although there are a number of provisions to which I should like to refer, I admit that this is not the time to Com- do so. I shall, therefore, merely express my regret that, when time is of so much consequence, and there are so many vital matters to be dealt with, the Government % have determined to go on with a Bill which, with all respect to the Minister of Home Affairs, is of trivial importance, remembering the great pressure upon Parliament, and the short period within which we can do useful work.",23
108,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Angas) [3.31] - In reference to the point raised by the right honourable member for East Sydney, in connection with clause 62, I would point out that by clause 57 the Commonwealth is created a corporation for the purposes of this measure. I do not see, therefore, that the suggestion that the States should lease this land can be carried into effect. It will be possible, however, when the Commonwealth does not require land which has been vested in it, to lease it to the States, and the States can then make what arrangements they please with private individuals in regard to it. Clause 57 creates a corporation, to be known as "" The Commonwealth of Australia,"" in which lands acquired by the Commonwealth are to be vested. That being so, it would be difficult to provide that the States may lease such land. I see no objection, however, to the Commonwealth, instead of selling surplus land under clause 63, leasing it or the right to mine, to any one who may be disposed to take it, and the States could make it Crown land by Act of Parliament, if it were not covered by the definition. At any rate, there are ways of getting over the difficulty. With regard to the title originally adopted for the Bill, I think that it was a mistake to term the measure the Eminent Domain Bill. The use of thlat title would not have enlarged the powers of the Commonwealth, while the title itself would have been a misnomer, , since eminent domain in the lands of the country, that is the residual power of sovereignty, remains with the States, and has been given to the Commonwealth by the Constitution for certain purposes only, namely, in regard to the acquisition of land under section 51 of the Constitution, or in connection with the transfer of properties used for the administration of transferred Departments of Government. It was thought in the Convention that powers of sovereignty would, as a matter of law, belong to the Commonwealth, as they do to the States, if this provision were not inserted, and, it having been inserted, it seems to me to limit, rather than extend, the powers of ' the Commonwealth. It is an express provision which is not contained in the American Constitution, under which powers of acquisition are implied, and, of course, limited to the purposes of the powers delegated to the central body. The powers given here are directly prescribed by section 51. The general powers of sovereignty, therefore, belong to the States, so long as they have not been delegated. That is clear from the fact that in America, though the lands are vested in the Commonwealth, that is, in the Federal Government, it has been decided that the powers of sovereignty in relation to eminent domain belong only to it in relation to the territories. The moment a territory becomes a State, the special powers of eminent domain, so far as they are not delegated to the Federal Government, belong to the State.",23
109,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Then the title would 'have been a wrong one to use ?,24
110,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I think that it would have been wrongly applied.,24
111,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,It is used in the United States in reference to land generally.,24
112,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,That is in reference to the powers of the States.,24
113,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"And in reference to the powers of the Commonwealth, too.",24
114,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I consulted Cooley on Constitutional Limitations just before the House met, and found that he draws a strong distinction. He says that thepowers of sovereignty of eminent domain do not belong to the Commonwealth of America, that is, to the Federal Government, but belong to the States. They are in the Commonwealth only as a land-owner in relation to a territory. The moment the territory becomes a State, the powers of the Federal Government are exercisable for specific purposes only, which are the particular powers vested by delegation in the Federal Government, and no more. The use of the term eminent domain would, therefore, not have extended the scope of the measure, but would have been somewhat invidious, so far as the States are concerned. 9 That, I suppose, was the chief ground of the objection which was taken to the title elsewhere. T h B i ll seems to be a consolidation of the existing law for the purpose of getting over a few flaws, some of which were pointed out in [""3] 1901, and, as the Minister has explained, to clear up certain points connected with the original drafting. I do not know that the drafting has been made more clear in some respects. It seems to me that confusion has been introduced. Some of the points which it is now endeavoured to make clear were mentioned in 1901. For instance, opposition has been shown to therBill on the ground that it gives power toresume the park lands of the cities of the States. That objection was taken in 1901.. But the present Bill was not framed to meet it. I pointed out in 1901 that the measurethen before us gave power to the Commonwealth to resume the park lands of the States. If the Commonwealth wishes to erect a building for defence purposes, or a post-office, on the park lands of any State,, it can resume such land under the Act of J901. I do not think that that power should have been granted, though, of course, it could be granted. Why should the Commonwealth acquire part of the park lands of our cities? Is it necessary to erect on such land a building for any of the purposes of the Commonwealth Government ?",24
115,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Has the Commonwealth the right to take lands dedicated by the State for anv purpose?,24
116,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Yes .,24
117,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Shoul d we do so?,24
118,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I do not think so. a l though, under the Constitution, we have power to legislate for the resumption of such land.",24
119,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,That power is not likely to be exercised except for some necessary purpose.,24
120,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The Commonwealth wished to erect buildings on the Centennial Park, Sydney, for militarv purposes . 1",24
121,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The Bill, like the Act of 1901, dees not prevent the resumption of park lands, though an attempt was made in the other Chamber to do so.",24
122,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,It was expressly provided for in the Senate.,24
123,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I find, by reference to page 5460 of Volume IV. of Hansard, that I mentioned, in 1901, that the park lands which surround Adelaide, and have been dedicated under a State Act, could be acquired by the Commonwealth. But. ale though that was pointed out at the time, the Government of the day would not assist honourable members to make an amendment in the Bill of 1901 to prevent it . A provision has been inserted in this Bill to qualify this power of acquisition, clause 19 providing that, where land is Crown land of a State, dedicated for a public park, or for the recreation or amusement of the public, either House of the Parliament may pass a resolution that the notification shall be void and of no effect, and that then the land shall be deemed not to have been vested in the Commonwealth. That, however, is not very much protection to the States. It simply transfers from the Executive to the Parliament the right to say whether such land shall be acquired by the Commonwealth. I should Like tp see a provision inserted preventing, the acquisition of park lands. Independent of such land, there is other land as suitable, or nearly as suitable, available for the purposes of the Commonwealth. The provision of the law as it stands has given rise to some Opposition and a good deal of disquietude, and therefore I should like to see it excised. Regarding the drafting of the measure, it is difficult to speak with emphasis, because of its technical character ; but I do not know that a glance at its clauses shows that the law has been made much clearer in some respects. For instance, clause 5 says that"" Land "" includes any estate or interest in land (legal or equitable), and any easement, right, power, or privilege over, in, or in connection with land, and also includes Crown land. Clause 8, however, speaks ofAny person seized, possessed, or entitled to Constitution. any land, and goes on to refer to interests have resulted from the cutting up of the fee-simple into a series of estates coming into existence in succession. one may well ask if the words "" any perin son entitled to any land "" refer to the possession of any estate in land or to the possession of an estate in fee simple. That there may be some doubt on the matter is, I think, clear from the wording of the Act of 190X, which refers toAll parties seized or possessed of or entitled to any such land or any estate or interest therein. A distinction is there drawn between a feesimple and a lesser estate or interest. It was evidently contemplated that persons could dispose only of the interests to which they were entitled, and would be compensated separately for each interest.",24
124,Mr ISAACS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Will the honourable and learned member look at section 22 of the Acts Interpretation Act? Mr Glynn.,25
125,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The Attorney-General refers me to the definition of "" land "" contained in the Acts Interpretation Act; but that does not affect my point, because there is a special definition in this Bill, and there cannot be two definitions for the purposes of one measure. If there were two definitions, and they were in agreement, one s would be superfluous, while, if they were not, one would contradict the other. My point is that the meaning of "" land,"" as used in clause 8, is not clear. It may be used to refer to an estate in fee simple or to any lesser estate. There aire other provisions in which I think confusion, rather than clarity, is introduced, though these are matters which may best be dealt with in Committee. While the Bill does not alter the existing law, it deals with matters of fundamental importance. I should like to know what the Government intend to do with regard to clause 64, which is as follows:Any land which, before the commencement of this Act, has been acquired by the Commonwealth from any State or person, or has by virtue of section eighty-five of the Constitution become vested in the Commonwealth, shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to have been acquired under this Act, and to be vested in the Commonwealth as if acquired under this Act. I presume that that means that the Commonwealth could pay, according to the scheme provided by this measure, for properties acquired under section 85 of the At an earlier stage in the Bill provision is made for the method of which payment. Clause 41 providesThe compensation payable to a State in respect of any land acquired under thisAct may, Therefore, at the option of the Governor General, be paid any of the following modes,' that is to say(a) by payment to the State of the amount of the compensation; or (4) by the Commonwealth becoming responsible to the State for its liability for principal and interest in respect of such a part of the public debt of the State as is the actuarial equivalent of a three and one-half per cent, loan of the same currency and of the amount of the compensation. That deals with the transferred properties. To some extent it is constitutional, and to some extent it is not. It is provided in sub-section 11. of section 85 of the ConstitutionThe Commonwealth may acquire any property of the State of any kind used, but not exclusively used, in connection with the Department; the value thereof shall, if no agreement can be made, be ascertained in, as nearly as may be, the manner in which the value of land or of an interest in land, taken by the State for public purposes, is ascertained under the law of the State in force at the establishment of the Commonwealth. Therefore, as regards land not exclusively used in connection with the Department the valuation must be ascertained as nearly as may be possible under the laws of the State, and, so far as the provision in the Bill is an attempt to override the provisions of the Constitution, it will be ultra vires. As regards property hitherto acquired and not paid for, or to be acquired in the future, the method'of compensation is prescribed by the Bill, and therefore we are really now dealing with matters of big policy. The provision is that the land shall be paid for either in cash or in bonds bearing interest at 3J per cent. Of course that is a very sound principle, but if the clause is to mean anything, we should piovide for giving effect to it. That cannot, however, be done without the consent of the States. We cannot take over the States debts except at the rate of so much per head of the population, and, therefore, I do not see how we can aoDly this ptovision. Section, 105 of the Constitution providesThe Parliament may take over from the States their public debts as existing at the lishment of the Commonwealth, or a proportion thereof, according to the respective numbers of their people, as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth. In view of this restriction, I do not know how we are going to work the provision in the Bill. I think it is a pity that the Minister should have brought in a Bill for the consolidation of the law relating to the acquisition of public property without consulting the States, with a view to inducing them to pass the necessary Acts to enable us to take over their debts to an amount sufficient to wipe off, as far as possible, the indebtedness in regard to the transferred properties. There are several other provisions in the Bill which, I think, could better be dealt with in. Committee. Debate (on motion by Mr JOHNSON) adjourned. ELECTORAL VALIDATING BILL. SECOND READING.",25
126,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [3.50] - I move That the Bill be now read a second time. This is a short, technical measure, introduced for the purpose of allaying doubts [""3l- 2 which have arisen in connection with the distribution of seats in New South Wales. Sections 17 and 18 of the Electoral Act provide that when the Commissioner has completed his report, he shall post it, together with a map of the proposed division in certain public places, and that within thirty days any person may lodge any objection or suggestion in writing. Jt is further enacted that the Commissioner shall consider all objections and suggestions so lodged before making his final report, In connection with the distribution in New South Wales, two or three alterations were made upon the strength of verbal suggestions to the Commissioner. These suggestions, which were not made in writing, as required by the law, involved the interests of a fairly large number of electors.",26

128,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The Crown Law officers, after carefully investigating the matter, have come to the conclusion that objections or suggestions acted upon by the Commissioner must be made in a manner prescribed by law.

140,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,To both.,27
141,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,What is proposed to be done with the present post-' office?,27

143,Mr STORRER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Bass) [4.1] - Am I to understand that this amount is to be paid out of the funds of the Commonwealth per capita?,27
144,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Yes .,27
145,Mr STORRER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"In Tasmania new post-offices have been erected since Federation was accomplished, and these buildings have been paid for out of Tasmanian funds. Until all these works are dealt with under the per capita system, it seems to me that an injustice will be inflicted upon those States which, prior to Federation, erected buildings, for which they are now receiving no rent whatever.",27
146,Mr CAMERON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Wilmot) [4-2] - I wish to know whether the proposed work is a new one entirely, or whether a fresh building is merely to be erected in place of an old one?",27
147,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,It will be an entirely new building.,27
148,Mr CAMERON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Has there never been a building there before?,27
149,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,There has been a Customs building.,27
150,Mr CAMERON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Then how can the cost of erecting the new building be charged upon a per capita basis ? To my mind, it is distinctly expenditure which ought to be charged to Western Australia.",27
151,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I suppose that the proceeds from the sale of the old building .will be distributed per capita?,27
152,Mr CAMERON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I should like to know from the Minister whether the proceeds from the existing building will be divided amongst the States upon a per capita basis, or whether the structure will be considered an asset of Western Australia ?",27
153,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Angas) [4.3] - It seems to me that the real question which the States have to consider is the effect of the total expenditure. The Budget papers show what would be the effect upon each State of applying the method of debiting the expenditure per capita, instead of under the old system. I think that our power to vary. the provisions of the Constitution in this respect will become operative in about another month. I repeat, that the only way in which we can judge of the effect of debiting our expenditure upon the per capita system is by looking at the totals of the various items of expenditure in the different States, and not at any particular item.",27
154,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Wentworth) [4.4] - I think that the Minister might well tell us what is proposed to be done with the proceeds derived from the old building at Fremantle.,28
155,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [4.5] - So far, we have not sold any public buildings belonging to the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, we are endeavouring to arrive at a' friendly arrangement with the States in respect of transferred properties. In some instances, the States are taking back properties which are burdensome to us. In this matter, we are treating Tasmania in exactly the same way as the other States are being treated.",28
156,Mr CAMERON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Unfortunatel y no new buildings are to be erected in Tasmania.,28
157,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I believe that in time Tasmania will require a great many new buildings. Of course, we have to look at this matter from an Australian stand-point.",28
158,Mr KING OMALLEY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The Minister viewing it from an-Australian, and not a Tasmanian, stand-point.",28
159,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Some time ago it was decided by the right honourable member for Balaclava, who was then Treasurer, that > all these buildings were new works, and as such should be""charged for as "" other "" expenditure. We are merely following the rule which he laid down.",28
160,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Lang) [ 4 . 7 ] - I notice that this building is to cost £ 1 5 , 0 0 0 .",28
161,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,That is the cost of the land and the building.,28
162,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,It is proposed to erect this building upon an entirely new site?,28
163,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Yes ; we have to acquire a new site nearer the shipping.,28
164,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Then what is the reason for the Government proposal to erect a new Customs House? Is it because the present building is no longer useful ?,28
165,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"It is in a dilapidated and insanitary condition, and has been reported upon to that effect.",28
166,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I think that honourable members are entitled to understand the reasons underlying all these proposals. No doubt, when the expenditure proposed is reasonable, no opposition will be raised to the items. There is just one point, however, upon which I should like to gain information. It occurs frequently throughout the Estimates. I refer to unexpended balances. It may be that when we are asked to authorize an expenditure of £ 1 , 0 0 0 during the current year in connection with a new building, there is an unexpended balance from the previous year. I should like to know whether these balances will be added to the votes which are authorized on the Estimates now under consideration ?",28
167,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Unexpende d balances absolutely lapse.,28
168,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I have a reason for raising this question, because something relating to it cropped up the other day in connection with the Audit Act. It was then pointed out that sometimes these balances are kept in hand, arid added to the votes for the current year. Thus it is quite possible that there might be an unexpended balance of £ 5 0 0 or £ 7 0 0 , so that, when we voted £ 1 , 0 0 0 in connection with any work the actual expenditure would be brought up to £ 1 , 7 0 0 .",28
169,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Darling Downs-Minister is of Home Affaia-s) [4.9] - In reply to the honourable member, I would point out that if any vote is not expended during the financial year it absolutely lapses. In such cases, no payment is really made. Whatever amount is appropriated for 1906-7 represents the total amount of the appropriation. Mr GLY'NN (Angas) [4.10] - I mentioned just now that it is necessary for honourable members to look at the total expenditure in connection with all works, if they wish to ascertain the effect upon the States of debiting that expenditure per capita. In the case of Tasmania, I find that if the expenditure upon new worksi in that State were debited upon a population basis the amount which she would be required to pay would be £ 2 9 , 0 0 0 , whereas if she had to pay for them herself she would contribute only £ 2 1 , 0 0 0 . So that she really gains £ 8 , 0 0 0 by the system which is being adopted. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON (North Sydney) [4.11] - I understand it has been decided that a new Customs House is neces1 sary at Fremantle, either upon the old site or upon a new one. The reason why a new site has been selected is that the harbour works have thrown the shipping into another portion of the city, and the existing building is therefore in a rather inconvenient position.. The same remark is applicable to the post-office. Its business has outgrown the accommodation provided, and instead of enlarging the present building it is proposed to erect a new one in a more central portion of the-town. Seeing that the Commonwealth can only use the, two existing buildings for the Customs or post-office purposesto which they have previously been put, surely the State Government-whic h might put them to many uses-shoul d be willing to take them over. I think it is desirable that that should be the understanding upon which the vote is authorized. Seeing that Western Australia is to obtain new offices-owin g to the unsuitability of the existing buildings- I think that it ought to be prepared to take over the old structures, so as to avoid their cost being debited to the Commonwealth. Proposed vote agreed to.",28
170,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Wentworth) [4.13] - I should like to gain some information in reference to the proposed expenditure of £8.000 upon a trawler and equipments. A Commonwealth trawler can trawl only outside the territorial limits of and therefore honourable members should be informed of the results which are expected to accrue from this proposed expenditure.,29
171,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [4-14] - This item is really part and parcel of a scheme for the proper investigation of the fishing resources of Australia. It has been suggested that we should obtain a trawler, which shall be used purely for the purpose of ascertaining the wealth of the deep-sea fisheries along the whole of our coast-line.",29
172,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Is the trawler tp be used inside or outside territorial limits?,29
173,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"In some instances it will be used outside those limits. For example, if honourable members will look at the map, they will see that the boundaries of Queensland extend right up towards the coast of New Guinea. They cover a great expanse of water, which really is part of the high seas. I understand, however,' that the honourable member, m speaking of the ""territorial limits,"" has in mind the ordinary three-mile limit.",29
174,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I use the term in the sense in which it is employed in the Constitution.,29
175,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"As used in the Constitution it is open to two or three meanings, but as ordinarily understood, "" territorial limits "" means a distance within three miles of the shore. If , as the result of the operations of this trawler, it is found that large quantities of fish can be secured in our waters, the fishing industry may be established on sound lines.",29
176,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,What will be the size of this vessel?,29
177,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I cannot say offhand what its exact size will be, but the amount on the Estimates will be sufficient to provide for the construction of a trawler on the lines of those operating at present in other parts of the world. The principle involved is not a new one. It has been freely and successfully exercised by the Cape Colony Government. In 1897 a boat called the Pieter Faure- a modern type of steam trawler-wa s acquired by that Government at a cost of £7,000 or £8,000 to engage in deep-sea trawling operations along the South African coast.",29
178,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The cost was £6,500.",29
179,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The New South Wales Government expert states that the cost was between £7,000 and £8.000. The Government biologist reports that, as the rethe States', sult of this experimentIt was soon demonstrated that there was an abundance of fish, notwithstanding what was said to the contrary, and that there was an excellent trawling ground, rivalling with the North Sea in productiveness. In 1899 the Government again took the work in hand, and in a short time the trawler produced a profit of over £300. Private enterprise was then left to deve lop the industry, with the result that, in 1.903, according to the report of the Government biologist, four steam trawlers, each considerably larger than the Pieter Faure, and over £30,000 in value in all, arrived from Europe to follow up the work initiated by the Cape Government.",29
180,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,These additional trawlers were provided by private enterprise ?,29
181,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"That is so. The Government having proved that large supplies of fish existed, private enterprise was left to develop the industry. The report of the Government biologist also sets forth thatTwo other vessels fitted up with special refrigerating arrangements for South African trade have arrived during the course of the.year. Another large boat, 250 tons gross register, designed as a carrier and trawler, was valued at ^'7,500. Other trawlers are at work in addition to those mentioned and continue to do profitable business. I;n a letter dated n t h April, 1906, the Prime Minister of Cape Colony wrote to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth as follows: The latest information from the trawling companies now established indicate that they are doing well, and are sending large quantities of fish to the inland towns. It will thus be seen that the South African experiment was successful in revealing large sources of food supply that were previously unknown, and that, as the result of it, the inland towns of Cape Colony have abundance of fish.",29
182,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,What parts of the Australian coast will be dealt with?,30
183,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"That will depend on the advice of the Government expert. honourable member will turn to the report issued by the Minister of Trade and CuSf toms in connection with the Bounties Bill , he will find that there are many points along tht Australian coast where investigations could probably be made with profitable results, but it is impossible for me to say where .operations will be commenced. The trawler will probablv be sent in the first instance to such parts of the coast as the authorities deem to be the most promising and the most desirable to examine. report issued by the Minister of Trade and Customs deals very fully with the prospects of successfully developing the fishing industry. The quantity of fish annually imported into Australia is 13,000,000 lbs., valued at about £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 . supply is spasmodic.",30
184,Mr DUGAL DTHOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,H a l f of our imports of fish consist of tinned salmon.,30
185,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"That is so.. It will be recognised, however, that we have in Australian waters large quantities of fish, and that our fisheries, as the result of a proper system of encouragement, may be opened up with advantage to the Commonwealth.",30
186,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"East Sydney) [4.23] This proposal may be connected with a scheme for founding a Commonwealth line of mail steamers, such as my honourable friends of the Labour Party are anxious to establish. It will mean a very small beginning, but it will, nevertheless, be a decided one. It will affirm the principle of a State-owned line of steamers, and also to some extent the principle of a national industry. Here, again. I am not in a position to quarrel with the Government. I look upon the development of our fisheries as one of the best and greatest objects that they could have in view.",30
187,Mr HUTCHISON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Is the right honourable member weakening in his anti-Socialism ?,30
188,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"H a d the honourable member allowed me to complete the sentence he would not have put that question. I have in view the magnificent development by private enterprise of the fisheries on the coast of the mother country, where tens of thousands of hardy fishermen have established a great national industry; I have in view a magnificent development of private * enterprise instead of the creation, in the future, of a fleet of Government trawlers. I look upon this proposal as one to which we need not object, because the object which I expect to be achieved is the development If ""the of one of the greatest of the private enterprises of Australia. This is the only difference between my honourable friends, the Socialists, and myself. We both believe in making the best use of the powers of the' Government for the benefit of the people, and I only part company with my honourable friends on the point that they look upon this, as the beginning of' a fleet of national trawlers, to be manned' by sailors wearing the Government uniform. Long before the question of Socialism was discussed in the The Federal arena, I had an opportunity to make experiments in. this direction. I believe that I was the first Premier of an Australian State to fit out a trawling expedition at the expense of the Government. I provided the necessary funds, and a The local gentleman well known in connection with the fishing industry- Mr Frank Farnell, who has been identified with these matters all his life-wa s placed in charge of a properly-equipped trawler to ascertain' what were the resources of the coastal waters of New South Wales.",30
189,Mr HIGGINS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Was not that very wicked and socialistic?,30
190,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"No . I have just mentioned the point at which I part company with my honourable friends the Socialists. If is foolish to believe that Socialists alone favour the using of the powers of the Government for the benefit of the people. Australian public men used the powers of the State for the benefit of the people before the Socialists were thought of, and will continue to do so long after they have been forgotten. I claim to be just as fearless as the Socialists are i "" . making use of the 2i6 Supply. [REPRESENTATIVES.] powers of the Government for the benefit of the general community, but I draw the line at their desire to convert the whole community into an army of Government servants.",30

194,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"A few of them are at present in the Chamber, and the honourable and learned member has got them into hot - water owing to his soundness on the question of Home 'Rule.

It is in that way alone that I can connect them with the question before the Chair. I can honestly say that I do not blame the Government for proposing this experiment. I hope that it will be judiciously managed-that the trawler will be placed in good hands, and will be such a vessel as can be employed all round the coast.",31
197,Mr MAUGER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,How did the honourable member's experiment succeed? «,31
198,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Unfortunately , it was not as prolonged as it should have been. I think-that something happened to me about the time in question. Unless the Government have some latent design in proposing to acquire a trawler-unles s they desire to convert it into a mail steamer, to be run on national lines- I have no objection to the item. I think that the proposal is a good one.",31
199,Mr HUTCHISON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Hindmarsh) [4.30]. - I was very glad to hear the speech of the leader of the Opposition,- because it has enabled us to know exactly how he stands; for the moment, at any rate. The only difference between his Socialism and that of the Labour Party is that he believes in Socialism which will give something to private enterprise, but does not believe in Socialism which will give something to the whole people. It is a - good thing that he Supply. does not oppose this item. It shows that he is advancing in the right direction.",31
200,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I was the first to make an experiment of this kind.,31
201,Mr HUTCHISON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Yes , but, although that experiment has been claimed to have been successful, private enterprise has not followed the matter up. That fact shows that it may be necessary for the Commonwealth to provide quite a number of trawlers. I have seen a good deal of trawling in the old country, where fish is sent from the north of Scotland to the English markets, not by the ton, but by scores of tons. The trawling industry there is very successful. We know that our waters are supplied, not with one or two kinds of fish only, but with an enormous variety, and it will 'be a good thing to use a trawler in the attempt to prove that there is a splendid supply that can be obtained at a comparatively small expense, and that enormous fortunes may be made by private enterprise if it goes into the industry.",31
202,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"North Sydney) [4.33]--The honourable member for Hindmarsh has drawn a distinction between the position of the right honourable member for East Sydney and that of the Labour Party ; I would point out a further distinction. It is this : The honourable"" member for Hindmarsh would refuse to the fishermen who risk their lives and expend their energies in the establishment and maintenance of a perilous and arduous industry, the profits to be won from it, and would give them to the State. That course would inevitably lead to the abandonment and ruin of the industry. If there is any industry which would not. prosper as a State enterprise, it is the fishing industry, and especially the deep-sea fishing industry. But it is the duty of the State to make the scientific inquiries and experiments necessary to prove and exhibit the resources of our seas as well as of our land.",31
203,Mr HIGGINS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The honourable member draws a line somewhere between trawlers and steamers.,31
204,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The honourable and learned member is not so den.$e as he tries to appear. It would be a poor compliment if I said that he cannot see my distinction. Whilst the State may use its powers for testing and exhibiting the resources of the country and of the adjacent seas-and the community has approved of that being done - it should not, in my opinion, endeavour to carry on industries which can be better carried on by private enterprise.",31
205,Mr HIGGINS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The honourable member wishes tp use the resources of the State for - the' few ; we wish to use them for the whole community.,32
206,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The honourable member is repeating a statement of the honourable member for Hindmarsh to which I have replied. He would give the advantages to be derived from the prosecution of the fishing industry, not to the seamen and others engaged in it, but to the community at large, thus taking from them the encouragement necessary to induce them to risk their lives, and to undertake the Heavy and severe exertions required by that calling.",32
207,Mr HUTCHISON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,There will be no trouble about manning this trawler.,32
208,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Not at create first; but there will be later on if it seen that the rewards of the enterprise are not allowed to go to those who earn them.,32
209,Mr HIGGINS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I understood the leader of the Opposition to say that workmen risk nothing-tiha t it is the capitalists undertake all risks.,32
210,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"If trawlexpensive ing is proved likely to be successful, vate enterprise will enter into and develop the industry.",32
211,Mr HUTCHISON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The leader of the Opposition says that he has proved it to be successful.,32

213,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The honof orable and learned member for Northern Melbourne would go further than is proposed, and, our resources having been proved, would establish an enormous fleet of Commonwealth trawlers to carry ""on fishing industry.",32

215,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The secthe tion to which the honourable and learned member belongs would do so, and he has indicated by his statements that his views coincide with theirs.

216,Mr HIGGINS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I follow the right honourable member for East Sydney when he right.,32
217,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The honless orable and learned member is satisfied that the leader of the Opposition is right in this instance ?,32
218,Mr HIGGINS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Certainly .,32
219,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Then I am right, too. I 'doubt, however, that the sum provided is sufficient for the purpose. Probably an additional vote will be necessary before any complete experiment can be made. It must be remembered that the trawler to be provided will have to be more expensively fitted out than is the case with the trawlers which work on the Dogger Bank, for example. It will require trawls for a great variety of depths, and raising and lowering apparatus to deal with, not one particular bank, or a set of banks, but unknown conditions. The Minister stated that the experiment would be under the control of experts. I presume that we are not to understand that it is intended to a Department of Fisheries, seeing is that we have already experts in the States.",32

In a recent interview with the Chairman of New South Wales Fisheries Board, I was assured that an experiment of this kind is very necessary, because no private capitalist would go to the expense of buildthat ing a trawler on the off-chance of discovering a profitable enterprise, whereas, if the of Government experiments demonstrate that the capital can profitably be embarked in this industry, there are several men of means who will invest money in it. The proposal is is defensible on the same principle as the Government putting down bores in watertracts of country in the interests of the community, with a view to promote settlement. When the right honourable memr ber for East Sydney was Premier of New South Wales, he authorized the expenditure of money for a trawling experiment, which trawling operations. was conducted under the supervision Mr Frank Farnell; but the operanew tions were continued for only six weeks, under the most adverse weather and other oppose the item. conditions. That time was not sufficient to thoroughly explore our waters; but the Reid Government went out of office, and was succeeded by a Ministry who would not renew the experiments, which therefore to be abandoned at a critical ment.

224,Mr WILKS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Dalley) [4.53] - I am of pleased to be able to support the proposed vote. I trust that the Government will arrange for the construction of the trawler in Australia. Although they declined to insert a provision in the mail contract that the proposed new mail steamers should be built in Australia, I hope that they will not refuse to give our artisans an opportunity of exhibiting; their skill in connection with the construction of the new fishing vessel. The proposed vote is similar to those which appear on some of the States Estimates for the purpose of encouraging prospecting, in connection with the mining industry, and I shall be glad if the search for good fishing grounds is as successful as have been some of the efforts of the prospecting parties in their quest for valuable mineral deposits. That is my desire, but my judgment tells me that the proposed experiment will absolutely fail. In New South Wales, the president of the Fisheries Board, when he was a member of the local Legislature, took charge of a trawling expedition, and the Government placed a considerable sum at his disposal. Mr Frank Farnell, the gentleman referred to, visited England with a view to forming a company to develop our deep-sea fisheries He had a series of interviews with the Fishmongers Guild of London, a very powerful corporation, but the members of that body were not inclined to invest their capital upon the strength of the flimsy information submitted to them. I would point out that within six weeks the fishing grounds off our coasts could be fully tested.",33
225,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"What , under weather conditions?",34
226,Mr WILKS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Yes . In the case of the experiments carried on in New South Wales the steamer proved to be faulty, and, though the trawling appliances were quite up-to-date, they were frequently damaged by rough weather. The present leader the Onposition, in common with mvself, very fond of deep-sea fishing, and he probablv aware that for the last fifteen such a great success. vears, the supply of fish along the tralian coast has been gradually ing. As a matter of fact, the best fishing grounds in Australasia are to be found unon the coast of New Zealand. S*ill. I do not wish to discourage the Government. Perhaps, if we consent to the proposed vote, we may prevent waste of monev in the future, at the suggestion of a protectionist Government', which mav desire 'to offer bonuses for the encouragement of deep-sea fishing. I am not so bigoted a free-trader that I would object to the Government arranging for the construction of the proposed trawler in my electorate. We are now passing through a period of political peace, and I am not such a flathead as to allow my electorate to pass unheeded when there is any loot to be obtained. I hope that the Minister will not follow the example of the present Minister of Trade and Customs, and decline to employ Australian artisans in the construction of the proposed steamer. There is no question as to the capability of our workmen, because I have in my electorate some of the most expert iron workers in the whole of the British dominions. 1",34
227,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Franklin) [4.58]. - We are being asked to commit ourselves to an absolute waste of money. I do not expect that the slightest success will be achieved as the result of the operations of the proposed Government trawler, but I predict that within three years the steamer will be up for sale, and that we shall be glad to accept any offer for her. Deepsea fishing has been carried on in Australian waters for many years. Some honourable - members may recollect the Rachel Thomson - a Hobart ketch of about 40 tons, which used to engage in deep-sea fishing off the coast of Tasmania, and bring her catch into the Melbourne market. That vessel met with misfortune, and has not been replaced. A few ketches fitted with auxiliary engines are now engaged in fishing off our coasts. They are chiefly used to obtain adverse fish for manurial purposes.",34
228,Mr TUDOR,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,What sort of fish?,34
229,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Barracout a and alshark, which are sold to the farmers and orchardists for manurial purposes. In our Australian waters there are not the vast of shoals of fish which visit England and is Scotland, and which enable those countries is to make their preserved fishing industries Consequently, I Ausmaintain that this bounty will prove an diminishabsolute failure.",34
230,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,How can the honourable member sav that before we have made the experiment ?,34
231,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The experiment has alreadv been made. As everybody is aware, the best fishing ground in Australia is considered to be off the Scamander River. Some time ago a voting Englishman, who had had considerable experience of fishing in the old country, visited Tasmania, and endeavoured to float a company to preserve the fish obtainable in the locality indicated. The project, however, fell through, simply because, although the fishing ground off the Scamander River is an admirable one for tourists, there were not sufficient fish to enable the company to start operations upon the large scale that would be necessary to make it a financial success.",34
232,Mr WATSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,There is a fish preserving industry on the New South Wales coast at the present time.,35
233,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,What sort of fish are preserved?,35
234,Mr WATSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I cannot say.,35
235,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"We have tried the experiment in Tasmania, and without success.",35
236,Mr EWING,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Quite as many fish pass along the eastern seaboard of Australia as are to be found in any part of the world.,35
237,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I do hope that, if the proposed £8,000 be expended, it will result in the establishment of the fish preserving industry. But I believe that it is impossible to obtain a sufficient supply to permit of that being done.",35
238,Mr WATSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,It is the difficulty of getting fish distributed which keeps them out of more general consumption.,35
239,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"If a plentiful supply were available - notwithstanding that the middleman frequently obtains quite as much in the way of profit as the fisherman gets for his labours,-the price of fish would come down. I credit Ministers with sincerity in this matter, but I believe that the project is doomed to failure. .Recognising that the money will be absolutely thrown away, I shall-if the item be pressed to a division-vot e against it.",35
240,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Parramatta) [5.5] - I support this vote most cordially.,35
241,Mr BROWN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Where is the anti-Socialist now ?,35
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The trouble really is that I am anxious to take, the last vestige of the cry of "" stinking fish "" from the honourable member. I maintain that, if this money be thrown away, it will be thrown away in a very good cause indeed.",35
243,Mr WILKS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,If the Government build the trawler in my electorate it will be all right.,35
244,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I will support the honourable member 'in any proposal of that character. I am afraid that we are succumbing to the influences which have been operative here for some time, and really one may be forgiven if , in a temperature like this, one's political fibre begins to relax somewhat. But speaking seriously, it occurs to me that, of all the amounts which it is proposed to allocate in the distribution of the Treasurer's surplus, the vote of £8,000 to enable the deep sea fisheries of Australia to be thoroughly tested is most to be commended. It is worth that amount to learn the facts of the case, and if those facts are as I believe, the waters of Australia are as plentifully supplied with fish as are those of any other part of the world. That is my information, and upon the strength of such assurances I am prepared to support this item in order to place the matter beyond doubt. Should experience prove that we have not the teeming millions of fish which are to be found in the deep seafisheriesof Other countries, I say that we have thrown away £8,000 in many a worse speculation. I d'o not think that we could spend a portion of the Treasurer's surplus in any better way than that proposed, always provided that this trawler is to be built in New South Wales, and in the electorate of the honourable member for Dalley.",35
245,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The honourable member had better make that remark satirical or it will be used against him.,35
246,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,It is by no means satirical. I mean it absolutely. I think it is about time that Mort's Dock got a look in in connection with the dispensation of favours by the Government. I trust that the proposed' venture will prove the success which is anticipated.,35
247,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Lang) [5.11] - I am afraid that some honourable members are in danger of seriously falling away from grace. I wish it to be distinctly understood that I do not follow either the honourable member for Dalley or the deputy leader of the Opposition in supporting this proposal, conditional upon the trawler being constructed in any part of the Commonwealth. I am only anxious that if the item is passed we shall obtain ""the besi result possible for our expenditure. If the most expert builders, are to be found in Australia, and if the vessel can be constructed here as cheaply and efficiently as it can be elsewhere, by all means let us give a preference to our local builders. But let us get the best results for the money. . Mr STORRER (Bass) [5.12] - I intend to vote against the Government proposal, because I regard it as an interference with private enterprise. At the present time, there are a number of persons who obtain their livelihood by fishing. We have conducted many similar experiments in connection with larger concernsexperiments which have proved absolute failures. I am not disposed to support a proposal fo expend £8,000 in an enterprise which I feel sure will fail. Stronger evidence in its favour should be forthcoming to justify this vote.",35
248,Mr TUDOR,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Yarra) [5.13]- I shall support the Government proposal in order that the waters all round our Australian coast may be thoroughly tested. quite possible-despit e the experiments which have been conducted in New South Wales and Tasmania-that there are fishing grounds upon our coasts which have not been properly tested, and which will yield an abundant supply of fish. I should even be prepared to vote for the construction and' equipment of a number of trawlers so that the Government might undertake fishing upon behalf of the entire community. In the course of his remarks the honourable member for Franklin stated that the middlemen usually absorb as much profit as the fishermen derive from their labours. That has been the case in connection with this industry throughout Australia. In some instances the middlemen have absorbed two-thirds of the amount for which the fish have been sold. In Victoria it sometimes happened that the fishermen, after having 'worked all the week, actually had to pay something in order to get their baskets returned' to them. It was only when they formed themselves into an association that they were able to combat the evil influences of the middlemen. 1",36
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The honourable State. member does not believe in private enterprise.,36
250,Mr TUDOR,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The vote that I shall cast on this item will, at all sistent with others I have given. An explanation will certainly be required of some honourable members opposite who prepared to vote, for an expenditure £8,000 on a Government trawler. ",36
251,Mr TUDOR,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"They are when it suits them, just as they are free-traders suits them to support the free-trade cause. But when there is a prospect of a Government steamer being built within one of their electorates, they are ready to support local industry. If this vessel is to be built in Australia, preference should be. given to a Government yard. It could be built either at the Fitzroy dock",36
252,Mr WILKS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,That is in my electorate.,36
253,Mr TUDOR,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"There is no dock-yard in the electorate which I represent, but the Government workshops at Newport ought to be able to build such a vessel, and to turn it out-as in the case of railway locomotives-at a price lower than would be demanded by private firms. I trust that this proposal will lead to a revision of the It is regulations relating to deep-sea fishing. I doubt whether, under the existing condi tions, a Commonwealth trawler could fish anywhere in Bass Straits without contravening the Tasmanian fishing regula tions. I believe that under one of the regulations of that State the use of a net which is more than a quarter of a mile in length and 16 feet in depth is prohibited. Those in charge of a trawler of this kind would not think of using such a shallow net.",36
254,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Tasmani a does not object to the operations of fishermen from other States so long as they are not conducted immediately along her coast line.,36
255,Mr TUDOR,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Not long age, the Tasmanian authorities seized a Victorian fishing boat when it was fifty miles nearer the Victorian than the Tasmanian coast. I hope that as the result of this experiment Ave shall secure uniform fishing regulations, and that it will lead to the control of the fishing industry being transferred to the Commonwealth. Islands within four milesof Victoria are held to be within Tas-: manian waters, although they are something like 150 miles distant from that",36

257,Mr TUDOR,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Yes . I shall support the item, and I hope that a division will be are called for, so that we shall see on the of division list the names of some honourable members, who, although they pose as anti-Socialists, are prepared to vote for the expenditure of £8,000 of .the money of the when it people to support this enterprise.

258,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Wentworth) [5.27] - Ther are a number of items in this division which relate to rifle ranges. The information have in my possession is to the effect that equipment is to be provided. at present the Commonwealth does not posopinion, sess a range. Year after year we are pending money on ranges which we occupy with modern apparatus. at the will of private owners.",37
259,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The honourable member means to say that in some instances we so.,37
260,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The Minister must know that we have no rifle ranges on land sessed by the Commonwealth.,37
261,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,We own rifle ranges income Sydney and in Melbourne.,37
262,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"There may be one or two isolated instances in which we own the whole land on which rifle ranges have been established, but I wish to know whether the votes to which I refer are designed to secure to the Commonwealth the ownership of land, or whether they are simply intended to provide for the erection of buildThe Comings on privately-owned land from which we may be ejected at very short notice. 34 Mr GROOM (Darling Downs-Minister 6 of Home Affairs) [5.29] - In some instances, these items relate to the acquisition 28 of sites for rifle ranges. I would point out that the item relating to the Singleton AYES. rifle range is to provide for the acquisition of land, and that in several other cases we shall acquire the freehold. Many rifle ranges actually belong to the Commonwealth.",37
263,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The great majority of them do not belong to the Commonwealth.,37
264,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,They will by-and-by.,37
265,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"We are, at all events, acquiring rifle ranges in the vicinity of the larger towns.",37
266,Mr BROWN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Canobolas) [5.30] - Sub division 1 of division 3 contains a number of votes for' rifle ranges and rifle clubs. For instance, item 3 provides a re-vote 0 1 J£ 5> IO and a vote of £2,707, under NOES. the heading of ""new service."" Then item 5 provides £265 for alterations and improvements to rifle ranges generally, while £320 is provided for the Bathurst rifle range, and £ 3 8 3 for the Adamstown PAIRS. rifle range; and in item 11, £3,356 is provided for - new works in connection with rifle ranges. I wish to know what is being done in regard to the improvement of old rifle ranges. I have had communications respecting the position of the Orange rifle range, where there seems to be some doubt e as to whether the improvements are to be carried out according to an obsolete sysI tem, or whether an up-to-date and proper In my it is extremely desirable that in all excases our rifle ranges shall be equipped Where repairs are necessary and equipment is obsolete, it should be replaced with new and up-to-date do apparatus. . I wish to know, also, whether the Department makes grants to rifle clubs without taking into consideration the poscost of the work to be done in connection with a club's range. For instance, it has under my notice that the sum allotted to the recently-formed rifle club at Condobolin for the laying-out and equipping of its range is insufficient, it being found impossible to obtain tenders for the work for the sum at the disposal of the club. What is the practice of the Department in these cases? _ Will an additional grant be made to provide the balance necessary for the completion of the work, or is it considered that the members of the club should find what is necessary ? I fail to see why a new club should be heavily handicapped by having' to incur a serious debt for the proper equipment of its range.'",37
267,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Wentworth) [5.35] - The Minister explained just now that where the express purpose of a vote for a rifle club was not mentioned, it could be taken that the money was not being spent on the purchase of sites. I find that no less than ,£6.781 is to be so spent. the country ranges in New South Wales are rented from private owners.",38
268,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"My information is that hundreds of them are the property of the Commonwealth, though some are leased. Our desire is to acquire security of tenure before spending any money.",38
269,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I wish to know how much of this money is to be expended on ranges which are leased from private land-holders, ancl what are the terms under which the land is leased. I should also like to know from the Minister if the Department can see its way within the near future to provide artillery ranges. Perhaps he will bring the matter under the attaition of his colleagues.",38
270,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I shall do so.,38
271,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"There is at present no artillery range in Australia, though we spend £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 a year on the purchase of artillery.",38
272,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [5.38] - Replyin g to the questions of the honourable member for Canobolas, part of the sum provided for alterations and improvements to rifle ranges is to be spent on the Orange rifle range.",38
273,Mr BROWN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Is that range to be given an up-to-date*equipment?,38
274,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"It is proposed to extend the sunken mantlet, to instal a shutter target frame of the "" Owen"" pattern, fitted with a pair of canvas targets of each class, and to utilize the old iron target in the new work. The range will be improved as much as possible, and its equipment brought up to the requirements of the Defence Department. With regard to the position of the Condobolin Rifle Club, every club in Australia receives a grant on an absolutely uniform basis, according to the number of its members, the sums paid varying from £ 2 0 to £ 4 0 .",38
275,Mr BROWN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Suppos e that the .amount is not sufficient?,38
276,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,In that case the members must provide the balance for themselves. All clubs are treated alike in this matter.,38
277,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Wentworth) [5.40] - I should like to know what is the state of the negotiations in regard to the acquisition of the land required for the North Fremantle fort? How much of the £ 8 , 0 0 0 set down in the Estimates is to be spent in acquiring the necessary site, and how much is to be spent in the construction of the fort? Practically all Mr GROOM (Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [5.41] - There is a dispute in regard to the land in question. The owner has made a claim for compensation which the Commonwealth will not acknowledge, and proceedings have been taken in the High Court. The value of the land will be determined by judicial decision.",38
278,Mr CARPENTER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Fremantle) [5,42]. - I understand that there has been delay in regard to the acquisition of the land required for this for t ; but I understood last year, when money was voted for this purpose, that the work would be proceeded with. Then a dispute arose as to the size of the guns to be used, and> the Government asked the advice of the Imperial Defence Committee on the subject. The Committee's report having come to hand, I wish to know what has been done.",38
279,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [5.43] - Plan s had been prepared, and everything was in readiness, when a request came for an alteration in the armament of the proposed fort. Nothing further was therefore done, pending the report of the Imperial Defence Committee, which is now under consideration, having come to hand only a short time since. As soon as the Department arrives at a decision, the matter will be proceeded with.",38
280,Mr CARPENTER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Fremantle) [5.44]. - I do not understand the Minister's reply, because the report of the Defence Committee was received some weeks ago. I understand that ai 6-inch gun is now recommended. I believe that plans were prepared for 7.5-inch guns, and we were told that if 6-inch guns were decided upon fresh plans would have to be drawn. I wish to know whether new plans are being prepared, and when the work is likely to be carried out?",38
281,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [5.45] - The land has been acquired, and the only question to be settled is as to the price to be paid for it. We are now awaiting the decision of the Defence Department with respect to the armament, and as soon as that has been communicated, the work will be proceeded with. Of course, the honourable member will recognise that the report of the Imperial Defence Committee relates to a large number of matters which call for serious consideration.",38
282,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Wentworth) [5.46] - I think that the Defence Department should have arrived at a, decision long before this. They have been in possession of the report of the Defence Committee for a considerable time. I should like to know whether we are going to stultify ourselves completely. The Government sent to England and sought the highest advice with regard to the armament of the forts of Fremantle, and other matters, and there should be no need for delay in arriving at a decision. I agree with the honourable member for Fremantle that in all these questions the Government should loyally abide by the verdict of the Imperial Defence Committee, and act upon it at the earliest possible moment.",39
283,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Lang) [5.47] - I agree with the honourable member for Wentworth. The Government have no right to flout the authority whose advice they have sought.,39
284,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,There is no flouting in the C3.SG.,39
285,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"That is what the conduct of the Government amounts to. I should like some information in regard to the proposed votes of £8,000 towards the construction of the fort, and acquisition of the site at North Fremantle, and of £580 for the fort and quarters at Arthur's Head. I see by the foot-note that the total estimated cost of these works is £87,000, and that the expenditure incurred up to the 30th June, 1906, inclusive of £24,000, under division 6, sub-division 1, item 10, of 1905-6, amounted to £43,398^ Last year, when we were discussing the estimates for Fremantle, we were told that some change was to be made in the armament. It was first intended to mount 6-inch and 7.5-inch guns at these forts, but it was afterwards suggested that 9.2-inch guns should be substituted. I should like to know whether the Minister is in a position to give us any information as to the recommendation that has been made in this connection ?",39
286,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,That information is in the possession of the Defence Department,39
287,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The information is desired, because I take it, that the cost of constructing the fort will, to a very large extent, depend on the character of the armament decided upon.",39
288,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The question of armament is one for the Defence Department to decide. We merely construct the works when we know what the Defence Department require.,39
289,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Yes , but we are being asked to vote a certain sum of money which may prove to be excessive, if 6-inch or 7.5inch guns aire mounted in the forts, instead of 9.2-inch guns, and I think that we are entitled to know what kind of armament is to be provided.",39
290,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I could not give the honourable member information as to the decisions of the Defence Department.,39
291,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Wentworth) [5.53] - I think that the Minister should be in a position to afford the, information asked for by the honourable member for Lang. We should not be asked to pass items of this character in ignorance, simply because the Minister does not happen to be in possession of essential information. I notice that the proposed vote is smaller by £2,000 than the sum voted last year. I should like to know whether that reduction is due to the new method that has been adopted in arriving at a valuation of the land required for the fort, or whether it is owing to some changes in the construction of the fort. I do not think that the reduction can be altogether due to any saving that may be contemplated in connection with the construction of the fort, but, at any rate, the Committee should be informed roughly as to themanner in which the money is to be expended. After all, we are the guardians of the public purse,: and dannot altogether delegate our powers to any officer of the Defence Department, however highly qualified and efficient he may be. The Minister seems to think that he has performed his duty when he has given all the information that happens to be in his possession. Unless the Minister is in a position to afford the information asked for, I think that we shall have to test once and for a.ll the question whether this Committee is to surrender absolutely its powers to some one entirely beyond the control of the people.",39
292,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Darling Downs) [5.56]. - I thought that I had made the position quite clear. An important report has been received from the Imperial Defence Committee, and before the construction of the fort can be further proceeded with the recommendations contained' in that report will have to be very seriously considered. The Defence Department have not yet communicated their decision to us, and I cannot therefore give the honourable member for Wentworth the information that he desires. He must know that confidential reports are received by the Defence Department.",39
293,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Why does the Minister beg the question?,40
294,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I am not begging the question. The honourable member for Fremantle asked me whether I could tell him how the matter stood, and I explained that the proposed vote of £8,000 included the sum that would have to be paid for the land that had been acquired. The claim in respect of this land will, I hope, be adjudicated upon by the High Court when it visits Western Australia in October next. I told the honourable member, further, that the balance of the sum would' be available for the construction of the fort, but that the Defence Department had asked us to stay our hands pending the receipt of their decision upon the recommendations of the Imperial Defence Committee.",40
295,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I asked the Minister how much money was to be devoted for the purchase of the site, and how much was to be appropriated to the work of constructing the fort?",40
296,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I could not give the honourable member that information, because the High Court has not yet fixed the amount to be paid for the land. All I can say is that a sufficient sum has been placed upon the Estimates to meet any expenditure that is likely to take place during the current year.",40
297,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Wentworth) [5.58] - I merely wished to know what portion of the £8,000 was intended to be devoted to the construction of the fort. Of course, the Minister could not at the present time tell me how much money was to be paid for the land, but he should have been able to inform us as to the amount proposed to be spent upon the fort. He ignored the question of the honourable member for Lang. 2",40
298,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I did not. I was per-' fectly courteous to the honourable member.,40
299,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,It seems to me that the Minister should know what has been set aside for the construction of the fort.,40
300,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Lang) [5.59] - In view of the statement of the Minister, I moveTliat the consideration. of items 16 and 17, sub-division 5, be postponed. We should not be called upon to pass the items until the Minister is in possession 'of such information as will enable honourable members to know what they are voting for. I think that we are entitled to have the information asked for.",40
301,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,It would involve the whole question of our coastal defence.,40
302,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The question which I have asked refers particularly to the armament of these forts.,40
303,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Did I not tell the honourable member that the Department has not yet arrived at a decision upon that matter?,40
304,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Then we are asked to vote money without knowing the purposes for which it is to be expended. Surely the Minister must know the amount which will be set aside for the purchase of the land ? Altogether, the proposals of the Government involve an expenditure of £87,000.",40
305,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Franklin) [6.2] I think that I thoroughly understand the explanation of the Minister. It seems that the amount which is to be paid for the land is already the subject of a judicial inquiry. That being so, if the Minister were to say how much the Government expected to give for the land he might prejudice their case.",40
306,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Surely that remark does not applv to the forts themselves?,40
307,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I regard the explanation of the Minister as/ entirely satisfactory, and I hope that the honourable member for Lang will withdraw his motion.",40
308,Mr STORRER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Bass) [6.3] - I am of opinion that the defences of the Commonwealth would be far better managed if honourable members did not know so much about them. Instead of a certain sum being placed upon the Estimates to permit of the necessary works being undertaken, and instead of relying upon our expert officers to manage the affairs of the Department in a secret way, every item - of expenditure is canvassed in this House, so that the information supplied goes forth to the world, with the result that everybody knows just as much about our own business as we know ourselves. The defence of Australia, I contend, is not upon a sound footing.",40
309,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Does the member approve of voting money in the . dark?,41
310,Mr STORRER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"As a business man, I appoint a certain individual to discharge certain functions. I hand him certain money, but I do not proclaim to the world what he is to do with it.",41
311,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Accordin g to the honourable member's dictum, there is no necessity for Parliament at all.",41
312,Mr STORRER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"If the honourable member will notify me when he has concluded his remarks, I will proceed. contend that the defence of the Commonwealth is badly managed, and that there are too many honourable members in this Chamber endeavouring to control it . As one who is anxious to see our defences placed upon a sound bas'is, I say that the carrying out of these works should be left to our experts. If we have not confidence in those experts , let us appoint others in whom we have confidence, instead of advertising to the world all our weak, as well as our strong, points. When the honourable and learned member for Angas was speaking a few minutes ago, he pointed out that under the present method of debiting works expenditure to the States, Tasmania is called upon to pay £ 2 1 , 0 0 0 , whereas under a per capita system she would have had to contribute £ 2 9 , 0 0 0 . Had he gone back for a period of three years-, he would have noticed that the expenditure of that State upon a per capita basis would have been £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 , whereas under the present system it was £ 5 1 , 0 0 0 . Also he would have discovered that during three years the expenditure of Western Australia unon a per capita basis would have been £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 , whereas the actual expenditure was £ 1 8 6 , 0 0 0 .",41
313,Mr FRAZER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The honourable member is getting provincial.,41
314,Mr STORRER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I think that we need to become provincial when money is spent in that wav.,41
315,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Wentworth) [6.6] - I think that the honourable member for Bass will see that he has done a very grave injustice to honourable members on this side of the Chamber. I scarcely think that he meant what he said.,41
316,Mr STORRER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I always say what I mean and mean what I say.,41
317,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"If the honourable member really meant what he said he is prepared honourable to forego the greatest trust which his constituents have reposed in him, namely, the trusteeship of the public purse. They did <. not intend that any officer of our Departments should be allowed to do exactly as he might please in these matters without any scrutiny from him. Regarding the statement that we a.re giving away secrets to the enemy and similar clap-trap, I do not think that any serious-minded individual will pay much, attention to it.",41
318,Mr JOHNS ON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Lang) [ 6 . 7 ] - I am surprised at the view which has been expressed I by the honourable member for Bass. If we subscribe to his dictum we might just as well close up Parliament entirely. All that would be necessary would be to say to the Treasurer, ""Here is £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . Spend it as you choose. We are content to trust you implicitly, and, although it is the people's money, we are not in the slightest degree interested in the way that it is ex1 pended. We shall shut our eyes and open our mouths.""",41
319,Mr STORRER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I rise to a point of order. The honourable member is professing to quote some of my statements, but he is not doing so. Is that in order?",41
320,The CHAIRMAN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"It would not be in order for the honourable member for Lang to misquote the honourable member for Bass, but I am sure that if he did so he did it unintentionally.",41
321,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I did not profess to quote the remarks of the honourable member for Bass. I was merely stating what was the logical outcome of his contentions. He has put forward a most astounding proposition, and one to which I certainly cannot subscribe. Since he has been a member of the House he has very rarely advanced any reasons, intelligible or otherwise, for the votes which he has registered. For him to exoect other honourable members to emulate his example is to expect too much'.. The principal point upon which I desire enlightenment has reference to the ordnance which is to be mounted at. these two forts. I desire to know whether it is intended to> mount 6-inch guns, 7.5-inch! guns, or 9.2inch guns?",41
322,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I do riot think it is necesorable sary for the Minister to tell us that. he should decide at once.,42
323,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"^ If we are asked to sanction the proposed expenditure to place 9.2-inch guns in position-gun s which, when mounted, will be useless-w e shall be absolutely throwing money away. I lieve that a 6-inch gun and a 7.5-inch gun would be ample for all purposes, and would prove far more effective than would any 9.2-inch gun, especially in view of peculiar situation of the Fremantle harbour from a naval stand-point. Rottnest Island interposes a natural barrier against effective use of long-range ordnance.",42
324,Mr FISHER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Wide Bay) [6. n ] do not agree with the contention orable member for Lang in regard to this matter. Ample opportunities are presented honourable members for discussing the calibre of the guns to be mounted for various purmounted. poses. I do not think that that information need be sought in this Committee. The honourable member has been good the enough to venture an opinion as to the class of gun which should be mounted these forts, but I think that there are very few honourable members who will regard him as an authority upon that subject. repeat that there are ample opportunities afforded honourable members of discussing the general question of armaments. Surely there is no need in connection with a small item upon the Estimates to demand inforsible mation as to the exact type of gun is to be mounted in a certain fort.",42
325,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,We merely wish to know what the Government intend to do.,42
326,Mr FISHER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"That is an entirely different matter. I agree with the honourable member for Lang up to a certain point. We ought to know the amount which is to be expended upon this work, but it is not at all necessary for the Minister to inform honourable members of the particular type of gun which is to be employed. If were no other opportunities of gaining information",42
327,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,What other opportuninecessary ties are there?,42
328,Mr FISHER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"If a Government fails in its duty in the matter of the defence of the Commonwealth, it ought not permitted to remain in office.",42
329,Mr CARPENTER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Fremantle) [6.13]. - I trust that the motion of the honorMinister. able member for Lang will not be pressed, I quite agree that it is necessary that members should be supplied with all But the information possible before they are asked to sanction any expenditure. The honourable member's objection to - this item is prompted by the fact that he is unaware of the particular type of gun which is to be used at these forts, and, consequently, behe does not know the amount which Parliament will subsequently be asked to vote. But I would point out to him that any such objection should have been urged last year the when this work was commenced. The original estimate for the undertaking was based upon a 6-inch armament. If there the had not been a question raised as to whether the use of a larger gun was not I desirable, the delay which has occurred of the honwould have been obviated.",42
330,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,It was afterwards deto cided to have plans prepared upon the supposition that 7.5-inch guns would be,42
331,Mr CARPENTER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Yes . That was after the matter had been' brought before House. I do not think that there will be an increase on the amount originally in named; the amount expended may possibly be less than that mentioned in the footnote. We are not asked to vote the total sum neI cessary to complete the work. : We are simply invited to vote £ 8 , 0 0 0 towards the purchase of the necessary land, and to carry on the work which has been entered upon. I agree with the Minister that it is imposto say what the total cost will be which until we know what guns are to be mounted. The Defence Department should by this time have determined that question, but the fact that they have not done so does not afford ai sufficient reason for refusing to vote the money necessary to carry on the work, and to pay for the land in process of acquirement. I would urge the honourable member to withdraw his motion.",42
332,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Lang) [6.17] - If it was originally intended that the fort should there be constructed on a scale which would that permit only of the ^mounting of 6-inch guns, its entire reconstruction might be to allow of the mounting of heavier ordnance.",42
333,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,But the plans were altered before the change in the calito be bre of the guns was decided upon.,42
334,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,That is an explanation Which ought to have been given by the,42
335,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I referred to it. Plans honwere prepared to permit of the mounting of 7.5 guns, and the Department of Home Affairs was then asked to stay its hand, pending the determination of the question of what the new armament should be. We are now awaiting the decision of the Department of Defence.",42
336,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Then this item is based on the proposal to mount 7.5 guns?,43
337,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"All that I can say is that part of the item is to provide for the acquisition of a site, which is the subject of litigation. In the circumstances, I cannot disclose the details; but the officers advise that this amount will be sufficient to cover the expenditure that is likely to be incurred this year.",43
338,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I have no desire that the Minister should disclose confidential information, and, in the light of the additional facts which have been presented since I raised objection to the item, I will not press my motion. Motion, by leave, withdrawn.",43
339,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Franklin) [6.19]. - In connection with the item "" Alterations to Sandy Bay rifle range, £ 3 0 0 , "" I should like to inquire whether that rifle range is to be a permanent one. As the Minister is aware, there has been much local agitation, and the opening of the range at Sandy Bay- a suburb of Hobart-ha s practicallyput a stop to building operations in that direction. Statements have also been made that persons walking along the hills at the rear of the range have on several occasions narrowly escaped being shot. I hope that the Minister recognises diat we ought not to agree to the expenditure of large sums on temporary rifle ranges, that carefully considered what may be the effect of this range on the development of Sandy Bay, and that he has not lost sight of the point that it may endanger the lives of persons, and render the Government liable to an action for damages. The question is a much-vexed one, and I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some information with regard to it.",43
340,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [6.21] - As the honourable member has said, the Sandy Bay rifle range has been the subject of careful and anxious inquiries on the part of the Department. A number of alternative sites were suggested, and some of them were withdrawn almost as soon as they were mentioned. Several visits were paid lo Sandy Bav by the officers of the Department, and, after careful inquiry it - yas definitely decided that the Sandy Bay rifle range should be a permanent one. With a view to minimize the risk of accident, the Department have acquired land in the immediate neighbourhood of the range, and this item of /, oo, which will be applied to the long 3 distance ranges, is expressly intended to secure the safety of the public. It is intended that this shall be the rifle range for Hobart.",43
341,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"East Sydney) [6.22] I should like to point out a rather unsatisfactory feature in connection with these Estimates. I 'refer to the fact that votes are passed, and that the conduct of the Department seems to show either that they ask for a much larger sum than is necessary, or that they are neglectful of their duty in that they fail to carry out works for which .Parliament has made provision. The subdivison relating to Tasmania, which is now under consideration, shows the same disproportion as exists in connection with the total sum for the division. Last year, under this subdivision, £ 3 , 1 9 6 was asked for by the Government as a sum . which it would be proper to expend in the twelve months ending 30th June, 1906. The actual expenditure, however, amounted to only £ 1 , 3 7 3 . In these circumstances, we either voted more than twice the amount that was required, or works which ought to have been constructed have not yet been carried out. . The same observation will apply to the whole of these Estimates. We voted for these services last year £ 6 6 , 5 0 0 , but only £ 3 3 , 0 0 0 was actually expended. The result is that re-votes he has amounting to £ 2 2 . 5 0 0 are sought by. the Government. I have two suggestions to make. Either the Government should not ask for more than they can spend during the financial vear, or, having asked for and! obtained a certain vote, they should see that it is expended-no t recklessly, but in carrying out the works of which Parliament has approved. When votes are not expended the finances of the States are sometimes seriouslv disarranged-disarrange d occasionally to the advantage of the States Treasurers, and sometimes to their disadvantage.",43
342,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [6.26] - The leader of the Opposition has referred to a matter which has not escaped the attention of the Government; but good reason can be given for the fact that some votes have not been expended. Let me explain the position.. A Department recommends to the Department of Home Affairs that a given sum should be appropriated in respect of a certain work, and after the vote has been granted a requisition is sent in for the execution of that work. It is then necessary to investigate the requirements of the Department concerned. I some other Government building is required a sketch plan has to be prepared showing the disposition of the space required. This having been approved, plans have to be drawn, and tenders have to be invited. In consequence of the delav in carrying out these details, votes are often passed which are not expended within the financial year.",43
343,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,- Everything should be in readiness for the work to proceed.,44
344,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I think it will be found that these delays will not occur so frequently in connection with the amounts upon these Estimates. We have pressed the Departments to apprise the Department of Home Affairs early in, 'the year of the nature of the work required by them, so that we may be in readiness to proceed with the undertaking as soon as the necessary vote is passed.",44
345,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The regulations to which the Minister refers were circulated last year.,44
346,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"That is so, but we have Irvinebank. hitherto. had some difficulty in bringing them into operation. It frequently happens that it is only at the last moment, so to speak, that a Department realizes its needs, but we are now in a better position than were last^year. Most of the sketch plans necessary in connection with the votes which honourable members are now asked to mates for a post-office at that place. agree have been prepared, and as soon as the Appropriation Bill is passed we shall be in a position to call for tenders.",44
347,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The passing of the Estimates late in the year has somebuilding thing to do with the fact that votes often lapse.,44
348,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Exactly . We passed the Estimates at a fairly early period last session, with the result that we were enabled to push on with various works earlier than we should otherwise have been able to do. Let me refer, by way of illustration, to an item relating to the construction of large defence works. We are now in a position to know what are the requirements qf the Department in relation to those works; the plans are in readiness, and as soon as the Estimates are passed tenders will' be called, and. the major portion, if not the whole, of the vote will be expended during the financial year.",44
349,Mr CROUCH,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Before the honourable member resumes his seat, I should like to inquire whether he thinks it right to include grants to rifle clubs under the heading of f a post-office or "" New Works "" ?",44
350,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The items to which the honourable and learned member refers relate, I presume, to new works in connection with rifle clubs. I have only to say that the point raised by the leader of the Opposition is an important one, but that, in some cases, there is special reason for the delay which has taken place. I agree with the right honourable member that the finances of the States, as well as of the Commonwealth, are often disarranged when votes are not expended within the year for which they are passed. Proposed vote agreed to.",44

352,Mr BAMFO RD,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Herbert) [7.31] - In subdivision 3, provision is made for the extension of the General Post Office, Brisbane, and for the erection of new post-offices at Atherton, Cairns, and But, although I have on several occasions approached the authorities of the Postal Department with, a view to getting a new post-office at Chillagoe, the only reply I have received has we been that the matter will be inquired into, and I shall be informed later on, and now to no provision is being made on these EstiI visited Chillagoe not long since, and, making a plan of the building in which the post and telegraph business of that town is transacted, sent it to the Department. The originally consisted of two 100ms and a verandah, but there are now five rooms, the verandah running round four sides. Of .these rooms, one is used as the post-office, a second as the parcels .oom, the third is the telegraph office, and the postmaster, his wife, and four children share the remaining two as parlour, dining-room, kitchen, and bedroom. The structure is of iron on a wooden frame, and could not have cost more than £ 4 0 0 , inclusive of the land. For it the Department are paying an annual rental of £ 4 5 , which is equivalent to interest at S per cent, on an expenditure of £ 9 0 0 . This shows what a poor business arrangement it is to remain in occupation of such inferior premises when, by the expenditure of £ 5 0 0 or £ 6 0 0 , much better accommodation could be given in a new building, both for the public and for the officer in charge.",44
353,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Does Chillagoe promise to be a permanent township ?,45
354,Mr BAMFORD,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Yes . I was asked that question five years ago. The Chillagoe Company is constantly spending money upon the erection of new works there, while there are a number of other mining centres, such as the O.K. mine, round about. The State Government have reserved a site of nearly 2 acres in area in about the centre of the town for a post and telegraph office, so that in providing for a new building, all that the Government would have to consider would be the cost of the structure itself. The accommodation now given to the postmaster and his family is disgraceful, and something of which the Department ought to be ashamed. I hope that the Minister of Home Affairs will give me his assurance that the matter will receive attention. The Postmaster-General has told me several times that it will be attended to ; but I ask now for some definite promise.",45
355,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [7-35J - The honourable member has made but a case deserving serious and immediate consideration. The probable permanency of a settlement must always be inquired into before the erection of a post-office is sanctioned; but Chillagoe appears to be a permanent town. are other mines in the neighbourhood besides the Chillagoe mine, whose postal business is transacted at this office, and from the description given, the quarters of the postmaster and his family, remembering the climate of the place, should certainly be improved. I shall at once put myself in communication with the Postal Department In connection with the matter.",45
356,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Robertson) T?-.i7]-- I should like some information from the Minister of Home Affairs in regard to the proposed expenditure of -^""v . i TO, together with a re-vote of £ 2 , 4 9 9 , in all £31609, upon the Cairns post-office. Was the amount voted last vear not sufficient to carrv out the work ? Mr GROOM. (Darling, Downs-Minister - of Home Affairs) [7.^8J - The appropriation last vear was £ 2 , 5 0 0 , but. when the money was voted, the plans and specifications were not ready for the erection of the building. The Inspector-General visited the town this year in company with an officer of the Queensland Government, since when plans have been prepared, and a tender accepted. Cairns is a township requiring a permanent post-office of the character provided, and the expenditure asked for is absolutely justifiable.",45
357,Mr BAMFORD,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,It will be too little.,45
358,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I am informed that the building will meet all necessary purposes for some time to come, although Cairns is an important and growing centre. Most careful inquiry .has been made, so that excessive expenditure shall not be incurred.",45
359,Mr BAMFORD,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Herbert) [7.40] Some years ago, the Town Council of Cairns passed a by-law requiring all buildings erected in a certain block to be of brick, concrete, or stone. That by-law was gazetted in January, 1905; but the Department wishes to ignore it by erecting a wooden structure. I contend that it has no more right than has a private person to treat a municipal by-law in this way. A municipal by-law having the endorsement of the Governor in Council is to all intents and purposes statutory law, and this Government has no right whatever to override any such by-law. The excuse urged is that there is not sufficient money available for the erection of a building such as would comply with the by-law; but, on the other hand, it is proposed to throw awav £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year upon the establishment of penny postThere age throughout Australia. The ""excuse that money is not available will, no doubt, be constantly heard if we agree to the penny postage system. It is disgraceful for the Government authorities to flout the local council as they propose to do.",45
360,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [7.41] - It is not intended to flout the municipality of Cairns. What is proposed is the removal of a building from one position on a block of land to another.,45

362,Mr TOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Lang) [7.42] - I should like some information from the Minister in Tegard to the proposal to expend £ 8 , 0 0 0 in extending the General Post Office, Brisbane. I saw the building not very long ago, and it seemed to me to be a very commodious edifice.",45
363,Mr R EDWARDS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,It is not nearly large enough.,46
364,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,It seemed to me a palatial one for a city of the size of Brisbane.,46
365,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs^ [7-43]--The Brisbane Post Office is utterly inadequate for the accommodation of the officers who have to work there. It was proposed, prior to Federation, to spend £ 1 3 0 , 0 0 0 upon the construction of a new building, and that amount was on the Estimates submitted to the first Parliament. The Commonwealth pays ,£720 for the rental of two buildings - on e of them an o l d theatre-whic h are at some distance from the post-office, to give the necessary accommodation, but the arrangement is inconvenient, and increases the difficulties of administration. proposed extension is to provide a parcels office, accommodation for the mail room branch, a telegraph operating room, accommodation for the accounts branch, strong rooms, a dead letter office, accommodation for the checking branch, accommodation for the correspondence branch, new detective galleries, and other requirements. The whole matter has been carefully considered, and the expenditure proposed is the minimum justified. Mr R. EDWARD S (Oxley) [7.44] The present accommodation in the Brisbane General Post Office is utterly inadequate, because, although the building has a very fine appearance, it contains only two floors. As the Minister has stated, the Barton Government decided to erect a new structure, and I only regret that there is not a vote on the Estimates for that purpose, instead of the £ 8 , 0 0 0 proposed.",46
366,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The vote asked for covers as much work as can\ be done during the vear.,46
367,Mr R EDWARDS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I trust that there will be no objection to the proposed vote, because there is no doubt that additional accommodation is required in Brisbane as well as in Melbourne, Sydney, and other places.",46
368,Mr CULPIN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Brisbane) [7.46] - The proposed vote will be only a small instalment of what is due to Queensland.,46
369,Mr BAMFORD,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Yes , and it was very ungracious on the part of the honourable member for Lang to raise any objection.",46
370,Mr CULPIN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The proposed expenditure will be very small as compared with that contemplated by the State Government before the Postal Department was transferred to the Commonwealth. I should like to know whether sufficient accommodation will be provided by the expenditure of the proposed vote.,46
371,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,All the requirements of the public and of the departmental officers will be met.,46
372,Mr CULPIN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I trust that ample accommodation will be provided for the officers. I understand that it is intended to concentrate the whole of the work of the Department in the one building, instead of having it performed in different parts of the city as at present, and I hope that the proposed additions will be undertaken at once.",46
373,Mr FISHER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Wide Bay) [7.47] Some time ago the Department of Home Affairs notified public servants who were The occupying Commonwealth buildings that they would have to pay the water rates levied in connection with such premises. I should like to know what position is now being assumed. I understand that it is not intended to insist upon the officers who occupy only part of a building paying the whole of the water rates levied in connection with such premises.,46
374,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [7.48] - The Crown Solicitor expressed the opinion that officers occupying public buildings were liable for the payment of the water rates levied in connection with them, and a notification to that effect was made. The matter was, however, again referred to the Public Service Commissioner, who, after looking into the matter, and considering the position in which public servants were placed, recommended that the demand for payment should, be withdrawn. The officers have, therefore, been relieved of any obligation in the matter.",46
375,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Lang) [7.49] - I was surprised to hear the interjection of the honourable member for Herbert. Surely it is an extraordinary thing for the honourable member to contend that no honourable member has any right to ask for information regarding a proposed vote.,46
376,Mr BAMFORD,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,If the honourable member had known anvthing about the matter his action might have been forgivable. 1,46
377,Mr TOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"If I had known anything about it, there would have been no necessity to seek enlightenment. One cannot be expected to be familiar with the requirements in connection with every post office in the Commonwealth.",46
378,Mr BAMFORD,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The honourable member might be content to trust the officers of the Department, who are familiar with the whole of the circumstances.",47
379,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Not at all. We know very well that departmental officers sometimes make very serious mistakes. If we are not to ask for information when the Estimates are submitted we might as well pass them en bloc. I think that I was fully entitled to be informed as to the necessity of the proposed expenditure. was not offering any factious opposition. In my own electorate there is one locality which is becoming very thickly populated, and which is badly in need of improved post-office accommodation. I refer to Miranda, where the whole of the postal business is conducted in one small room, not as large as this table. Yet I have not had the temerity to ask for improved accommodation. It is necessary to closely scrutinize proposed items of expenditure, in order that we may be able to justify our votes. As the Minister has assured me that additional accommodation is needed, and his statement has bean corroborated by two representatives of Queensland, I do not propose to offer any opposition to the proposed vote.",47
380,Mr DAVID THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Capricornia) [7.54] - It'is very strange that honourable members representing, other States should assume the part of watchdogs in regard to every item of expenditure relating to the State of Queensland. The honourable member for Lang, and others representing New South Wales, were absolutely dumb when the Estimates relating to that State were being dealt with; but immediately Queensland was mentioned they became very much on the alert.",47
381,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,We are not offering any opposition.,47
382,Mr DAVID THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The honourable member was offering opposition, and was not satisfied with the information afforded by the Minister. The State Government contemplated the expenditure of thousands of pounds upon additions to the General Post Office, Brisbane, and the proposed vote is sadly needed to provide accommodation both for the public and the post and telegraph officials. It is f ime that honourable members confined their attention to matters with which they are familiar.",47
383,Mr R EDWARDS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Oxley) [7.56] - I had a short conversation with the honourable member for Lang before he asked the Minister for information regarding the proposed vote in connection with the Brisbane Post Office. He certainly gave no indication that he intended to oppose the vote, but stated that he would merely seek information with regard to the necessity for the contemplated expenditure. I regret to find that no provision is made in the Estimates for additional post-office accommodation at Beaudesert. I visited that township at the I beginning of the year, and I am satisfied that there is great need for improved accommodation. Beaudesert is a large and thriving settlement,, with a rapidly increasing population, and I am sure that £ 2 0 0 o r £ $ ° could well be spent there in en0 larging the present post-office. I recently spoke to the Postmaster-General with regard to this matter, and he told me that he was obtaining, a report. I am afraid, however, that he has overlooked the matter.",47
384,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"No, we have not lost sight of it.",47
385,Mr R EDWARDS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"If I am returned to the next Parliament I shall no longer represent the part of the country in which Beaudesert is located, and I should have been better pleased if, before I had ceased to be tlieir representative, I had been able to secure for the residents some additional conveniences.",47
386,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I shall hurry up the matter tomorrow.,47
387,Mr STORRER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Bass) [8.0] - When the Postmaster-General was in Tasmania some time ago a very large deputation waited upon hi mi in reference to the Launceston post-office tower. All the members of the Commonwealth Parliament who have visited that city are acquainted with the peculiar features of that tower, and with the desire of the Launceston residents that it should be removed. The latter have even gone so far as to offer to instal, at their own expense, a clock and chimes which will cost about £1,500, if the postal authorities will demolish the existing tower and erect another which will be capable of receiving them. Upon the occasion of his recent visit to Launceston the Postmaster-General pointed out to the deputation to which I have referred that it was no part of the function of the Commonwealth to provide towers for post-offices. At the same time, he gave that body a very sympathetic reply. Everybody who is familiar with Launceston knows how proud its residents are of its up to-dateness and of its many beauties, and I need scarcely point out that the present post-office tower is a complete eyesore to the place. It was designed by the Tasmanian authorities, and was in an' unfinished state when the building was taken over by the Commonwealth. I am strongly of opinion that the Government should either complete the tower or remove it altogether. Of course, I am aware that many country districts are urgently in need of postal conveniences, and I know that some time ago the Postmaster-General 'requested the various States Governments to reserve suitable sites for postal purposes in newlyestablished settlements. In my own constituency three such areas have been thus reserved. In the town of St. Leonards a splendid site is available for a post-office, and a great saving might be effected by the Commonwealth if it erected its own buildings upon it , instead of continuing to pay rent for offices. Adverting to the Launceston post-office tower, I feel disposed to move the reduction of the proposed vote by £ 5 , in order to test the feeling of the Committee upon this question.",47
388,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Do not do that.,48
389,Mr STORRER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I wish to know whether Launceston is to receive justice in this matter ?,48
390,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The question does not affect Launceston only. all the States.,48
391,Sir JOHN FORREST,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The honourable member for Bass really desires an increased vote.,48
392,Mr STORRER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"But I cannot move in that direction. It is all very well for the Treasurer to make suggestions of that character, seeing that Western Australia is receiving four times as much in the wav of expenditure upon public works as is Tasmania.",48
393,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,What does honourable member want?,48
394,Mr STORRER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I wish the post-office tower at Launceston removed. If it were demolished, the residents of that city would be quite prepared to rebuild it, and to make a complete job of it. When the Postmaster General was in Tasmania he promised to favourably consider their request, but no doubt when the matter came before the Cabinet the Treasurer was present, and prevented him from doing as he would have liked. In order to test the feeling of the Committee, I move That the proposed vote be reduced by £5.",48
395,Mr BROWN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Canobolas) [8.9] - I hope that the honourable member for Bass^ will not persevere with his amendment. I need scarcely point out that Tasmania is not the only State which is prejudicially affected by the policy which is being pursued by the Postal Department. Other States have their grievances, and I am sorry to say that ray own electorate has one. The reason why I urge the honourable member not to press his proposal to a division is that if he does so honourable members like myself will be precluded from entering full y into a discussion of the Government policy in this regard. In my opinion, the matter can be better dealt with, either by resolution, or when the Estimates-in-chief are under consideration.",48
396,Mr FISHER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Wide Bay) [8.10] - I think that the honourable member for Bass has clone a public 3ervice in drawing attention to the outrageously unsightly tower of the post-office in the pretty city of Launceston. Apparently the design was prepared by the State authorities, so that the Commonwealth is to a certain extent relieved from the imputation which would otherwise lie against it. The tower in question is the only eyesore which I observed during my two visits to Launceston.",48
397,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,H as the tower been built? It affects Mr FISHER - Yes ; and its unsightly appearance is such as to justify the demand that it should either be improved or demolished. Mr HENRY . WILLIS - I do not think that it could be improved.,48
398,Mr FISHER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,It could be improved with ten pounds of dynamite. It is a most unsightlv tower with which to crown a substantial structure.,48
399,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Lang) [8.13] - A little while ago, when I ventured to request in the formation from the Minister of Home Affairs, the honourable member for Bass told me, in effect, that it was my province, not to seek information, but to hold my tongue.",48
400,Mr STORRER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,That is not a fact.,48
401,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The honourable member said that I should trust the Minister. The gist of his unsolicited advice was that I should simply say to the latter, "" Here is the money,"" and that I should ask no questions.",48
402,Mr STORRER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I did not say anything of the kind.,49
403,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"That was the purport of the honourable member's remarks. The a advice which he tendered to me this aftertermination noon he might very well take himself at the present time. But I will be a civilization. little more considerate to the honourable member than he was to me. I understand that he proposes that this item should reduced by £ 5 . I have spent very agreeable hours in Launceston, and I can certainly endorse his statement that the post-office tower there is nowhat thing but a very unsightly excrescence. I understand that it is popularly known as the "" pepper-box,"" and it more support nearly resembles that little domestic able article than does anything else I can press it to a division. think of. I would point out, however, if the item were reduced as proposed, other works in Tasmania might be affected. would perhaps be better for the honourable member for Bass to solicit the friendly offices of the Postmaster-General, and personally suggest to him the improvements which he thinks desirable. I feel sure the Postmaster-General will lend a symregister pathetic ear to his complaint The item a remarkably small one, and I , for one, Minister. shall not oppose it .",49
404,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Franklin). [8.17] The object of the honourable member for Bass in moving this amendment was simply to draw the attention of the Committee a matter which is worthy of serious consideration. The Launceston Post-office a very handsome and commodious building, admirably suited to the requirements of town. It was built by the State, biit difficulty arose in connection with the erection tion of a tower, and. as the result of partower. liamentary interference, a structure was run. up which absolutely destroys the appearof ance of the building. In view of the small sum 'required to improve the post-office, think that this matter should receive serious consideration of the Minister. citizens of Hobart subscribed £ 1 . 5 0 0 for a face is still vacant. clock and chimes, to be placed in position in the Hobart Post-office, and the inhabitention tants of Launceston are prepared to subin scribe for a clock and chimes to be placed in the post-office tower, if ture be provided. The present one is not only an eye-sore, but is unsuitable to carry a clock and chimes. I should be sorry, indeed, if anvthing were done that would attract attention to so unsightly an From my knowledge of Launceston, I think I can honestlv say that in no other part of the Commonwealth have the people shown greater degree of self-reliance or more deto provide the town in which they live with all the adjuncts of modern At a cost of a few hundred pounds what is a positive eye-sore in one of the prettiest town in Australia could be be removed. I feel sure that the Minsome ister of Home Affairs is not prepared to denv the request of the people of Launceston, since he shows a readiness to be somelavish in his treatment of other parts of the Commonwealth.",49
405,Mr CROUCH,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Corio) [8.21] - I shall the amendment moved by the honormember for Bass, and. trust that he will It is about time that that we received something more than a sympathetic hearing from the Postmasterl t General when we make requests in regard to postal buildings. The honourable gentleman is always very sympathetic, but he to gives nothing. The Launceston "" pepperbox "" monstrosity should be removed, and that it is just as well that the Committee should its protest against the way in which is postal requirements are dealt with by the I wish to refer to the position in regard to the clock in the Geelong Post office tower.",49
406,The CHAIRMAN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"We have dealt with the Victorian Estimates, and those relating to to Tasmania are now under consideration.",49
407,Mr CROUCH,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I think that I shall is put myself in order by moving that the amendment be so amended as to provide the that the £ 5 by which the item is proposed a to be reduced shall be applied to the erecof a clock' in the Geelong Post-office,49
408,The CHAIRMAN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Such an amendment the amendment would be out of order.,49
409,Mr CROUCH,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Then I shall have to I content myself by saying that I know of the provision for a clock in a post-office The tower, although the space left for its If the representatives of Tasmania will assist me in drawing atto the fact that post-office towers other parts of the CommonweallJi also need attention, I shall be prepared to supa suitable strucport the amendment.",49
410,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Wentworth) [8.24] After listening to the debate, I am somewhat at a loss to determine what are the true functions of the Post and Telegraph object. Department. I have always been under the impression that its chief function is to deal with the reception and transmission of letters and messages; but I am beginning to think, after what I have heard during this debate, that one of its duties is to improve some of the cities that most need beautifying. The interest displayed on all sides with respect to this question leads me to believe that honourable members have in mind many prospective post-office clocks. This is a fitting occasion for the Minister to definitely state the Ministerial policy in regard to these matters. If we are to vote Government funds to one purpose, When they should be devoted to different purposes altogether, we shall deplete the revenue in a way previously unheard of. The Minister should clearly indicate that, in the opinion of the Government, it is not the duty of the Commonwealth to beautify buildings in the way suggested. Unless he does so, we shall have begging letters from almost every municipality in Australia, and the position of honourable members will be rendered much more difficult than it already is. I know ' of an instance in which the Department has definitely refused to acquire some ricketty buildings in the neighbourhood of a post office on the ground that to adopt such a course would be to go beyond its functions. If it is not to preserve the health of its own officers by the abolition of unhealthy buildings in the vicinity of its offices, surely it will exceed its functions if it builds towers to replace certain unsightly edifices such as the "" pepper-box "" at Launceston. This craze is obtaining on Parliament a stronger hold than it ought to have. The Postmaster-General must recognise the force of my argument, and I hope that the Minister in charge of these Estimates will see that it is necessary to do something, before it is too late, to check this spirit.",49
411,Mr STORRER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Bass) [8.28] - After the discussion that ihas taken place, I do not intend to (press my motion. I - would point out that the situation in regard to the Launceston post-office is different from that of other buildings, since a tower has ally been erected. It was urged that clock and chimes should be purchased and erected in the Town Hall tower, since that out of revenue. building belongs to the people of Launceston. I resisted that proposal, because recognise that the post-office is also the property of the people.",50
412,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Hear , hear ! We are only trustees.",50
413,Mr STORRER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"In the circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the motion. Motion, by leave, withdrawn. Proposed vote agreed to. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. Division 5 (Telegraphs and Telephones), Mr ' DUGA LD THOMS ON (North Sydney) [8.29] - Wit h all humility, and-in view of some of the speeches to which we have listened this afternoon - with some trepidation, I rise to seek information with regard to the first subdivision of this division. I have heard this afternoon, for the first time in any Parliament, the statement that honourable members have not a right to fully criticise a request from the Crown for the grant of Supply. I do not endorse such a doctrine, and no Parliament should endorse it . We ought to reasonably exercise our right to criticise; we should never allow Departments, Ministers-, or officers to indulge in the unregulated and uncriticised expenditure of the money of the country. . On the first page on which this division appears, an increase of £ 4 1 , 0 0 0 is shown, and of that increase £1,3,000 relates to the Estimates for New South Wales, and the remaining £ 2 7 , 0 0 0 relates to the Estimates, for Victoria. The total increase is a very big one. Whilst they may be quite justifiable, I should like to know from the Minister the reason for these increases. Mr AUSTIN "" CHAPM AN (Eden Monaro-Postmaster-General ) [8.32] - My regret is that these increases are not greater. Last year £ 1 6 , 0 0 0 was voted for the construction and extension of telephone lines, and the placing of wires underground, and £.19,058 was spent. This year we ask for £ 2 7 , 5 0 0, a sum which, my officers tell me, is absolutely necessary for new works. A great deal of the money will be spent in constructing conduits to place the wires in Sydney underground, while the balanoe will be devoted to the construction and extension of telephone lines, or used in providing instruments and material. It must be gratiactufying to honourable members to know that a we have been able to do so much in the way of increasing facilities for communication Mr. JOSEPH COOK' (Parramatta) I [8-35]-- I think it would be a good thing to apply a great part of the £ 2 7 , 5 0 0 provided for the construction and extension of telephones and the construction of conduits to the establishment of metallic circuits. Although £ 9 , 0 0 0 was voted for that purpose last year, and £ 8 , 8 3 3 expended, only £ 5 , 5 0 0 is asked for this year. At the very least, £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 is required to provide metallic circuits throughout Australia, but the expense is a necessary one, because our telephone systems are steadily becoming worse, and will not improve until an independent return is arranged for. I urge the Postmaster-General to appropriate as much as he can of the votes for his Department for this very necessary work, because, until it is done, our telephones will not be as useful as they should be. When they have been improved, the business of the Department will be increased, and the public will get a great deal more satisfaction from the service.",50
414,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Robertson) [8.38] - I agree with the honourable memral, ber for Parramatta that the telephone vice requires improvement in the ""direction indicated. At present it is not even vate. The other day, when waiting condenser for a call, I heard a subscriber say. "" Will you speak to So-and-So, Memmirably, ber of the House of Representatives,"" and if I had taken the trouble I could have heard the whole message. hope that, if it can be done, the Minister will divert some of the votes to extending the metallic circuit. At the presenttime our telephone system ismost unsatisfactory, and is certainly not cheap. Some time ago supplied at very small cost. I drew attention to the unsatisfactory seruse vice given by the bureaux telephones. then the bureaux system has been almost perfect. If one wishes to be connected with expedition during a busy time like SatI urday morning, for example, one can creased always get communication through a bureau, and if a mistake is made, the partment will refund three penny stamps. I should like to know, however, why charge for a conversation has not been duced from 3d. to i d .",51
415,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,It will shortly be reduced.,51
416,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I shall be glad to learn of the reduction. I draw the honTesult. orable gentleman's attention to the fact the condenser system is a failure, and him what he intends to do in regard to My own experience in two or three instances shows it to be wholly unsatisfactory, and the officers of the Department have conmany firmed my opinion. That being so, Postmaster-General should inquire into the matter, and, if the system cannot be improved, see that no more money is wasted on it .",51
417,Mr BROWN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Canobolas) [8.42] Within the last few years telephone communication has been rapidly extended in the country districts, and in my electorate, where not long ago there were very few telephones, there is now a comolete network of lines. Not only have we the condenser system, but we have also town systems constructed by the Department, and private extensions carried out at the expense of the subscribers. Upon .the inauguration of Federation, the Department was very conservative with regard to telephone extension, so that it was almost impossible to obtain its sanction for new works; but its views were revolutionized by the honourable member for Macquarie when Postmaster-Geneand I am pleased to find that the honserorable member for Eden-Monaro is following in his footsteps. I do not agree with the prihonorable member for Robertson that the system is a failure. In my electorate it has, in manv respects, worked adsupplying a long-felt want, and the people would be loth to forego the advantages which they get from it . There Therefore, I are defects, but these, I am told, are due partly to the vibrations caused by trains where the wires run parallel to a railway, or by the want of sufficient "" crossovers."" which. I understand, could be As the of more ""cross-overs"" would Since greatly improve the efficiency of the service, it is a penny-wise-pound-foolish policy to economise in regard to them. t would be better to incur a slightly inexpenditure, in order to insure an efficient service, than to make a saving Deupon an imperfect service. I wish to refer to the subiect-matter of the guarantees that the are demandfed from persons who reauire retelephone extensions. The general understanding is that if the estimated revenue falls short of the estimated cost of working and maintaining a proposed line, a guarantee will be accepted from the local residents in respect of any deficiency that may Most of these estimates are based that upon what I may call conservative lines. ask Generally speaking, the revenue is underit. estimated, and the expenditure is overestimated-that is to say, a liberal allowance is made for contingencies. In a great instances the departmental estimates the have proved entirely misleading, because from the very outset the business has shown a profit, and the guarantors have not been called upon to make good any deficiency. For some time past I have beeni worrying the Department in connection with an application for the extension of telephonic communication to a very promising settlement known as Yeova.1, between Cumnock and Obley. I cannot understand why it is impossible to obtain a satisfactory decision from the Department. Yeoval is in the midst of a splendid agricultural area, which is being steadily developed. Nearly two years ago the residents communicated with me, and intimated that they desired to be brought into telephonic communication with Obley. Cumnock, and Molong. I obtained an estimate from the Department, but under the old conservative management such a large deposit was required that the construction of the line was out of the question. Later on, when the new and more literal regulations were introduced, I obtained a further estimate, and the residents were prepared to enter into the necessary guarantee to make good any deficiency. To my great surprise, however, the Department refused to accept the guarantee, and stated that the line was one that the residents might construct for themselves. I should like to know upon what principle guarantees are accepted in some cases and declined in others ? At first I thought it possible that the Department were not satisfied with those who were willing to join in giving the guarantee; but I found out afterwards that they were content if the guarantee were signed by substantial men, who would, in all likelihood,- meet their obligations. There was not much fear of any default in the case in question. I would ask the Postmaster-General to look into this matter, and ascertain why the Department have refused to comply with the request. When I noticed that the amount of £ 1 6 , 0 0 0 voted last year for the constructio.ni and extension of telephone lines had 'been exceeded by £3,058. I thought that in all probability the officers of the Department were unwilling to trench to any greater extent upon the Treasurer's advance account, and, if that is the explanation of their action, I shall have nothing more to say. I hope that the proposed vote of £ 2 7 , 5 0 0 will prove sufficient to meet all requirements in connection with such cases as I have mentioned.",51
418,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"North Sydphone ney) [8.52] - I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that if there is to be any additional expenditure under the head of conduits and metallic circuits, the latter item should receive the greater amount of attention. In some parts of Sydney the telephone service is becoming almost unusable owing to the lack of a metallic circuit. The electric trams interfere very seriously with the conduct of business over the telephone lines, and I think that an increased expenditure might very well be incurred in rendering the means of communication available to the residents of Sydney more effective than at present. It is no doubt convenient that some of the telephone cables should be carried underground; but it is of the utmost importance that something should be done to make the telephone service more useful than at present in certain localities, and particularlv where the transmission of telephone messages is interfered with by the electric tram service. . I see that there is a considerabl'e reduction in the amount proposed to be devoted to the establishment of metallic circuits, as compared with the sum spent upon similar works last year. I should like some explanation with regard to that matter, and also with regard to the Dortion of the metallic circuit system that is to be covered by the proposed expenditure.",52
419,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Parramatta) [8-551--It occurs to me, upon looking at the Estimates, that there is nc provision for any new work of the kind referred to by the honourable member for North Sydp e v £ 7 J 5 ° ° is to be appropriated for 2 the construction and extension of telephone lines, and only £ 5 , 5 0 0 towards the establishment of metallic circuits in connection with the telephone system. The latter amount will not more than cover the new work provided for, and therefore the construction of return circuits will really be at a standstill. I consider that this matter should be regarded by the Postmaster General as one of the greatest possible urgency, and that at least £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 of the surplus revenue of the Post and Telegraph Department might very well be devoted to this purpose alone. It would be far better to spend the money in this direction than to fritter it away in the manner proposed by the Treasurer. It seems to me that the Postmaster-General has presented to him an opportunity to convert the telesystem, and to give the people what they have never had in Australia, except perhaps in Brisbane, viz., a really efficient telephone service. The telephone service must be made more private than at present, in order to induce the public to make full use of it . When you are endeavouring to send a message you can hear conversations relating to every one's business but your own. I hope that the Postmaster-General will endeavour to induce the Treasurer to make available more monev than is now proposed to be devoted towards the establishment of metallic circuits, and that he will be able to do a great deal towards removing the cause of the present trouble.",52
420,Mr LONSDALE,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"New England) [8.58] - A portion of the surplus reself venue of the Post and Telegraph Deinterests partment could not be better than in the direction suggested the honourable member for Parramatta. I think that some of it might also be devoted to improving the telephone facilities get his own transacted. available to residents in the country disstand, tricts. It is proposed to throw away a considerable sum of money in the purchase of a trawler, and in establishing the penny though- £ 8 , 0 0 0 postage system, and I am afraid that the direction last year. position of the people in the country, desire to share in the benefit of telephone communication, will in consequence be renthe £ 8 , 0 0 0 dered more difficult than ever. Some orable members have had very strange exequipment periences in connection with applications the extension of telephone services. I have succeeded in obtaining what I have desired for my constituents only after a severe struggle. I think that telephone facilities possible. should be provided at very much cheaper rates than at present. I understand that the Postmaster-General now has before him a new regulation, which will provide for reduction of the charges now levied upon tain residents in the country districts who enjov the benefits of telephonic comthe munication, and I trust that it will brought into force as soon as possible. strides Some of the charges which are made are simply enormous. A man who lived six miles outside a populous township, and desired to obtain telephonic communication with it, was asked by the Department to pay £ 1 5 a year for the maintenance of the line, and to guarantee that amount for years. It would have been much better if it had plainly intimated that it could not pect of success. undertake the work. It would be in the interests of such persons if the new reguin lation to which I have referred were brought into operation at as early a date as possible. A somewhat similar occurrence took place in another portion of my electorate. A man who lived twelve miles from a town desired to secure telephonic communication with that town, but the price which the Department demanded from him for the erection of the line was a prohibitive one. He saw me in reference to the matter, and I suggested that he resided only three miles from a receiving office in which a telephone had been, installed. I pointed out that by erecting his own line to connect with that office, he could secure communication with the town by transmitting his messages a distance of about twentv-five miles. The Postmaster-General has always prided himupon the fact that he looks after the of rural districts. I desire him spent to act up to his professions. There can be by no doubt that, under the telephone system as it exists in Sydney, a person can Rear "" the other fellow's "" business, but cannot This, I underis due to the want of a metallic circuit. Yet only £ 5 , 5 0 0 has been provided upon the Estimates towards the cost, alwas spent in that In my opinion it who would be much better to expend in improving the Sydney telephone service which the Government honpropose to spend upon the purchase and of a trawler to exploit the fishfor ing grounds round the coast of Australia. I trust that the Postmaster-General will bring the new regulation to which I have referred into operation as soon as",53
421,Mr JOHNS ON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Lang) [9.6] - I heartily sympathize with the desire of the a honourable member for New England to obgreater facilities in connection with telephonic communication and a cheapening of service. But, whilst I admit that the be Postmaster-General has made very great in that direction, there yet remains a good deal to be done, particularly in the matter of securing an alteration of the existing regulations, whereby the charges levied in the metropolitan area may be extended to populous centres just outside that area. I have conducted lengthy correspondseven ence with his Department' in connection with this question, but with) very little prosI have received several communications from F'rogress Associations my own district bearing upon the matter, and particularly one in which the township of Sutherland-whic h is only just outside the metropolitan radius-is interested. understand that the reason Why the regulations have not been amended so as to make the metropolitan rates apply to populous centres just outside the metropolitan area is that Western Australia stands in the way.",53

I trust that reasons of this kind will not in future weigh with the Department. Mr AUSTIN CHAPM AN (Edenthe Monaro - Postmaster-General) [9.16] - I should like to say that I quite agree with the representations made by the honourable On looking through the Estimates, I find that the amount provided this year in respect to metallic circuits is practically the same as for that provided last year, although made up in a different way. The sum of £1,450 for telephone cableshas been provided for under item No. 2, which relates to the expenditure'of a sum of £27,500. item of £1,450 for replacing cables will be charged to "" Contingencies,"" instead of to the vote for metallic circuits. I agree with the honourable member that the telephone service is capable of great improvement. I shall, bear in mind the representations he has made. I am just as anxious as he is that the telephone system shall the improved, and no doubt we shall be able, by means of tire metallic circuit, to improve it to a greater extent than is possible in any other way. In answer to the honourable member for Canobolas, I may say that I shall endeavour to see if I cannot meet his request. He appears to have made out a good case. I was surprised to hear the statement of the honourable member for Robertson that the condenser system is an absolute failure. after all only a commercial makeshift. means telephoning over telegraph lines, with many breaks and "" cross-overs,"" and in the circumstances the means cannot .be as satisfactory as is a line erected for telephonic purposes. If the honourable member will bring under my notice any case in which the condenser system has not worked satisfactorily, I shall be pleased to see whether improvements can be made. As the business under the condenser system increases, I shall be glad to 'put in extra wires wherever such a step may be deemed justifiable, for my desire is that the people shall have the very best telephonic service. I have made a note of the point raised by the honourable member for New England, and shall see whether his request can be met. It seems to be a very reasonable one. Some trouble has arisen with regard to the question of the metropolitan radius, to which reference has been made by the honourable member for Lang. The whole question is being reconsidered. Some time ago a certain radius was fixed for the city of Sydney, and the honourable member has been most persistent in his representation that some suburbs which have rapidly sprung, up should be brought within that radius. The difficulty is that we cannot bring in one without bringing in the whole of them. Such a change would involve a very serious loss of revenue. There are also other ques-' tions-such as the establishment of new exchanges, which would necessitate a large expenditure-which must be considered in Mr Austin Chapman. connection with his proposal. Quite recently some alterations have been made in Western Australia, and also in Newcastle, Another and if it is possible to meet the wishes of the honourable member I shall be pleased to do so. We wish, if possible, to meet the requirements of those who settle at some distance from centres of population, and we shall try to give that which the honourable member asks. All these changes, however, cannot be made at a moment's notice. They necessarily involve a large expenditure.",54

The officers of the Department, after careful inquiry, have come to the conclusion that what is known as the common battery system- a system which we have just installed iru Hobart-is prefer- able. When some of the agents for the automatic system approached me, I said 1 that I was prepared to allow them to instal it in one of the towns that are springing up, and require a telephone service, ancl that, if it proved successful, we should be prepared to deal with thern. In view of the information I have obtained, however, I do not tihink that we should be justified in expending, a large sum of money in installing the system in Sydney or Melbourne, more especially as, if unsuccessful, it would lead to the' public being subjected to much inconvenience.",55

436,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Althoug h it has proved successful there, in Germany and other countries where it has been tried it is gradually being discarded. In building new exchanges, those countries are showing a preference for the common battery system.

The honourable member proved himself one of the most capable Postmasters-General that we have ever had. I repeat that he .gave the Committee a very long and lucid account of the operations of the Department, and I would remind the Committee that?, on this occasion, no such statement has been presented.

Totravel hundreds of miles in order to take part in the proceedings of the House l and then not to attend here, is certainly most ludicrous. As I happen to be present - it is, perhaps, a mere accident that I am - I desire the Postmaster-General, since he was not pressed for a statement during the Budget debate, to answer one or two questions with reference to the administration of his Department. In the first place, let me say that I am in favour of any expenditure under these, or any additional Estimates, to extend the conveniences of the Department throughout the length and breadth of Australia. I am prepared to vote any sum within reason to extend the benefits of the telegraph and telephonic system to the furthest corners of settlement in Australia. But I have no sympathy with the idea that the people in the pioneering districts demand penny postage. I do not suppose that they get a letter once in three months.",56

In the first place, we aire not in the House, but in Committee, and, in the next place, the Bill ira question may not be proceeded with.

When I used the term ""dagger,"" I meant that I had every reason to believe that, by an elaborate course of manipulation, and by conferences with my direct political opponents, preparations were made for the political downfall of the Government of which I was the head. The whole transaction was of a secret nature, and did not arise out of any great question of public policy. It was of the character I have already described more than once. I admit that the Minister has never been a supporter of mine, although I have always acknowledged the ability and devotion, displayed by him in putting the Labour Party out of office. I have never refused to recognise in the most generous way his unwearied efforts to shift that partu from office. I take no exception to that, but what I do complain of is that the same unwearied efforts were devoted to the task of shifting me from office. The Minister carried out his work, not by making soul-stirring appeals in this House, but by indulging in a series of beautiful manipulations, which were very effective, and in connection with which there was very little noise. But the Postmaster-General is a political baby compared with the Treasurer, in the art of inflicting destruction upon Governments of which he is not a Supply. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Supily. member. If we had had those two Ministers in our Government, we should have been there today, and for ten years to come. The only mistake I made was that I did not take them in with me. When I next form a Ministry I shall try hard to include them-that is, if I can do so with due regard for political decency. But I am not one who remembers these things. After I all, one is not injured personally by being relieved from the strain of office. The only two men that I know of in public life who never seem tired of office are my two honourable friends. The Postmaster-General is only a political baby compared to the monarch of the West. There is an earthquake at once if the latter is not in office.

I know that they made representations, passed resolutions against the adoption of that system. The Postmaster-General probably alludes to the fact that they tended that, if the toll system were adopted, the proposed number of calls allowed a fixed charge would not be anything sufficient. They urged that the telephones would not be really useful to even comfor paratively small user's unless an alteration was made in that direction. out that if the proposed scale of charges were adopted a number of persons would have to give up their instruments they could not afford to pay the heavytariff.

If the Postmaster-General can make out a strong case in favour of the toll system I think that he should be supported. At any rate, the existing telephonic system is not satisfactory. There is a good deal of force in the statement of the honourable member for Parramatta that the proposed vote could be better spent in making our telephone system more effective. If that were done, a large sum might be saved in the expense of working it. I can only speak of my own personal experience in connection with this matter. I may tell honourable members that I frequently waste an hour at the telephone, and go away unsatisfied. If I lived closer to the General Post Office I would not be bothered with the instrument at all. For years I endeavoured to do without it, because I knew what a nuisance it was. I sum of hold that it is the duty of the Postmaster General to endeavour to provide us with a more satisfactory system.",61
507,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Lang) [10.13] - Now that the Treasurer is present, I desire to refer to a statement which was made by the Postmaster-General a few minutes ago. I understood him to say that he was anxious to give effect to some of the improvements which have been suggested by honourable members, but that the Treasurer was the "" l i o n in the path."" We all know that the right honourable member for Swan has very large ideas regarding expenditure when it affects Western Australia, but when it becomes a question of incurring expenditure in New South Wales there is a sudden tightening of the Commonwealth purse strings.",61
508,Sir JOHN FORREST,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,No .,61
509,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,That is the case if we are to accept the statement of the Post,61
510,Sir JOHN FORREST,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,What did he say ?,61
511,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,He said that he of would be very happy to carry out some of 7 the improvements suggested if he could seronly induce the Treasurer to loosen the purse strings. I wish the right honourable gentleman would display to New South Wales a little of the liberality which characterizes his actions in regard to expenditure in Western Australia.,61
512,Sir JOHN FORREST,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Does Western Australia enjoy any advantage in connection with these Estimates ?,62
513,Mr TOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"In proportion to her population she has a very decided advantage. So far, we have not dealt with the proposed items of expenditure in Western Australia, and it is questionable whether we ought not to oppose some of those items unless the Treasurer consents to treat the other States a little more liberally.",62
514,Sir JOHN FORREST,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,I shall be delighted.,62
515,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The Treasurer assures us that he will be delighted, so now, apparently, there is no difficulty with him. The Postmaster-General and the Treasurer should confer and whether a little more liberality cannot be displayed by them in making provision for these necessary conveniences for the people residing in the outlying parts of New South Wales. I also hope that the Postmaster-General will be prepared to so extend the metropolitan radius as to include within it populous districts which are at present a short distance beyond it.",62
516,Sir JOHN QUICK,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Bendigo) [10.16] I desire to bring under the attention of the Postmaster-General some representations that have already been made to him by the City Council, the Stock Exchange, and the Chamber of Commerce of Bendigo, respecting the inadequate and defective telephonic service existing between that city and Melbourne, and also between Bendigo, Eaglehawk and suburbs. For upwards of twelve months, these complaints have been pressed upon him by myself, as well as by the representative bodies I have mentioned. The honourable gentleman has received them sympathetically ; he has expressed his desire to attend to and, if possible, remove them, but although many reports on the subject have been received, these grievances have not been removed. The Stock Exchange, as well as the numerous, traders carrying on business in Bendigo, which is a great centre of commerce, have been greatly inconvenienced by the fact that there is only one trunk line to Melbourne. During business hours, when communications are running at high pressure, there is a complete block of business. At the very time of day when 2 the Department should be able to earn a considerable income by transmitting telephonic communications, and giving the people the accommodation they require, a block occurs, with the result that those who wish to communicate with Melbourne often leave the office without patromzing the service. It is all very well to say that these communications should be spread over the whole day. That is impossible.' If the Department desires to extend and popularize the service, it must provide adequate means of communication. When the people find that the means provided are defective, they do not patronize the Department, and revenue is consequently lost. There are already two main trunk lines between Melbourne and Ballarat, ana I believe that there are three between Melbourne and Geelong, whereas there is only one between Melbourne and Bendigo. Bendigo is quite as important a centre of population as is decide either Ballarat or Geelong. Owing to this lack of accommodation and want of speedy communication, the number of subscribers to the Bendigo Telephone Exchange has been declining. The subscribers to the Ballarat Exchange now number 433, that at Geelong has 387 subscribers, whilst that at Bendigo has but 244. Formerly it had a larger number of subscribers than had the Ballarat Exchange, but owing to the defectiveness of the service, the number has been reduced. There are other districts where the Department, instead of popularizing the telephone system, has provided an inadequate service, with the result that it must lose subscribers and revenue. The refusal to duplicate the trunk line between Bendigo and Melbourne is a penny wise and a pound foolish policy. I would urge the Minister to grapple with this question. It has gone beyond the reporting stage; there is nothing more reportable. If the honourable member wishes to increase the business of the Bendigo Exchange, he must duplicate the trunk fine, and must also improve the installation of the local telephone lines. He must make the communication swifter and more complete than it is at present. I am also told that defective instruments are in use. Recently Mr. John Hesketh, the Commonwealth electrical engineer, was sent by the Minister to Bendigo to inquire into the condition of the lines and instruments in use there. He reported that the great bulk of the instruments were obsolete, that Berthon-Ader telephones were in use, whereas the best instruments were those known as the Ericsaro son telephones. The bulk of the subthink scribers complain that the Berthon-Ader struments are out of date, and cannot the work that is expected of them. time has arrived when many of these struments ought to be thrown, on the scrapreferred. heap. It would pay the Department to treat them in that way rather than to have an obsolete plant, earning only a small revenue. If the honourable gentleman wishes this service to earn the revenue that might well be expected of it, he must see that there is a proper supply of up-to-date instruments, and that the whole service modernized. I fail to see why Bendigo and other inland towns should not be supEricsson plied with as good am installation and with as up-to-date instruments as are supplied in Melbourne or Sydney. The towns are just as much entitled to art to-date service as are those cities; believe that there is a tendency to send best instruments to the metropolitan tres, leaving the country districts with unsatisfactory service. For years the comsome plaint of Bendigo and other inland towns has been that the service is inadequate, 1 and unless their requirements are fully sidered the Department will lose revenue. I once more publicly urge the Minister to deal with this question. He ought to take the matter into his ownhands; it useless to refer it to officers for further portHe should place on the Estimates sum sufficient) to provide for proper ments, for increased trunk lines, and a general improvement of the service. thoroughly agree with the views expressed this evening} by representatives of New South Wales with regard to similar comtime plaints on the part of residents of that State. The time has arrived when this service ought to be placed on a proper basis. It is useless to tinker any longer with it. It must be dealt with boldly, done in the matter. comprehensively, and in a scientific ner. I agree with the contention that would be well, as far as possible, to estabsimilar lish the metallic circuit system. I hope that the representations of honourable memman bers from New South Wales, as well as the complaints that have been made by my own constituents, will receive attention. desire is that the Minister will not sayof that "" this matter will be inquired into,"" but that "" this matter will be attended and the grievances rectified.""

517,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Eden-Mon- Postmaster-General) [10.27] - I that the honourable and learned meminber for Bendigo has some ground for comdo plaint. I have given this matter special The attention, and I hope to be able to remedy in some of the grievances to which he has It is extremely difficult to at once meet all these complaints, and especially to replace the Berthon-Ader instruments to which reference has been made. The honourable and learned member is mistaken if he thinks that their use is confined to Bendigo; they are scattered all over the Commonwealth. But it is exis tremely difficult, not only because of financial considerations, but because the instruments may not be available whew we require them, to carry out the demand that the instruments now in use inland shall be at once discarded. The honorupable and learned member for Bendigo but I knows that I have endeavoured to give the special attention to the complaints of cenhis constituents, and that I hope to be an able to remedy, in the very near future, of the grievances which he has voiced. I shall be glad to inform him of the steps that have been takeni, and to receive any confurther suggestions he may desire to make. He has pressed me on several occasions to deal with this matter, and I shall be glad, as far as possible, to remedy any grievis ances relating not only to the telephone resystem in force at Bendigo, but to those a in operation elsewhere. instru Mr DAVID THOMSON (Capricornia) [to.30] - I hope that after these Estimates I have been passed a considerable sum will be available for the extension'of the condenser system'in country districts. Some ago, I asked the Department to connect Westwood. Whvcarbah, and Stanwell, well settled farming districts in my electorate, with Rockhampton; but, so far I have not vet heard that anything is to be I believe that the manProgress Association, of Whycarbah has it written to the Minister, making a request to that which I have already pressed upon him. No doubt the honourable gentleis always pleasant and affable to meet, and declares himself sympathetic; but what I want is practical relief. It seems to me My that he depends too much upon the reports his officials, who live for the most part in the cities, and. not knowing the condito tions of country life, are unsympathetic in regard to requests for improved facilities of communication. I hope that the honourable gentleman will urge upon his officials the desirability of treating applications more generously than, they have done in the past. It would not cost a great deal to connect the railway stations in the district to which I have referred with Rockhampton by means of the condenser system, whereas the connection would be of great advantage to the farmers who do business with that town. It is more necessary, to them to have telephone communication than to obtain a reduction of the postage rate to a penny. The Progress Association has asked me what I have done in this matter.",63
518,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The honourable gentleman has done a great deal in, the way of worrying me to grant what the association wants - I was sorry to hear some remarks a short",64

520,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Eden-Monaro-Postmaster-General ) [10.33] - I shall be very pleased to look into the case which the honourable member has brought under my notice. He has been most persistent in his applications to me for telephone connection,, coming to see me as often as possible. I have made a note of the places to which he has referred, apd hope to be able to give him satisfaction. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON (Barker) [10.34] - Las t year I represented to the Postmaster-General in this Chamber the desirableness of improving the post and telegraph offices at Mount Barker. I then explained that the offices were erected forty years ago, and, while, no doubt, quite adequate for the requirements of that period, have become out of date. I suggested immediate action, ajrid I thought that the wishes of the residents were to be satisfied. So, indeed, did they, because an officer visited Mount Barker, inspected the premises, and promised certain alterations, including the provision of private letterboxes by February last. However, nothing has been done. The case is put very fairly in the following paragraph, which I have taken from a leading article in the Mount Barker Courier:Recently post-offices in places of no greater importance than Mount Barker have been remodelled and brought up-to-date; but in no case could the need for improvements have been more urgent than here, where all that is necessary to meet the wishes of the residents and the just demands of the case could be done by the 2 expenditure of very little money. What is wanted is a more adequate and convenient means of delivering the mails, private letter boxes of the orthodox kind, and a local telephone exchange on the toll system. The claims of the case should be patent to the authorities, who have gone so far as to make inspections and give certain promises, and when the matter of reform is commenced it is to be hoped it will be in no piecemeal fashion, but with a determination to bring the post-office thoroughly up to-date. The department will be conserving its own interests by immediate action. I trust that the Minister will give the matter his immediate consideration, and, as far as possible, meet the wishes of the residents.",64

522,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"East Sydney) [10.37] time ago from an honourable member who seemed to begrudge the liberality of the I trust Treasurer towards Western Australia. In my opinion, that State has not been treated properly, and, if 'anything, the present Treasurer has been slightly less generous to it than any of his predecessors. No doubt its distance has often led to the neglect of its just demands; but, as one who represents an electoral division nearer the centre of government, I shall always be prepared to deal most liberally with its claims.",64
523,Mr FRAZ ER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Kalgoorlie) [10.38] I believe that it is a departmental regulation that telephone extensions are not to be constructed unless there is a reasonable expectation of the return of a considerable percentage on the necessary outlay, and, while I do not advocate the construction of extensions without due consideration, I think that the conditions which have been imposed in many cases have not been satisfactory. Except under very extraordinary and special circumstances, I am altogether opposed to the policy of asking a State to guarantee any part of a Commonwealth undertaking. Though in the Black Range case such a guarantee was asked for, I hope that that policy will not be continued to any extent by the Postmaster-General or his successors.",64
524,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Franklin) [10.39]. - I have, on previous occasions, complained of the hard-and-fast rules of the Department. In my district a telephone connection was asked for, which was estimated by an official to cost £ 1 4 2 . The district in question happened to be immediately beyond the radius within which 2 Supply. [REPRESENTATIVE'S.] the charge was £ 3 per annum. The residents in the district referred to-Por Cygnet-offere d to guarantee fourteen scriptions of £ 3 per annum, or a total of £ 4 2 ; and yet the regulations of the Department were such as to preclude the construction of the 'line. I contend that regulations which prevent the carrying out of works which would return from 33 to 40 per cent, per annum profit represented by cash in advance, and at the same time confer some benefit upon the community, are absolutely absurd. The Minister has met me most kindly in this matter, but he has apparently been powerless. Ever since the Federation was established, the regulations have been of a cast-iron character, and have prevented applications being dealt with upon their merits. It should be one of the chief objects of the administration to afford facilities to settlers in the back blocks, by, as far as possible, extending to them the benefits of telephonic communication. believe that the Post and Telegraph Department requires to be thoroughly overhauled. I do not speak so much of the Ministerial as of the official head of the Department. We have established a system of routine and centralization which necessitates the transaction of all business of importance in the central office in Melbourne. absurd that matters affecting localities in Northern Queensland or in the remofer parts of Western Australia should have to be referred to the head office before anything can be done. We must decentralize our administration before we can achieve satisfactory results. I believe that the DeputyPostmasters-General are .thoroughly comdesire petent men-if they are not they should be^-.and we shall never effect an improvefinger ment until we give them a certain amount of discretion, and enable them to carry out works which will not involve the DepartGeneral ment in any loss. It is time that we dishas pensed with hard and-fast regulations, and conducted our business upon common-sense lines. The Postmaster-General has always treated me most courteously, and I know that the fault does not lie with him so in much as with the sysfem, under which it impossible to deal with individual cases their merits.",64

526,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The greater part t of the vote would have been spent if the subtenders could have been closed in time.,65
527,Mr STORRER,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I can bear out the remarks of the honourable member for Franklin as to the obstacles which are placed in the way of telephonic extensions. Some time ago the departmental officer estimated that the cost of constructing a certain telephone line would be £ 2 5 0 , but it was afterwards ascertained that the work could"" be carried out for £ 1 0 0 . If all the departmental estimates are prepared in the same way, it is not to be wondered at that difficulties should be presented. In one case a gentleman who resided about a mile out of a certain town, applied to have the telephone line extended to his house, and was informed that the annual cost would amount to £ 1 5 per annum. These are the sort of difficulties which prevent our people from enjoying the full beneI fits which would otherwise be conferred by our telephone system. I do not know whether it is the fault of the central authority in Victoria or in Tasmania, but I do know that if a business man controlled the Department he would, send an experienced officer round to advise intending subscribers upon the spot, and the reI t is sult would unquestionably be a material increase in the amount of revenue derived. I trust that some such officer will be appointed to visit each State in the Commonwealth.",65
528,Mr WILKS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Dalley) [10.51] -- I merely to emphasize the fact that the honourable member for Franklin has placed his upon a very weak spot in our postal administration- I refer to the evil of centralization. I believe that the Postmasterhas more work cast upon him than any of his colleagues. A good deal of that work is due to the system of centralL ization which has been adopted, and which is opposed to the efficient management of the service. Seeing that we have appointed the different States high-salaried officers is in the persons of the Deputy Postmasterson General, it seems ridiculous that they should be required to refer the decision of the most trivial matters to the central office in Melbourne. If these officers cannot be to invested with a certain amount of discrepower, they ought not to be retained in the service. In my humble judgment, conwhilst this system of centralization is permitted to continue, the true interests of the Department must suffer. The prowisdom posed vote in respect of wireless teleinto graphy is one upon which honourable memposes, bers should be afforded some information. I have in my mind a speech which was dein ships."" livered by the Postmaster-General at the installation of the Marconi system at Queenscliff- a speech in which he pointed out the great advantages which it would confer upon the sea-travelling maintain that, if the sum of £10,000 is intended to provide for the erection of suitable wireless telegraphic stations around the cost of Australia, it is altogether inadefit quate for the purpose. If , oh the other hand, it is merely designed to cover cost of the existing stations at Queenscliff and Devonport, the amount is too large. My own knowledge of the Marconi system leads me to say that it is a very expensive one to instal upon vessels. Certainly, ordinary ships trading around our coast lished. could not afford to be fitted with it. Upon the large Atlantic liners I am aware that the system is installed, but honourable bers must recollect that they cater for class of very wealthy passengers, who can afford to transmit Marconigrams whilst voyaging between Liverpool and New York. That condition, however, does not apply to the ships which trade along the carrying coast of Australia. I would further point out that neither the captain nor the officers of most vessels could successfully employ the Marconi system. It requires a verynumber expert telegraphist to handle the machines, and he needs to be possessed of mechanical knowledge in case they should get out order. These objections constitute a suffihonorable cient answer to the speech of the Postthe master-General at Queenscliff. If he can remove those objections, I shall be glad see the people of Australia enjoying as uption. to-date communication, by means of wirecomplete less telegraphy, as is enjoyed by portion of the world.",65
529,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Eden-Monaro-Postmaster-General ) [10.58] - I admit that the sum of £10,000 would not be sufficient to instal any complete system of wireless telegraphy along the coast of Australia. That system is an innovation in this graphy country. But it has passed the experimental stage, 'and is already being used with very great advantage in other parts of the world. The Government have placed this sum upon the Estimates, because-whils t we recognise that it is necessary to proceed with extreme caution-w e cannot doubt the of introducing the wireless system Australia, not only for commercial purbut with a view to protecting the lives of persons who "" go down to the sea",66

However, the arrangements are at present only in the initial stage; and a of suggestions have been made as to the places at which there should be installations, and as to the cost which may of be incurred.

535,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The Government have given a guarantee to the Eastern Extension Company, and that guarantee does not expire for three years. While we should be glad to have wireless telegraphic communication with Tasmania, we must be careful not to come into competition with ourselves during the term of the guarantee. There are places, however, where there is no telegrahic communication of any kind, and suggestions have been made for resorting to wireless telegraphy in such cases. One suggestion is that there should be communication with New Guinea, and there is another suggestion that there should be a power station in New Zealand, and another on the mainland here, connected with Tasmania, King Island, and other places. We must proceed very cautiously, however, in order to ascertain, first of all, which is the best system. In the meantime, we cannot ask for definite estimates, considering that presently the rival companies may come into competition.",66

543,Sir JOHN FORREST,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Ne w Guinea, too.",67
544,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"That would not appear so from the information we have been given. There is already cable communication with Tasmania, and yet it is intended to establish a wireless telegraphy station so as to touch King Island. Until vessels have this installation, there is no necessity to vote this money. The large ocean steamers may find sufficient stations on the voyage to warrant their installing the plant, and when that has been done, there will be time enough for us to move in the matter. If this money is intended to give encouragement to some people or companies who are experimenting, we ought to remember that they have come out to Australia for business, and ought to take the risks. On the occasion of the recent visit to Queenscliff, I heard some rather florid speeches on the advantage of the system from the gentlemen who entertained us, but all he said only went to show that our installation would be of no use until the ships are fitted with the necessary appliances. King Island is a most insignificant place, which' certainly does not warrant this expenditure, and I hope that the Minister, after consideration, will decide to strike out the item. The Minister himself has informed us that there are now three or four systems, and that the Government are not satisfied that the Marconi system is the best. My own opinion is that the northern part of Australia, where there are very dangerous waters, would present the best opening for wireless telegraphy. There vessels are likely to meet wifh disaster, and the system would be of importance in ar- the case of the approach of an enemy.",67
545,Mr CAMERON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Wilmot) [11.9] Honourable members appear to have overlooked one fact, which has rather an im-' portant bearing upon this vote. Tasmania at the present time is connected with the mainland by cable, but we all know that cables, owing to the action of the waves, and the presence of rocks, are liable to chafe and part. Some years ago the cable between Low Head and Tasmania was cut by rocks, and some months elapsed before communication could be restored. The Marconi system at the present moment is installed between Queenscliff and Devonport. The expenditure in connection with it is not considerable. It seems to me that it is better that it should remain as it is, even if it is not used, because no man can tell at what moment the cable may be cut. Even supposing the installation' of the Marconi system between Tasmania and the mainland cost £ 1 , 0 0 0 or £ 1 , 5 0 0, the interest expenditure is comparatively small; and I am quite sure that even the cable company would be pleased to have a system in operation which would enable communication with Tasmania to be restored immediately, in the event of the cable communication being temporarily impaired. The proposal of the Postmaster-General is, under the circumstances, extremely reasonable. Had it beeni to erect an expensive system at once, I do not know that, with my views on economy, I should have supported it ; but, seeing that the system has been erected, it would be suicidal, for the sake of £ 1 , 0 0 0 o r £ ' > SJ to block the policy of the Post0 0 master-General.",67

The able member tells us that, owing to stress of weather, the cable system between Tasluxuries mania and the mainland is liable to becan come deranged. The Postmaster-General, however, has not told us how the money to be spent. I like to see Australia keep up-to-date in all matters, but, in my view, if wireless telegraphy is to be installed anything like a useful scale, the expendivessels, ture proposed is insufficient. If it is desir-. able that we should have it at all, should have the system right round coasts. Certainly, £1.0,000 would not suffice for that. The remarks of the Postrather master - General regarding shipwrecked sailors were attractive from a point of view, but they really had no value, because all that is at present proposed as I understand it , a system of wireless telegraphy between Australia and Tasmuch mania. 6 n the occasion of the installation at Queenscliff, it is remarkable that the Governor General's message and the Postrests master-General's message got through all right; whereas the most angelic message sent by the Prime Minister never got through while we were there: It must, somehow, King Island. have got wafted up to the spirit regions. 2 It was so beautifully, worded that even the Marconi system broke down under it .

It is all humbug to talk as though what is proposed is for the benefit of Australia generally. It is nothing of the kind. £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 will not nearly supply the coast of Australia with wireless telegraphy apparatus.

Take the case of the people of The Commonwealth is at present spending something like £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 2 Supply. [REPRESENTATIVES.] per annum on Papua, .where there are something like 600 white people and a good many blacks. On King Island there is a community of 600 whites, who have very little communication with the mainland, or with Tasmania. A steamer calls once about every three weeks, when she is not prevented now from doing so by stress of weather. people on Flinders Island, and on other islands in Bass Straits, are similarly badly situated. I have known shipwrecks to occur of which no news has been received until three or four weeks after the occurrence in consequence of bad weather in the Straits. It is not fair for the Commonwealth to treat these people in the way I have indicated. If the Flinders Island group were not in my own electorate I should advocate their cause more strongly than I do. King Island is not in my electorate, and I repeat that, having regard to the consideration shown to other parts of the Commonwealth, it is not fairly treated. I have been endeavouring to secure a grant' of a few pounds per annum to provide steam communication between these islands and Tasmania, and I certainly think that we ought to be connected with them by wireless telegraphy. Honourable members are perhaps unaware of the extent of the shipping passing through the Straits between Victoria and Tasmania, of. the large number of wrecks which have occurred in the neighbourhood of these islands.. If by means of wireless telegraphy we could establish speedy communication between the islands and the mainland many lives might be saved.",68
554,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Franklin) [11.21]. - This is a very important item, concerning which the fullest information should be supplied, but I am quite prepared to accept the statement of Ministers that they do not intend to expend the whole amount at the present time. If experiments are to be conducted, by all means let them be carried out where they will be of practical use. Instead of erecting stations solely for experimental purposes, we should establish them where they will be of practical use.' The honourable member for Dalley has referred rather slightingly to King Island, but in no part of the Commonwealth do people suffer greater inconvenience and receive less attention than do the residents of that important island. As the honourable member for Bass has said, there are practically as many white people on King Island as theTe are in Papua, where Supply. we are spending a large sum of money and getting little for it. If there is one section of the community which will be specially deserving of our consideration when these experiments are being conducted, it is that of King Island, which is practically shut off from the The rest of Australia. We have an opportunity to conduct experiments in wireless telegraphy which may be of practical use to the whole of Australia, and which will certainly confer an absolute blessing on people who are deprived of many of the advantages of civilization. Proposed vote agreed to. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY. Division 6 (Government Printing Office), £i,5 00",69
555,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"East Sydney) [11.24] - I wish to say, Mr Chairman, that I intended to speak on the division with which we have just dealt, but that just as you were about to put the question I was inveigled into a private conversation by the Government Whip, and so lost my opportunity * Mr ""HUTCHISON (Hindmarsh) [11.25] - The hour is rather late to enter upon the consideration of an item relating to a Department which involves a vast exand penditure, respecting which much information is necessary. The proposed vote relates to machinery and plant for the Government Printing Office, and works in connection therewith. This is a very expensive and unsatisfactory Department, and I hold that it is high time that we had a Commonwealth Government Printing Office. It is estimated that the Department will cost us about £13,000 during the current financial year. Notwithstanding the enormous sum which we pav for our printing, the bound copies of Hansard and the parliamentary papers for last session did not reach us until a few days before the opening of the present session.",69
556,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,And we did not obtain until quite recently bound copies of the measures passed last session.,69
557,Mr HUTCHISON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"That is so. Surely the Parliamentary papers can be bound and sent out more expeditiously than they are at present. I know a little about the printing trade, and have been looking at the cost of some of the items relating to this Department. If we are supplying our own machinery we are certainly paying an enormous price for our printing. I wish to know - whether the machinery which we have provided is used solely for Commonwealthpurposes? Jn the interests of the taxpayer, it is necessary that we should inquire into these items, and I trust that the Treasurer, to whose Department this matter relates, will be able to furnish an answer to my question.",69
558,Sir JOHN FORREST,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Swan-Trea surer) [ir.28] - The honourable member for Hindmarsh is aware that the Victorian Government Printer attends to the printing requirements of the Commonwealth. The resources of the State Printing Office are placed at our disposal, and the Commonwealth plant is used for State purposes. If it is found convenient to use the Commonwealth printing plant for State purposes, use the State plant for Commonwealth purposes, that course is followed. I believe, notwithstanding what has been said by some honourable members, that the arrangement is an economical one, and that it would cost us far more to conduct a separate printing office of our own.",70
559,Mr HUTCHISON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I do not think and I speak as a practical printer, who has looked into this question.",70
560,Sir JOHNFORREST,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I know that the honourable member and some of the party he belongs to consider that it would be better for the Commonwealth to establish a great printing office of its own, but I think that we are under a great obligation to the Government of Victoria, who have placed at our disposal the services of the State printer, as well as their plant and buildings.",70
561,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Do we not contribute anything to the expenses of the State Printing Office? We ought to do so.,70
562,Sir JOHN FORREST,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"We pay for the time actually devoted to Commonwealth work by State officers. Although I am anxious that every economy should be practised, still, I think that when we do establish a Commonwealth Printing Office, we shall find that our expenditure on printing will be much greater than it is under the present arrangement.",70
563,Mr HUTCHISON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Hindmarsh) [ n . 3 1 ] - I cannot say that the Treasurer's reply is satisfactory to me. I have been a practical printer all my life, and have had experience in every branch of the trade. I have also had some experience in regard to the working of the Government Printing 2 Office in South Australia. I can assure honourable members that it is conducted upon anything but an economical scale, and that there is room for radical alteration there. I do not allege, however, that that is the case in regard to the Government Printing Office in Victoria. I know that in adding plant to that office",70
564,Sir JOHN FORREST,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"It wil l belong, 'to the Commonwealth.",70
565,Mr HUTCHISON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Exactly; but, in the course of a few years, it will be quite useless.",70
566,Sir JOHN FORREST,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"We use their plant, too.",70
567,Mr HUTCHISON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The plants in the Printing office are depreciating very rapidly. The Treasurer will' find that if he makes or to a 20 per cent, reduction in the value every year, he is not making tc'o large an allowance.",70
568,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Surely the _ honourable member does not expect the Victorian Government to supply the Commonwealth with a plant for nothing !,70
569,Mr HUTCHISON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"No ; and the so, Commonwealth pays for all its printing. If we did not have any plant in that office, our printing could be done for much less in an office of our own. We really do not know what our printing costs. I do not know whether we are paying a high figure or not, but I am aware that the bound volumes of parliamentary' papers ancl Hansard are not produced as expeditiously as they should be. I only received my volumes of Hansard a few days before the beginning of this session, and some honourable members had not received their copies even at that time. I am quite satisfied with the manner in which Hansard is produced during the session. The expenditure is increasing so rapidly, that we ought to be careful in regard to every item. If it were not proposed to increase, the expenditure by £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 for one purpose, £ 5 0 . 0 0 0 for another, and £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 for, say, deporting Kanakas, I should have no objection to this small item. It is high time, I think, jbat honourable members took more interest iro the Estimates for works and buildings, in order to see that unnecessary expenditure i l not incurred. The country is entitled to the information for which I have asked'. I shall have more to say on the subject when we are dealing with the Estimates ins chief.",70
570,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,East Sydney) [11.34] - I suppose that the plant which it is proposed to purchase \\\\\ be useful for the Commonwealth.,70
571,Sir JOHN FORREST,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Yes ; it is all earmarked, and belongs to us.",71
572,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I hope that it will be some time before we establish a Federal Printing Office. Printing establishments involve an expenditure of thousands and thousands of pounds, and I think that by a judicious arrangement with the States, which have splendid printing offices, we can get our work done at a much more reasonable amount than we could in a printing office of our own. I agree with the remarks of the Treasurer. Proposed vote agreed to. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE. Division 7 (Special Defence Material), £130,000.",71
573,Mr DAVID THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Capricornia) [11.35] - I a m v e r ister representing the Minister of Defence in his place, because I wish to elicit whether tenders for saddlery have been called for in the open market, or whether a price has been fixed by the Department? There are striking peculiarities in connection with the contracts which were let in the different States last year. According to the figures which have been published in the Gazette, we have in Australia, not only a shipping combine, but also a harness combine. All tin; tenderers for the supply of harness in the different States fixed upon the same prices to a penny. In the case of the Field Artillery equipment in New South Wales, the contractors were Messrs. J. J. Weekes Limited, whose prices were as follow :Harness, Breast, Pole Draught, R.A. pattern 36 sets wheel, near ... 36 sets wheel, off... ... 36 sets centre, near ... 36 sets centre, off . .. --36 sets lead, near .. --36 sets lead, off .. --- --- 9 4 6 76 sets universal saddlery The contractors for the supply of harness to the Field Artillery of Victoria were Messrs. Guthridge and Company, who charged the same prices to a penny as did the New South Wales contractor. In Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, Messrs, Holden and Frost got the contract, and they charged the same prices to a penny, as did the other contractors.",71
574,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,There must have been collusion between them.,71
575,Mr DAVID THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"In Tasmania it is the same. In Western Australia, when some extra sets were required, Messrs. J. Colton and Company got the contract.",71
576,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,At the same price?,71
577,Mr DAVID THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Yes . With regard to medical equipment, I find that the prices at which Messrs. J. J. Weekes Limited tendered for the New South Wales supplies wereHarness, collar, G.S., for ambulance and transport waggons- per set. £ s. d. 4 sets wheel, near ... ... 17 8 6 4 sets wheel, off ... .. 13 15 o 4 sets lead, near ... ... 17 o 6 4 sets lead, off ... ... ... 13 4 o 3 single sets for one-horse vehicle... 12 8 o 25 sets universal saddlery ... 6 18 6 Messrs. Hunter and Company have the contract for Victoria, and their prices vary y pleased to see the Min- only in regard to the near wheel sets, in which there is a difference of 11s. 3d. Matthew Hemsworth had the contract for Queensland, and his prices were identical with those which I have given, as were also those of Messrs. Holden and Frost for South Australia.",71
578,Sir JOHN FORREST,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,What'is the point? No doubt the lowest tenders were accepted.,71
579,Mr DAVID THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The surprising thing is that the prices are identical in each State. It seems to me that the Department is being taken down by some arrangement between the tenderers. Some time ago I was in correspondence with Messrs. Mountcastle and Sons, whose contract was cancelled in July.",71
580,Mr HUTCHISON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"On what ground ? per set. Mr DAVID THOMSON - Because the £ s. d. Department thinks that each State should ... 10 9 6 manufacture its own requirements. I be... 10 8 6 lieve in that. I do not think that goods ... 9 15 6 9 4 ^ required in Queensland should be made in 9 '5 6 South Australia, or that goods required in South Australia should be made in New -- 6 iS 6 South Wales. If harness or leather work is needed in New South Wales, it should be made there. Under the present system of calling for tenders in all the States there seems to be collusion as to prices, under which the Department suffers. I find that Messrs. Holden and Frost get the biggest share in the business.",71
581,Mr HUTCHISON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,They are the best makers of harness in the Commonwealth. That was proved in the Boer war.,71
582,Mr DAVID THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"There are harnessmakers in Rockhampton who hold certificates as to the excellent workmanship of the saddlery which they made for the Boer war. Those certificates prove that their work was done to the satisfaction of the Department, but not that it was better than that of any one else. The Department should see that it is not taken down bycombines.",71
583,Mr EWING,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I am not prepared to give the honourable member any information with regard to this matter to-night, but I shall be able to furnish him with an answer tomorrow.",72
584,Mr DAVIDTHOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I ask the Minister to promise that in future the requirements of the States shall, as far as possible, be made within their own borders. Each State should do its own work, and, moreover, each centre of population should have an opportunity to tender for local work. For instance, tenders should be called in places like Rockhampton and Townsville, instead of merely in Brisbane, because the people of the central and northern parts of Queensland do not take the Brisbane newspapers, and may therefore be ignorant of the fact that tenders are being called. I do not think that this system would result in the Department having to pay more for its articles, because in most country towns they can manufacture nearly as cheaply as in the larger centres. have been'told that the halters and pickets used by the Defence Department are not manufactured in Australia. is so, I do not know the reason, because the ropes themselves can be easily made, whereas the pickets are merely pegs shod with metal. These articles could be manufactured in Australia, because they are composed mainly of rope.",72
585,Mr HUME COOK,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,They are made by the thousand in Brunswick.,72
586,Mr DAVIDTHOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"All I know consider is that they are being introduced into the various States, and that no opportunity given to the local manufacturers that they can produce them.",72
587,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Is the honourable member quoting from some official publication as to prices-is he satisfied that the prices correctly quoted?,72
588,Mr DAVID THOMSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Yes . I am quoting from the Commonwealth Gazette. I hope that the Minister will look into this matter, and see that the work is distributed over the various centres in something like an equitable manner.",72
589,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"East Sydney) [11.51] - At an earlier stage of the evening, I certainly expressed my willingness to remain here until the whole of the Estimates relating to new works and buildings were disposed of. Of course, I cannot go back upon that arrangement, but I must say that I did not calculate upon our having, at this hour of the night, to consider a division involving a proposed vote of £ 1 3 0 , 0 0 0 for military supplies. However, if the Government think it necessary, I am prepared to go on. I regret that very few honourable members seem to take an interest in proposal's in volving such a very large expenditure; although I must admit that we have a larger attendance now than at almost any previous stage of the sitting-w e have nearly a quorum. I think that the honourable member for Capricornia has rendered a distinct service in calling attention to the matters to which he has alluded. I understand that the figures quoted by him are taken from the Commonwealth Government Gazette, and I cannot understand why the Treasurer fails to realise the seriousness of the case to which attention has been directed.",72
590,Sir JOHN FORREST,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I said that the prices quoted were those of the lowest tenderer. I Mr Reid - Yes ; but when tenders are called in six different States, and the tender accepted in each case is for exactly the If that same amount, much sagacity is not required to arrive at an understanding of the situation. The honourable member for Capricornia has mentioned the names of several firms. If , after all, they are one and the same firm, it is as well that the Government should know it . When tenders of the same amount are received from a number of different firms, the Department mav that the price fixed is a reasonable one, but if the same firm tenders under a is number of different names, a deception is to show practised on the Department.",72
591,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"They are distinct firms, but they are working in unison.",72
592,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"That is an operation into are which we can all agree to look very caref u l l y. If one firm is enjoying a monopoly in connection with the supply of certain articles, we shall all feel indebted to the honourable member for Capricornia for having directed attention to the matter.",72
593,Sir JOHN FORREST,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,We shall look into it all right.,72
594,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I quite agree with the honourable member for Capricornia that, given anything like equal prices, local tenderers should have preference.",73
595,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The preference is always given to local tenderers if the prices are the same.,73
596,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I should think it would be SO.' But I understand, from what the honourable member for Capricornia has said, that that rule was not observed in the case to which he has referred.",73
597,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Tender s were sent in by a number of different firms, but in some cases they worked in unison.",73
598,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Passin g from that matter, I desire to point out that a marvellous want of calculation is displayed in connection with the item ""Accoutrements, saddle-trees, stirrups, and bits."" We expect the Estimates to be framed with some regard to the necessities of the case. I find that last year we voted £42,750, buf that the actual expenditure amounted to only '£4>859notice further that we voted £22,500 for "" making saddles."" Therefore, we appropriated a sum of £65,000 for these two items of a similar character. No doubt it was assumed by honourable members that the public service required the expenditure of something like that amount upon these supplies, but we find",73
599,Mr EWING,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The right honourable member must remember that these were really his Estimates. Mr .REID - That only shows that the Government starved the votes in order that they might spend the money in other directions.,73
600,Mr EWING,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"If the right honourable gentleman will look at the Estimates, he will find that, instead of spending the money upon accoutrements we bought rifles. We could buy saddles at any time, but we could not procure rifles with the same readiness.",73
601,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Does the Minister mean to say that, if we vote £42,000 for saddletrees, stirrups, and bits, the 'Government can spend the money upon rifles?",73
602,Mr EWING,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"We informed the House, ancl obtained their approval.",73
603,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"We are being introduced into a really marvellous field of amusement. The Government solemnly ask honourable members to vote a certain sum for stirrups and bits, and afterwards tell them that they are going to spend the money upon rifles. Honourable members, after having seen the items in the Estimates for two years, are told that the money is to be spent, not upon bits, but upon rifles. All that I cani say is that we are learning a lot in connection with the way in which the public funds are disbursed. Surelv, in view of the fact that the Government intended to use the money for an entirely different purpose, they might have amended the Appropriation Act.",73
604,Mr EWING,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"We used money out of the Treasurer's Advance Account for the purchase of rifles, and saved a similar amount upon the vote for accoutrements.",73
605,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Apparentl y we never know under which thimble the pea is to be found. The Minister's explanation makes the matter still more amusing. I hope that in the future the Estimates will be more reliable, and will convey more information to the public, because, if the practice pursued in the past is persisted in, we shall never have a proper system of accounts. I know that I the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who takes a personal interest in the Defence Department-althoug h he never visits it-wil l see that these matters are attended to. I suppose that we may take it that we have his personal assurance upon that matter.",73
606,Mr EWING,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Certainly . The right honourable member has my assurance.,73
607,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"In view of that assurance, I will defer some other remarks which I had intended to make.",73
608,Mr HUTCHISON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Hindmarsh) [12.1]. - As it is the intention of 'the Government to put through the Works and buildings Estir mates to-night, I merely wish to say that wherever the expenditure of a large sum is involved, it should be very closely scrutinized, especially in view of the great change of opinion which: js coming over the minds of many in regar<rto our defences. We are all anxious to place the Commonwealth upon a proper footing, so far as its defence is. concerned, but the question which arises is whether it would not be wise to expend upon our naval forces some of the large sums of money which are now being expended upon our land forces. Upon these Estimates a large amount is set down for the purchase of Lee-Enfield rifles. Most honourable members must have noticed in the press the other day the statement that the rifles which the Commonwealth has been purchasing are not satisfactory. Personally I have no desire to sanction the expenditure of a large sura .for the purchase of defective rifles. We know very well that such weapons have been - sent out to Australia in very large quantities. When the opportunity presents itself of discussing the Estimates of the Defence Department, I shall have something more to say upon this question.",73
609,Mr WILKS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Dalley) [12.3] - I notice that the sum of ^£21,000 is provided upon these Estimates for the purchase of small arms ammunition, and a further sum of £15,000 for the purchase of artillery ammunition for our fixed defences. Is it not high time that the Government established its own ammunition factory in Australia, especially in view of the fact that the large stores of ammunition which are now in hand are yearly depreciating ? As ai matter of fact, the authorities have occasionally to issue instructions to our forces to fire off some of this ammunition, which has become useless. Only some twelve months ago at t Goat Island, in Sydney, certain members of our Defence Forces were amusing themselves, to the great annoyance of the public, by firing off useless ammunition for a period of five weeks. I bad to get the medical authorities to interpose, in order to prevent the residentis of the vicinity from becoming invalided. If we established our. own ammunition factory, we should not be called upon to waste money in. that way.",74
610,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Does not the use of ammunition which is at present being manufactured burst the guns?,74
611,Mr WILKS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I am aware that the Estimates of the Defence Department lend themselves peculiarly, to a display of jocularity, but I can assure the honourable member (for Lang that there is no more serious matter to be faced than the urgent necessity which exists for establishing an ammunition factory within the Commonwealth.",74
612,Mr BROWN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"Canobolas) [12.7] - The Defence Department is undoubtedly the great spending Department. It is so liberal in its expenditure that it is very necessary for us to keep a close watch upon the demands which it makes upon the Commonwealth. There are some very heavy items of expenditure included in these Estimates, but, as the leader of the Opposition is prepared to assist the Government to pass them, it is idle for me to offer amy further protest.",74
613,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"I merely spoke for myself, and for any honourable member who chose to act upon my advice, but I never dreamed that we should be discussing these Estimates at this hour of the morning. Personally, I think that there ought to be an adjournment of the debate.",74
614,Mr BROWN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"There are important items in these Estimates which ought to receive fair discussion. At this late hour, however, it is quite impossible to expect intelligent discussion of them.",74
615,Mr ISAACS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Upon the Estimates-in'chief the honourable member will have a full opportunity of discussing the defence policy of the Government.,74
616,Mr BROWN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"But I shall not have an opportunity to debate this particular vote. I support the view entertained by the honourable member for Hindmarsh that greater consideration should be given to our naval defence than has hitherto been extended to it. Possibly some reduction, might be made upon these Estimates which would enable that to be done. I notice that it is proposed to spend a sum of £70,000 odd upon the purchase of ammunition and rifles. I should like to know when the Commonwealth is going to manufacture small arms for itself? That matter was discussed at the outset of the Federation, and we were assured that the Commonwealth would move in that direction. But today we occupy precisely the position which we occupied then. These are matters which should be discussed, and upon the Estithe mates-in-chief I shall avail myself of the opportunity of debating the Government policy in this connection. Mr Reid! (East Sydney) [12.9] I should like an explanation of the item ""Field artillery, guns, harness, waggons, and ammunition, ^£53,040."" Last year we voted £58,000 for the purchase of these things, but only £10,000 of it was spent The result is that although during the past two years we shall appear to have voted £ m , o o o in the direction indicated, we shall in reality have only spent ,£63,000. All these figures are most misleading. I do not know whether the Vice-President of the Executive Council has any definite information to impart to the Committee, although I recognise that he has plenty of assurance. Can the honourable gentleman give any explanation how it is that the Inspector General of Fortifications spent only ,£10,000 out of a sum of £58,000 voted for field artillery ?",74
617,Mr EWING,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The information I have is that, first of all, there was some delay in ordering the guns in question, and then they were not delivered.",74

619,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"East Sydney) [12.15] - I recognise the wisdom of granting the Government these supplies at the earliest possible moment, but I hope this will not be taken as a precedent, because it is serious to allow appropriations to go through en the suspension of the Standing Orders.

In the interests of the country, it is about time we had such a factory.
