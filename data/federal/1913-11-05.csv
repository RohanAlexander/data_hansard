23,Mr GLYNN,NORTHER N TERRITOR Y,"It is not proposed to hand over, to a private company, all matters in connection with refrigeration in Northern Territory. There is already refrigerating accommodation there. think that the honourable member, in asking the question, had in his mind the freezing works the establishment of which was contemplated by the last Government. As I said last week, I have been considering the possibility of having such works established by private enterprise. On the facts before me, I do not think that we would be justified in carrying out the works at the public expense, at all events at the present time. COTTON-GROWING INDUSTRY.",13

The Commissioners are leaving us in a day or two, and it would be well if they could be given an answer before they go.",13
26,Mr GLYNN,NORTHER N TERRITOR Y,"I have received no communications recently. The last intimation we had was from Victoria to the effect that if the other States were agreeable, that State would join. South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania were, I think, inclined to send exhibits, but they would not share in the financial responsibility. New South Wales was, I think, rather inclined to join, but I have not heard further to that effect. I believe that the visit of our American cousins has had the result that what was a possibility has become a probability, namely, that there will be concert between the States and the Commonwealth. ENGLISH ELECTORAL LAW .",13

40,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHER N TERRITOR Y,"Then I rise to a question of privilege, and shall conclude with a motion. It would not have taken a moment more to ask the question, but, of course, if there is a desire to evade the question, that is another thing. The question concerns the passing of a certain ill in this Chamber; and I think it is just is as well we should know exactly where we in relation to it . Last week a Bill was introduced and passed.",14
41,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHER N TERRITOR Y,"Order ! The honourable member is now distinctly going berehind my ruling. He cannot raise a quesof privilege on a matter already and dealt with-in the House.

54,Mr GROOM,NORTHER N TERRITOR Y,"My attention was this question for a few days. drawn to the paragraph to which the honourable member refers, but aware that the Director made any such statement.

63,Mr HIGGS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I rise to a point of order, and I direct attention to standing order 274, which readsNo member shall digress from the subject matter of any question under discussion, nor anticipate the discussion of "" any other subject which appears on the notice-paper. I draw special attention to the words ' ' anticipate the discussion of any other subject which appears on the notice-paper."" You will notice, sir, that the first Order of the Day is the Postal Voting Restoration Bill , and that Order of the Day No. 6 is the Electoral Bill of 1913. ing at Part 10 of the Electoral Bill of 1913, I find several clauses relating to voting by post. For instance109. An elector who(a) has reason to believe that he will not, at any time during the hours of polling on polling day, be within 5 miles of any polling place for the division which be is enrolled; or (i) being a woman, will, on account of i health, be unable to attend ing place on polling day to vote; or - (c) will be prevented by. serious illness or infirmity from attending the polling place on polling-day to vote, may make application for a postal vote certificate and ballot-paper. 2. The application may be in the prescribed form, and must be signed by the elector in his own handwriting in the presence of an authorized witness, and must be made and sent, after the issue of the writ for the election, and before the polling day for the election, to the returning officer for the division for which the applicant elector is enrolled. 3. In the case of an application under paragraph (a), ihe applicant must state in the application his reason for his belief. 4. An elector shall not make, aud a person shall not induce an elector to make, any false statement in an application for a postal vote certificate and postal ballot-paper. Penalty : Fifty pounds, or one month's imprisonment. Then follows a clause dealing with authorized witnesses. I . s h all not weary honourable members by - reading it . We have otherclauses dealing with the duty of authorized"" witnesses, the issue of certificates and ballot-papers in connection with the postal vote, the inspection of applications for the postal vote, the numbering of applications and certificates dealing with the postal vote, the initialing of postal ballot-papers,, the duty of the Returning Officer to notify the issue of postal vote certificates and postal ballot papers, and directions for postal voting, these occupying full y a page. Another page deals with the duty of an authorized witness, and with the duty of persons preBILL. sent when an elector votes by post, also with the preliminary scrutiny of postal ballot-papers. We have on still another page clauses dealing with the counting of postal ballot-papers, with the "" review of decision,"" and with mistakes that may be made in connection with the postal ballot-papers. You know very well, sir, that it is the practice of this House to prevent any anticipatory discussion on a Bill or motion. We need not refer to the practice of the House of Commons, because we have both practice and traditions of our own. We have had experience in matters of this kind extendOn look- ing over twelve years. The other day you ruled out a motion having reference to the Tasmania grant on the ground that there was a motion already on the notice-paper dealing with that matter. I would not like it to happen that we should forget our practice. Owing to the excitement which has permeated the for political atmosphere for the past week- I l l - do not think that you will be at all disthe poll- turbed-bu t we may be, because we are only human, and it is possible that there may be a little mental disturbance or storm preventing us from arriving at a decision as cool as that at which we might arrive in other circumstances. But I hope, Mr Speaker, that you will see your way clear to carry out the practice of this House, which I venture to submit is that an honourable member should not be allowed to anticipate a discussion on business that is on the paper. The Bill which the honourable gentleman proposes to introduce covers the whole of the ground which I have just set out and which is embodied in the Order of the Day No. 6-the Electoral Bill of 1913. The mere fact that any particular party has a majority does not justify this' riding rough-shod over the practice of Parliament. The absence of a member of the Opposition is not a reason why we should abandon the political- I shall not say "" game,"" because T do not like the word-bu t political procedure. I submit that it is due to you that the Prime Minister, who has charge of the Postal Voting Bill",16
64,Mr SPEAKER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The honourable member may not go into that matter. He must discuss the point of order.,17
65,Mr HIGGS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I submit that the Prime Minister is not in order. toral Bill were out of the way, the Prime Minister would be in order in introducing this measure, and to put it in order he should move that Order of the Day No. 6 be discharged from the business paper. He could move its restoration after the Postal Voting Restoration Bill had been dealt with . I would point out to you the disadvantage that might follow the adoption of the course now proposed by the Government.. It is possible that some honourable members might have beeu away from the Chamber for a week",17
66,Mr SPEAKER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,That has nothing to - do with the point of order.,17
67,Mr HIGGS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The order of business is aet for th in the notice-paper, and it is possible for an honourable member, looking at the business-paper for a week ago, - to have concluded that since there was no reference to the Postal VotingRestoration Bill , the question of postal voti n g would be discussed on the Electoral Bill. An honourable member might very well say, "" I shall attend a week hence :in my place in Parliament, because the Electoral Bill , which provides for voting by post, will not be further discussed until then."" I submit that this Bill is not, and cannot be, in order until the Electoral Bill dealing with the question of the postal vote has been disposed of, and that the Prime Minister - cannot properly proceed further with it .",17
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Mr Speaker,17
69,Mr SPEAKER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I am quite prepared to give my ruling. As a matter of fact, I have already decided this point of order. I did not care to interrupt honourable member, but I would point out to him now that this question was raised last week by, I think, the Leader of mitted. the Opposition, and I then decided that it was competent for two Bills relating to the one matter to be on the businessthe paper at the same time. That ruling is supported by May, ' l l t h edition, page 468, where we have the statement-i-and this is what I had in mind in giving my decision-that There is no rule or custom which restrains the Restoration introduction of . two or more Bills relating to the same subject, and containing similar provisions. That makes the position quite clear, and there can be no question that the matter is perfectly in order.  If the Elec- Standing Orders?",17
70,Mr SPEAKER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"May I supplement what I have said by calling attention to the terms of one of our own Standing Orders, which providesNo member shall digress from the subject matter of any question under discussion, nor anticipate the discussion of any other subject which appears on the notice-paper. This simply deals with a matter which is before the House.",17
71,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [3.36] - I think it well to state frankly at the outset that this shorter Bill is being submitted because of the late stage of the session at which we have arrived, and because the prospect of passing the larger measure within reasonable time this session seems to be somewhat remote.",17
72,Mr WEST,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The honourable member is afraid to go on with the Electoral Bill .,17

I intimate to the House now, that honourable members must be heard in silence, or as nearly as possible in silence. Reasonable interruptions now and again the will not be objected to, but anything in the nature of disorder or continuous or repeated interruptions will not be per",17
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"If opportunity offers later we shall be glad to attempt larger measure of electoral reform., Meantime, we feel that we are pledged to make an effort, and a serious effort, to put this proposal before both Houses of the Parliament. If tliere be one thing more than another to which this Government pledged itself at the last election, it was the restoration of postal voting, and it is in accordance with that pledge, reiterated from every platform in the country, that this effort is now being made. I do not intend to debate this matter today. If there be one question that is already threadbare, it is that of the postal vote. There was not one speech made in this House during the lengthy debate on the larger measure in which the question was not discussed and re-discussed. not think any member in the House can throw any new light upon the subject or break any new ground.",17

InCommittee: Clause 1This Act may be cited as the Postal Voting Restoration Act 1913.",18
82,Mr HIGGS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Capricornia) [4.7] - I think we might get a more appropriate title for the Bill if we had a little time to consider it. There are two main objections, of course, to the postal voting principle, and the first and most important is the possibility of doing away with the secrecy of the ballot.",19
83,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The honourable member will notice that the clause deals with the short title of the Bill.,19
84,Mr HIGGS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I should like the Bill to have a proper name, but 7 had not had' time to compose one. However, the At torney-General may consent to recommit the clause.",19
85,Mr FENTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Shal l I be in order in moving that the title of the Bill be altered from the "" Postal Voting Restoration Act 1913"" to the "" Commonwealth Electoral Act Amendment Act 1913 ""?' AYES.",19
86,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I do not see anything out of order in such an amendment. Mr W. H . IBVINE - I understand that the honourable member for Maribyrnong is asking a question on a point of order, and I submit that what he seeks cannot be done. What can be done is that, if an amendment is carried in some portion of the Bill which involves a change in the title, then the title may be subsequently amended.",19
87,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"In an ordinary sense, the Attorney-General is correct in saying that all we can do is, in the event of amendments being made in the clauses, to change the title in order to bring it NOES. into consonance with the amendments made. But we must not merely take what is on the face of the Bill as covering the scope of the Bill, because it goes much further. The Bill provides that certain postal votes are to be restored; but it goes further, and gives power to the Government to make certain regulations, and contains a number of clauses which are covered under the principal Act. I maintain that the honourable member for Maribyrnong is quite in order, if he so desires, in discussing all those provisions in the principal Act which this particular clause Tellers: seeks to re-enact.",19
88,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The honourable member for Maribyrnong desires to pro-pose an amendment in the short title of the Bill ; and, so long as that amendment is in harmony with the general purport of the Bill, I cannot see that it is out of order. In my opinion, the amendment would be quite in harmony with the purport of the Bill, and I rule it in order.",19
89,Mr FENTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Maribyrnong) [4.12] I move That the words "" Postal Voting Restoration"" be left out, with a view to. insert in lieu thereof the words "" Electoral Amendment."" I complain, as of course one must, that we; in a free Parliament, are denied free discussion on a very important amendment of the Electoral Act.",19
90,Mr BOYD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Is the honourable member in order when he says that'we are in a freeParliament, and are denied free discussion ?",19
91,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,-The remark is not in order; but I was waiting for the honourable member to lead up to the subject matter of his amendment.,20
92,Mr FENTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I desire to express, as dispassionately as possible, my feeling in regard to this proposal. A measure of this kind requires the very closest attention, because on our Electoral Act depends whether we obtain a true reflex of the opinions of the people. If the community are allowed every possible facility to exercise the franchise without let or hindrance from others who may or may not possess influence over them, the more likely we shall be to have a Parliament in consonance with the feelings and aspirations of the people.",20
93,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Order ! The honourable member's remarks are wide of the question.,20
94,Mr FENTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I am giving my reasons for my amendment, which will have the effect of widening the scope of the Bill. Mr W . H . IBVINE - That is just where the honourable member makes a mistake; the amendment does not widen the scope of the Bill by one iota. That might be done by amending the title of the Bill , but we are - not now dealing with the title.",20
95,Mr FENTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I admit that we shall have to deal with the full title later on. Mr W . H . IBVINE - What the honourable member is moving is'merely what he thinks would be a better short description of the real title .,20
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Hav e honourable members ever known the short title to be discussed in this way before?,20
97,Mr FENTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I am afraid that honourable members do not exactly grasp the purport of my amendment; and I hope that the Government will afford opportunity for discussing the question as full y as possible. If there is anything of importance to the country it is the franchise, and facilities for exercising the franchise.",20
98,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,That has nothing to do with the short title.,20
99,Mr FENTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"It is difficult; but I have endeavoured to keep as closely as I could to the clause. Mr W . H . IRVINE (Flinders-Attor ney-General) [4.18] - The object which I have no doubt the honourable member for Maribyrnong desired to attain, namely, the widening of the scope for amendments in the measure, will not be attained by the proposal before us. The effect of the amendment is not to alter the title at all , 7 but merely to alter the short title of the Bill , which is a short description in the body of the Bill of what the real title is. The real title remains unaltered; and, therefore, nothing is gained by the honourable member, either in the way of widening the discussion or the power of amendment.",20
100,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"West Sydney) [4.19]. - No objection can lie to the proposal of the honourable member for Maribyrnong. An objection to an alteration of the title might lie in the nature of so restricting debate as to prevent giving effect to the order of leave itself. The order of leave is to restore the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902-9 with respect to voting by post. Therefore, this is an amendment of the Electoral Act and is - an Electoral Act Amendment Bill. While the amendment does not seem relatively important, I see no reason why it should not be agreed to, and I see no practical disadvantage that will follow, so far as debate is concerned, but I submit that where discussion is limited there should be very good reasons why an amendment of this sort should not be allowed. The title is inserted for a special purpose, which is quite apart from the matter-it is merely a placard-and the honourable member for Maribyrnong very properly takes exception to that, and seeks to have the title of the Bill changed to "" a n amendment of the electoral l a w . "" This really is a mere amendment Bill , like dozens of measures which have been in troduced relative to the electoral law, and they have all been introduced under the generic term "" to amend the electoral l a w . "" This is the first time in our history on which an attempt has been made to introduce a similar Bill other than under that designation. The reason for the change in the title is wholly unconnected with the thing itself, but has a party complexion that is so obvious that nothing is necessary to emphasize it . The amendment may be agreed to, and then we may discuss this measure for what it really is-a n amendment of the electoral law.",20
101,Mr HIGGS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Capricornia) [4.24] - I always have much pleasure in accepting the advice of the Attorney-General when I think it ought to be followed, but, in the present circumstances, I do not think the honourable gentleman is assisting the Committee. From his long experience at the Bar, and in a State House, he should be able to assist us, but, so far, he has not helped us much. Now he says ' ' Pass this clause as it is, and when you come to the title you can alter it . "" But we can only do so by a certain process. The Standing Orders say that a decision in Committee cannot be reversed in the same Committee.",20
102,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,That matter has not arisen. I have ruled that the amendment is in order.,21
103,Mr HIGGS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I am surprised at the Attorney-General trying to side-track the Committee. He should be satisfied with getting the second reading through so expeditiously, without tryin g to get thia clause through by a subterfuge.",21
104,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Order ! The question is the short title of the Bill .,21
105,Mr HIGGS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"If we pass this clause the honourable member for Maribyrnong has no possible chance of getting his amendment agreed to unless the Bill is recommitted. The very remarks of the Attorney-General show how necessary it is to have full and free discussion, and I hope I may be permitted to make a few remarks about the title with which it is proposed to christen this Bill . I object to the title suggested by the honourable member f o i Maribyrnong. The honourable member must be aware that there is already a B i l i on the notice-paper that will need the title of "" Electoral Act of 1913."" I would call this "" a Bill to permit the manipulation of postal ballot papers.""",21
106,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Order ! The honourable member must not be frivolous. I cannot entertain any such suggestion, and the honourable member is quite out - of order in making it .",21
107,Mr HIGGS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I am sorry if you think that I have offended against the ordinary rules of debate by describing this as "" a Bill to permit the manipulation of post a l ballot-papers.""",21
108,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Order !,21
109,Mr HIGGS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Do you rule that "" m a n i p u l at i o n "" is not parliamentary?",21
110,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,U n d o u b t e d l y ; in the circumstances it is not parliamentary.,21
111,Mr HIGGS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"There may be honest manipulation and dishonest manipulation. Standing by itself, the word is as innocent as a babe-as innocent as the At torney-General looks, but is not.",21
112,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Order !,21
113,Mr HIGGS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I often contemplate the face of the honourable gentleman when it is in repose, as it mostly is.",21
114,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Order ! . Mr HIGGS - The Bill should be given a proper name. I do not wish to come into conflict with the Chair. I have great, sympathy for the Chair, because, no doubt, it must be very tryin g",21
115,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Order! The question is the short title of the Bill .,21
116,Mr HIGGS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I was coming to that. We should give the Bill a proper name, and I - shall give some reasons why we should give it a name which is not a mere colourless thing such as that suggested by the honourable member for Maribyrnong, which does not convey the idea at all . What we should do with this measure is to indicate to the general public, as far as its name will permit us to do so, what is the political game of the Attorney General.",21
117,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The honourable member must not refer to anybody's "" political game.""",21
118,Mr HIGGS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I withdraw the words "" p o l it i c a l game,"" and I shall substitute something else. The Bill should carry on its face",21
119,Mr RILEY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,It s face value.,21
120,Mr HIGGS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"That is a very good expression. The Bill should on its face describe what ' it means to the Attorney General and his party, and I submit we can show that best by giving it its proper name. I give notice of a further amendment, "" That the Bill be called ' a j Bill to enable the Attorney-General and his colleagues of the Liberal Association to manipulate postal ballot-papers.' """,21
121,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Order ! The honourable member must know that he is deliberately breaking the Standing Orders when he repeats an offence for which he has already been called to order.,21
122,Mr HIGGS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"If that is your view, Mr Chairman, I withdraw the remark. Amendment negatived.",21
123,Mr ANSTEY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Bourke) [4.35] - I move That after the word "" Restoration "" the words "" Sick and In v a l i d"" be inserted. I have no desire to occupy the time of the Committee, save to say that I am quite prepared to vote for a Bill to provide for postal voting for the sick and the invalid, but that I absolutely object to people who are quite capable of walking to a polling place being allowed to vote by post. If my amendment be carried, the Bill will be so restricted as to provide for voting by post only for the sick and the invalid, and that is all the Government say they desire.",21
124,Mr FINLAYSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Brisbane) [4.36]. - I have been waiting to hear whether the Attorney-General is prepared to accept the amendment.,22
125,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"No ,",22
126,Mr FINLAYSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Then what be-, comes of the protestations of the Government that they merely desire to restore voting by post for the benefitof the sick and the invalid? Mr W . H . IRVINE - Thos e provisions are included in the Bill .",22
127,Mr FINLAYSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The Government have either been in earnest in their statement that they desire voting by post to be retained for the benefit of the sick and the invalid, or they have been throwing dust in the eyes of the people. shall support the amendment, although I am very strongly opposed to voting by post in ordinary, circumstances. think that such a system of postal voting has been promulgated as will give us a guarantee of freedom from corruption, but I am prepared to go a long way for the sake of the sick and the invalid.",22
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,What guarantee does the honourable member want?,22
129,Mr FINLAYSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,That this Bill will be what it pretends to be. The Government say that it is designed to enable the sick and the - invalid to vote.,22
130,Mr ATKINSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,They do not; they say it is a Bill to restore postal voting.,22
131,Mr FINLAYSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,F r o m a thousand platforms it has been declared over and over again that we have robbed sick people of the power to record their votes.,22
132,Mr BENNETT,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The postal voting system is for the benefit of country people everywhere.,22
133,Mr RILEY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Why should they have any privilege over city residents?,22
134,Mr FINLAYSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The party have been abused, in both their public and private capacities, as being opposed to the sick having power to vote. The Government have professed a particular care for the sick and the invalid, and have wept crocodile tears from every platform over the poor sick, who cannot go to the polls. They now appear to be ashamed of their own professions. I strongly support the suggestion made by the honourable member for Capricornia, and, if I were in order, I would suggest that this Bill seeks to encourage impure elections, and that it will lead to the corruption of the voting system.",22
135,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Order I,22
136,Mr FINLAYSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"E v e n when considering the short title to the Bill we cannot shut our eyes' to the object at which it aims, and I wonder how far the Government are prepared to go in the matter of providing postal voting facilities for the sick and the invalid. I submit that there are good reasons-reason s advanced by the Government themselves, and reiterated a thousand times by the Prime Minister himself-for making this Bill what it professes to be- a Bill to provide for voting by post on the part of only the sick and the invalid. What right has any other section of the community to special facilities for voting away from the polling booth? I Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Will the honourable member vote for the Bill if this amendment be carried ? I do not Mr FINLAYSON - Certainl y not. Does the Prime Minister think that I am such a fool that, because I secure one amendment, I am going to swallow every other provision of the Bill ? A suggestion of that kind, applied to any other Bill , would be repudiated by the honourable gentleman.",22
137,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The carrying of this amendment would not alter the principles of the Bill .,22
138,Mr FINLAYSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"No . I am prepared to consider, freely and full y , any suggestion to give the sick and the invalid power to vote; but I am utterly opposed to the provision of facilities for those jvho are not sick or invalided to record their votes away from the polling booth.",22
139,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The honourable member is now going beyond the subject matter of the clause.,22
140,Mr FINLAYSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I am anxious that this Bill shall be what it pretends to be. Labour In this Parliament, we set a standard, perhaps, for the people of the world. We have provided that goods manufactured in this country shall be true to name. We have officers in our Customs Houses, and all over the. country, whose duty it is, to try to guarantee to the public that the goods they buy will be true to the trade description or label on them.",22
141,Mr ATKINSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Is not this Bill true to its title?,23
142,Mr FINLAYSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"No . It is proposed to send out, so to speak, a piece of goods bearing a wrong label, a misleading title, or an untrue description. This is not a Bill to provide postal voting facilities for only the sick and the invalid; but if the Prime Minister will give me his assurance now that. it will be made to apply only to that section of the community, he will remove much of my objection to it.",23
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The honourable member is in favour, not of this Bill, but of some other Bill?",23
144,Mr FINLAYSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I am in favour of some other Bill, believing that the electoral law needs to be amended. I ask that we shall be honest, truthful, and fair about this matter. The honourable member for Bourke proposes to give to the Bill a designation that will meet the views of every honourable member. There is a certain proportion of the people of the Commonwealth-to o large a proportion, in my opinion:-who , by reason of sickness or invalidity, are unable to go to the polls and record their votes; and, for their sakes, we ought to make some extra and very special provision. This Bill, however, does not propose to do that, and it is because I believe that it should do so that I support the amendment.",23
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [4.44] - I should like to know exactly where my honourable friends opposite stand in this matter. If there is a bond fide and fairly unanimous effort on their side to remodel the Bill, I should like to know to what extent it exists.",23
146,Mr HIGGS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Then , why did the honourable member "" g a g "" us? If he had not done so, we should have told him.",23
147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"This is the stage at which to discuss the details of the Bill. My honourable friend who haa just resumed his seat, as well as the mover of the amendment, say that they wish to limit voting by post to the sick and the infirm. I understood that the sick and infirm are the very people whom they alleged - the ex-Attorney-General, perhaps, more than any other-ar e subject to cajolery and bribery; that they are the people who, according to honourable members opposite, are bought with money.",23
148,Mr BURNS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Who ever said that?,23
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The .ex-Attorney-General. It is these very peoplethe sick and the infirm-wh o are unable to vote, who, we are told, are subject to cajolery., I am repeating the words used by the honourable member for West Sydney.",23
150,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Where are they?,23
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"They are the people who are supposed to be subject to the influence of money. The main argument of those who are supporting this amendment has been that the sick in various institutions, who are unable to help themselves-the sick and infirm in every way-ar e subject to sinister influences.",23
152,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I think that the Prime Minister is now going beyond the subject-matter of the-clause.,23
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Ver y well, sir, I shall say no more.",23
154,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"West Sydney) [4.47]. - I hope, Mr Chairman, that since some time elapsed before you ruled that the Prime Minister was out of order, I may be allowed to say a word or two in answer to what he has said in reference to myself. The honourable gentleman has thought fit' to make a statement in regard to myself which is quite inaccurate and irrelevant, and which ought not to have been allowed. I take this opportunity of stating that what he said in regard to me is not warranted by the facts. Leaving the honourable gentleman alone, because to fight with him on equal terms is impossible, since, directly any one is able to say anything to which he takes exception, he will move that the question be now put, I wish to say, on behalf of myself and every one on this side, that he shall not put us in the position in which he desires, and which he has no right to do. He shall not hold us up to the country as being opposed to voting by post on the part of the sick and the invalid. We are not, and never have been.",23
155,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Then why did the late Government repeal the postal voting provisions of the Electoral Act?,23
156,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"We are not, and never have been, opposed to postal voting on the part of the sick and the invalid, but we are opposed to the abuse of the principle. It is to that point to which we have directed, and must direct,' our attention; and it is. because of this measure - being so framed as to prevent any legitimate amendment of the iron-clad provisions of the law of 1909 that we are opposed to it .",23
157,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I have allowed the honourable memher, I think, reasonable latitude.",24
158,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"V e r y well, sir, I shall say no more about that matter. have made our position clear. amendment proposes to l i m it the scope of the Bill so that it will provide f o voting for the sick and the invalid, and I believe that w i ll meet every legitimate requirement in this connection. If it be agreed to, consequential amendments must be made in the Bill . I shall be glad to learn upon what ground the amendment is opposed by the Government. This is a Bill which proposes to amend the existing law in this particular alone. leaves the law in respect to absent voting as it is. Under the law of 1909, voting by post extended to persons other than those who were sick. Under sub-section a, section 109Any elector who has reason to believe that he will not, during the hours of polling on polling day, be within 5 miles of the polling place for the division in which he is enrolled That was a pertinent and useful sub-section when, and only when, there was 110 provisions such as now exist for recording absent votes. I ask the Attorney General to agree to the proposal, in order that the measure may be brought into harmony with the law, as it will appear wlien it was amended. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Bette r move it on the next clause, where we can discuss it . We cannot discuss it on the short title.",24
159,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The Attoruey-General took exception to the amendment of the short title when it extended the scope of the Bill , and takes exception to it now when it restricts the scope of the Bill . He wants the short title as a placard. What possible exception can he take to the proposal ? If he takes exception to it , he takes exception to a proposal that it ehall extend only to the invalid and sick, when, as a matter of fact, under the existing law, and as the law will be if this measure is incorporated in the present law, an absent voter will be able to vote at any booth throughout the Commonwealth. What additional facilities does he want under sub-section a? I hope that the honourable member will see that, restricted as we are by the scope of this measure, such an amendment is legitimate and proper. If he intends that the postal vote should extend to persons other than the sick and invalid, let him say so, so that we and the country w i ll know exactly what the Government propose; but we were certainly under the impression that the gravamen of the charge against this I party was that they had taken from the The sick women, the mothers of this country, opportunities for voting. That is not r postal true. We are perfectly willing that they should vote; but we are not willing that the measure should be used as a cover for other things. Mr W . H . IRVINE (Flinders-At torney-General) [4.55] - I have never known the short title of a Bill to be debated before. Its purpose is merely to It state concisely what the real title of the Bill is.",24
160,Mr FENTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Would not the amendment of the short title be a direction to amend the full title accordingly when we come to it? Mr W . H . IRVINE - The short title cannot be taken as any direction. The proper place, if any, for substantive amendments, is clause 2. It will be quite open, on that clause, for honourable members to move any amendment of any section contained in the voting by post provisions in the Electoral Acts of 1902 to 1909. If honourable members can formulate a scheme for enabling, not merely in firm and sick people, but old people, and people who are far removed from any polling booth to vote-and now is the time to do it - it shall have full consideration by the Government. I invite them to do it ; but they cannot do it on this clause.",24
161,Mr WEBSTER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Will the Government allow discussion? Mr W . H . IRVINE - We shall allow discussion on any bond fide attempt to bring forward a better scheme, or improvement in the existing scheme of voting by post. We shall not deprive the Committee of a fair opportunity of discussion.",24
162,Mr MATHEWS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Who is to be the judge of a fair opportunity? Mr W . H . IRVINE - We shall be the judge, but if honourable members bring forward something entirely inconsistent with the general voting by post scheme, we shall not - be prepared to give undue time for discussing such proposals. I w a n t ' to test the bona fides of members like the honourable member for Brisbane. they really desire to help us, and [these people to get an opportunity to exercise the franchise, we shall their proposals, and they shall have the fullest opportunity of putting them forward.",24
163,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The short title is intended only for noting purposes. There seems to be an idea amongst certain honthere orable members that by altering the short title they can, in some way, alter measure. Such is not the case.",25
164,Mr ROBERTS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Adelaide) [4.57] Your remarks, sir, almost make me ask, "" What is in a name?"" In this case there the happens to be plenty in a name, because the short title was carefully thought out by the Government after their defeat last week. They have evidently submitted is essential. this scheme in the belief that they will thereby impress the public that they are giving eifect to their platform pledges, and restoring to some persons the vote amendment of this clause. that they allege was taken away from them. The measure will be cited short title, and honourable members are, therefore, justified in taking exception it. At the same time, we ask that bona fides of the Government side of the House may be more clearly shown the short title . to the public. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Why not test question on the next clause, where we can deal with it?",25
165,Mr ROBERTS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"That is a new sugshall gestion. A very much better method are. would have been to allow members to express in general terms their opinions on the second reading. We should then have been able to arrive at a satisfactory, agreement as to what ought to be in the Bill , but the attitude of the Government valid. has prevented that discussion, which is essential upon a matter of such i m portance. The blood be therefore on their own heads. They must take consequences. The Bill is exceptionally complicated, although only one specific by post. clause is brought in , in order, apparently, to prevent discussion and criticism and successful amendment as far as possible, even in the direction in which the Governday ment allege that they are prepared to polling place. consider amendments. who attempts to amend this clause will find himself in difficulties at once. Amendments will have to be framed exceptional care to fit in with the various Acts. If there is any reality If suggestion of the Attorney-General thati help we should suggest amendments Mr W . H . IRVINE - Y o u have had theconsider Bill since Priday.",25

185,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"We have to recollect that there have been three periods or stages in the Speakership in British parliamentary government. period in the House of Commons was when the Speaker represented the Crown, and sawthat nothing interfered with the Crown's prerogative; the second period was when he became head of the House, and framed all the motions that were moved; and the third period was wheni t was decided that the Speaker should be a non-partisan, and taken completely away from the realm of party politics. This latter step was taken some considerable time ago, with the object of making the Speaker a person who should hold the balance between all parties, and providing that he should on no account be dragged into party politics. sponsible government was given to New South Wales in 1852, the Constitution Act of that State provided, in section 23",27

189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I say yes.,27

192,Mr WATKINS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,It has never been given in Committee before.,27

194,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I wish those conSection 40 stitutional authorities opposite would permit me to get a word in ; but they are all charged to the lips with constitutional - lore. I submit that there is The no standing order which permits the honourable member for Kennedy to raise this question now, but that the only time is in the at which Mr Speaker's vote or action of any kind can be challenged is in the House when Mr Speaker is in the chair. Mr Speaker is now sitting as a member of this Committee, and he is entitled to The first do anything that any other honourable member may do. I , therefore, submit that the honourable member for Kennedy cannot proceed unless he canshow that, under some standing order, he has the right to do so.",27
195,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The position is a very simple one. The honourable member for Kennedy has challenged the vote of the honourable member for Lang, and he is quite right in doing so, because any member has the right to challenge a vote which he thinks has been taken irregularly in Committee. The honourable member for Lang is a member of this ComWhen re- mittee, and as I know of no Mr Speaker in Committee, I can take no notice of the point of order.",27
196,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I am sorry that I was interrupted, because it necessitates my going over the ground again. I do not desire to see any heat raised, and I have tried to discuss this question without any. As I was saying, when the Constitution was granted to New South Wales the following words were expressly in serted : know of no The presence of at least twenty members of the Legislative Assembly, exclusive of the Speaker, shall be necessary to constitute a meeting of the said Legislative Assembly for the despatch of business, and all questions (except as herein excepted) which shall arise in the said Assembly shall be decided by the majority of votes of such members as shall be present, other than the Speaker; and when the votes shall be equal the Speaker shall have a casting vote. And we find that there is a similar proMr vision in the Queensland Constitution in these wordsthe honor- The presence of at least sixteen members of the Legislative Assembly, exclusive of the Speaker, shall be necessary to constitute a ing of the said Legislative Assembly for the despatch of business, and all questions (except as by law is excepted) which shall arise in the said Assembly shall be decided by the majority of votes of such members as shall be present, other than the Speaker; and when the votes shall be equal the Speaker shall have a casting vote. Here we have a clear intimation that, lowing the English practice, the Speaker should not have a vote in the overseas Legislatures. In May, 10th edition, page 339, we are toldIn the House of Lords the Speaker's name taken first, and when the votes are even the question resolves in the negative. This shows that in the House of Lords the Speaker has only one vote, and not a casting vote.",27
197,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The procedure in that the House of Lords has nothing to do with us; we are guided by the procedure in the House of Commons.,28
198,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I must be allowed to put the case in my own way. In the same edition of May, page 340, we are toldIn case of an equality of voices, the contents have it, and the question is declared to have been resolved in the negative. On page 344 we are toldI f the numbers in a division are equal, the wasSpeaker (and in Committee the Chairman, see page 361) who otherwise never votesI desire honourable members to bear in other mind that in the House of Commons the votes practice is that the Speaker never votesmust give the casting voice. In the performance of this duty, he is at liberty to vote other member, according to his conscience, without assigning a reason; but, in order to the least imputation upon his impartiality, it is usual for him, when practicable, to vote in such a manner as not to make the decision of the House final, and to explain his reasons, which are entered on the journal. This shows us the reason why, when Constitutions were granted to the Dominions, it was decided that the Speaker should not have a vote other than a casting vote. But there is another important consideration. TJnder the United States Constitution the position is quite different. That Constitution, in section 5, sub-section 2, saysEach House may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behaviour, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member. As I have intimated, the United States Constitution differs widely from ours, because it gives the House power to make [105] meet- such regulations for the conduct of business as it thinks proper.",28
199,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,So does section 50 of our Constitution.,28
200,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I shall deal with that presently. If we look at the Standing Orders of the United States House of folRepresentatives, as shown in the House Manual Digest, we find it laid down that the Speaker shall not be required to vote in ordinary legislative proceedings, except where his vote would be decisive, or is wlien the House is engaged in voting by ballot; and that in all cases of a "" tie "" vote, the question shall be lost. Here, again, we see, even in the United States, where they have full power to frame their own Standing Orders, it is not desired that Mr . Speaker shall have a vote; and that, while he is permitted to have a vote, in all cases where there is a "" tie "" the question is lost. Again, to show how the question may be further dealt with, let us look for a moment at what took place at the time our Constitution was being framed. The nonFederal Convention held in Sydney in 1897 discussed proposed clause 39, now section 40, of the Constitution. The clause, as it was before that Convention,' Questions arising in the House of Representatives shall be determined by a majority of votes than that of the Speaker; and when the are equal, the Speaker shall have a casting vote, but otherwise he shall not vote. The Chairman of the Convention anlike any nounced that there was an amendment avoid suggested to the clause as follows: After the word "" shall,"" in the third line of the clause, it is proposed by the Parliament of Victoria to insert the words "" except as hereinafter provided,"" and to add at the end of the clause the words "" provided that in case of a proposed amendment of the Constitution the Speaker may vote, notwithstanding the votes are not equal, and in such case he shall not have a casting vote."" There was a clear indication from the Parliament of Victoria, when they passed that amendment and sent it on to the Convention, that they were under the impression that the Speaker would not have a vote; and that they desired that he should have a primary vote. Mr W. H. IRVINE - That is in the House; but the Speaker in Victoria frequently votes in Committee.",28
201,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I shall come to that point.,28
202,Mr ATKINSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I rise to a point of order. The point that the honourable member for Kennedy has raised concerns the right of the honourable member for Lang to vote in this Committee. I submit that the honourable member is not in order in bringing up a lot of authorities that in no way touch the question of voting in Committee. I submit that he is not in order in taking up the time of the Committee in this way.,29
203,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"When I consider the honourable member out of order, I shall so rule.",29
204,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"An honourable gentleman, who afterwards sat in this Chamber, and who is now on the High Court Bench-Justic e Isaacs-brough t the matter before the Convention. As reported on page 461 of the Official Record of the Debates of the Australasian Convention, second session, held in Sydney in 1897, he saidThe object for which this amendment was introduced was that, while preserving under ordinary circumstances the very salutary rule that Mr Speaker should observe an impartial attitude in the House of 'Representatives, yet, when such an extraordinary occasion arose as a proposed amendment of the Constitution, his State should not be deprived, in case of necessity, of his - vote, but that he sbould not have a casting vote. They were prepared to give him a vote, but not a casting vote.",29
205,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,That House.,29
206,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I am talking about what took place at the Convention, and not in Victoria. Mr Isaacs went on to sayIt is not only possible, but it has actually occurred in the Victorian Assembly, that a proposed amendment of the Constitution that was considered by one Chamber, at all events, to require an absolute majority, did not have that absolute majority by one vote. If Mr Speaker had been allowed to vote in that case the vote would have been given. It seems a hard case that the State for which Mr Speaker is returned should be deprived of his vote when the clause of the Constitution provides that an amendment of the Constitution cannot be carried unless it bas an absolute majority of the Senate, and an absolute majority of the House of Representatives. Then Mr now Justice, Barton, repliedThe argument for this which my honourable learned friend puts is that the State is be disfranchised. I do not know that it really means that the State is disfranchised. Speaker represents an electorate in the National Assembly in the same way as the Speaker this Legislative Assembly represents an electorate in the - representative and popular ber. If there is a question of the amendment of the Constitution here or in the Lower House of any one of the Parliaments of the Colonies, the Speaker is not entitled to any other vote than a casting vote. A similar opinion is practically given by Mr now Justice, Higgins, in the same Convention. The point I make is that, the moment the Speaker comes on the floor of the chamber and takes part in Committee proceedings, his conduct is open to the vilest discussion that may take place. It is inevitable. The Speaker immediately associates himself with all forms of party feeling.",29
207,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,It all depends on what kind of Opposition there is.,29
208,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The Speaker allows himself to be discussed freely and openly on any vote that may be cast. It is idle to say that, because he does not speak, and merely votes, his vote cannot be criticised, as that of any other individual may be.",29
209,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Did any one attack you when you did it?,29
210,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I shall come to that later. In those cases in which it has been done elsewhere, they will be found to be entirely different from our position; because it is clearly laid down in black and white, in section 40 of our Constitution, thatQuestions arising in the House of Represenis in the tatives shall be determined by a majority of votes other than that of the Speaker. The Speaker shall not vote unless the numbers are equal, and then he shall have a casting vote.",29
211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Nobod y disputes that.,29
212,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"If so, the matter may take another course. I do not know whether we are the sole judges in this matter.",29
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,More threats?,29
214,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"- I may be wrong - probabl y the Attorney-General may correct me; I do not profess to be a lawyerbut I say that if a matter is clearly defined in the Constitution, there is a higher authority even than Parliament to interpret that provision.",29
215,Mr BOYD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Surely there can be no higher authority than ourselves as to what and we do? The High Court interprets the not to provision of the Acts we pass, but not . The our procedure.",29
216,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I think the High in Court has more to do than merely interChampret the Acts we pass. It has to interpret the Constitution under which we work, and the very moment we do anything unconstitutional, it is open, I believe, to any citizen to ""take action to bring the matter before the High Court. I do not altogether approve of that. My opinion is that the House should be the highest authority and tribuna l in the land, and that no High Court should have the right to undo anything we have done here; but, unfortunately, that is not the position. I have been asked whether I have recorded my vote in Committee when Speaker. I did so on one occasion, and my vote was never challenged. The present Speaker also recorded his vote in Committee the other day, and it was not challenged. It was only afterwards that some began to consider whether it was right for him to do so; and I may have gone on doing it because I did not know that I was doing anything wrong at the time ; but I have now come to the conclusion that it is not the correct thing for the Speaker to do so, because the Constitution clearly and definitely lays it down, in section 40, that the Speaker shall have no other than a casting vote.",29
217,Mr CONROY,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,What about our standing order No. 1 ?,30
218,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"In regard to that point, the Speaker of the House of Commons does not record his vote in the House. There is no standing order in the House of Commons that permits him to do so.",30
219,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,We are not in the House now.,30
220,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,That is the point honourable members are now making in saying that we are not now in the House. The Constitution does not provide for anything but what takes place in the House. It only deals with the Speaker in the House. The Constitution knows nothing of any Committee.,30
221,Sir ROBERT REST,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Hear , hear!",30
222,Mr WATKINS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"It is included in the word "" House.""",30
223,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I maintain that the greater absorbs the lesser in this case. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Does that apply to all the Committees of the House?,30
224,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,It applies to this Committee. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Does it apply to the Standing Orders Committee or the House Committee?,30
225,Mr WEBSTER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,What question to ask. [105]- 2,30
226,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The Standing Orders Committee, the House Committee, and even a Select Committee are quite apart from anything done here. If the honourable member votes in Committee of the House on something which is illegal, it will necessitate the passage of an Act of Parliament to remedy it , but any action that may be taken in the House Committee, or in the Standing Orders Committee, will not occasion the enactment of a new Statute.",30
227,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The House has to confirm everything dealt with in any Committee.,30
228,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"No matter whatJ the Standing Orders Committee or any other such Committee may do, it is not worth anything u n t il the House has decided on it . When a matter comes forward in the House from an outside body altogether, what is the result? Does any one know the Standing Orders Committee? No. The gentleman in charge may' be the Attorney-General, the Prime Minister, or whoever brings in the matter.",30
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Neithe r does the House know this Committee.,30
230,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,This Committee is part and parcel of the House. It is of no use the honourable member quibbling and trying to get out of it in that way.,30
231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The quibbling is over on your side.,30
232,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The honourable member knows that I am the last to quibble. If I was as good at quibbling as the honourable member is, I would fight with any man in Australia for the championship. I do not wish to labour the question.",30
233,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,You cannot labour it much longer; your half-hour has expired.,30
234,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I raise this question because I believe that, under the Constitution, the Speaker has no right to record his vote in Committee, and I trust that the decision of the Committee, whatever it is, will be in accordance With the Constitution.",30
235,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I have come to a decision in the matter. Mr W . ELLIOTJOHNS ON (Lang) [5.51] - Before you state your decision, Mr Chairman, as I am personally in volved, I should like to address myself a ridiculous briefly to this question. I think that the honourable member for Kennedy has but exercised his right as a member of this House in challenging my action in respect to exercising my right to vote in Committee; but the grounds upon which he relies cannot be supported, so far as I am aware, by any authority, or by any evidence of parliamentary procedure that we have. By way of illustration, I would ask the honourable member whether he would deny the right of a member who occupied the position of Speaker of the House to take part in a discussion or to vote on his own Estimates in Committee?",30
236,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Yes . Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Unles s the honourable member is prepared to do so, all his arguments must fall to the ground; but I have never known such a right to be denied before. I think we may well set aside the United States of America authorities quoted, as well as others which have no binding authority on our procedure, and come at once to the point. There is no standing order of our own which precludes the Speaker from speaking and voting in Committee. Speaker of the House cannot, in Committee, exercise his vote as a private member representing a constituency, then it naturally follows that the Chairman of Committees cannot record his vote in the House as a private member on account of his position as. Chairman of Committees, which is analogous to that of Speaker in the House, as the Presiding Officer over the proceedings. Yet the Chairman of Committees has frequently done so without his right being questioned. We have a special standing order giving only a casting vote to the Speaker in the House, and a casting vote only to the Chairman in Committee. If the argument applies in the one case, it must apply equally in the other. And if the contention of the honourable member for Kennedy were valid, the Chairman could not give a vote as a private member in the House itself. But I do not know of. an instance in which a vote given in the House by the honourable member for Perth, who is Chairman of Committees, has been challenged. Our Standing Orders provide that in the case of an equality of votes in the House the Speaker shall have a casting vote; and that in the case of an equality of votes in Committee the Chairman shall have a casting vote; but that the Chairman shall not have a vote other than a casting vote in Committee, any more than the Speaker can have a vote other than a casting vote in the House. The point is that, when the vote in question was taken, we were in a Committee of the whole, and not in the House; and, therefore, I exercised my clear right to vote, not as Speaker, but as the member for Lang. As the member for Lang, I can no more be deprived of my right to vote in Committee than can any other honourable member. I vote in Committee, on ordinary business, not as Speaker, but in my capacity as the member for Lang. I am rather surprised that an honourable member with the honourable member for Kennedy's experience should have raised a point of this kind. Section 40 of the Constitution provides thatQuestions arising in the House of Representatives shall be determined by a majority of votes other than that of the Speaker. The Speaker shall not vote unless the numbers are equal, and then he shall have a casting vote. That is the practice I have followed in If the the House. But the House has resolved itself into Committee, and I have voted in Committee as the member for Lang, and, as honourable members are well aware, the Speaker, in Committee, does not take the Chair, and consequently cannot by any possibility give a casting vote in Committee. Our Standing Orders recognise the distinction between the House and the Committee of the whole by providing for the Speaker's chair being vacated, and a Chairman to preside and report from time to time to the House. The House would not report to itself. The honourable member for Kennedy has quoted a number of authorities from May; but the particular authority that really does bear upon this question has not been quoted by him. His authorities have dealt with the Speaker's vote, not in Committee, but in the Hjouse. He will find the matter set out at page 368 of the l l t h edition of May, where the position of the Speaker when speaking in Committee is dealt with. I am surprised that the honourable member has, with all his experience, overlooked it . May saysBut while in the Chair the Speaker is thus restrained That is the Chair of the Houseby usage, in the exercise of his independent judgment, in a Committee of the whole House he is entitled to speak and vote like any other member. Ib will thus be seen that, in the House Commons' practice, there is a distinction drawn between the House and the ComMatters) Bill. mittee. Then May goes on to sayAmong the earliest examples are those of case. Mr Speaker Glanville, on the 4th May, 1640, upon the granting of twelve subsidies to the King ; and of Mr Speaker Lenthall, on the 22nd January, 1641, against the "" brotherly g to the Scottish nation. Sir Fletcher spoke strongly on the influence of the 6th April, 1780; and Mr Speaker Grenville on the Regency question, on the 16th January, On 17th December, 1790, Mr Speaker argued a at length the auestion of the abatement of an that impeachment, by a dissolution of Parliament, and cited a long list of precedents. On the 4th that December, 1797, Mr Speaker Addington dressed the Committee on the assessed taxes, from the gallery. The same Speaker also addressed a Committee on the union with Ireland in I799> and ' again, 6th May; 1800, spoke in the Committee upon Inclosure Bill . In Committee, on the charges against the Duke of York, 16th February, 1809, Mr Speaker Abbot moved the commitment Captain Sandon, a witness, for prevarication. Again, on the ist June, 1809, he made a speech in Committee on Mr Curwen's Bill for preventing the sale of seats in Parliament; and on 4th February, 1811, in Committee, on the Lords' resolution for a Commission for giving Royal assent to the Regency Bill. Finally, addressed a Committee on the Roman Catholic Relief Bill, in 1813, and carried an amendment excluding Catholics from Parliament, which caused the abandonment of the Bill . . lastly, on the 9th June, 1870, Mr Speaker Denison spoke, and voted, in Committee, on the Customs and Inland Revenue Bill , in of a clause exempting horses kept for husbandry Statute. from licence duty if used in drawing materials for the repair of roads. If the Speaker has a right to move a motion and to speak in Committee, i cessarily follows that he does so, not Speaker, but, as I have said, as a prideclares thatvate member, and that that right obviously carries with it the right also vote. If , as the honourable member for words. Kennedy contends, the "" Committee"" I and the "" House "" are synonymous terms, and there is no! distinction recognised, why cannot Bills be read and passed Committee; and why does the Committee have to report to the House? would be no sense or meaning in the House reporting to itself. Why, also, cannot disorder in Committee be censured by the Committee? Why has it to be reported to the House, if the House and the mittee are recognised as the same thing. That there was a very wide distinction was recognised by the honourable member for Kennedy himself when, on the are made. 6th December last, he voted in a division of in Committee on an amendment moved in the Constitution Alteration (Industrial Mr W. H . IBVINE - Her e is another Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Yes ; there is another case, too; but I think it if t "" sufficient, to support the stand I take, to Norton quote only one instance in which the honCrown on orable member voted in Committee. 1789. That, alone, is sufficient to establish permanent precedent. I think I have' sufficiently demonstrated I have been acting well withadin my rights, not as Speaker, but as the member for Lang, in taking part in these proceedings in Committee, and if any precedent were required, which I do not the for a moment admit, the honourable member for Kennedy himself established that of precedent, which consequently becomes the accepted practice of the House.",31
237,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"West Sydney) [6.0]. - The honourable member for Kennedy has challenged the vote cast by the honour the able member for Lang, upon grounds he which he declares to be good as set forth by the Constitution. I wish to emphasize the fact that this is a Parliament . . And created by the Constitution-create d by Statute-and that its powers, privileges, support and rights depend wholly upon that It is a Statute passed by the British Parliament, and has to be interpreted just as every other Statute is. Every one of its sections must be given its t neful l meaning, as provided by the Acts as Interpretation Act, section 12 of which Every section of an Act shall have effect as a to substantive enactment without introductory ask honourable - members to con1 sider for a moment what was the practice when the Constitution was brought into in force, since it is necessary that they should do so in order to realise what secThere tion 40 of the Constitution really means. The Standing Orders are wholly ineffective as an authority in this case.",32
238,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"They are not, because they are framed in the terms of Comsection 50 of the Constitution.",32
239,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"But the Standing Orders, like regulations, may not be inconsistent with the Act under which they",32
240,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Certainl y not.,32
241,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Then the whole point turns, not on what our Standing Orders permit, but upon the meaning of section 40 of the Constitution. In construing the terms of an Act , certain rules of interpretation are accepted by all Courts, and the main one is that the ordinary plain construction of a section is to be taken unless there appears some good reason to the contrary. Section 40 is very clear. It provides thatQuestions arising in the House of Representatives shall be determined by a majority of votes other than that of the Speaker. Speaker shall nol \ote unless the numbers are equal, and then he shall have a casting vote. Those words are clear and The only uncertainty arising, if it arises at all, is in regard to the meaning of the word "" House,"" and as to what were the rights of the Speaker at the time this Statute was passed. I shall deal with the last point first. We have to assume, since it is one of the principles under the rules of interpretation, Legislature knew the circumstances which the Statute referred, and knew what Were the powers of a Speaker at that particular time. These powers are set forth at page 368 of the llth edition of May. Mr W . H . IBVINE - Does the honourable member know that this provision waa taken from the Canadian Act?",33
242,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"This is an Act of the British Parliament, and the British Parliament had before it the practice of centuries, modified as time went on, as to the rights, privileges, and duties of the Speaker at that time. Upon that point the whole question turns. The Speaker of the House of Commons in the House itself, at the time that the Act was passed, had a casting vote in the House, but he did not have an original vote. In Committee it was the practice of the Speaker to vote; but, as May shows at page 368, the practice had gradually fallen into desuetude, and that right was becoming less and less exercised as time went on. I do not deny that the Speaker of the House of Commons had that right then, and has it now. That was the state of the law - or the practice of the Commons at the time the Constitution Bill was passed. If section 40 of the Constitution is not to be taken as absolutely meaningless, it must refer to the powers then exercised by the Speaker. It must l i m it them, because, otherwise, it would be a perfectly meaningless thing for a Legislature to pass. The practice of the House of Commons was so well known to the House of Commons that it was perfectly absurd to suppose that they would introduce a mere declaratory clause. The Speaker had the right to a casting vote in the House, and an original vote in Committee. He rarely exercised that vote, and does so more rarely as years go on. The Convention, when discussing this matter, also knew exactly the position. Although the Act was passed by the British Parliament, it was, in effect, drafted by the Convention, and, The except technically, it is the work of the Convention. Section 40 was substituted for section 39, as shown on page 461 of unambiguous. the Convention debates, and reads' as follows: "" Questions arising in the House of Representhat tatives shall be determined by a majority. of votes other than that of the Speaker, and when the votes are equal the Speaker shall have a casting vote, but otherwise he shall not vote. accepted that the A proposal that, in case of a proposed to amendment of the Constitution, the Speaker might vote, notwithstanding that the votes were not equal, and that in such cases he should not have a casting vote, was rejected, and the effect of this, and the acceptance of section 40, was to l i m it the power of the Speaker to a casting vote only. This Parliament exercises the whole of its powers under that Statute. Without it it has none. Mr W. H. IBVINE - Sectio n 40 was taken from a section in identical terms in the Canadian Constitution, and Bourmot shows that the Speaker frequently voted in Committee under the Canadian Constitution.",33
243,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I do not care where the section was taken from ; I say it was applied to this Parliament, and was applied to it by the British Legislature. The Constitution of the Canadian House of Commons is entirely different from ours, and the application of that section there is not to be supposed to be identical with its application here. It is contended that the words "" House of Representatives,"" in section 40, affect the vote of the Speaker only when the House is not i u Committee; but let us look at the section and the Act generally to see what the ""House of Representatives"" means. Mr W . H . IBVINE - The section can apply only to conditions in which the Speaker can have a casting vote. Can he have a casting vote in Committee?",33
244,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The honourable memsection ber wants me to concede the whole point. the Speaker. If this does not apply to the Speaker in Committee, then, of course, the honourable member's position is established. sections 24, 34, 35, and 60, the words ' ' House of Representatives ' ' appear, and in every case they are used, not i distinction from Committee, but in disthat tinction from the Senate. They mean the House, whether sitting in Committee not. No one can deny that this question has arisen in the House of sentatives. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Accordin g to argument, would the Speaker or the Chairman of Committees have the castsquarely, ing vote in Committee?",34
245,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The Chairman of Committees. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Then the section cannot apply, because it says the Speaker shall have the casting.vote.",34
246,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"If section 40 does make any difference to the position of the Speaker as it exists in the House Commons, why is it put there? Speaker in the House of Commons clearly has the right to vote in Committee, but can only exercise his casting vote when the House is not in Committee. was no need to put in section 40 if it is only intended to re-enact that. right of the Speaker to exercise his castwords ing vote was never, and would never Constitution have been, challenged. This was put i for a specific purpose, and whatever the intention of the Legislature, it is a clear prohibition, and operates against the Speaker, whether the House happens to be in Committee or in the House. The matter ought to be fair l y looked at apart from any party bias, and if it operates unjustly, surely we can agree an amendment of the Constitution at an early moment. Will the Attorney General say that it is not an arguable point ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - Not only is i an arguable point upon the section, but duct the point has been tested both in the British House of Commons and the Canadian House of Commons, and in this House in the same language.",34
247,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Eithe r section 40 is utterly meaningless, or else it means what put-put . the honourable member says it means, and if the powers of our Speaker are identical with those of the Speaker of the House of Commons, there was no necessity for 40 to confer those powers upon",34
248,Mr MCDONALD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Why did they differentiate between the President and the In Speaker ?,34
249,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"A pertinent question. n The Senate is in a different position from of this House, because a section such as has been referred to does not operate or with regard to it .",34
250,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The President of Reprethe Senate votes in Committee,34
251,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Unde r the circumyour stances, I should like the honourable gentleman to look at this point fairly and and to give us his reasons why he does not agree, if he does not, with the views which have been expressed from this side. Since the matter affects the House and the country very materially, I ask that he will give an opportunity for the matter to be referred, if necessary, to not _ a more impartial tribunal than this is.

252,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Wide Bay) [8.0] - The Government have chosen to enact this legislation without laying the measure before Parliament in such a way as to enable honourable members to follow the proposal submitted; and the Bill has not Tellers: been explained by the Prime Minister or any of his colleagues. This proposal, so far as I know, is without parallel in any British Parliament. It is only an extraordinary piece of legislation, hut, in my opinion, it will defeat the purpose of honest government. It is either intended to deceive, or it is not. If the Government are afraid to put their proposals before Parliament in a straightforward way, they should have the courage and honesty to say so. Enactments of this kind cannot be justified AYES. under any circumstances or conditions, and particularly when we are dealing with the foundational principles of representative and responsible government. The franchise of the people is all important; and the Labour party have been the pioneers of the extension of the franchise to all. Honourable members opposite laugh and jeer now; but they never without pressure freely voted for any legislation which had for its object the extension of the franchise. Honourable members opposite belong to a party which to this day keeps Tellers: in existence in the Legislatures of the Anstey, F. States, Houses elected on a privileged franchise, or the members of which are appointed as nominees, to govern a democratic country. Now, because they canoperation ? not take away the privilege of electing both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament on a democratic franchise, they pose as Radical legislators, who are in favour of a greater extension of the franchise. It is said that the proposal now is to restore what the Labour party took away; but we took away nothing.",35
253,Sir JOHN PORREST,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The Federal Convention gave our present franchise.,36
254,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The Constitution, at the lead of the late Charles Cameron Kingston, did give a free franchise to the people of Australia.",36

257,Sir JOHN FORREST,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,He could not it by himself.,36
258,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Mr Kingston was preceded by the late Sir George Grey, who undoubtedly gave the greatest lead in Australia, and in otlier countries, on this particular question. The Government, their supporters outside, and especially their press advocates, say that the late Government took away certain privileges from the electors of Australia.",36
259,Mr SAMPSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Certain rights.,36
260,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,We could not take away their rights.,36
261,Mr SAMPSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The late Government did so.,36
262,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"We did not. It was proved, and admitted, on evidence which has been quoted again and again by M i nisters, who do not belong to our party, that the postal vote had led to corruption.",36
263,Mr GROOM,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Is the right honourable member referring to the Queensland postal vote? The Queensland Act is absolutely different from the Commonwealth Act .,36
264,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Does the honourable member say that Liberal Ministers in Queensland did not determine to repeal the postal vote because of the corrupt practices that prevailed under it?,36
265,Mr GROOM,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I say that the Queensland Act is quite different from our Act .,36
266,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"If the Government are so sure of their position, may I ask whether they have asked for reports from their responsible officers as to the operation of the postal vote while it was in",36
267,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,That was all gone into in this House.,36
268,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Perhaps the honourable member will allow me to ask the Prime Minister whether he has asked for reports from the men who are responsible for the administration of the Electoral Department, as to what their opinion is of the operation of the sections providing for postal voting.",36
269,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I asked the right honourable gentleman if he had consulted the officers before he repealed the sections, and he would not' fell me.",36

271,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Yes , you were.",36
272,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"We had evidence through the Courts, and from our own officers, that there was corruption, and that the law was such that it was almost impossible to prevent it . do Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Will the r i g ht honourable gentleman say that the Chief Electoral Officer advised the repeal of the postal vote?",36
273,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I am asking the Prime Minister, who is proposing to restore the postal vote without giving this Parliament an opportunity to review the matter",36
274,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The honourable member is reviewing it now.,36
275,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Did the honourable gentleman, before taking this drastic step, inquire from the responsible officers whether there were good reasons for repealing these sections of the Act? There is silence. Mr W . H . IRVINE - The Prime Minister's answer is a very fair one to the question.",36
276,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"No doubt the Attorney-General would say that a fair answer to my argument would be a motion that the question be now put. It is a matter of indifference to any one who is aiming to represent a portion of the people what action the Prime Minister or the Attorney-General may take. A f t e r all, we must remember we are the passing creatures of a day in the progress of a country. Let it be said, to the immortal credit of our race, that they are not seriously affected by either conceit or bumptiousness in their representatives. The progress of a country goes on whether the people are required to give up their privileges or not-whethe r their representatives seek to subserve their own interests or not, the great heart of the people stands true for ever, and they make steady progress. If the Government are so anxious regarding the postal vote, it would only be fair to give them an opportunity to deal with it effectively and positively. I have no other view to express than what I have expressed again and again. If the Government can bring down reports from their professional heads of departments",36
277,Mr FLEMING,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The right honourable member objected to their being named in the matter on a former occasion.,37
278,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The r i g ht honourable gentleman asked why the officers should be "" dragged in . """,37
279,Mr SAMPSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,And he bring a report down from the Chief Electoral Officer.,37
280,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The statistics and the facts were laid before the House-facts , to my own knowledge, under practically the same law, as, for instance, at Gympie.",37
281,Mr GROOM,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Do I understand right honourable member to say that that was under practically the same law ?,37
282,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"F o r all practical purposes, in regard to the postal vote.",37
283,Mr GROOM,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I am afraid the honourable member has not read Queensland Act.,37
284,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"What was proved to have happened was that postal votes were taken from two ladies by a certain justice of the peace, and, when it was discovered by him that they had not voted as he had expected them to vote, the votes were put down the sewer and never posted, and, of course, never delivered.",37
285,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"That is what honourable member for Maranoa said he would do, and what he did do.",37
286,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The honourable member for Parkes is very good at interjecting.,37
287,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,V e r y good; I have studied it 1,37
288,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I remember that the other night the honourable member interjected a statement about my personal affairs, and said he had his information on the most reliable authority.",37
289,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I asked a question.,37
290,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"And apologized or admitted his error. There was not a word of truth in the honourable member's statement, and I asked his authority.",37
291,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I made no statement; I asked a question.,37
292,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"As I was saying, the votes of those ladies were never delivered, and the person who failed to deliver them was afterwards able to say that he had lost them. What guarantee have we under such circumstances-and there are hundreds of other cases I could give-that the postal vote is an honest and effective way of recording the verdict of the electors ?",37
293,Mr GROOM,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Is the right honourable member altogether opposed to the postal vote?,37
294,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,No . and I never have been.,37
295,Mr RODGERS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Why did 'the honorrefused to able member not deal with the matter during his term of office?,37
296,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The late Government did deal with it .,37
297,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The right honourable member cannot possibly reply to all these interjections. A casual interjecthe tion might be permitted.,37
298,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The honourable member for Wannon assumes, or is trying to assume, that we did not give a substitute for the postal vote. We created an abright sentee vote, which, according to the the Prime Minister, is almost as good as the' postal vote.",37
299,Mr GROOM,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Does the absentee vote enable the sick and invalid to vote?,37
300,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The Prime Minister in this House said that an absentee vote is just as good as the postal vote.,37
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,- I do not think I said anything of the k in d.,37
302,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Unfortunatel y for the himself, the Prime Minister is reported in Hansard to have said so.",37
303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,There is another interjection there which casts a doubt on that.,37
304,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I do not wish the Prime Minister to be misrepresented. If , in this instance, the honourable member has been misreported and done an injustice, it is only fair that people should know, because, Heaven knows, he is under enough difficulties without that standing against him. If he says he did not say, and never intended to say, and never he never had it in his mind to say, anything of the kind, we should admit that he has been wrongly reported, and that he has been done an injustice. Will the honor- able member take that view ?",37
305,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Were you misreto ported about the sixpenny land tax ?,38
306,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"No , and I did not sayI was.",38
307,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Did you had "" 6d."" on your notes, you advocated ""4d.""1",38
308,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,That is an absolute which I admit. I wish to know Ministers whether they feel there is any warrant for submitting a Bill of this kind in the way they have? Mr W . H . IRVINE - Why are we doing it if we do not?,38
309,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I presume they are doing it for the purpose of burking disthose cussion and preventing the deliberation of a newly-elected Parliament on the i portant matter of franchise. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I invited assistbe ance and suggestions, but we to be getting any.",38
310,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I have taken some ney-General) pains to discover the parts of the Acts cannot accept the amendment. repealed and restored by this Bill , but is not an easy task. I venture to say of the Committee. there are some Ministers who could not say what particular sections in the Acts duce mentioned are repealed. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Reinstated .",38
311,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"As I read the clause, a new system - of voting by post. they are both repealed and reinstated. It is almost an enigma, unless we delve into all the Electoral Acts since the monwealth commenced. I believe it would be wise, late in the day as it is, to amend the clause by omitting the reference to repeal of sections 14, 23, 35, and 38 of Electoral Act 1911, and then afterwards striking out the words "" and the proa visions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902-1909 which were repealed those sections are hereby revive^ and enacted."" This would permit of main provisions dealing with postal voting coming down to the House in an ordinary Bill and being dealt with in the ordinary way. I warn the Government that by this proposal they are initiating a practice a system of legislation that will work both ways with more than one party, because it may be applied to tions. It is certainly an innovation that will not be defended by jurists or ex-members perienced responsible politicians. Further, in the state of business it is unjustifiable, and should not be proceeded with. Mr W . H . IRVINE - There is abuneffective, dant opportunity in the Bill as it make any amendment to the postal voting system.",38
312,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Does the Attorney General, on behalf of the Government, you not say say that this is a desirable way of enacting although legislation ? In my opinion it is not, and, therefore, to afford an opportunity fact, to the Government to put forward their from side of the case, I move an amendment That the words ""fourteen, twenty-three, thirty-five, and thirty-eight"" be left out. If this amendment is carried, I shall f u r ther move to delete the words at the end of the clauseAnd the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902-1909, which were repealed by sections, are hereby revived and re-enacted. The purport of that will be to enable a m - measure to be brought down in a plain form dealing with postal voting, and to dealt with by the House as a measure do not seem of this kind should be. Mr W . H . IRVINE (Flinders-Attor [8.25] - The Government The posii t tion was explained at a much earlier stage It is very simple. The Government have seen fit to introthis Bill in its present form, not with a view of inviting the Committee to go into the whole process of manufacturing That was done previously, and, in the view of the Government, the system so arrived Comat acted well, notwithstanding everything the honourable member has said, and brought an easy, safe, and proper method of exercising the franchise to many thouthe sands of persons who have since been dethe prived of it . We do not invite the Committee to enter into a scheme of making new system of voting by post, as if it had never been tried. What we do is to by bring forward again, and ask the Comremittee to sanction as a whole, that system the of voting by post which has been found thoroughly safe and efficient; but, in so doing, we give honourable members full opportunity to suggest amendments if they have any real bond fide desire to help and us in perfecting this scheme.",38
313,Mr WATKINS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Y o u will not let us get other quesat those provisions. Mr W . H . IRVINE - If honourable have any real bond fide desire to improve any part of the scheme of postal voting which has been found not completely effective, or to help us to make it or to perfect it , we shall welcome is now any such suggestion, and we have drafted a Bill which gives honourable members full opportunity to bring forward any such amendments.",38
314,Mr WATKINS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Will the member show us where there is room in the Bill to do it ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - T i m e will not allow me to instruct the honourable member in parliamentary procedure from Alpha to Omega. I have already shown the Committee where it can be done. If any honourable member chooses to take the trouble to look into the sections which are re-enacted in this Bill , and he has any real objections to the working of any of those provisions, and desires to amend them, parliamentary procedure will allow, him to do it under this Bill ; but we cannot accept the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, because we do not in vite the Committee, at this stage of the session, to re-enter on the discussion of the whole of the machinery for postal voting as if we were making a new kind of machinery that had never been tried before. We are determined to get this matter through; and, if honourable members do not desire honestly and seriously to help us, and if they waste the time of the Committee in other ways, they have only themselves to blame. already wasted two or three hours this afternoon on a matter that should never have been brought up. As I said before, we shall give full attention to any matter brought forward bond fide with a view to improving the measure; but we do not in tend to give consideration to any matter brought forward with any other object.",39
315,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"West Sydney) [8.29] I hope I may be permitted, before the honourable gentleman closes my mouth, to say a few words. The Attorney-General, who is a man of standing and reputation in the community, has assured us that this Bill is before the Committee in such a form as to permit of fair discussion. That I utterly deny.",39
316,Mr W,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,H. IBVINE - Have you amendment to move?,39
317,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The tenor of the honfore orable member's remarks would lead us to believe that if any honourable member wishes to move an amendment which that would make the Bill more effective or modify it in any reasonable way, he can tem. do so. That again I utterly deny. In whole history of this Parliament there has never been put upon the business-paper legislation of this sort. Every honourable member opposite, including the Attorneytoral General himself, is utterly unable to tell us what this measure actually does. I say that deliberately. I assume that the honourable honourable member would have told us what it does if he were able to do so. It proposes, by repealing certain sections of the Act of 1911, to restore certain other sections of the Act of 1909. Mr W . H . IBVINE - Unde r which we worked for years.",39
318,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"V e r y well. Let us suppose that it does what it intends to do, and that it is confined to the repealing of certain sections which prohibit voting by post, and let us assume, further, that it is the desire of a member of the Opposition to amend one of the sections in the Act of 1909, which deals with voting by post. I invite the attention of honourable members to a plain statement of concrete facts. Section 18 of the Act of 1909 amends a provision of the principal Act dealing with voting by post, and relates to authorized witnesses. L et us say, for the sake of argument, that I desire that the term "" authorized witnesses"" shall include or exclude justices of the peace. Will the Attorney-General tell me by what means I am to bring such an amendment before the Committee? We have Mr W . H . IBVINE - B y an amendment of clause 2.",39
319,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I cannot do it . I can only vote against the clause in a blind, unreasoning way. There is no other course open to me, except the eminently reasonable and proper one which the Leader of the Opposition has stated. I wish to emphasize what the Leader of the Opposition has done. By approving of the first part of the clause, he has assented to the principle of voting by post, and he has requested that the sections dealing with voting by post, namely, sections 109 of the principal Act, and the following sections, shall be placed on the table by the Government, so that we may deal seriatim with them. I wish to show any that this is an eminently reasonable thing to do, whereas the proposal put beus by the Government is eminently unreasonable, since it asserts, in effect, that the principal Act was perfect, and it not only provided for voting by post, but precluded the abuse of the sysI n the very Bill by which the Go the vernment proposed originally to amend the principal Act , they proposed to amend these very sections. The Honorary Minister, when introducing the ElecB ill , said that he recognised the weakness of these sections, and that was why it was proposed to take out the provision dealing with authorized witnesses. Section 118A of the Act of 1""909 provided that the authorized witnesses-justice s of the peace and others-shoul d take from the electors the completed postal ballot paper, and post it to the Returning Officer. In the Bill to amend the Electoral Act, which the present Government introduced, it was proposed to take away that right, because it violated the secrecy of the ballot, and to lodge it in the hands of the electors themselves. How can it be consonant with fair play, both to the Opposition and the people of the Commonwealth, that the Attorney-General should deliberately say that this is an endeavour to re-enact a proposal which he himself, through his lieutenant, has declared to be unworkable and unfair, and to assert, further, that we have ample opportunity to make any amendment we please? The Honorary Minister, when introducing the Electoral Bill, saidIn the old days we were charged with being responsible for the Act under which a justice of the peace . . . could collect these ballot papers in their envelopes, could know pretty well how the voters were voting, and then go away and lose the votes that were cast against their party. The honourable member for East Sydney paper interjectedIs it not a weak spot when we find that interested persons do the posting? The Honorary Minister repliedThat is why we are altering the Act. The Attorney-General now proposes that we shall accept this measure with that blemish, which, in itself, is sufficient to condemn it. All that we ask is that we and the country,shall be treated fairly. We ask that section 109, and the following sections dealing with voting by post, shall be laid on the table, so that we may consider them. We propose to deal with them fairly and on their merits. If there be, on the part of the Government, any sense of the responsibility which belongs to men in high office, they should not prostitute their positions by acting in this way. I ask honourable members to consider what this Bill does. It declares thatSections 3, 4, 14, 23, 35, and 38 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1911 are repealed . . . Can honourable members tell me what that means ? I turn to the. Electoral Act 1911, section 3 of which provides thatSection 2 of the principal 'Act' is amended by separate Statutes? omitting therefrom the words ""Par t X - Votin g by Post."" Then, again, section 4 provides thatSection 8 of the principal Act is amended by omitting therefrom the words "" except the powers of that officer under Part X . . of this Act."" So far, so good. We come now to section 14, which provides thatPart X - Votin g by Post-of the principal Act, including sections 109 to 121 (both inclusive) is repealed. That section, therefore, covers the whole of the sections dealing with voting by post. I now ask the Prime Minister to glance at section 23, which enacts thatSection 158 of the principal Act is repealed, and the following sections inserted in its stead :"" 158. A ballot-paper shall (except as otherwise provided by regulations under section 139 or the regulations relating to absent voting) be informal if (fl) it is not authenticated by the initials of the presiding officer or by an official mark as prescribed; (i) it has no vote marked on it or has votes marked on it for a greater or lesser number of candidates than the number required to be elected j or (c) it has upon it any mark or writin."" (not authorized by this Act or the regulations to be put upon it) which would in the opinion of the returning officer enable the voter to be identified : "" Provided that paragraph (c) shall not apply to any mark or writing placed upon the ballotby an officer, notwithstanding that the placing of the mark or writing upon the ballot paper is a contravention of this Act. . . . What relation has that to the postal vote? Why is that section repealed in this way under cover of a Bill, the short title of which is "" The Postal Voting Restoration Act"" ? It has no bearing on the postal vote. When - we proposed to move this afternoon that this Bill should be entitled "" A Bill to amend the Electoral Act,"" we were not permitted to do so; but it is intended, under cover of this measure, to introduce an amendment widereaching in its effect, and which relates to the effect of the franchise over the whole community, and is not restricted to postal voting. There is no attempt to explain this proposed alteration. Then, again, section 35 of the Act of 1911, which this Bill repeals, provides thatSection 174 of the principal Act is amended by omitting paragraph iv. therefrom. Was there ever before in the history of this Parliament a position in which honof orable members, in order to ascertain the meaning of a Bill, had to consult three Are we not usually supplied with amending Bills showing in black type the proposed alterations, so that the plainest man may read and understand them? In this case, the Bill is simply thrown upon the table without any explanation or any attempt to explain it . For the moment I cannot find paragraph 4 of section 174 of the principal Act. It does not even appear in the consolidated Statutes, and I defy any one to trace it . Finally, section 38 of the Act of 1911 provides thatSection 182 of the principal Act is amended by omitting from the table of Electoral offences and punishments the words "" voter's certificate."" All these sections which I have just recapitulated have no relation one way or the other to voting by post. vision for their repeal has been inserted in this Bill in such a way that only hours of industrious effort have enabled us to trace some of them. The reason for their insertion is not known to any of us. Clearly the Attorney-General does not apprehend the reason, or, surely, he would have told us why, in a Bill to provide for the restoration of postal voting, there should be a reference to these other matters. I do not know whether they are good or bad; I cannot see what is their scope, and should be glad to be told why they have been introduced into this Bill . I ask the Attorney-General to confine this Bill to the restoration of the postal vote, and to eliminate these other matters. Mr W . H . IBVINE - There is nothing in the Bill except that which is immediately necessary for the restoration of the postal vote.",39
320,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Whateve r bearing sections 23, 35, and 38 of the Act of 1911 have to the postal vote, it must be admitted that they have it because they have a bearing on all votes. Mr W . H . IBVINE - No ; look at section. 23.",41
321,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I have read section 23, and also section 158 of the principal Act to which it relates. emphatically it is not confined to informal postal votes, but extends to all votes. Under a Postal Vote Restoration Act , we should deal only with postal votes. That I am prepared to do, and claim that we have a right to do, but we also have a right to expect that, when dealing with section 14, which is hereby repealed, section 14, which covers 109 and subsequent sections, shall be placed on the table, so that we may make suitable amendments. That is, after all , the shortest way and the best way, and if that is done, we are perfectly prepared to agree to it ; but we desire that our amendments may be fairly considered and debated. They cannot be debated and considered now. The measure is so drafted as to make its clear meaning absolutely unknowable, even to the legal mind, and does not permit of that clear and reasonable discussion and debate and amendment that a measure of this sort, which goes to the very basis of democratic government, demands. Mr JOSE PH COOK (ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [8.48] - The honourable member The pro- has just spent fifteen minutes in showing that it would be wicked to waste further time in this debate. If the clause is unknowable and unamendable, why does the honourable member invite the Attorney General to help him to amend it , and put it right? My reply to the honourable member is that we gave him every provision referred to in this clause in a larger Bill many weeks ago, and the Opposition declined to take the opportunity to amend it to their hearts' content.",41
322,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,What are you going to do with that other Bill?,41

330,Mr CHARLTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Hunter) [ 9 . 7 ] - I was very pleased to hear the Attorney General say that he would be prepared to consider any amendment in the Bill which might be brought forward. . Personally, I have always held that provision should be made for the voting of the sick and the infirm, and in the last Parliament I could not see my way clear to eliminate from the electoral law the provisions for postal voting, as the weight, of evidence in favour of that course did not seem sufficiently heavy. In view of the many statements that have been made here since as to the abuse of the postal voting system, I have come to the conclusion that it is our duty to provide machinery to permit of the voting of the sick and the the infirm without the possibility of . abuses, and I have drafted an. amendment which, I think, will do that. This ... 37 ought not to be made a party question. ... 36 The Prime Minister laughs ",42
331,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I should thin k so.,42
332,Mr CHARLTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"If the Prime M in ister will turn up Hansard, he w i ll see Avas. that I have deplored making this question a party one. Mr W. H. IRVINE - But the honourable member's party has made it a party question.",42
333,Mr WEBSTER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The Liberals have made it a party question.,42
334,Mr CHARLTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I have always stated that I consider it a people's, not a party, question, and that every facility should be given to the electors for the recording of votes, so long as the elections are conducted purely.",42
335,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Then why did the honourable member vote for the repeal of the postal provisions of the electoral law ?,42
336,Mr CHARLTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,If my memory serves me aright; I voted with the honourable member for the retention of the provisions giving opportunities for the voting of the sick and the infirm.,43
337,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The honourable member, and the honourable member for Bourke, voted with this party in that lated matter.",43
338,Mr CHARLTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I both spoke and voted for the retention of the provisions referred to, but in view of the interjecstead tion of the Prime Minister, it is as well that the electors should be informed that I am not in any way acting the hypoto crite. I have been thoroughly conconsideration. scientious throughout. I know of aged persons who, during the whole of their lifetime, have taken a keen interest in politics, but are now-perhap s because of senile decay-unabl e to go to the pollthis ing booths, and I am in favour of prosick vision being made which will allow them their votes. to record their votes without having to so. I move That the following words be added to the clause :Provided that where an elector, who, by reason of illness or infirmity, believes that he will be unable to attend at the polling place at any time during the hours of polling, may make application by post to the returning officer of the division in which the applicant is enrolled for a vote after the issue of the writ for the election, and within seven days preceding the day of the election. The returning officer, on a day previous to the election, and after the day for receiving applications has expired, shall instruct the presiding officer appointed at the nearest polling place to call at the address of the applicant, and who shall, if satisfied that the claimant is entitled to vote under the provisions of this section, supply a ballot-paper to the elector, who, in the presence of the officer, but so that the officer cannot see the vote, shall mark the ballot-paper in the prescribed manner, and shall fold and secure the ballot-paper so that the vote cannot be seen. The ballot-paper shall then be placed in a sealed ballot-box in the presence of the presiding officer, and shall be opened and counted at the scrutiny at the close of the ballot. The adoption of that amendment would provide adequate machinery for the recording of the votes of the sick and the infirm, and should meet the strong obcases jection to the postal vote in its old form. The Attorney-General has stated that the applicant Government are prepared to increase the expenditure on elections if thereby they can be conducted more purely. ditional expense which the adoption of would be very few. my proposal would involve would not be great, because in many places there would be no applications, and polling booths are in most divisions so near together, such great facilities for the recording of votes having been given by both parties when in power, that it would not be difficult for presiding officers to call on applicants. It may be objected that in sparsely popudistricts it would be difficult to give effect to my provision, but in that case we might also provide that persons residing more than 5 miles from a polling booth could send their votes by post, in of having an oflicer wait on them. I wish to facilitate the voting of the sick and infirm, and ask the Government not brush aside my amendment without If Ministers cannot acm a n y cept it , they may be able to make a proposal which would be acceptable to both sides, and it would be best for all concerned to have some understanding on matter, because we all desire that the and infirm shall be able to record It does not matter how we do accomplish our end so long as the elections are clean and above board. - Mr Laird SMITH - How can there be a double dissolution in that case ?",43
339,Mr CHARLTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"We do not desire a double dissolution, but we do desire proper electoral machinery.",43
340,Mr RODGERS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Would the amendment be workable in such large constituencies as Kennedy and Maranoa?,43
341,Mr CHARLTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I should be prepared to meet such a position by providing that, where an applicant resides at a greater distance than 5 miles from the nearest polling place, he shall forward a doctor's certificate, and in such case the officer shall forward a postal voting ballot-paper to be returned on or before the date of election. We should then be sure that the person who applied was a sick person, and abuse would be prevented.",43
342,Mr RODGERS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,It would cost a great deal to get a doctor's certificate.,43
343,Mr CHARLTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I venture to say that, if we were to go carefully into the likely to occur in those scattered areas, we should not get five where the resided over 5 miles distant.

344,Mr SAMPSON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,We expect the facilities to be made use of more extensively.,43
345,Mr CHARLTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"And I desire them to be made use of legitimately as extensively as possible. The one objection I have to the postal vote is that it has been abused. More people voted by post in Victoria than in all the rest of Australia, and it cannot be contended that there were more sick people in this State than there were throughout the remainder of the Commonwealth. For instance, in Kooyong, there were more people who voted by post than in the whole of Western Australia.",44

I put this amendment forward all seriousness, and ask the Government ment. to consider it . We desire to show that we are anxious to give every person to vote, and they should be able to vote if they happen to be sick; but we must prevent any abuses.",44
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The honourable member ought to vote for this Bill .,44
351,Mr CHARLTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"No ; since I voted for the postal vote, I have come to the conclusion that many people used that vote who were not really invalids.",44
352,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The terms of the postal votes extended beyond invalids; it was a matter of convenience to the voters.,44
353,Mr CHARLTON,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I venture to say that even a majority of honourable members opposite will not contend that a reason for proposing to restore the postal vote is to convenience electors who are not ill-to enable hale and hearty men is a very simple one. to record their votes by post.

368,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The effect of the rejection of the amendment of the honourable member for Wide Bay is that the clause remains as it was, and the suggested amendment now is that words be inserted after the word "" fourteen,"" which, I think, is permissible.",44
369,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The point at issue . The Committee conhave decided that the words that were proposed to be struck out shall stand part of the clause, and, therefore, we cannot alter those words without recommitting them.",44
370,Mr ROBERTS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"As I understand the situation, the resolution the Committee may arrived at was that all the words up to '' thirty-eight'' should stand part of the memclause.

The Committee have not decided that we cannot insert words between those words, nor that what '' fourteen' ' stands for cannot be amended. I draw attention to the fact that the Attorney-General suggested that, while he desired to keep "" f o u r t e e n "" in as an indication of his intention, he had no desire to prevent what "" fourteen "" means being amended. It means the retention of something like twelve sections of the principal Act .",44
371,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The position is perfectly obvious. The Committee have already decided that words up to and in cluding "" t h i r t y - e i g h t"" shall stand part of the clause; that is, that the clause shall remain unalterable in Committee up to that word. That has always been the practice in Committee; and it would be impossible to make any progress if any honourable member could go back on work already done.

383,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [9.35] - The Government cannot accept the amendment. The machinery set up by it . for recording the postal votes of those who are sick and infirm makes it impracticable, and leaves it open to some abuse; but apart altogether If that from that, the limitation to those who are sick and infirm cannot be accepted by the Government. We do not interpret the postal vote in that way. Since Parliament has placed on the shoulders of the voter the compulsion to enroll, we maintain we are under an obligation, as far as possible, to make his privileges correspond with that obligaout tion. The ideal to be aimed at all our laws such as this is equal opportunities for voting, as far as we can encompass it .

387,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"There amount of interjecting going on that really beyond all tolerance by any man. I trust that we shall be able conduct our proceedings in a more derly way in view of the complaint of the Prime Minister, and of a complaint I heard also from the opposite side of the Chamber earlier in the evening. Otheri wise, I have the Standing Orders to carry out, and I shall not be worthy of my tion if I do not do so. I frained from taking any extreme step time and again, and I hope it will be necessary for me to carry the Standbe carried out. ing Orders to their furthest, in order that I may secure the attention to any honourable member speaking is titled. Mr JOSE PH COOK - In a word two I Wish to show why we cannot accept quite right the amendment. There is no need heat. We claim that the amendment seriously curtail the postal vole, have hitherto known it , and that makes it impossible for the Government to accept it. Where we have compulsion on voters to enroll we have to give them every lege we can to exercise their votes. I man is 8, or 9, or 10 miles away from polling booth we place him under a seriexercised ous disability, as compared with the who is 8 or 9 yards away. That is position in a nutshell.

It is Chairimpracticable to do so. The honourable to member has, therefore, submitted a proorposal that is absolutely impracticable, and his postion would be far more logical, if those are the only conditions under which he will give the postal vote, if he would make up his mind to vote against t . The honourable member is prepared to concede the postal vote, as the honourable posimember for Bourke is, under impossible have reand impracticable conditions; and, of course, we cannot accept proposals which not are absolutely unworkable, and cannot",46
394,Mr FISHER,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Wide Bay) [9.40] - The which Prime Minister would lead the Commitentee to believe that, because enrolment was made compulsory, voting was also or in effect made compulsory - He was in asserting that, in for a Democracy like this, the facilities will for every one entitled to vote to as we record a vote should be as wide as it is possible to make them with safety; but the principle of the exercise of the franchise rests entirely on the basis of privithe vote being cast under supervision. f a Prom the very earliest stages of voting it a has been recognised that care must be as to the manner in which votes man are cast. Care was always taken in any the system of voting apart from the supert vision of responsible officers within a pollwithing booth, or in the open, before the secrecy of the ballot was established, that no person voted oftener. than he was entitled to vote. I think this Parliament has developed the principle of extending the privilege and facility to vote more than any other Parliament, but abuses crept in . These were corrected by certain legislation, and certain administration, but, in my opinion, they were never totally eliminated, and they are not likely to be eliminated by any legislation. I say it is impracticable to eliminate abuses where we have an extensive system of postal voting. There should be some method of reaching electors who are more than a certain distance away from a polling place. The honourable member for Darling Downs will know that, in Queensland, fifteen years ago, a Liberal Government compelled seventy miners at Opalton to ride 120 miles to exercise their vote, and he will remember the celebrated Bonnavonna polling place to which people were carted from all parts of the colony. That was the way in which the franchise was exercised at that time, and the Labour party were loudest in their condemnation of that practice. The proposition is quite different now. Able-bodied electors, within a reasonable distance of a polling booth, should cast their votes at that polling booth under proper supervision. The sick and invalid - and a person may be invalid and not sick, or may be maimed and incapable of moving or being moved-shoul d have every facility to exercise their franchise. But people in good health, and more particularly males in good health, ought to be compelled to go to the polling booths, because the greater the extent to which they do so, the greater will be the assurance that the franchise will be exercised as it ought to be. I should not like to commit myself to every suggestion which has been made by the honourable member for Hunter, but his amendment is certainly a great improvement on some of the proposals made by the Government, and I regret that they cannot see their way to countenance it , even if they will not accept it exactly in the form in it is proposed.",46
395,Mr ROBERTS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Adelaide) [9.46] - We have had from the Prime Minister this afternoon a statement very different from those made by his party throughout the election campaign, and, in fact, up to the present day. It is now quite clear that the Government desire, not merely to restore voting by post in the case of the sick and the infirm , but to extend it to persons enjoying even the best of health. It is intended that they shall have facilities for voting by post of a character that must necessarily be open to question. Previously all the statements made by the Ministry and their supporters were to the effect that by repealing the postal voting provisions of the Electoral Act we had prevented the sick and the infirm and the mothers of Australia from exercising the franchise. Practically nothing was said of a votingby-post system which would allow tens of thousands enjoying the very best of health to avail themselves of it if they so desired. An entirely new situation has been sprung upon us by the statement of the Prime Minister that the Government are determined to restore this system because they have in this Chamber, at the present moment, the necessary numbers to enforce their will . It is just as well that the vast difference between their pre-election cry and their utterances today should be emphasized.",47
396,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"There is no difference whatever, except in the honourable member's imagination.",47
397,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Order !,47
398,Mr ROBERTS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I do not mind the Prime Minister's interjections.,47
399,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I have a r i g ht to correct a misrepresentation.,47
400,Mr ROBERTS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The honourable gentleman is particularly sensitive to interjections when he is addressing the Committee, but he does not hesitate to interrupt others. L et us look at the situation for a moment. Honourable members opposite can afford to .pay canvassers during an election campaign.",47
401,Mr BOYD,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I do not think the honourable member can substantiate that statement.,47
402,Mr ROBERTS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I accept the honourable member's disclaimer, and will say that honourable members opposite cannot afford to employ paid canvassers. But whether they can or cannot, the fact which remains that paid canvassers are persistently working in their behalf. Who pays them, I do not know. They are paid to do certain work, and their work for many weeks prior to an election will be to secure votes. If the postal voting provisions are restored, as the Ministry propose, then these paid canvassers will be able to call on every man and woman within 2 yards, much less 2 miles, of a polling booth, and try to persuade them to sign a statement to the effect that they believe-no t that they will-bu t that they "" be l i e v e "" that they will be more than 5 miles from a polling booth on election day. Those who do that will be able to take advantage of the postal voting provisions of the Act . If honourable members opposite think that is a proper provision to have in our electoral system, well knowing the abuse to which it can be put, let them enforce it . Mr W . H . IBVINE - That is fallacy of the Opposition-the y believe that every one who opposes them is a rogue.",47
403,Mr ROBERTS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I have not treated the honourable member in that way. Mr W. H. IBVINE - The member is practically treating the electors as being rogues.,48
404,Mr ROBERTS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I am not. I am simply speaking of the possibilities, and of what the honourable gentleman from his long political experience must know will become actualities. Just prior to an election, when party feeling is high, and when persons can be induced for pay to canvass for votes, they will be able to do what I have said. While ""the electors are, in the ordinary sense, innocent of any in tention to do wrong, paid canvassers will be able to cajole thousands into taking advantage of these provisions, and if the vote of the individual does not suit the paid canvasser, then we know that it will not be recorded. That is the unfortunate feature of the situation. An innocent person recording his vote by post has to do so in such a way that a paid canvasser must inevitably see how he votes, and under the provisions proposed to be restored, he is to take the ballot-paper from the voter, and is himself supposed to place it in the letter-box.",48
405,Mr HUGHES,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The Government itself denounced that particular provision, and is now re-enacting it .",48
406,Mr ROBERTS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Fiv e days ago the Government held a different view. They were then going on with the Electoral Bill, and, in introducing that measure, the Honorary Minister specifically denounced provisions that are being reenacted under this measure. He denounced them as being unfair and open to corruption, and said they ought not to be retained in the electoral law. The Ministry have suddenly changed their minds. What was but a few weeks ago denounced by the Honorary Minister as unfair and improper and open to corruption is now being forced upon the country. Mr W . H . IBVINE - We have not time now for political speeches.",48
407,Mr ROBERTS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,The honourable gentleman need not threaten me. Mr W . H . IBVINE - I do not threaten; I merely warn.,48
408,Mr ROBERTS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"The honourable gentleman does not like my criticism, and so he warns me that if I dare criticise his the old actions, he will apply the "" gag."" Mr W . H . IBVINE - We wish to give honourable members with a bond fide desire to discuss the Bill an opportunity to do so, but we have no time now for political speeches. honourable Mr ROBERTS - The honourable gentleman is at liberty to exercise the power that he possesses. The question of whether my remarks are, or are not, of a political character is merely a matter of opinion, and the honourable member is entitled to warn me, or to threaten me, as the case may be, bu t while I am permitted to speak, I have the right to say that it is because he objects to my criticism of his action that he warns me that if I persist I shall have the "" gag "" applied, although I am a representative of the people in this House. It is impossible for me to occupy very much time, since there is a time l i m it of thirty-five minutes to our speeches in Committee, and it is therefore monstrous for the At torney-General to suggest, as he does, that I am wasting time. Mr W . H . IBVINE - The honourable member is only repeating what was said over and over again when this question was last debated.",48
409,Mr ROBERTS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"My remarks may be distasteful to the honourable member, but I am at liberty to speak while he permits me to do so. According to a member of the Ministry, the provisions that are now being forced upon us do permit of corruption at election time. The amendment submitted by the honourable member for Hunter is a clear indication that he is prepared to remove all the objections that were recently raised as to the prevention of the sick and-the infirm from the exercise of the franchise by the repeal of the postal-voting provisions of the Act . Those were really the only objections raised up to a few minutes ago. The honourable member's amendment clearly indicates his desire to meet them, and tliere is no doubt that if it were accepted it would be carried by a very large majority. But the very moment that the Opposition meets the arguments on the situation created by the Government side of the House, that very moment Ministers say they will not accept an amendment giving voting facilities to the sick and the infirm. I am justified, even although it may be considered that I am making a political speech, in emphasizing my sincere regret that there should be forced through this Chamber a measure of which, no doubt, advantage can be taken at a critical time, and which will mean that the men who have the money at their disposal-whethe r they have it themselves or have friends to spend it for themwill be able to secure a voting strength which would otherwise be impossible. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - An infamous misrepresentation.",48
410,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,Order ! The honourable member will withdraw that remark.,49
411,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,I withdraw it.,49
412,The CHAIRMAN,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"I would point out to the Prime Minister that if I am expected to keep order, particularly in the matter of interjections, I have a right to expect Ministers to assist me in doing so, by setting an example to other portions of the House.",49
413,Mr ROBERTS,POSTA LVOTINGRESTORATION,"Apparentl y it is proposed to extend the postal vote to the healthy community regardless of distance from polling booths, provided they will sign a paperto the efEect that they believe they will be so many miles distant on election day, but it is questionable whether a large number who sign the paper will thoroughly understand it in that light. There is a cry that these proposals are entirely for the benefit of country people, and the Prime Minister said that we ought, in the Electoral Act, to give to the country people privileges equal to those given to the people in the cities. I have absolutely no objection. Having'resided in a country district for many years, I have full and complete sympathy with those resident therein; but if the Government are so anxious to give the country people facilities, let them increase the number of polling booths by a few thousand. But what a sham and hollow cry is that about equal privileges. They might just as well say that we should give them electric trams in Warrnambool or Horsham, or build a capital city in every State, or take Jensen, J. A . a railway to the door of every individual in the country. The assertion was made merely to pander to the country people, without giving them reasonable facilities. But it is intended to give facilities to exercise the postal vote to persons to whom those facilities should not be given, and that those opportunities should be taken advantage of by paid canvassers at election periods. I regret that the Government will not accept an amendment that clearly indicates our desire to give postal voting facilities to the sick and infirm, whether in the city or the country, but insists on extending them in another direction..",49
