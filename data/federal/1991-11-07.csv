United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The Petition of the certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House their deep concern that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: (l)(a) makes inadequate provision for a subjective judgement by parents as to what is in the best interests of their children, (b) makes inadequate provision for parents to use their discretionary powers to act on such judgements. (2) creates the potential for conflict between parent and child (rather than the atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding mentioned as valuable in the preamble). (3) will produce closer monitoring by Government agencies of relationships between parents and children. Your Petitioners therefore pray that: (1) By Act, Parliament ensure that all international treaties (excluding national security) are debated by the Parliament. (2) The Parliament take action to have the Convention amended in order to pay the highest regar.d to the importance of the family unit, and to the nghts and responsibilities of parents. by Mr Cadman (from 662 citizens), Mr Grace (from 14 citizens), and  Government Funding of Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned Australian citizens shows that: Every abortion kills an unborn human baby. More unborn Australians are killed every year (80,000) than the Australian death toll for the whole of World War II (30,000). Australia's population is aging. Our live birth rate is below replacement level. About 98 percent of abortions in Australia are performed for non-medical reasons (see SA Health Commission statistics). Post abortion depression is a silent epidemic and is linked with the growing incidence of child abuse by mothers who have previously had abortions. The Australian Government should not fund the killing of future Australian citizens. Mothers with problem pregnancies need positive help to carry their babies to full term. Your petitioners therefore pray that your Honourable House will: pass the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill lYYO, and help pregnant women with problems to continue their pregnancies. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Connolly (from 19 citizens), Mr Downer (from 18 citizens), and Mr Wilson (from 88 citizens). Medicare: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That every abortion kills an unborn human baby. That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights. That the Governments first duty is to protect this right to life. That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect. That in 1987-88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided medical benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million. That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Cadman (from three citizens), and Mr Chaney (from 24 citizens). Medicare: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The Humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That every abortion kills an unborn human baby; That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights; That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life; That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect; That in 1989/90 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided Medical Benefits for 69,587 abortions totalling $7.8 million; That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal. And your Petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Ronaldson (from six citizens), and Mr Webster (from 389 citizens). United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned Australian citizens shows: The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: gives wide rights to children in Articles 12 to 16, including the right to privacy and freedom of association; gives only qualified rights to parents in Article 5; fails to recognise the absolute right of parents to determine the education of their children; could result in government-assisted rebellion against parents who want to set limits for their children in their children's best interests. Your petitioners therefore pray that your Honourable House will: request the Federal Gove.rnment to denounce those parts of the Convention which could undermine the parent-child relationship. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Duncan (from 51 citizens), and Mr Wilson (from 88 citizens). AIDEX Exhibition To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That attention is drawn to Australia's location and involvement in the Asia/Pacific region where there exists a number of actual and potential conflicts, along with several countries which can ill afford to pay for the importation of military equipment yet feel obliged to do so. That Australia is increasing its role in the arms trade in this region, and in particular, it is supporting and participating in AIDEX '91. The anns trade is detrimental to Australians affected by the diversion of public money away from health, education, social welfare, and is an integral factor in the oppression and poverty of people of the Asia/Pacific region. The petitioners therefore appeal to the Australian Parliament to: Stop all military aid and training to governments engaged in repression of their own people. Direct those Government Departments participating in AIDEX '91, i.e. Defence, Austrade, Industry, Technology and Commerce, to cancel their bookings for space at the exhibition and withdraw their support for AIDEX '91. Redirect all monies currently being used in promoting the arms industry to socially useful research, development and production. Explore the possibilities of setting up an Agency for the development of techniques for conflict resolution. Increase overseas aid to counteract the reduction since 1983/4. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Hicks (from 65 citizens), and Mr Sharp (from nine citizens). AIDEX Exhibition To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. A petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will: Acknowledge that the undersigned citizens object to any government policy which promotes military arms exports as an acceptable means of reducing the balance of trade deficit. Close down 'AlDEX 1991' and direct all Federal and State Government departments and instrumentalities to withdraw from participation in and support for 'AlDEX 1991' and similar arms trade fairs in Australia and overseas. Redirect all monies currently being used to promote the arnlS industry to the research and development of socially useful products and industries that would contribute to environmentally sustainable development and the creative enhancement of communities rather than human destruction. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Simmons (from 312 citizens). Cape York Peninsula Petition to the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of this House that we are concerned that the proposed spaceport and associated developments threaten the ecological integrity and wilderness values of Cape York Peninsula. As one of the last tropical wildernesses remaining in Australia and the world, its natural values should be protected for future generations. Your petitioners therefore request the House to direct the Prime Minister and his Government to: declare a moratorium on the proposed spaceport at Temple Bay; undertake management plans for the entire Cape York Peninsula, so that its future is not decided by ad hoc development; afford a high priority to reserving land of conservation and wilderness value or Aboriginal significance; protect areas listed on the Register of the National Estate. by Mrs Kelly (from 242 citizens), and Mr Mack (from 2,083 citizens). ABC Television: Investigation By Ombudsman To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled: We, the undersigned citizens of Australia, are deeply concerned by the continued political biases and deplorable disregard for common decency displayed by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Further, we are alarmed that the Corporation is able to conduct itself in this manner without accountability to an independent authority. We believe that it is totally unacceptable that a publicly funded body can undertake any action it chooses, free from public complaint and scrutiny. Your petitioners therefore pray that the members of the House of Representatives will act to empower the Commonwealth Ombudsman-either of his own intention or in response to a complaint from a member, or members, of the public-to investigate any action that relates to a programming decision of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. by Mr Aldred (from 994 citizens). Medicare: $3.50 Co-payment To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We, the undersigned residents of the state of NSW, draw the attention of the House to the fact that we are unhappy with the additional $3.50 (soon to become $5.00) patient payment for medical services. We support Medicare and the principle of universal access to health care. We believe the extra fee may prevent many people from seeking primary medical care, especially people with young children and those struggling financially. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to reverse the decision which decreases the Medicare rebate and introduces patient co-payment. by Mr Baldwin (from 5,861 citizens). Electoral Advertising To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled; the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we call upon Honourable Members to reject legislation denying Australians the right to advertise electoral material on radio and television, believing such bans amount to a denial of free speech, an unfair advantage to an incumbent government, and a denial of information to printhandicapped and other Australians. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Beale (from four citizens). To the Honourable Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia to the attention of the House That the democratically elected members of the Parliament of the Republic of Croatia, proclaimed on the 25th of June 1991. That the republic of Croatia, be an independent and sovereign state, as it was requested by the people in the referendum held on the 19th of May 1991. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House takes all action within its power to bring about: The recognition of the Republic of Croatia by the Australian Government as an independent and sovereign state. The condemnation by the Australian Government of any action of force against the Republic of Croatia and its people. by Mr Beddall (from 19 citizens). Medicare: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That every abortion kills an unborn human baby. That the right to life of all innocent human beings is the most fundamental of all human rights. That the first duty of the Parliament and of the Government is to protect this right to life. That in 1989-90 alone Medicare provided medical benefits for almost 70,000 abortions at a cost to taxpayers of $7.8 million. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will protect the right to life of unborn Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare and by all other means at its disposal. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Cadman (front 119 citizens). Deportation of Mr Aka Vana To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament House Canberra: As electors of the Division of Indi, we hereby draw to the attention of the House the extraordinary plight of Mr Mrs Aka Vana and family. Mr Vana, a soldier in the Australian Army has had his Croatia application for citizenship rejected and will be deported on 30th November 1991. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House may urgently undertake to review this case and draws grant a reasonable hearing to Mr Vana, currently serving in the Australian Army. by Mr Ewen Cameron (from 118 citizens). Pornographic Telephone Message Service To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House that the Telephone Information Services Standards Committee is considering the introduction of hard-core pornographic telephone messages in Australia if public opinion approves. According to the proposal, access to such a service would be restricted to mature-age subscribers armed with their own pin number. This proposal obviously relies on the integrity of the person who has been allocated the pin number, and does not offer any assurance to the community that young people will be protected from exposure to sexually explicit messages. We have heard the perpetrators of rape and other sex-reiated crimes admit that they have been influenced by the proliferation of pornographic literature and videos. We believe that if society is subjected to yet another form of hard-core pornography, we will see an increase in the incidence of such crimes. Your petitioners therefore request the House to protect the interests of the people of Australia, and to ensure that the proposed introduction of hardcore pornographic telephone messages does not take place. by Mr Filing (from 88 citizens). Telecom 0055 Service To the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia to the attention of the House the readily available range of sex and fantasy audio text services transmitted via Telecom through the use of the 0055 prefix. We express deep concern that these messages could be easily accessed by young people, and that the transmission of such messages will lead to a decline in the moral standards of all Australians. Your petitioners therefore request the House to move to immediately disband this 'adult' information and entertainment service. by Mr Tim Fischer (from 34 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of Fowler residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House the current campaign which is being waged by the Communist Government of Serbia and its agents against the aspiration for independence of the Republic of Croatia. We particularly draw to your attention the fact that Croatia has satisfied the conditions of international law for independence, and that it has made every effort to enter into meaningful dialogue with its opponents in Serbia. These have been to no avail. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House as a matter of urgency offers immediate recognition to Croatia as a sovereign nation. by Mr Grace (from 481 citizens). Pensions: CPI Adjustment To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that pensioners are being burdened with an increase in the cost of living and are receiving no compensation for it. Because the CPI is not specific to the spending patterns of pensioners, a decrease in the cost of living has been shown as 0.1 % which therefore cuts out a rise for this September. CPI has shown a negative movement because within its basket of goods, are luxury items that have dramatically decreased in price and therefore cover the increase in basic consumer items that are relevant to the spending patterns of pensioners. Also the wage/tax deals that have occurred between the Federal Government and unions has meant that Australian workers have received an increase in their take home wage but we have seen no counterbalance occur for pensioners. Your petitioners therefore request the House to negotiate with the Federal Government to introduce draws a pension CPI measurement that takes into consideration the spending patterns of pensioners. Also that a $4.50 rise be granted to pensioners to compensate them for the wage/tax deals that occurred in January '91. by Mr Humphreys (from 246 citizens). Brisbane Airport Task Force To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament: We, the undersigned petitioners, reject the final report of the Brisbane Airport Task Force, because it failed in its basic charter to ""minimise the impact of aircraft noise on surround communities. Croatia It failed to recommend their own conclusions that an extended Cross Runway would ""significantly reduce aircraft noise"" and that an extended cross runway could operate as the ""main or supplementary runway,/I which, along with the Main Runway would enable 80% or more planes to go in and out over Moreton Bay, as promised. Although it rejected these solutions because the cost would be $105 million, it recommended that a future Parallel Runway be built at a cost of $395 million (today's price) which could escalate to double or more in 15 to 20 years, thus forcing north and southside citizens to suffer increasing aircraft noise with no end in sight. We urgently request that money be made available for an extended Cross Runway as the most cost effective and practical solution to Brisbane Airport noise and safety. We also request that changes be made to flight paths over Hemmant, Tingalpa and BulimbaBalmoral, Morningside areas. by Mr Jull (from 17 citizens). Hydro-Electric Power Station: 'fully Millstream To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of Queensland draws to the attention of the House: Our opposition to the construction of the Tully Millstream Hydro-Electric Power Station. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to: allow sufficient funds to be made available to proceed with the construction of the Burdekin Dam Scheme to its maximum capacity of water conservation and hydro-electric power. by Mr Lindsay (from 14 citizens). Organochlorine Pesticides To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House: That we understand that the organochlorine pesticides heptachlor and aldrin have been banned or restricted for health and/or environmental concerns in 34 and 41 nations overseas (respectively). They are still widely used in Australia for termite control under and around buildings and homes. As effective non-chemical alternatives are becoming available for the control of termites, we fail to see why Australians and their environenvironment ment should tolerate these toxic, persistent and bioaccumulative pesticides any longer. Your petitioners therefore request that the house takes immediate steps to ban all uses of the organochlorine pesticides, particularly for urban termite control. by Mr Mack (from 41,627 citizens). . Slovenia To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: That the democratically elected members of the Parliament of the Republic of Slovenia proclaimed on 25th of June 1991 that the Republic of Slovenia be an independent and sovereign state, as it was requested by the Slovenian people in the referendum held on 26th December 1990. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House Takes all action within its powers to bring about: The recognition of the Republic of Slovenia by the Australian Government as an independent and sovereign State. The condemnation by the Australian Government of any action of force against the Republic of Slovenia and its people. by Mr Mack (from 1,495 citizens). Croatia To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: The current occurrences in Croatia. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House to recognise Croatia immediately; initiate World order by condemning aggression by the Yugoslav Army and Serbian 'Chetnik' Terrorists; supply aid to the Croatian refugees; establish a Croatian Embassy in Australia. by Mr Mack (from 1,310 citizens). Arms Trade To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: We, residents of the Western Suburbs of Melbourne and custodians of the Earth, regard the maintenance of peace, social justice and a clean as the first priorities of government. Australia's growing role in the production and sale of weapons and weapon systems contributes to international conflict, particularly in the Asian and Pacific region. We therefore call on you to halt this trade and, in particular, to cancel the AIDEX Arms Bazaar scheduled for Canberra in November. We urge you to adopt our views and to act accordingly. by Mr Mack (from 108 citizens). AIDEX: Withdrawal of Support To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain Christian citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: 1. that an Australian International Defence Equipment Exhibition (AIDEX) is to be held in Canberra, November 26-28, 1991; 2. that this private arms trade fair has the official support of the Australian Government and the participation of the Department of Defence and some State Government Departments and instrumentalities; 3. that it is inconsistent to advocate disarmament while helping to promote the arms trade, and immoral to reduce our trade deficit by developing a competitive arms export industry; 4. that a trade fair to promote the sale of arms will not help to preserve the peace of our region, but is more likely to destabilise it; 5. that the basic need of our Pacific and S.E. Asian neighbours is for food, shelter, health care and education, not arms. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House: 1. immediately withdraw all Government support for and participation in AIDEX; 2. refuse to allow into Australia any arms, including defence components and equipment, destined for display at AIDEX; 3. express willingness to consider compensation for firms which may already have spent money on AIDEX. by Mr MACKellar (from 41 citizens). To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the central role played by the arms trade in creating an environment in which wars such as the Gulf War can occur. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: (i) call on the Federal Government to outlaw sales of armaments and arms-related technology to overseas organisations, government and private. (ii) call on the Federal Government to lobby internationally, including at the United Nations, for the banning of sales of armaments and arms-related technology to unstable regions and to countries with dictatorships. by Mr Melbam (from 12 citizens). Telecom 0055 Service To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the HouseThe readily available range of sex and fantasy audio text services transmitted via Telecom through the use of the 0055 prefix.

And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Nebl (from 680 citizens). Blasphemous Language To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain electors of the Division of Cowper, draws to the attention of the House, the increasing blasphemous use of the name of Jesus Christ in movies, videos and radio and television programs. This practice is offensive to Christians who hold in reverence the head of the Christian Church. Your petitioners therefore request the House to amend controls over the media to ensure that unjustifiably offensive use of the name of Jesus Christ is restrained. by Mr Nehl (from 185 citizens). Arms Trade SBS Television: Mid-North Coast To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the fact that we are not able to receive SBS TV on the Mid North Coast of N.S.W. Your petitioners therefore request the House to take action to provide SBS TV facilities in the Mid North Coast area in as quick a time span as possible. by Mr Nehl (from 160 citizens). Pensioner Assistance To the Honourable, the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws the attention of the House to the need to redress falls in the real value of the pension relative to wages, and the need to alleviate poverty among low-income Australians. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to: (1) Increase the basic pension rate by $15 per week (2) Introduce a $20 pw supplement for pensioners with no other income (3) Increase rent assistance (4) Abolish the ""deeming"" legislation (5) Extend fringe benefits to all pensioners, and (6) Remove the $2.50 and other charges for prescriptions, in the 1991/1992 Budget of the Commonwealth. by Mr Nehl (from 127 citizens).

Ensure guidelines are followed and the State Committee permitted to meet. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Ronaldson (from 21 citizens). Redundancies: Tasrail To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament.

Estimates Committee Cutbacks To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of the Northern Territory, draws attention to the House that due to the Estimates Review committee cutbacks which have occurred recently or are expected to occur in the near future, community services such as Health Care Clinics which were previously in easily accessible areas are now only reached by public transport for the aged in the Darwin and suburban areas. With the expected increase of the public bus fares this will cause further hardship to people who are already disadvantaged by these decisions and therefore your petitioners pray that the House should take action to increase the concessions available with regard to the use of the public transport system in Darwin by the aged. by Mr Snowdon (from 158 citizens). RAAF No.7 Stores Depot, Toowoomba To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, this petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia invites to the attention of the House that: (a) Government interference in Defence Department decision making processes will lead to the concentration of Defence warehousing facilities, from somewhat decentralised locations into others that are questionable on political, cost efficiency and strategic grounds; (b) the RAAF No.7 Stores Depot, at Toowoomba, Queensland, is less than 90km from Amberley Airforce Base and 30km from the Army Aviation Centre at Oakey. It is a perfectly functioning multi-Service storage facility which could be enhanced at minimal cost and should not be closed down and have its functions relocated to Amberley; and (c) relocation will cost many millions of dollars for the construction ofreplacement facilities at both Amberley and Oakey; employee resettlement and redundancy arrangements; and unquantifiable social and community costs to the people and commerce of the city of Toowoomba. Your petitioners request that the House of Representatives require the Government to reverse its questionable directions to the Department of Defence until a full debate on the political, cost efficiency and strategic implications confirms its decision on the closure of RAAF No. 7 Stores Depot to be correct. by Mr Taylor (from 166 citizens).

Thus, reflecting the true environmental & social costs of exploitation, manufacture and disposal. by Mr Taylor (from 17 citizens). SBS: Hungarian Language Broadcasts To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The SBS Board has rescheduled the air time for language programmes on SBS Radio 3EA. As a result, the Hungarian Language Programme has been cut by half. This created serious anomalies at the expense of the Hungarian community. We do not wish to gain at anybody's expense, but we point out that, based on 1986 census data, several times smaller ethnic communities have been given more air time. We call upon the Parliament to address the grievances of the Hungarian listeners of SBS Radio. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Dr Theophanous (from 287 citizens).

3,Mr LANGMORE,COMMITTEE REPORT,"by leaveSome people are saying that they can perceive no alternative policies to those which we have at present being articulated which would ease the current economic malaise. It is true, of course, that we are in the midst of a severe recession. Over 850,000 people are unemployed and actively looking for work and at the same time the current account deficit remains high. Yet new ideas are emerging which could simultaneously increase employment and improve our trading position. Recovery will occur automatically but additional government policies could be introduced which would speed up that recovery. Faster growth and economic activity in employment can be achieved without substantially increased inflationary pressure, provided the incomes policy is maintained. A couple of weeks ago the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade tabled a report which analyses these issues and recommends new policies. The trade subcommittee which prepared that report has prepared the first comprehensive report on the Australian economy ever in this Parliament. While targeted at international economic relations, the report touches on many aspects of the Australian economy and in fact makes recommendations which encompass every industry. The current account deficit is central to our current malaise. It was the current account deficit which motivated the cuts in public outlays and the high interest rates which have dominated economic policies since the mid1980s. It is those extremely tight fiscal and monetary policies which were the principal cause of the current recession. Current account deficits have been a feature of most of Australia's economic history. However, during the 1980s the size of the deficit increased from 4 per cent of GDP to around 6 per cent. There was also a radical change in the nature of the current account deficit during the 1980s. At the beginning of the decade the deficit reflected primarily an excess of our imports over exports. By the end of the decade the deficit was dominated by our foreign debt servicing obligations. There has been an improvement during the last financial year caused by growth in our exports, particularly of manufactured goods. In fact, during the last half a dozen years, the real value of exports of elaborately transformed manufactures has grown by about 12 per cent a year. To have maintained that for about six or seven years now is really an amazing achievement, one of which all Australians can be very proud. That is a remarkable and an insufficiently recognised achievement. However, it was from a very small base and so it still does not make a sufficiently large contribution to the total value of Australia's exports. Unfortunately, though, the recent improvement in the current account was not due to a substantial decline in imports. There is a considerable risk that, as the economy recovers, the value of imports will rise again, causing renewed deterioration in the current account. Australia's overseas debt grew sharply during the last 10 years, increasing more than tenfold to $165 billion, almost 44 per cent of GDP. While this debt has not yet reached the crisis proportions evident in some countries, it would certainly do so by the end of the 1990s if debt accumulation continued unabated at the rate we have experienced, particularly in the mid-1980s. This continuing large current account deficit and growing overseas debt makes Australia more vulnerable to global economic changes. With this background, the Committee recommended a package of proposals in three parts: firstly, positive support for Australia's export and import replacement industries, particularly those adding value to our exports; secondly, measures to increase saving and to reduce our reliance on capital from overseas-to change the direction of investment in the country so that it is better targeted at industries which build up exports or replace imports; and, thirdly, changes to macroand microeconomic policies. The most important of these is the recommendation that real interest rates be lowered further. It was delightful to see that yesterday the Committee's recommendation was accepted by the Government and that interest rates were reduced by one per cent. That brings the fall in interest rates to about 10 per cent since they peaked at the beginning of last year. But during that time there has also been a welcome fall in the inflation rate of about 5 per cent so that real interest rates have fallen only by about 5 per cent. This means that real interest rates are still well above those in the countries with which we trade, despite yesterday's fall, so that Australia is still an attractive destination for short term financial flows, that is, hot money. This is one reason for the continuing high level of the Australian exchange rate. The most obvious requirement for further improvement in our trading performance would be a devaluation of the Australian dollar. One of the most striking changes which occurred during the 1980s was the perverse movement in the prices of traded and non-traded goods. This is a particularly important point. Over the last 10 years the average price of non-traded goods rose 50 per cent faster than the price of traded goods. That is partly due to the deterioration in the terms of trade, which is in large measure set by overseas forces. But it is also due to the high level of the Australian dollar and the high level of interest rates. Devaluation of the dollar would increase the incentive for investment in export and import replacing industries. A reduction in interest rates would contribute to that result as well as stimulating investment generally. That is perhaps the most important recommendation of the Committee. The Committee also recommended a more flexible interest withholding tax which could be set at higher levels, as it is in Canada, when the Government wanted· to reduce or remove the difference between real interest rates in Australia and overseas. This and the variable capital inflow tax which could be used when too much hot money was coming to Australia would give further instruments for influencing the exchange rate other than interest rates and open market testing and smoothing operations by the Reserve Bank. Use of the successful industry strategies like those for steel, motor vehicles and heavy industry should be extended into other sectors. Tripartite preparation of those strategies would enable identification of ways in which new goods and services could be produced or existing production expanded. Such assistance might include additional public investment in infrastructure, expansion of education and training programs for particular skills in demand or further support for research and development as well as the existing assistance with export development and marketing. Such increases in outlays would both increase exports and increase employment and are clearly justified even within a stance of fiscal restraint. I think it is very important that we move beyond a rather rigid approach to fiscal policy which identifies cutting outlays as the principal goal to one which sees both outlays and revenue as counter-cyclical instruments and which would be used to stimulate the economy when it is recessed and restrain the economy when it is booming. A particUlarly effective way of encouraging investment in value adding or import replacing production would be by introduction of an accelerated depreciation allowance for such enterprises. That is a policy which is strongly supported by business. It would, of course, be a well targeted way of stimulating investment in export industries and so offset some of this perverse effect of the respective movements of prices in the non-traded and traded goods areas. It would not mean picking winners. It would simply involve offering an incentive for additional investment in those industries which would be of most direct benefit in improving our trading performance. Such targeted assistance would be cost effective. Superannuation funds are becoming a major channel for Australian savings and investment, yet the superannuation funds have concentrated too heavily on investments likely to yield short term returns and have concentrated on risk minimising blue chip stock, with the effect that innovative small and medium firms have found difficulty in obtaining investable funds. The Committee therefore recommended establishment of a trade and industry development fund with one per cent of the resources of superannuation funds for use with innovative enterprises in which the returns would be received in the medium and longer term. This fund would be jointly controlled by the superannuation funds and government and would concentrate on development in the national interest. A tax exempt savings scheme should also be established to encourage additional saving. Such a scheme would also remove many retired, small savers from the tax net. There were many other recommendations but those described are high priority and give the flavour of the report. It is clear to everyone that past policies have not been adequate to simultaneously improve both employment and our trading position. The report eschews both a highly interventionist approach on the one hand and a libertarian approach on the other. Rather, it concentrates on recommending selective costeffective means of government intervention in ways which would increase the productivity and competitiveness of Australian enterprises. Such a cooperative approach is essential. The metaphor of the level playing field is inadequate when the contestants are David and Goliath. During the 1990s all parts of the economy must cooperate effectively so that relatively small and isolated Australia has the best possible chance of competing effectively with the global economic giants.",21
4,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMITTEE REPORT,"Bradfield) (9.51 a.m.)I rise to speak in support of the remarks of the Chairman of the trade subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), on the report entitled Australia s Current Account Deficit and Overseas Debt, which was tabled by him recently. I take this opportunity to commend my colleague on the manner in which he chaired a difficult and, in many respects, very far-reaching investigation of the Australian economy. To the best of my knowledge, the investigation was taken to a greater extent than any previously undertaken by this Parliament. As the honourable member mentioned in his opening remarks, the situation facing the Australian economy today is, indeed, very parlous. Therefore, the issues which have been raised in this report are particularly pertinent. The Australian economy has run current account deficits over most of its history. We have tended over the past years to take this very much for granted and have assumed that the rate of foreign investment coming into Australia would to a major extent at least manage to balance the books. Despite this, however, in terms of invisibles on current account, the position has gone from bad to worse. As the report states, the apparent structural increase in the current account deficit is a significant economic event in Australia and clearly distinguishes the 1980s from earlier decades. In fact, not since the 1920s has Australia experienced persistent current account deficits of the relative magnitude of those experienced in the 1980s. Therefore, the writing is quite clearly on the wall. The question is whether we have the courage to face up to some of the alternative policy approaches which have been outlined in this report. The position is, in fact, so serious that Australia's current account deficit is very high by international standards. Among the highest of any members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the OECD. The widening current account deficit over the 1980s also coincided with major changes to Australia's approach to macro-economic policy. Financial deregulation and the floating of the exchange rate, combined with further reductiorts in industry protection, led to heightened anxiety in some parts of the Australian community about the ability of government to take sufficient corrective action to address current account deficit problems. Sadly, it is quite clear, on the record of the last two or three years in particular, that the decisions taken by the Government in the earlier period of the 1980s to a very large degree have contributed to the current problems facing the Australian economy. The other major economic phenomenon that distinguished the 1980s from earlier periods was a rapid accumulation of foreign debt to unprecedented levels. In fact, Australia's indebtedness to the world increased more than tenfold in nominal terms over the 1980s to reach $145 billion by the end of the decade. There have been projections to the effect that if current trends continue we will be reaching a level of foreign debt of approximately $200 billion by the end of the decade-a position which is quite clearly unsustainable. The stock of gross overseas debt rose from around 11 per cent of GDP at the beginning of the 1980s to 43 per cent by the end of the decade. The level of overseas debt further increased to $165 billion by June 1991, which represents almost 44 per cent of gross domestic product. This situation therefore cannot be permitted to continue and the report contains a range of options as to what could be done in that particular context. The Opposition members of the Committee, while supporting the overall thrust of the report, do not accept some of the recommendations as presented because we regard them as overly interventionist in the Australian economic circumstances of today. We see them as mainly quick fix remedies which will not achieve the long term solutions which this nation desperately requires. As I said, the current account deficit is to inadequate national savings and inadequate international competitiveness. It is those two elements which make up the basic formula which has to be addressed if we are to improve the overall situation of the Australian economy in the long term. Putting it quite simply, the economy is in very bad shape and everybody in this nation appreciates that fact. In fact, as the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) said recently, 'We are in the worse recession since the 1930s'. As I have already stated, our international debt has grown more rapidly than any other comparable economy over recent years. Not only that; we have also surpassed all records in other measures of economic activity as well: personal bankruptcies, the collapse of the rural sector, our debt serviceability, and unemployment. The level of unemployment is now well above 10 per cent in real terms; if we take into account underemployment, it is probably around 15 per cent of the total work force. Roughly, that means that about one person in six is being affected by current economic policy and is suffering grievously because of the current state of the economy. The Treasury submission states on page 143 of the report and part of the minority report that the policy should be related to the medium term and policy instruments should be assigned to their area of greatest effectiveness. It also states: Such a framework entails the following changes: monetary policy clearly enunciated and focused on reducing inflation and inflationary expectations but remaining very much alive to the implications of settings for domestic demand; fiscal policy targeted towards contributing to an appropriate balance between domestic demand and production, particularly through its contribution to raising national savings; and wages policy aimed at restraining aggregate wage pressures to maximise employment growth and contribute to progress on inflation, while increasing labour market flexibility. As we see it, Australian society needs to be prepared to rebuild the Australian economy using a breadth of structural change which, frankly, we have not seen before in this land. The policies which the Treasury has recommended are critical to achieving that structural due change. I would like to add to its statement, however, and point out that tax reform is also critical to reforming the economy. One of the weaknesses of the report was that it did not give satisfactory consideration to that very important element. According to the Prime Minister at the 1985 tax summit, reform of the tax system is needed. We say amen to that. He said it was necessary to achieve a fairer, simpler tax system which contributed to sustained economic growth. Anybody can see that in the private sector or elsewhere in this economy the Australian tax system is not simple, it is not fair and clearly it has not contributed to the degree of economic sustainability which this nation clearly requires. For that reason, we have recommended that a broad-based consumption tax, side by side with substantial reduction in personal tax and compensation for the disadvantaged and low income earners, would help to tum our country around, provided, of course, that the existing ramshackle system of indirect taxes is entirely removed. Unfortunately, the Government since 1986 has failed to address these issues adequately. The Opposition has put forward basically 12 points for economic sustainability and most of those points, I am pleased to say, are covered to one degree or another in this most significant report. In that context, tax reform is just one of a number of measures which we propose to transform the economy. I have already stated that there are three main Treasury policies which we support. Obviously, these measures will not only reduce our current account deficit, but also they will create jobs, reduce inefficiencies make Australia a fairer society. I refer specifically to price stability. With inflation at zero or to two per cent, it would be possible to achieve an increase in exports. This would essentially mean that Australia's rate of inflation would be lower than that of our main competitors overseas. This would give us a comparative cost advantage, which is absolutely essential if we are going to increase the size of our exports and, therefore, improve our overseas debt situation. This point was emphasised so clearly by the honourable member for Fraser. Not only that, but an increase in exports is essential to help us stabilise our national debt. In terms of rebuilding financial relations between the Commonwealth and the Statesan issue which is currently on the agenda - I regret to say that the report had nothing to say of any substance on that point. Nevertheless, the removal of duplication and overlapping of services is essential. Similarly, we must reduce industrial protection while, at the same time, ensuring that micro-economic reforms are in place to reduce the overall costs of production and, therefore, encourage exports. Labour market reform is an essential element of the overall package which again, regrettably, was not covered in this report. In Australia, it is estimated that our national production will be boosted by $21 billion if we can match or beat the best international practices carried out by our major competitors overseas. The minority report, therefore, emphasises the fact that wages growth has to coincide with a continued moderation of labour costs. It says that a shift towards enterprise bargaining provides an important mechanism by which lower unit labour cost growth can be achieved through linking nominal wage increases and other costs of employing labour more closely to productivity growth. I recommend this report to honourable members. It contains substantial statistical material and will certainly add to the debate. (TIme expired)",23
5,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEE REPORT,"I am also happy to speak on this excellent report called Australia S Current and Account Deficit and Overseas Debt. I commend the Chairman and other members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for the work which they put into that report. Before I go on to the report, however, I want to say that I am rather amazed to hear the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) suggesting that we solve one problem by creating another huge problem. He suggested that the introduction of the consumption goods and services tax is going to solve the current account problem. That is like transferring one rather difficult problem to another huge difficult problem, as we shall point out when the Opposition finally does bring down its long awaited goods and services tax. In relation to this report, I say firstly that while it is true that we have had and continue to have problems with the current account, some of the analyses as to the nature of those problemS and the solutions for those problems have been incorrect. To some degree we, in the Government, have been guilty of that as well. I think it is true to say that the nation as a whole overreacted to the current account deficit with the view that there should be some considerable reduction in growth in order to control imports. Looking at the actual nature of the current account problem in Australia, however, the major problem has never been so much the The table read as followsCurrent transactions Goods and servicesMerchandiseExports Imports Balance on merchandise trade ServicesCredits Debits Services balance Balance on goods and services IncomeCredits Debits Income balance Unrequited transfersCredits Debits Net unrequited transfers Balance on current account Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics, Cat.

6,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEE REPORT,"The table shows a comparison between 1989-90 and 1990-91. It also divides up the current account into four areas: goods and services, income, and unrequited transfers. The interesting thing about this is that, in terms of the contribution which is made to the current account problem, the overwhelming proportion of the problemtradeable sector. It has been a problem in the past, but it has actually vastly improved. The irony is that at a time when the recession was brought on to deal with the problem, already there was significant improvement in the current account. I illustrate the point with a table from the report. I seek the leave of the House to incorporate this table in Hansard. Leave granted. Table 2.3 The Current Account, 1989-90 and 1991-91 1989-90 1990-91 Change between 1989-90 and 1990-91 ($ million) (per cent) 47,815 51,793 +8.3 -50,991 -49,250 -3.4 -3,176 2,543 +180.1 11,799 13,268 +12.5 -16,212 -16,723 -3.2 -4,413 -3,455 +21.7 -7,589 -912 +88.0 4,921 5,038 +2.4 -21,958 -21,917 +0.2 -17,037 -16,879 +0.9 4,518 4,711 +4.3 -2,172 -2,229 -2.6 2,346 2,482 +5.6 -22,280 -15,309 +31.3 Balance of Payments, Australia, $17 billion of what was then $22 billion in the last year for which we have the figureshad nothing to do with the trade or services imbalance, but with income shifts. Most of that was the repayment of debt. A lot of our current account problem is really not a problem about trade-at this stage it is certainly not-but it is a problem about the imbalance in terms of the debt situation and the transfers out of Australia of capital as a consequence of that. In addition to that about $2,346m is actually unrequited transfers, that is transfers out of Australia from people who are earning money in Australia, and there are other such transfers. When we look at that difference, it is very significant. Effectively, nearly $20 billion of the $22 billion was in that category. I think that shows that the current account problem is more complex. The general response, the one that was suggested to the Government by everyone-the Opposition, the community and Treasury officials-was to clamp down on the economy. Unfortunately, as some of us indicated at the time, clamping down on the economy is a difficult exercise. If we clamp down on the economy a bit too much, we could actually have a recession which would be deeper than what was originally intended. Controlling the level of the recession is not an easy matter. We have to be very sensitive as to when we are going to start reducing interest rates and when we are going to start allowing the reins off the economy so that we can allow growth. That is the issue which whoever is in government at the time, whether it be Labor or conservative, will have to made a judgment about. Never mind some of the claptrap that goes on in the Parliament about economic management. The fact of the matter is that we will have to make a difficult judgment on this issue. Of course, each of us has his view about that. I, for one, would have liked to have seen interest rates come down earlier. I am happy that they came down yesterday, but I believe that we have to monitor that situation quickly. If the response is not adequate, we should be looking again at a further cut in interest rates. In my estimation, in Australia interest rates have still not come down sufficiently. Having said that, I also want to indicate that I believe it is time that we had a very good look at the manufacturing process. This report is excellent from that point of view because it makes a number of very important recommendations. I suggest that the Government look at those recommendations and take some of them on board as quickly as possible. In the area of manufacturing, it is time that we looked again at significant improvements in depreciation allowances specifically targeted for manufacturing and, in particular, for export industries. If we really are interested in doing something about this area, we should give a kick-on to our export industries by doing that. I believe that if we did that, we would really be making a very immediate and positive contribution both to investment and to export orientation. In addition to that, I am very happy to announce that today we are introducing the Sales Tax Amendment Bill (No.3). There are usually a lot of them. What is significant about this particular Bill is that it is taking up an announcement made in March but, in my view, again it is taking too long to come before the Parliament. This announcement is of a very important nature. It is saying that once this Bill is passed into law, all inputs into the manufacturing, and many agriculture processes, including things such as office equipment or stationery in the office-not just raw materials-will now be exempt from wholesale sales tax. That is a very important matter. As a nation we should have done something about wholesale sales tax a long time ago. We have talked so often about the so-called level playing field but we have not levelled it; we have put our manufacturers further down in the playing fleld and allowed importers free kicks. By bringing in these measures we can achieve the changes which I have mentioned: depreciation allowances; changes to the taxing arrangements so that everything that goes into the production process can be exempt from wholesale sales tax; and additional measures. The most important additional measure has got to be the encouragement of investment in manufacturing in the production process. I commend the recommendation in this report which talks about the formation of an investment fund. It is time that we looked very hard at the bodies most involved in saving-, such as superannuation funds, and asked them to make their contribution. They can do this through the formation of a fund which will be most involved in investment in the manufacturing process. We are not talking about the Government picking winners here; we are talking about a general fund whereby these bodies can invest in whatever manufacturing processes they are interested in. It seems to me that it is time that we at least got away from this total free market approach and said, 'Let us have investment in manufacturing'. (Time expired)",26
7,Mr MACKELLAR,COMMITTEE REPORT,"As we have heard, we are debating the repOlt entitled Australia s Current Account Deficit and Overseas Debt. At the start of my remarks, I would like to commend all those associated with the main work in compiling the report, particularly the staff, who have to do such an extraordinarily difficult and important task in getting the material together, corralling all the members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade as effectively as they can, and producing the draft, which is then eventually gone over by the members of the Committee. It has been a very far-ranging inquiry, the number of submissions has been good and, in many cases, the length and the complexity of the submissions required a great deal of careful analysis. As honourable members would know, I am a signatory to the minority report because, in my view, the statement that we make accurately sums up the situation. It reads: In our view Australia needs urgently a comprehensive program of policy reform to effect fundamental change to boost national production, productivity, exports and savings. We do not believe that this emphasis comes through in the (Committee's) report. The honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) in his contribution-the honourable member for Berowra, in his other manifestation, is a professor of economicssaid: ... this country needs urgently an across-the-board program of reform to effect a fundamental change in attitudes, the law, institutions, attitudes to performance and work. We have to strive in every corner of the land for best international practice, and also reassert what one might call traditional, individual and corporate morality. I say 'Hear, hear!' to that. I am sure that a number of honourable members on both sides of the House would adhere to those views. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in his contribution in the previous manifestation of this debate also referred to a number of issues which, we believe, point to the need to look more comprehensively not only at the analysis, but also at the means of responding to this very serious situation that the nation finds itself in. Of particular concern to me was the emphasis in the report on what I would regard as several excessively interventionist remedies. For example, recommendation 11 asks the Government to establish an industry and trade development fund whereby all superannuation funds are required to lodge one per cent of all new assets from 1 January 1992 in the fund. The fund is to be used to provide loans to priority investments in accordance with a series of industry development strategies. The second recommendation-I regard it as interventionist and wonder how it could be implemented-is recommendation 21, which states: Government seriously needs to consider mechanisms that forceI underline the word 'force'individuals and enterprises to forgo current consumption in favour of compulsory savings ... I also underline the word 'compulsory'. The recommendation went on to indicate a number of measures that could achieve this, including a superannuation surcharge and investment bonds. As honourable members would expect, the Opposition totally rejects the use of force and compulsion to achieve targeted economic goals. I strongly believe that they are anathema to the Australian people. We have seen many examples around the world where they have been tried and have failed dismally in almost every socialist country that has been established. It seems to me that the single greatest problem facing Australia-and one that is not sufficiently considered or addressed in this report-is our inadequate international competition and the associated role of productivity. I am talking here not just about employee productivity, but about both capital and human productivity, with the latter ranging over all levels from management to the shop floor. I am not one who castigates the Australian worker for not working cleverly or hard enough; I think that we are all in this together. I think Australian management must bear a very great proportion of the blame because of attitudes and practices which, I believe, have not been conducive to a proper working environment-one which would encourage the maximisation of productivity of the whole enterprise, not just the workers on the shop floor. There seems to be a very great need for better management practices and employee and employer relationships to be developed if we are to achieve that maximum productivity which, I think everybody would agree, we must have. The magnitude of the problem facing Australia is enormous. One of the great things of this report, leaving aside the dispute about the recommendations, is the wealth of factual material contained in it, which I believe will be of very great use. It will be a rich source of information to those who have an interest in this area. As other contributors have said, there really is no quick fix to these problems. I particularly recall the right honourable member for New England talking about the need to look at the medium and longer terms rather than just concentrating on the immediate. I believe that there are a number of areas we should be looking at as a nation. I have already mentioned productivity. There is no real analysis of the exchange rate in this report. At present a number of commentators around Australia would point to the exchange rate that the Australian dollar is currently operating at as a real factor in the prevention, move: or slowing down, of the recovery that we would all like to sec take place. I have a firm view that, if the exchange rate were lower, this would be of great assistance to our export industries and would also have the concurrent effect of slowing down the emphasis on imports. I realise that the current thinking on both sides of the House is to let the exchange rate float, although even the current exchange rate is slightly dirty in its floating. There is no doubt in my mind that if we had a lower exchange rate it would have a very great impact on our capacity to export and would at the same time reduce the willingness or the impetus to import. I think we should also be looking very closely-of course, the Opposition has put a great deal of emphasis on this-at the industrial relations area. If we could get that right and sort out the massive inflexibility and industrial relations problems which beset Australia we would be doing a very great deal to overcome some of the problems which have been so explicitly set out in the report. I would like to mention in passing that I do not think that Austrade and the other associated groups which are alleged to assist Australian exporters do anything of that order at all. I have been extremely disappointed in the slow response and the inadequate performance of both Austrade and the AIDe, as well as the others, which allegedly exist to assist exporters. I think that they need, if not elimination, then a massive reorganisation. I do not think that they are doing their job at all. Finally, I re-emphasise the great worth of the submissions which have been detailed in the report; there is a wealth of material. Again, I thank those people who have been associated with the report's production. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! 'The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA",28
8,Mr HOLLIS,MINING ON ANTARCTICA,"I That this House: (1) notes that 39 nations recently signed a Protocol banning mining on Antarctica for 50 years; (2) notes with pleasure that this Prot-col came about as a result of an initiative by Australia's Prime Minister in 1989 to set up a World Park in Antarctica; and (3) urges all nations to respect the fragile environmel1t in Antarctica and so preserve it for future generations. I ask honourable members to imagine a view of untrampled beauty, of stillness; a view incredible beauty as far as the eye view encompassing the most incredible colours; a land of dramatic sunsets and rises. All this, and more, is Antarctica. ever-increasing search for minerals, some people have argued that Antarctica should mined. Not satisfied with cutting down forests or desecrating some of the most beautiful and fragile parts of the world, miners have cast their covetous, greedy eyes to the last remaining wilderness-Antarctica. Imagine the scene described above with great overburden of mining waste. Imagine the whiteness spoilt forever by or the silence of Antarctica pierced by the noise of mining activities. Recently the 39 nations of the Antarctic Treaty formally banned mining for 50 years in this, the last wilderness continent. Andous tarctica has been designated as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science. The Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty mental Protection is a substantial advance by treaty nations in seeking comprehensive protection for the Antarctic as the last great wilderness on earth. The Protocol prohibits any activity relating to mineral resources, other than scientific research. On 22 May 1989 the Prime Minister Hawke) announced that Australia was opAustralian posed to mining in Antarctica and would not sign the minerals convention; instead, it would work towards developing a comprehennone. sive environment protection convention for Antarctica. The Prime Minister said the Government believed that it was both Our desirable and possible to seek stronger tion for Antarctica. He said that Australia would work within the framework of the Antarctic Treaty system to obtain consensus among consultative parties on the establishment of Antarctica as a wilderness park, while seeking also to strengthen and prolong the moratorium on mining in Antarctica. Australia's concern for the environmental aspects of the Antarctic is reflected in its current science program. It is interesting that in a world dominated by conflicts, of comscientific peting and conflicting ideologies and selves. philosophies, long before there was interof national cooperation in other spheres there can see; a was cooperation on Antarctica. I know of no-one who has visited Ansuntarctica who supports mining there. I know In our that some people who supported mining before they went to Antarctica changed their be minds after visiting the area. Many members rainof this House have visited Antarctica. Regardless of where we are in the political the spectrum, those of us who have visited the frozen land are totally opposed to mining. Indeed, who could support mining when a looking across the fragile landscape and seeing the incredible beauty and colour of this huge oil spills, frozen continent? Of course, there are many arguments against mining. I do not believe that the economics of mining would stand close scrutiny. I draw attention also to the tremeninfrastructure that would be required, the harsh and changeable weather and the transport difficulties. There are also economic on Environand legal arguments involved. Antarctica is the last clean place of any size left on earth. How long it can stay that way is questionable because there will most likely be increasing numbers of tourists, ships, garbage and pollution in general. Already there are elements of pollution there. I pay (Mr tribute to the clean-up measures of the Government at our Mawson, Davis, Casey and Law bases in Antarctica. I believe that our record in Antarctica is second to I must say that when I was in Antarctica, as well as visiting the Australian bases I visited the Chinese and Soviet bases. protection of the environment was better protecthan that practised at those bases. For those reasons I am opposed to tourism in Antarctica. There is little tourism in the Australian part of Antarctica, but last summer 17 ships operated from around the Antarctic peninsular on the South American side and two worked out of New Zealand to the Ross Sea. According to an article in yesterday'S Australian Financial Review there are already problems with overcrowding. Tourists pose a danger to wildlife, to fragile ecosystems, to work and, not least of all, to themThat is something that people do not realise. When these so-called adventurers go to Antarctica, it is usually persormel at the Australian bases who have to rescue them when they get into difficulties-as, indeed, most of them do. When I was in Antarctica in early 1989, the Argentinean supply vessel Bahia Paraiso, with tourists on board, sank causing a major oil spill. To look out, as I did at that time, over the beautiful white landscape and to try to .imagine it spoiled and stained by oil or, indeed, by mining waste, was a very frightening and sobering experience. This spill alerted all those people concerned about the integrity of the Antarctic environment to the compounding dangers implicit in mining activities, particularly those relating to transportation by sea. Another aspect which we should consider is that any ships coming to Antarctica to pick up freight or minerals would have to have ballast. As we have found on the south coast of New South Wales, ships from Japan and other places which come to ports such as Eden to-unfortunately-Ioad woodchip release their ballast into the water. Ballast water has an effect on the environment, and it has had an impact on oysters in the Eden area. If ships brought ballast to Antarctica and released it into bays it could well affect sea life. Another matter to take into consideration is the tremendous infrastructure that would be needed if any mining activities took place. Despite having safeguarding measures, it is inevitable that spills will occur. Bad as the spill was from the Argentine ship, the whole world was shocked two months later when, on 24 March 1989, the Exxon Valdez disaster occurred off the Alaskan coast. It is interesting to look at the clean up measures that were undertaken at the time. Although there was some delay in undertaking the clean-up measures after the Exxon Valdez disaster, those measures were actually taken. They were taken because people could actually get in there and carry out the clean-up. They could get the equipment in there. In the Antarctic there are parts that cannot be reached for, say, 10 months of the year. When I was there in 1989 we were stuck in the ice for some three weeks. Ships on the first resupply trip of the year go to the ice edge, which could be up to 200 miles from the mainland or from the bases. Even in later trips-in fact as late as the January tripships may only get within 20 miles because the ice is still there. As honourable members can imagine, if an oil spill had occurred in that area it would have been impossible to even get the equipment there, and it would take at least 14 days from Hobart to get to our bases, depending on the weather. As the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) knows, it can well take more than 14 days if the weather is not kind. During those 14 days the weather can change very suddenly and very dramatically. It is frightening to think of any oil spill, or any damage to the Antarctic, because it would be impossible to get there speedily enough to clean it up. Many kinds of pollution are cleaned up gradually by a natural process. An oil spill, damaging though it is, evaporates to some extent. It breaks down or it degrades gradually and finally disappears. We all know that this does not happen quickly and that before it degrades it often causes a tremendous amount of harm. Chemical processes tend to slow down as temperatures drop, so in cold weather the evaporation and degradation of the spill is slow. At the very cold Antarctic temperature the rate of evaporation and degradation may only be one-hundredth of what it is in warmer climates. Spills of this sort may make their effects felt for a full century or more. If the continent of Antarctica itself is largely a frozen wasteland, the waters around it are the richest reservoir of life on the planet and they support the familiar large animals of the far southern seas-penguins, gulls, seals, dolphins and whales. The sea is also rich in krill, which unfortunately is being overfished by the Japanese and others. If we damage the region badly, which even with the best will in the world mining and tourism would inevitably do, we tear an enormous hole in the fabric of the planetary ecology and cause damage elsewhere. Antarctica is without doubt the world's greatest !wilderness. This vast land and its surrounding seas are dominated by nature, by cold and wind, ice and snow. The continent itself is barren-in fact it is the driest continent on earth-and Antarctic wildlife depends for its survival on food from the ocean. Humans can exist there only with outside support. In such a place many countries have decided to establish bases in which people can live and work. They have done this for many reasons, but predominant is the desire for understanding. Antarctic research has brought new life to great questions about the earth, about its geophysics, its geology, its ecosystems, its atmosphere and its place in the universe. It has also provided the world with an unprecedented opportunity for cooperation between people of many nations in the peaceful pursuit of knowledge. The Antarctic region is valuable to the people of Earth because of its ecological role and as a mine of information useful to science. In addition, we have a responsibility to try to protect and preserve the Antarctic in as pristine a state as possible. This is not too high a price to pay, and the scientific and environmental integrity of Antarctica is infinitely too valuable to lose through inactivity or in the name of dubious short term economic enrichment. As I have said in this motion, I pay tribute to the fact that Australia has played such a leading role in the protection of Antarctica. I know Australia did not do it alone. In the early days it was a very lonely path-we had only France for company, and I sometimes wonder why it was France because of what it did in Dumont D'urville on its own base, putting in an airstrip. That was not being particularly protective of the environment. Nevertheless, the French Prime Minister at that time, Mr Rocard, and the Australian Prime Minister led the campaign to preserve Antarctica when Mr Gorbachev annoWlced at a meeting in Moscow in January 1990 that the Soviet Union would also support Antarctica being a wilderness park. Then gradually, but with some reluctance, the Americans came on side, although they still have reservations and sometimes one wonders about their commitment. There has been some criticism that the Madrid Protocol lasts for only 50 years and will then be renegotiated but, given the difficulty that has been experienced in reaching that agreement and the fact that it does last for 50 years and will be re-examined at the end of that period, it is a significant step forward. Some people would argue that mining should have been banned in Antarctica forever-and that is my personal view-but tremendous steps have been taken and there has been a significant amount of cooperation. This has always been the wonderful thing about Antarctica-whatever nations the scientists and the other people come from, they do cooperate. This shows that when there is an overriding purpose people can cooperate. We on Earth have mined, farmed and raped much of the world. We have done tremendous damage to this planet. Surely there is one place on Earth that can be left in its pristine state for the benefit of everyone and for future generations. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Is the motion seconded? Ms MCHugh-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",29
9,Mr NEHL,MINING ON ANTARCTICA,"It is with pleasure that I speak about Antarctica and the motion of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). The honourable member commenced his contribution in a most eloquent and poetic way and continued in that stream by then talking about the miners casting their covetous, greedy eyes over Antarctica. I suggest that it is a complete load of nonsense to castigate the mining industry of Australia or the world by saying that they were casting their greedy, covetous eyes over Antarctica. We all know that there are resources in Antarctica of some kind or another. We know there is coal. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) and I have handled coal from the Prince Charles mountains; we know it is there. We also know of the great difficulty that would be involved in any mining. I think we should start with the stage completely bare and look at what has happened in view of the realities; and the realities are that it is most unlikely that there is going to be any mining in the foreseeable future. That does not mean that I do not totally applaud the action of the Antarctic Treaty nations in signing the Madrid Protocol-it had to happen. I would also like to comment about the opposition the honourable member for Throsby has to tourism. I cannot totally agree with him. After all, we have a continent 2 11z times the size of Australia-a magnificent continent; everything he said about it is absolutely - orrect. But I am afraid that, while I emphaslse that we must take absolute care and exercise great caution, I do not think there is necessarily a case for the elitist view that only the privileged, only the chosen, should be allowed to experience what takes place in Antarctica. The honourable member for Throsby and I, and many other members of this Parliament, have been privileged, have been fortunate enough, to have visited Antarctica. I have been twice-I went in 1986 and again this year-and I count it as a great privilege in exercising my duty as a member of this House to be able to visit Antarctica and see what Australia is doing. Mr Snow-Who went with you?",32
10,Mr NEHL,MINING ON ANTARCTICA,"The honourable member came with me-and survived that stann off Heard Island. Again the honourable member for Throsby was correct when he talked about the incredibly dangerous weather and environment that exist. I was making the point that I do not believe we should be exclusive or elitist. If people have the opportunity of visiting Antarctica under correct, controlled conditions, I do not think we should take steps to prevent them from doing so. I am also surprised at what the honourable member for Throsby did not say in his speech. The motion consists of three parts. The first: ... notes that 39 nations recently signed a Protocol banning mining on Antarctica for 50 years. I accept that without query or quibble. The third part: . . . ur.ges all nat-ons to respect the fragile environment m Antarctica and so preserve it for future generations. Spot on! I give the honourable member for Throsby 100 per cent on that. But the second part, which he hardly touched on at all: . . . notes with pleasure that this Protocol came about as a result of an initiative by Australia's Prime Minister in 1989 to set up a World Park in Antarctica. What a load of rubbish! .What a load of posturing I And the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) does not need the help of the honourable member for Throsby to posture on the world stage. Only yesterday we saw what the Prime Minister did in presenting his report on his performance in Harare at CHOGM. But he did not make any reference to the British press reports of 'a foul-mouthed little man'. The Prime Minister of Australia comes into this chamber time and time again claiming to have achieved this, that and the other. I believe we will have the statement on employment next week-another 'world's greatest', for sure. I am surprised that the honourable member for Throsby did not live up to my expectations and sing the praises of the Prime Minister, even though his motion does so. In reality, in this country there has been a bipartisan approach to working for the protection of Antarctica. I do not want to pass up the opportunity of telling honourable members that in fact it was the National Party of Australia that was the first major political party in this country to adopt a no-mining stance on Antarctica. I take credit for being the one who led the fight at the 1988 National Party Federal Conference to get that adopted as policy. I am pleased also to say that our Liberal colleagues came in very quickly in support of that stance. But what happened with the Labor Party Government? !\VA weeks before the Government was due to sign the minerals convention, it was dragged in screaming and changed its mind. However, I am delighted that it did change its mind, that common sense did prevail and that it was able to follow the lead of the National and Liberal parties. Ms MCHugh-We were following your lead.",33
11,Mr NEHL,MINING ON ANTARCTICA,"The Labor Party should be following by lead, and I am delighted that it did. Two weeks before the Australian Government - as to sign the first minerals convention, it changed its mind. I am delighted that it did that. I am even more delighted that on 4 October 1991 in Madrid 39 nationS signed the Protocol to protect Antarctica from mining for 50 years. I am equally very pleased that there will be no work on mineral research whatsoever, except for scientific purposes. I believe that is important. I underline the fact that this Parliament, comprising people from all parties, has done so much to make the world aware of the need to protect that wonderful environment of Antarctica. The honourable member for Throsby made passing reference to krill. I know he is aware of the problems associated with its harvesting. This incredibly delicate animal is the basis of the food chain in the very rich Southern Ocean. It is very high in protein and, although there are difficulties in using it, it is being harvested. The honourable member for Throsby made reference to Japan and other countries which are harvesting krill. I believe the Soviet Union is harvesting 90 per cent of the total catch and Japan would probably come next, but other countries are harvesting it as well. The biomass research program, which was set up in 1977, has finally come up with some first-rate results. In Hobart on 1 November 1991 an agreement on Southern Ocean fishing was signed by the 21 member nations of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CAMLR. The krill is a fascinating creature. One of the problems with using it is that the shell has excessive quantities of fluoride, which makes it difficult to use for human food. Also, because of various enzymes in its bodily make-up, it starts to decay very quickly and must be processed within three hours of being caught if it is to be used for human consumption or within 10 hours if it is to be used for fishrneal or other processed food for animal consumption. We do not even know how long krill live, so it is very appropriate that the biomass research program was set up. A lot more work still needs to be done, because we do not know how productive krill are, how many there are, or what they do in winter. But they are still fished on a fairly massive scale and are the most fished crustacean in the world. Regrettably, most people do not know a great deal about them. The krill fishery is the thirtieth largest fishery in the world. In the Great Southern Ocean the krill fishery is four times as large as the other fisheries combined. It is also interesting that once the shell is removed, if the tail is blanched, it ends up about the size of a grain of long grain rice. So we are not talking about an individual animal which is large in size, but in the very great masses in which they are found they are a very significant resource for the food chain in the ocean. We have to look to the long term future and not allow overfishing and overexploitation. That is why I am particularly pleased that in Hobart on 1 November we reached an agreement on Southern Ocean fishing which said: A precautionary catch limit on Antarctic krill in the South Atlantic, including the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Georgia areas, where fishing is currently concentrated, has been set at 1.5 million tonnes in a fishing season. The estimated volume of krill is 150 million tonnes, so we are looking at one per cent as a possible catch. I can go along with that, but it will need very careful monitoring to make sure that the resource is not overexploited, because it is of great significance to the future of the world. I am also concerned that, in terms of the research being undertaken in Antarctica, we continue on an international basis to research the hole in the ozone layer. The massive hole, now some 20.7 million square kilometres, has now opened for the third year in a row. As most honourable members would know, ozone is a molecule which is made up of three oxygen atoms. Its major function in terms of life on Earth is to protect us from ultraviolet rays and the consequent risk of cancer in humans and animals and damage to crops. The research must continue, and I certainly compliment the United States space agency, NASA, for being very instrumental in the work that,is being done and for the information that is being provided. In the short time left to me, I must very complimentary comments about the work being undertaken by the Antarctic Division, which conducts the Australian bases at Casey, Davis and Mawson and, of course, a perThe manent base at the sub-Antarctic island Macquarie Island. The work being undertaken by the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition, ANARE, I believe, is absolutely first class. ANARE is looking at a whole range of activities. It is looking at plant seals, sea birds, algae and mosses. Cosmic research is being undertaken at Mawson, which is the only place in Antarctica where this sort of research is being undertaken. Antarctic continent is a pristine laboratory, absolutely beautiful, absolutely superb, ocstage casionally terrifying and certainly ment that nobody should treat carelessly. It is an indication of the history of this world. I mention in particular the work of Dr Quilty, the Assistant Director, Science, Antarctic Division, and the various people who have been working with him at Marine Party. Plain in the Vestfold Hills out from our station at Davis. A couple of seasons ago, Quilty discovered the fossilised skull of dolphin, which discovery was of great sigindividuals nificance. Because dolphins are warm water mammals and not necessarily found in AnAntarctica tarctic waters, it is a further indication of great change that has taken place in the climate of Antarctica. I had the very great thrill in February this year of being with Quilty, again with my friend and colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow). We were able to look at the fossilised skeletons of whales which had been found at Marine Plain. This is extremely valuable work for the future of the world, and I commend and compliment the Antarctic Division. If from occurring. there is ever any suggestion of cutting back on the funding for the Antarctic Division, we should unite, and support and extend, in a bipartisan fashion, the work that is being done, because Antarctica and its future vital to the future of this wonderful world ours.",33
12,Ms MCHUGH,MINING ON ANTARCTICA,"As Exxon seconder of the motion moved by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), make I am very pleased indeed to speak in its support. I am absolutely delighted to find us falling all over ourselves trying to take credit for the wonderful thing that has happened. bipartisan approach is really superb and, as the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) said, it must last into the future. It is an understatement to say that the mining ban now in place has been a long time coming. The Madrid Protocol, which bans mining, is life, the result of a phenomenal amount of work by ray many dedicated Australians. As the motion correctly states, the Protocol came about as a result of an initiative by Australia and the The commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to take the proposal onto the world and to argue forcefully and convincingly an environfor its introduction. Here in the Parliament, I wish to acknowledge the work of those who fought so Pat hard for this Protocol-and I add to those of the who fought so hard the member for Cowper and those who were with him in the National It has certainly paid off, as the objective has been achieved: mining is now banned Dr on the Antarctic continent and the world park a concept will become a reality. While many and environmental groups have been arguing the case for the protection of for years, the issue in the mind of the the public received most publicity in early to mid-1989. At that stage, Australia was in the process of debating whether or not it should Dr sign and ratify the Convention for the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities, CRAMRA. This Convention would have permitted mining in Antarctica, albeit strictly controlled. But, as we have seen in so many cases, strict controls do not prevent accidents and environmental catastrophes The honourable member for Throsby spoke of the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster in Alaska. Strict controls did not prevent it from are happening. The result was an incalculable of amount of environmental damage to the marine environment-damage we are still trying to repair today. The Chairman of had to apologise to the entire world in newspaper advertisements. The disaster underlined the fact that, in minerals and oil exploration activity, there is a very real risk of accidents and ensuing damage to the environment. The argument, in fact, can be boiled down to the question: should the world start mining in Antarctica and take the risk that if there is an accident there will be no damage to the environment? Many answered yes. In fact, it was said thatCRAMRA reduced any possible risks to minute levels and that the world needed to gain access to the mineral resources in Antarctica. The perceived economic benefits outweighed the risks, so it was claimed-and there were some greedy eyes cast on the mineral resources of Antarctica, because they are quite extensive. There are minerals besides oiL There is copper, chromium, platinum, lead, zinc, silver, tin, gold, coal and iron. But of course oil is the commodity needed most. As there is a world oversupply of coal, there is certainly no need to go to the Antarctic for it. But if the Alaskan tragedy proved one thing, it was that the risk was simply not worth taking. Antarctica is often said to be the earth's last great wilderness, indeed a wilderness continent of beauty and fragility. To risk its future would be unacceptable and would betray future generations. Previous speakers have discussed the global significance of the Antarctic environment. Those who argued this view point in this Parliament and other forums are the ones we must congratulate. Australia, back in 1989, was in a position to use its influence as a major nation involved in Antarctic policy to protect that continent forever. If we did not sign CRAMRA, then it would not be implemented. Many said we should sign the convention because, if we did not, mining would go ahead anyhow. I remember all the arguments very well indeed. Mining would at least be controlled, it was said, and Australia would at least be in a position to bring pressure to bear on those nations likely to mine to ensure they did so in a responsible manner. But those who rejected the whole concept of exploiting the Antarctic for its mineral resources kept their eyes firmly on the vision of preserving the continent as a world park. I would like particularly to acknowledge the work and commitment of the conservation groups and, in fact, of two former members of this House-Bob Chynoweth and Peter Milton. Both of them wrote excellent and convincing papers that were distributed to all members of this Parliament. Both had an enonnous love of the Antarctic, having been there as my colleagues have. I am one who has yet to go there, and I have wanted to go from when I was a very small child. The major groups that were involved, of course, were Greenpeace, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition and the Wilderness Society, all of whom lobbied strongly and vigorously to protect Antarctica. Their campaign was magnificent. The thousands of people, too, who made up those groups and campaigns told those who said that the Antarctic world park was an impossibility that, in fact, it was possible. There is an enormously important message there to be got through to the rest of us. Certainly the odds were against it but, so long as it was possible, then we as a nation had to do all within our power to make it a reality. There were those in this House and there were many in my own Party who thought we should sign the mining Convention, if for no other reason than they thought the world park proposition just was not a realistic option. For arguing the case in favour of protecting Antarctica so convincingly in this Parliament, we have to thank again Peter Milton and Bob Chynoweth. Peter Milton, in fact, was the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts. That Committee, while he was Chair, put out a report on tourism in the Antarctic to which I would like to refer the honourable member for Cowper. It says quite specifically: The Committee does not accept that the Antarctic experience should be reserved for the privileged few who are involved in Antarctic research and the establishment and maintenance of support facilities or others because of their distinguished visitor status or their positions in administration. The Committee supports tourism to the Antarctic provided it is conducted within a regime which ensures proper protection of the wilderness values of the continent. The report that Peter Milton put out goes into the sort of regime very thoroughly. Abandoning the Convention was seen as a first step in the process for achieving the world park. Once that was defeated, the world park option became a realistic possibility. The decision made by the Government on 22 May contained a statement which said in part: Australia will not sign the Minerals Convention, but instead will pursue the urgent negotiation of comprehensive environmental protection convention. Eighteen months later the Prime Minister acknowledged in a policy statement that: ... the Minerals Convention was based on an illusion-the illusion of human infallibility in a region which hosts the most delicate and fragile ecosystems in the world. Australia's step not to sign the Convention was decisive. Soon after, as the honourable member for Throsby detailed, to its credit the French Government expressed its full support for our position. Over the next 15 months nations across the globe joined with Australia and France. Belgium in June 1989, Italy in September 1989, the Soviet Union in January 1§G0, et cetera, followed soon afterwards, and eventually 39 nations joined Australia's initiative. The diplomatic work necessary to encourage these nations and those which followed should not be underestimated. The Prime Minister himself, the Australian Ambassador for the Environment, Sir Ninian Stephen, as well as numerous senior officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade all deserve the credit and support of this Parliament. The achievement of a 50-year mining ban, and the environmental protection which will follow, was a lengthy but certainly worthwhile process. What started as a vision, what seemed an impossible vision of an Antarctic world park and nature reserve, will now become a reality. The success of those who turned their vision into a reality should encourage others who face similar obstacles to persist with their arguments because, as with so many environmental disputes, the arguments in favour of conservation as against exploitation are eventually proved to be the correct arguments for the long term. I would like to quote a short paragraph from Peter Milton's report, Tourism in Antarctica: The Antarctic is a unique region; the last remaining continental near-pristine wilderness containing unique terrestrial and marine ecosystems and a scientific laboratory of global significance. . . Pollution in the marine environment as well as on land a has the potential to cause major disruption of the entire ecosystem. In the low temperatures and ice conditions that prevail, wastes can persist for long periods without decomposing, resulting in long term pollution. High winds may distribute waste material over extensive areas. Because of infinitesimal growth rates, a footprint made in a moss bed may still be visible ten years later... Can we imagine mining in an area where a human footprint can last for decades? I congratulate everyone involved.",35
13,Mr HALVERSON,MINING ON ANTARCTICA,"Casey) (11.03 a.m.)It is a great pity that the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has chosen to word his motion in such a manner as to ensure that the Opposition parties cannot agree with, or support, at least part of it. We have no difficulty with parts (1) or (3), but part (2) certainly does pose some problems. To claim that the Protocol to the Antarctica Treaty on Environment Protection came about as a result of an initiative by Australia's Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in 1989 to set up a world park in Antarctica is not only absurd but demonstrably incorrect. One can only guess at the misguided motivation behind this diabolical suggestion. As already pointed out by my colleague the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), the coalition parties recognised the need to preserve this environmental wonder of the world, and had taken positive steps to achieve that objective, including prohibiting mining, long before Labor realised the Antarctic continent was anything more than ice, wind and penguins. The coalition has always been united on this issue. We have firmly and decisively led the way with the divided Government ranks stumbling and bumbling along behind, trying hard to catch up. Eventually they saw the light, the green light, and adopted our policy. It is fUtile for them now to try to claim it as their own, for the record proves conclusively that any such claim is false. Part (2) of the motion of the honourable member for Throsby must therefore be rejected. However, part (3) is certainly deserving of bipartisan support. In February 1988 I was fortunate to visit Antarctica in my role as a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. It was an awe-inspiring experience. One is overwhelmed by the vastness, the majestic grandeur of the ice scenery, the isolation, the magnificent, untamed and as yet largely unspoiled natural splendour of this last great wilderness frontier, this last great sanctuary where large, wild populations of mammals and birds can live, feed and breed in their natural environment. Antarctica is breathtakingly, dramatically and ruggedly beautiful, and at the same time fragile, delicate and very vulnerable. This area of very special significance presents some enormous challenges for present and future decision makers, who must choose between preservation of the unique Antarctic environment and exploitation of its potentially vast reserves of natural resources. This is not a matter of identifying and then carefully treading a fine line between protection and destruction. When it comes to the Antarctic there is no fine line; there is all or nothing. Once it has gone, it has gone forever. As the well-known British naturalist and artist Sir Peter Scott once said: We, who share the earth with all other living things, must not squander the heritage of future generations of life on earth. Perhaps Antarctica is our last chance to demonstrate that we are capable of heeding this advice. We have already squandered so much of our precious natural heritage, sometimes irretrievably, and often without realising what we have done or properly appreciating the long term consequences of our actions. The Antarctic continent is one of the last places, if not the only place, left on Earth where so far nature has been able to hold out against the determined onslaught of humans. Its isolation and its harsh and unforgiving environment have so far kept it relatively safe. But for how much longer? We must ensure that we do not waste or ignore the opportunity nature has itself provided for us, an opportunity to take the necessary action to preserve and protect an irreplaceable part of the heritage of future generations. The Antarctic is the coldest, highest, windiest, driest, wildest and most dangerous and inaccessible continent on Earth. It is therefore hardly surprising that it was the last continent on Earth to be discovered and explored. It is one of the most desolate and isolated regions in the world. It has never been settled, and its hostile climate and terrain make permanent settlement unlikely. The Antarctic land mass, close to 14 million square kilometres, is almost twice the size of Australia. It covers almost one-tenth of the earth's surface and is almost entirely covered in ice. The coastline measures 31,900 kilometr-. As much as 98 per cent of Antarctica is buried under an icecap, with an average depth of four to six kilometres. Although the Antarctic icecap holds 80 per cent of the world's fresh water, it is in fact the driest continent on Earth with a slightly lower rainfall than the Sahara Desert. Summertime temperatures rarely rise above minus 30 degrees centigrade, whilst winter temperatures average below minus 60 degrees centigrade. Coastal areas are warmer, with summer maximums rising to above zero, and winter minimums at minus 30 degrees. The winds which blow from the high polar plateau to the coast frequently reach speeds of 120 kilometres per hour. Each year in winter the Antarctic doubles its size, and then halves itself again during summer. The belt of pack-ice ranges from four million square kilometres to 22 million square kilometres, depending on the season. The ice is constantly moving, with speeds of between one and two kilometres per year having been recorded at the front of the ice shelves. In such a harsh environment the likelihood of accident and environmental disaster is greatly increased. One major careless accident is all it will take to destroy the delicate Antarctic environment. Every minor accident has the potential to cause irreversible damage to the fragile Antarctic ecosystem, perhaps even resulting in total destruction of some fonus of animal and marine life. Already several species of whales, seals, birds and fish are threatened or near extinction. We must remember that we do not yet know a lot about Antarctica; therefore our ability to accurately predict the possible impacts of commercial resource exploitation or other serious disturbances or stress to the ecosystem is very limited. In many instances we can only guess at the hanu we may do. Although human presence in the Antarctic region has, in comparison with most of the rest of the world, been relatively minimal and limited so far, already the pollution and other damage caused by man and modem technology is significant. In the areas around many of the existing research stations, coastal waters have already been used extensively dumping rubbish. In many cases human waste goes directly into the ocean, and oil slicks, caused by ships pumping out their bilges accidental spills, are becoming far too comminerals. mon. In February 1989 a massive spill 950,000 litres of oil from the Argentinean supply vessel Bahia Paraiso had disastrous effects upon one of Antarctica's richest and seal habitats. Exhaustive efforts Argentina, Chile and the United States clean up the oil slick and miilimise environtation. mental damage not only proved very difficult but also prohibitively expensive. At the moment Antarctica provides a unique example of successful international, political and scientific cooperation. Australia is one the nations involved in deciding the potential economic, scientific and environmental future of this ice-bound, but resource rich, continent. The Antarctic Treaty provides the primary legal framework for decision making in the region. It resulted from a collective research effort organised by the International Council of Scientific Unions which singled out Anthe tarctica for special scientific study during 1957-58 International Geophysical Year. Treaty was signed in 1959-although it did not actually come into force until 1961-by 12 countries which had an active scientific interest and involvement in Antarctica. They have since been joined by 14 more countries with consultative party status, with a further 13 non-consultative parties. Any country may become a party to the Treaty. The Treaty was originally designed to prevent competition over the region. It stipulates that Antarctica should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and not become the scene or object of international discord. No military bases may be established there, and nuclear explosions and disposal of radioactive wastes are prohibited. The Treaty also encourages international scientific research to be conducted by temporarily solving the problem of sovereignty. Freedom of access to the entire continent was guaranteed and there was provision for the exchange of scientific infonuation and personnel. Although the Treaty provided a basic for framework for protecting the environment, it did not expressly cover the possibility of exploitation of commercial quantities of or natural resources, particularly oil and Over recent years there has been a of growing awareness that any mining or oil drilling operations would pose one of the greatest threats to the future of Antarctica and bird the surrounding oceans. In the harsh and by unrelenting Antarctic environment, mining to would lead to certain pollution and devasGeologists have already identified a number of important mineral resources in the region, including gas, oil and coal. Although it may seem impossible to mine in a continent which of is twice as cold as the Arctic, in darkness for six months of the year and accessible by sea for only a few short months, one only has to look at what is happening with mining in Alaska to understand that the seemingly impossible may be possible if there is sufficient motivation or promise of considerable economic gain or reward. In the 1970s, when Convention of the Regulation of Antarctic the Mineral Resource Activity was initiated, it The may have been appropriate to predict and prepare for the exploration and exploitation of the potential mineral wealth hidden under the Antarctic ice, but in the late 1980s people started to question the wisdom of allowing mineral exploration or mining activities in the last great wilderness on earth. I would like to conclude with the words of James Barnes, an American lawyer specialising in international environmental law, co-founder in 1977 of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition and a member of the US State Department Advisory Committee on Antarctica. He said: There has never been a more urgent need for people to stand up and declare their intention to protect this extraordinary region. Antarctica can become a symbol of hope to all people, a living reminder of human ability to preserve its past, present and future, and to live in harmony with nature. I am confident that this sentiment is shared by honourable members on both sides of this House.",37
14,Mr KERR,MINING ON ANTARCTICA,"This debate on mining on Antarctica gives us an opportunity not only to reflect on the pristine wilderness of Antarctica, which my friend the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), who travelled with me to Antarctica shared on our voyage, but also to make some reflections about morality and courage. One of the tragedies of political life is that success does not always go to those who show greatest morality and courage. 1\vo people who are not with us today were cast aside by their electors at the last election on issues that do not relate to Antarctica. Those electors would probably never have reflected on the consequence of setting aside .Bob Chynoweth and Peter Milton from this Parliament. It is sad because the measure of those men, in tenns of the lasting contribution they have made to Australia in any substantial way, is that they changed around an almost predetennined view on one of the most important issues that has ever faced the world. It is from the spark of courage from those two-against overwhelming odds-that most of us in this House took the view that probably the best measure in all the circumstances, given all the constraints, was to sign the minerals convention. It was a view that was shared by people who have very strong environmental credentials: the then Minister for the Environment, Graham Richardson, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). Those men were not regarding the environment lightly; they fonned the view that the best we could get out of this situation was to sign the convention. As the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh) said, they kept their eyes firmly on a vision. With many ordinary Australians behind them, they were able to persuade, first, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and, through him, the Government, and then, strangely, the world community, that we would set aside Antarctica forever. That is extraordinary because those two men who are no longer with us are not able to be here today in any way to savour what I would have thought would have been oneof the greatest victories this country can claim internationally. If we reflect on it, when all of us go very few will be able to say, as they can, that we contributed to this victory. Without their activities some decision of that monumental nature would not have been made. I think it is sad that they are not with us. Let us tum to another instance where courage can make a difference. In this case, the Prime Minister showed courage. It was by no means certain when Australia set upon its course of trying to persuade world opinion that it would be possible to draw together a coalition of nations to set aside Antarctica for wilderness, heritage and science. Many scoffed when the Prime Minister took that view; many were sceptical. Until France became involved in the effort, we were the lone international voice. Many other countries joined with France, but until only the most recent months the most powerful nation in the world, the United States, stood out against that international consensus. It was eventually drawn in. Today we have an opportunity to reflect on a moral question-a. question of courage, which should spark a flame in all of us. Each of us can hope in a small way by determination, by belief in issues of principle, that one day we will be essential to some important decision which will benefit the long tenn, the world and the future of this planet, as Peter Milton and Bob Chynoweth did so well. I certainly .wish them well in their retirement. (nme expired)",40
15,Mr SINCLAIR,MINING ON ANTARCTICA,"There is no doubt that any opportunity for this House or this Parliament to debate issues pertaining to Antarctica is to be welcomed. This is Australian territory. As several honourable members have said, it is an important part of the ecological systems of the world. It is an area about which few Australians know very much. Because of its remoteness and pristine beauty it has attracted the imagination of all those who have visited it and all those who know a little of it. For that reason, we need to look at it and work out where we are going and where we are. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you introduced the motion-although you are sitting in another role at this time. I say to you that as you found it necessary to introduce paragraph (2) it is indicative of the fact that even in a matter of some seriousness and importance the Australian Labor Party finds itself unable to resist pursuing parochial factional politics. The whole concept of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) having had anything good to do with Antarctica is rubbish. Let us start off on that precept. Frankly, he has been one of the players who has contributed only because of the position he has held. As the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has said, frankly, until France participated, the concept of a world park-which I still have very strong reservations about-did not even get off the ground. There are several parts to the however, and the other two certainly are matters which deserve the support of the House. I must admit that I still believe that the mining convention was a better way to go, although I believe the idea of imposing a ban for 50 years is excellent. But we need to realise that setting up a marine park does not guarantee the sanctity of the place. We have just seen those appalling incidents in Dubrovnik in the past few weeks. We need to understand that France was one of the countries that encouraged the establishment a marine park. It has not shown exactly same concern for some of the island states and areas of the South Pacific. As a number of us have'said on other occasions, if France wishes to pursue underground nuclear testing-and I can understand the reason why and indeed support the force de frappe, as it is called-I would be far happier were it to pursue that within continental France. There is no reason why it cannot do so. If it is not going to do any harm to the environment, why do it in the South Pacific? But that is another issue. There are a number of issues I want to mention but, as I have only two minutes remaining, frankly I cannot say a great deal. But I want to mention two. I feel very strongly about the move to take the huskies from Antarctica. The huskies have made a tremendous contribution in that part of the world. Those who are trying to advocate their withdrawal do not seem to understand that the huskies still have a capacity that no machine enjoys. They have saved the lives of so many of those who, when traversing that very fragile Antarctic area, have found that their huskies have suddenly stopped because they have known, they have sensed, that the ice over which they were travelling was too fragile. From my point of view, the huskies should stay. There is justification for their remaining. There is no longer any reason to kill seals or animal life in Antarctica in order to feed them; Australia has not done that for a long time. I urge the Government to review that nonsensical decision in that respect. Mr Snow-It is not a Government decimotion, sion; it is under the Treaty.",41
16,Mr SINCLAIR,MINING ON ANTARCTICA,"Those opposite have had a great deal to do with it. They supported it and they need to understand that, if they are not prepared to stand up on a matter like that, it illustrates what nonsense there is in that part of the world which is Australian Antarctic Territory. I just commend the Australian Antarctic Division. It does a great job, and I respect its work so much.",41
17,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINING ON ANTARCTICA,"Mr Hollis)of Order! The time allocated for this debate has the expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order \of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA  move: That the House refer to the Committee of Privileges for inquiry and report the question of whether certain Government Members of the House were subjected to intimidation or improper interference on account of action or statements by Mr Bill Ludwig of the Australian Workers' Union in connection with the recent Government leadership challenge. On Monday, 3 June I raised with the Speaker, pursuant to standing order 96, a matter of privilege based on news reports concerning comments made by a Mr Bill Ludwig, the Queensland Secretary of the Australian Workers Union. Mr Ludwig was reported in many places to have said that if certain Queensland parliamentary members of the Australian Lahar Party supported the unsuccessful leadership challenge by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) then those members would lose their preselection. After considering the matter, on 5 June the Speaker advised the House that he was not prepared to grant precedence to a motion to have the matter referred to the Committee of Privileges. To underpin the seriousness of the matter, I point out that the conduct of Mr Ludwig prima facie contravenes section 73 of the C-imes Act, and that his threat, if complied With, would destroy the very essence of our representative system of government. In giving his ruling the Speaker said, amongst other things, that a complaint of alleged intimidation or improper interference raised by a third party-such as myself-does not provide a good foundation for action in this area. I disagree, for reasons I will state a moment. He also noted that if such allegations were raised by a member who had been the subject of the relevant intimidation or improper interference, he would be disposed to seek the advice of the Committee of Privileges as to the proper course that should be followed. I regard his ruling as contrary to the law an- practice of parliamentary privilege. It is entirely proper for a matter of this nature to be referred to the Committee on the instigation of a third party. In this respect, honourable members who have been subject to the intimidation may not be willing to raise the matter for fear of retribution. Indeed, I would have thought it my duty as a member of the House to respect and uphold the rights and privileges of the House. It would be a gross dereliction of duty on the part of the House if appropriate action were not taken. In this particular case it may well be that the honourable members concerned, as I say, are reluctant to raise the matter for fear of retribution. This is borne out by public comments made by Labor members, the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler) and the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). In the event that I go further on another day, I will provide appropriate details of those statements but, for present purposes, I would simply highlight the following: firstly, on 1 June the honourable member for Leichhardt has said that he was 'totally dissatisfied with the interference of the AWU, the union in Queensland'; and secondly, on 4 June the media reported that the honourable member for Hinkler has acknowledged that he may face retribution for his decision to support the honourable member for Blaxland in the leadership challenge. Furthennore, notwithstanding the fact that a matter of privilege had been raised and put before the Speaker, Mr Ludwig continued to make public statements about this matter and amongst other things, Mr Ludwig has beereported as saying that the honourable member for Hinkler may well have problems in retaining preselection. Those comments if true, may even amount to a further conte-pt in of Parliament on the part of Mr Ludwig. When he gave his ruling on 5 June, the Speaker indicated that he was 'not aware of any exact precedents for the matters complained of'. We know the power of the House to punish for contempt is a general power, one not restricted to the punishment of breaches of acknowledged or established heads of privilege. The real question must be resolved by having regard to the provisions of section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 which pose an objective test. The question is whether the relevant conduct was intended to have, or was likely have, the effect of interfering with the performance by a member of the member's another, duties as a member. Furthermore, there numerous cases in which matters have been referred to the Committee of Privileges on instigation of a third party. In March 1951 House referred to the Committee a question involving party directions as to the conduct members. The matter was raised by an honourable member who was not a member of the party involved. Two similar precedents can be drawn on in the British House of Commons-which we do draw on. The cited case involving Mr W.I. Brown was originally raised by another member, Mr Byers, in March 1947. There was a similar case in 1944 when a matter was referred to the House of Commons Committee of Privileges involving a member, Mr Robinson. That matter was originally raised by another member, Sir Herbert Williams. In all the circumstances, it is my submission that the matter under present consideration should be referred to the Committee so that we may have the benefit of its advice and of its guidance. That is what it is there for. Having regard to the precedents which exist, to which I have referred, and their possible relationship to section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act, we are faced with a serious and, indeed, unique claim of privilege, and one that ought to be tested. Those who control the business of House gave me the opportunity to bring on today-they did so a week or so agomoment, because I had put this motion before the House back in June. Some may think that does not have a relevance to events. Oh, yes? Anyone listening to the AM program this morning on the ABC would have heard about the donnybrook that is going on within the Australian Labor Party. On that program senior members were at one another's throats and doing all they could to humiliate each other-members of the Cabinet and members of the party organisation, particularly Mr Ludwig's own Queensland division. While most Australians will be appalled to that, at a time of economic crisis, all the free Labor Party can do is wreak havoc on one the fact is that this is only a precurare sor to what is ahead-a drawn out, down in the gutter, base political brawl over who the should lead the Labor Party. To hell with the the national interest! Do not worry about the broad national good; do not be concerned of with more than a million unemployed; to hell with those men and women who are finding it difficult enough just to make ends meet! No-we are going to be preoccupied with who the hell should lead the Labor Party to often defeat at the next election. This is about personal ambition, nothing more and nothing less. Honourable members can forget the speeches. There is no philosophic difference. It is all very well the former Treasurer warning the Labor Party that it has got to pay attention to the millions unemployed. Who was responsible for the economic program that brought that about? The Treasurer himself, until he resigned. This is just an old fashioned power play. In the midst of a national crisis, where the well-being of most Australians is up against the wall, that sort of issue is being thrown aside. Threats regarding endorsement that I referred to back in June are relevant again now. Who was here on Tuesday in this very Parliament? None other than the State Secretary of the Queensland Labor Party, Mr Wayne Swan, heavying the Queenslanders as Mr Ludwig did only a matter of months ago. the The honourable member for Petrie (Mr this Johns), who is not in the House at the has already been marked for extUlction, to be replaced after redistribution it because of his support for the honourable contemporary member for Blaxland. This show that is going on within the Labor Party is one of the grubbiest deals that we have witnessed-a power play in the midst of harsh economic times. As I say, to hell with the national good! That would be bad enough at any tinlC but particularly when there is such a crisis in the Australian community. It underlines just how bad it is when important economic issues are being put to one side simply' to argue about leadership within the Labor Party. That is why the relevance of this referral to the Committee was stark and correct in June and it is correct today. It compels a reference if in fact the threats are being regurgitated through Mr Swan, as well as Mr Ludwig. It is a tragedy, when there is so much besetting the Australian nation, that all we have emanating from the Labor Party at the present moment is this personal power play, accompanied by threats to members about their endorsement if they do not vote for one or another. Mr Sharp-I have pleasure in seconding the motion moved by the honourable member for Kooyong and reserve my right to speak.",41
18,Mr SNOW,COMMITTEE OF PRIVILEGES,"In a lO-minute speech of superficial innocence, the honourable member for Kooyong  He skipped over the essential elements of the Parliamentary Privileges Act, particularly section 4, and he has skipped over the Speaker's verdict even on the case he mentioned, the Brown case. For him to try to put up here that someone can successfully threaten the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler), the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) and the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) is a bit like saying that the honourable member for Kooyong has never been involved in shady deals for leadership. The honourable member for Kooyong referred to the actions of Mr Ludwig. The honourable member failed to show that there was any offence. What section 4 says is that conduct must amount to an improper interference with the free performance by a member of the member's duty as a member. So it is more than interference-and it would need to be. It is interference with free performance. Of course, that interference can happen to varying degrees and has been a continuing facet of political life in the history of democracy. The honourable member for Kooyong was twice Leader of the Liberal Party. I recall when he became Leader the second time there was a discussion on a Four Corners program which showed some amazing elements of interference leading up to his coup over the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). He won the leadership and the Four Corners program made it pretty clear that there was interference, but was it improper? The interesting and frank discussion on FOllr Corners showed how confusing it can be when determining whether interference is improper or not. We had the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) saying he was involved in the pressuring of members and he told the honourable member for Kooyong. We had the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) saying that he was involved and when the tussle was on he told lies. To add to the confusion, the honourable member for Kooyong said that he was innocent. He said, 'Nobody told me'. The honourable member for Ryan said, 'I told Peacock'; the honourable member for O'Connor said, 'I told lies'; the honourable member for Kooyong said, 'Nobody told me'. As a member of the Committee of Privileges of the House of Representatives, I know that we frequently apply the precedents of the House of Commons when considering matters. The Speaker rejected a request by the honourable member for Kooyong to have this matter referred to the Privileges Committee. Mr Speaker particularly noted on 5 June 1991 that 'arrangements made within political parties were unlikely to give rise to matters of privilege or contempt'. Mr Speaker went on to describe the way in which members 'are subject to representations, urgings and pressure as to their positions'. He said: ... as a general rule, the House should not attempt to intervene in arrangements made within political parties. If an honourable member came into this House and sought the protection of the House from Mr Ludwig or Mr Tuckey or anyone else, the Committee of Privileges ought to be able to consider the matter, but that has not happened this time. TIlls time we have a third party, the honourable member for Kooyong, that a member of the Opposition, alleging intimidation of members on the other side. It is interesting to see the reaction and recall the reaction of Mr Speaker on 5 June 1991 when he said: But I do not believe that a complaint of alleged intimidation or improper influence raised by a party is a good foundation for action in this area. We can go back to 9 November 1983 when Mr Speaker Jenkins cited the very case that the honourable member for Kooyong cited, the case of Mr Brown, MP, in 1947 when the House of Commons Committee of Privileges stated: Your Committee think that the true nature of the privilege involved in the present case can be as follows: It is a breach of privilege to take or threaten action which is not merely calculated to affect the Member's course of action in Parliament, but is of a kind against which it is absolutely necessary that Members should be protected if they are to discharge their duties as such independently and without fear of punishment or hope of reward. Does anyone think for a moment that the honourable member for Petrie, who has been a Labor Party organiserMr Johns-A member for 19 years.",44
19,Mr SNOW,COMMITTEE OF PRIVILEGES,"A member of the Labor Party for 19 years. Does anyone think that he is going to be threatened by someone who says to him, 'Vote this way or that. '? The honourable member for Petrie will, I am sure, tell us if and when he feels such a threat. Then the Committee of Privileges may well deal with the matter. Does anyone think for a moment that the big, burly honourable member for Leichhardt would feel pressured by someone who says something like that to him? Obviously not. If he does, then no doubt he will tell us. I have had a lot of association with the honourable member for Hinkler on some fairly tough issues, including resource security for the timber industry and on other issues. Not for a moment would I think that he would feel threatened to the extent that he was unable to discharge his duties independently and without fear of punishment or hope of reward. I believe we need again to emphasise section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. It clearly states: Conduct (including the use of words) does not constitute an offence against a House unless it amounts, or is intended or likely to amount, to an improper interference with the free exercise by a House or committee of its authority or functions, or with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member. The question we have got to ask is: is this third improper interference with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member? There is no evidence of that. The honourable member for Petrie is performing his functions as a member of this House in the most impeccable manner. He is freely performing his duties as a member, as are the honourable members for Leichhardt and Hinkler. I reject the assertion of the honourable stated member for Kooyong and support the decision of the Speaker in rejecting the request. It is interesting that in 1983 Speaker Jenkins quoted former Speaker Morrison of the House of Commons, who expressed the view that the activities of Whips and the usual channels had never been regarded as a breach of the privileges of the whole House. Speaker Jenkins also quoted Speaker Selwyn Lloyd of the British House of Commons, who said: In general, I think that arrangements made within political parties in this House would be unlikely to raise questions of contempt or privilege. Speaker Jenkins said: He declined to accord precedence to a motion on this matter - - - Also on 9 November 1983 Speaker Jenkins said: . . . I draw the attention of the House to the opinion of the House of Commons Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in its 1967 report and, in particular, its recommendation that the House should follow the general rule that its powers in respect of privilege and contempt should be exercised (a) in any event as sparingly as possible and (b) only when the House is satisfied that to exercise it is essential in order to provide reasonable protection for the House, its members and its officers, from such improper obstruction or attempt at or threat of obstruction as is causing, or is likely to cause, substantial interference with the performance of their respective functions. This is sound advice indeed, and in 1978 was adopted by the House of Commons and is now a principle guiding that House, its Speaker and its Committee of Privileges in these matters. It is a principle which should in my view be observed when we consider all matters of privilege and contempt, whether or not involving possible breaches by honourable members or other persons. Madam Speaker Child made similar decisions. When a matter was raised with her on 16 September 1986 she said: . . . no actual evidence has been placed before me of what might be regarded as either obstruction or intimidation. 'The honourable member for Kooyong has also failed to bring forward any matter which can be regarded as obstruction or intimidation. To sum up, Speaker MCLeay has also said: . . . in so far as all parties are concerned... numerous discussions' are held and arrangements entered into between individuals and groups of individuals. . . as a general rule the House should not attempt to intervene in so far as arrangements within and concerning political parties are concerned.",45

21,Mr JOHNS,WATER RESOURCES,"I move: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) water is one of Australia's most valuable resources; (b) its use, treatment and availability vary enormously throughout the nation; (c) there is debate as to whether this resource is managed sufficiently well so that the water available to the next generation will be at least as good as that currently available; and (d) together, water and sewerage activities involve total employment of 35 000 workers and $2 billion worth of investment annually; and (2) calls on the Government, in conjunction with the States and other authorities, to: (a) consider how Australia can achieve more efficient and environmentally sound use of its water resources; and (b) develop a national strategy for sustainable water quality management. Mr Beale-You are hiding in here; that is what you are doing.",46
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WATER RESOURCES,Mr Hollis)Order! We will not have any interference. The honourable member for Petrie will continue with his remarks and ignore the unhelpful interjections.,46
23,Mr JOHNS,WATER RESOURCES,"My lips are sealed on all matters other than water. Part of the motion states: (a) water is one of Australia's most valuable resources. Further on, it calls on the Government, in conjunction with the States and other authorities, to: (a) consider how Australia can achieve more efficient and environmentally sound use of its water resources; and (b) develop a national strategy for sustainable water quality management. I draw to the attention of the House three excellent Federal Government initiatives relating to sustainable water management. I will then go to what I call a 'tale of three cities', which is three different illustrations of initiatives that will enable better water management in Australia. The first is a Commonwealth report of the Australian Water Resources Council entitled An A WRC Strategy for Water Quality Management. It is a discussion paper of March 1991. The key element of this report is that future generations should-be able to rely on the same water resources of the same quality as the current generation. The sustainability of Australia's water resources is the key strategy which Australian governments must adopt. We must always avoid use by sectional interests to degrade our water quality; that is, if a local council competes for industry by offering an industry in one region the ability to further pollute its streams and water sources as opposed to those of another council, that sort of activity must be stopped. We have to use national powers and agreements to stop that. The second report by the Industry Commission of July 1991 is entitled Water Resources and Waste Water Disposal. Here the Industry Commission, as ever, is looking for means or devices by which those who manage our water resources can better do it, for efficiency, savings on infrastructure costs and the protection of the environment. That is the second initiative that the Government has taken. For instance, this report looks particularly at the cost of water used by households; access of water by farmers and industry; options to use water more efficiently in the home, in industry and on the farm; the provision of water-related infrastructures, such as dams, drainage and sewerage facilities; and water quality. The third Federal Government initiative is that of the Ecologically Sustainable Development Working Groups, which in its draft report states that many of the environmental problems associated with water use can be addressed through the following sorts of policies. It recommends: that Governments introduce pricing structures for water which encourage efficient use and reflect the full cost of administration and distribution; that this be accompanied by full transferability of entitlements-between land holders. . . between and within States and between irrigation and other users, including recreational and users; I will now give three illustrations of how, in three instances, we are achieving a much more intelligent use of water resources and better protection of our water resources. The user pays concept has not always been well accepted by honourable members on this side of the House. In 1982 the Hunter Valley region was experiencing drought. The Hunter Water Board was considering building a fourth dam to service Newcastle and the Hunter region. Rather than go to the enormous cost of building that dam, a user pays system, a metered system, was introduced for water to households and industry rather than the old method of charging, which was just a flat and basic tariff. This can harm poor people if they happen to be left on a fairly large property where they are not using a lot of water but are being charged a large rate because they hold a large property. In 1982 the Hunter Water Board introduced a variable charge, It charged people for the amount of water they used. People's immediate reaction was very effective: they stopped using so much water. So powerful was it that Newcastle and the region literally 'browned off'. People stopped doing the sorts of things that they normally did. However, once people adjusted to the user pays principle, the pricing, there were amazing results. This has occurred since 1982, so we have a proper example of how better pricing of water resources brings decent results in terms of efficiency and equity. I will work this through. Consumption was predicted to drop by 20 per cent but, in fact, fell by 30 per cent. There was a significant reduction in peak day demand by as much as 50 per cent. The savings brought about in water consumption did not put the fourth water source-the Tillegra Dam-off for five or 10 years; it has now been put back to about 2024. The building of an entire dam has been put back 30 years because people are using water more sensibly by means of a pricing device. As an illustration of this, in the late 1970s within the Hunter district the residential urban consumption of water-averaged across all sorts of properties-was 270 kilolitres, moving up to 280 kilolitres and then to 290 kilolitres per property, when drought hit that region. The restrictions that the Hunter Water Board had to apply at that time of drought in order to save water reduced the consumption of water to about 250 kilolitres per household. That consumption moved back slowly as the Hunter region came out of drought. The introduction of rating based on the use of water has meant that consumption has now dropped to about 200 kilolitres to 210 kilolitres per household. What is more, it is continuing to decline. We are suggesting, firstly, that in the early 1970s there was a runaway use of water by individuals-a wasteful use of water. This would have led to the building of a fourth dam which, ill itself, would have been costly and environmentally destructive. Secondly, physical limits on the use of water were imposed to save water through time of drought. Those physical limits reduced the consumption of water. However, they have not had anywhere near the impact of the pricing system, which has now taken consumption right down to about 200 kilolitres to 210 kiloiitres per household. I think this is a sensible use of a pricing policy to bring about an environmentally very sound outcome. That is illustration one. The second illustration concerns water use in Melbourne and Victoria. A very recent study of the Department of Conservation and Environment in Victoria titled Water Victoria: The Next 100 Years considers ways of better transferring water around Australia for different uses. It talks about a market or trading in water which would allow, once again authorities to put off further huge and destructive capital works in Victoria by making better use of existing water supplies. The report states: After only 150 years, Victoria is already over halfway towards the full utilisation of its water resource. If water development and water consumption continue to grow at traditional rates Victoria will have developed all of its availablwate; wit-in 35 y-as and be up against a 'brick wall . SOCIal COnflICt, generated by the exorbitant financial costs of dam construction and the resultant environmental damage, will erupt in coming decades if we follow this traditional path to water development. We are not talking about a pricing device here. It is suggested that certainly in the Melbourne CBD, there is sufficient cost recovery to pay for any works associated with water reticulation. However, what is being suggested is a water trading scenario. This involves a management framework in which urban and irrigation water authorities trade water entitlements in a bulk water market extending across Victoria. Of course, I would hope that in time this might extend across State boundaries. Urban and irrigation authorities would be encouraged to buy and sell their entitlements, like any other comhad modity, in the marketplace. The report states: Under this water trading scenario, urban areas of .the Great Dividing Range purchase water ent-tl-ments currently hel- by northern irrigators. ThIS IS the cheapest optIOn for supplying extra water to their growing populations. In this market northern irrigators receive a sum of money for thek entitlements which exceeds the dollar amount which could be earned if the water is used to pasture. ! do not know how this will work out, but is recommended, although not in such detail, by the Ecologically Sustainable Development Working Groups. They are recommending more flexible, intelligent means of using water resources: one, a pricing method the second, a trading method. The third m;thod is instanced by a discussion of a very advanced waste water treatment technology proposed for the Hastings district around Port Macquarie, which, as ever in these matters has been developed and commercialised by the CSIRO. It is a suggestion for a small scale waste water treatment technology which could be applied outside cities to regions, smaller towns and so on. It is called the vertical flow wetland technology. As is noted in the discussion paper, that technology is tailor made for thousands of smaller communities and households throughout Australia which are struggling to treat sewage and other waste water in a way which avoids an explosion in their rates and also meets the increasingly stringent environmental standards for effluent disposal that are now being adopted. I find great joy in the manner in which the Commonwealth is moving to pull together those who have responsibility for the management of water in the nation and is helping to direct them to ways in which we ca.n maintai- a very high quality of water Without havmg to continue to destroy the environment through very large treatment schemes or extra dams and reservoirs and so on. We ought to be very flexible about how we achieve that end. In one example, that of the Hunter Water Board, we have a pricing mechanism which environmentally sensible outcomes. They were very sensible in that they put· off very large capital expenditures. The second south example was that of the potential fora water trading system which will have a similar environmentally beneficial outcome. The third - xample w-s of the technological fix, if you like, that ffilght allow a more benign treatment of waste water in the locality. By and large grow the problem in respect of the treatment of waste water in our cities is not a technological it on.e but one of transportationwe simply ship the stuff out to sea and dump it. This is not a very intelligent way of cleaning up waste water. CSIRO is seeking more intelligent ways of doing that. To finish up, in my home town of Brisbane we need to install water meters so that it becomes possible for me as a landowner to put in my own water tank. If I am going to outlay a couple of thousands dollars for a water tank, I must be able to save the money by not using water from the reticulated water system. It is possible to do that. I hope that the Brisbane City Council can achieve that. (Time expired)",46
24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WATER RESOURCES,Is the motion seconded? Mr HuJls-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,49
25,Mr ANDREW,WATER RESOURCES,"I welcome the oppOltunity to participate in this debate on water resources and to support much of what the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) has had to say about water conservation, water management and the maintenance of water quality around Australia. However, I want to put things into a rather more national perspective than the urban perspective of the honourable member for Petrie. It is something of a coincidence, Mr Deputy Speaker, that earlier this morning you and the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) participated in the debate on Antarctica. While there is a popular opinion that Australia is the driest continent in the world, as we discovered this morning in comments made by the honourable member for Casey, this is not true at all; the driest continent in the world is Antarctica, and Australia is the second driest. To illustrate just how dry our continent isI if we are to give a national perspective to this need debate-if we were to build some sort of watertight wall around Australia and retain within the continent all the run-off resulting from natural precipitation, we would finish up with a continent covered by water five centimetres deep. If we were to do the same thing with the next driest continent in the world-the African continent-and contain all the water within that continent, we would finish up with a lake 17 centimetres deep. Australia is an exceedingly dry continent and, as the honourable member for Petrie has pointed out, there is a desperate need for a responsible national perspective in the way we manage this scarce resource. In fact, as Australians we have been very casual about water use. I am told the average Australian consumes something like 530 litres of water a day. We can compare that with the usage of the Aboriginals who occupied this nation before us; they could live on 1.5 litres of water a day. While I do not want to bore the House with a run through the Neil Andrew morning ablutions, I confess that this morning I trotted in from my Narrabundah residence and so I had occasion to shower in Parliament House. As the water was cascading over me I wondered how many water outlets there were in Parliament House, so I checked the Parliament House directory. After a quick calculation, allowing for my mathematical error, I found that in this building there are something like 2,500 taps in one form or another, 1,300 water valves-I am not sure of the differentiation between a tap and a water valve-18 water displays located in the gardens around the House and 36,000 sprinkler heads. That is amazing. This is the dependence that we have on water in this building, let alone the demands that we as a nation place on what are, as the honourable member for Petrie pointed out, very confined and limited resources. I am participating in this debate as a South Australian. Without being unkind to the honourable member for Petrie, whose remarks I largely support, I thought that much of what he said was, in national terms, motherhood. happen to think it is fundamental that we some form of user pays system if people are to be responsible with what is a scarce resource. Without dismissing what the honourable member said, I thought that in that sense it was elementary. I am here as a South Australian who believes in user pays, because my State is entirely dependent on one source of water, the River Murray. I am here as a South Australian concerned about the quality of water that currently flows down the River Murray. I am here to endorse-in the words of the honourable member for Petrie-the need for a national strategy on the way we go about our water management. Lest the Government imagine that, as a member of the Opposition, with the convenience of being in opposition, I am pleading for some grandiose scheme and enormous expenditure of money, I say it is not that at all. It does not take much to sort out the way we manage this valuable and scarce resource in the second driest continent in the world. I reflect on the famous words of a predecessor of mine, Mr Bert Kelly, who, every time he saw an enormous national dam being constructed-he was particularly critical of the Ord River scheme-said that there must be an election around the corner because he could feel a dam coming on. There is always a temptation for governments to do something that is grandiose in order to capture the national imagination, but we can change our attitude to water conservation without grandiose schemes, and that was outlined by the honourable member for Petrie. Much can be quietly achieved in water conservation. Let me illustrate from a country point of view what can happen. The honourable member for Petrie has already said what can occur from an urban perspective. We do not have to be very imaginative, or outlay enormous sums of money, to have tree planting programs that can really sort out the salinity levels in our streams. Much of the problemnot all by any means; not even a majoritywith the River Murray occurs because, with good intention but poor information, we have cleared surrounding land. The millions of trees that once lined the river and lined the Mallee and were all in their own right little water pumps picking up saline inflows and discharging them through the respiration process have gone. Instead, the water moves through the aquifer, unchecked by tree roots, picking up salinity that has accumulated in the aquifer and taking that saline water into the river basin. We do not have to be very clever to be involved in a tree planting program, nor do we need enormous sums of government money. In the process, we can minimise the saline inflow that is currently doing so much damage to the streams that all of our cities, but particularly Adelaide, are depending upon. Neither do we need do a great deal to rehabilitate the irrigation areas that are currently so dependent on our streams. Consider what happens if we simply provide each irrigator with a tax incentive to ensure that he or she is prepared to go from the extremely wasteful flood irrigation technique into the much more efficient distribution of water by dripper, microjet or overhead sprinkler, as the case may be. When the Liberal and National parties were in power there was nothing more than a 125 per cent tax deduction that dramatically changed the way in which irrigators went about sorting out their irrigation practices. This Government, for no good reason, rubbed the tax deduction out. As a result, it dramatically influenced the standard of water in South Australia and the capacity of irrigators, squeezed by the rural decline, to go about some form of rehabilitation themselves. It does not need much imagination to have the odd tax incentive which will not capture the voter imagination, but will do something about the standard of water currently flowing into our streams. As I said, I am a South Australian. I am astonished that the water source on which I am totally dependent carries 1.4 million tonnes of salt to the sea each year. From where that water flows over the border between South Australia and Victoria to the sea, the water picks up an additional 600,000 tonnes of salt. That means that if we stand beside the River Murray for 15 minutes and watch what is happening 24 tonnes-or a semitrailer load-of salt will effectively flow past our eyes. It has been too easy for parliaments to say, 'Well, that is what the irrigators are doing to the River Murray; they are the people who are mucking it up'. That is nonsense. The reality is that the Murray has always had a saliriity problem because the catchment area of the Murray was once a vast inland sea. Much of the saline load of the River Murray results from the fact that the water that flows mto the River Murray picks up saline water from what was once the basin a vast inland sea. Much of the salt load in river is the result of that flow. In the 1860s, before irrigation was even considered in River Murray basin, one of the inlets was called Salt Creek because the early settlers found it so saline. During the 1914 drought, when irrigation had still not expanded to what we know it as today, the salinity level at popular. Morgan in South Australia was 10,000 EC units. In 1990 the average would be about 1,000 EC units, falling to about 500 EC units-in 1914 it was 10,000 EC units. If we look at a graph of river salinity Morgan we discover that over the past decade river management has never been better, salinity levels have rarely been lower, even though the popular line peddled by the vironmentalists, who simply want to embarGovernment rass irrigators, would suggest that the worse water that has ever flowed down the Murray flows down it now. That is not true. damentally, much of the salt load in the river comes not from irrigation but from what collected as a result of the river having been fed by a vast inland sea. I compliment the Government for picking up an initiative of the Fraser Government and installing the Woolpunda scheme, in which natural saline inflows that come into the north and east of the River Murray basin are intercepted by 49 bores. Those bores pick up these natural saline inflows, which in cases come up into the river basin from below, and pump them out to an evaporation basin. A person standing at the evaporation basin and watching the water flowing out of the pipe is seeing water that has never been seen before by a human eye, because thousands of years ago it fell to the north and scheme. the east of the river and it has taken thousands of years to percolate slowly through those saline basins and finally make its way into the river. I come from a State dependent on a water resource that needs to be cared for, and in House in which I stand the Australian Labor Party is the Government, and it is currently the Government in Queensland and Victoria. It has a great opportunity, as the honourable member for Petrie has said, to maximise its of chances to coordinate water management the around Australia. It will not find this side of the House in any way frustrating what it is the trying to do. If the Government is seriously prepared to do something about water quality, it does not have to outlay enormous sums of money; it merely has to have the political will to do what is responsible, even if it is not I appreciate what the honourable member for Petrie said about urban water quality, and I agree with him. But I can take him to River Murray towns of 4,000 people where sewage at ponds are still located adjacent to the River Murray. I do not have much doubt that the  Fisher) can do the same thing 'in his elecentorate. It is an indictment of the Labor that in 10 years nothing has been done to put those sewage ponds out of the flood zone. That is the sort of thing that it has Funhad 10 years to do something about; but nothing has happened. The result is that every is downstream community on the River Murray once collects the sewage from an upstream community. That is Third World stuff, yet we still have it in Australia. I agree with the honourable member for Petrie on water pricing. I have watched water pricing work for irrigators. The only real frustration irrigators have with a user pays principle is that in many cases what they are many picking up is the cost of inefficient government schemes. They would happily install their own pump, lift water out of the river and put it on their own properties, and they would do it more efficiently and at cost. They are irritated only by the fact that they are saddled with the cost of a government I agree with what the honourable member for Petrie said and with the interjection picked up by the honourable member for Mallee: the Government needs to encourage urban residents to install rainwater tanks so that they this can go about their own form of water conservation. The honourable member's point about water meters is fundamental. I would have thought that everyone in Australia would expect t6 be charged for the water he or she uses, just as every South Australian does. (Time expired)",49
26,Mr HULLS,WATER RESOURCES,"I am pleased to have this opportunity to second this motion. I share the concerns of my colleagues the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) and the honourable member for VVakefield (Mr Andrew) about the urgent need to develop a national strategy for sustainable water quality management. There is probably no other electorate in this country that can so dramatically demonstrate the need for the efficient and environmentally sound use of our water resources as my electorate of Kennedy in western Queensland. In the north of my electorate around the lip of the Gulf of Carpentaria, the summer monsoon rains regularly flood the savanna country, sometimes for hundreds of kilometres inland. The Gulf towns of Normanton, Burketown and Doomadgee were isolated by flood waters for nearly a month last Christmas. Meanwhile, Mount Isa, Longreach, VVinton and Clermont can go for years without getting much more than a drop of rain. On the tablelands the rain falls with monotonous regularity all year round, except for a dry spell this year that had a severe effect on local agriculture. But because there is such concentrated land use, there are problems associated with the sometimes competing needs of agriculture, development and the environment. The extremes of rainfall experienced in my electorate and the range of associated water management problems are repeated across Australia. VVe live in the second most arid continent on the planet and it is incumbent upon us to manage our water resources sufficiently so that the water available to the next generation will be at least as good as, if not better than, that currently available. I am not suggesting-and I am sure the honourable members for Petrie and VVakefield will agree with me-any grandiose Katteresque, that is, Bob KaUer, Junior, Bradfield-type scheme to solve the problem. The damage that could be wreaked upon the environment by quixotic and chaotic schemes to divert the Tully and Herbert rivers inland is beyond reckoning. VVhat I am suggesting, and what this motion calls for, is sensible management on a national level to set basic standards for the use, treatment and availability of water. Climatic extremes have forced us to manage water sensibly in Mount Isa. The 40-degree summer days of Mount Isa, on which people can feel the moisture being sucked out of their skin every time they step into the sun, are the norm for millions of square kilometres across the continent. Because water is such a precious resource to the people of Mount Isa, it is treated with great respect. VVater restrictions are in force for part of the year, there is an appropriate pricing structure in place for excess water usage, and water quality testing is carried out regularly by the Mount Isa City Council. VVhat is needed, however, are national water quality standards and a national strategy for sustainable water quality management. VVe also need adequate funding for research and development into initiatives such as solar powered transportation of water over long distances in inland Australia. In this way we can harness the energy of the everpresent blazing sun of the inland to bring much-needed water to the region. The efficient and environmentally sound use of water resources in Mount Isa is unfortunately not so obvious in the practices and attitudes of the majority of the Australian population, who live around the perimeter of Australia. A classic example of the problems that can result from our current mishmash of Federal, State and local authority regulations concerning water management is occurring now in relation to the Tinaroo Falls Dam on the Atherton Tableland. Because the local council concerned has permitted residential development well within one kilometre of the shoreline of the lake, there are suggestions that the water quality in Lake Tinaroo may already be almost beyond the point of no return because of the effects of past and present development around the lake. This presents a serious problem, as other councils in the area plan to draw water for human consumption from the dam to augment existing supplies next century. A more critical incident that illustrates the urgency of the need for national water resource management standards made the national media recently after developer George Quaid bulldozed thousands of trees into the Mitchell River, and the State and Federal governments were virtually powerless to stop him. So I commend this motion to the House in the hope that the States and other relevant authorities will cooperate with this Government to bring about more efficient and environmentally sound uses of our water resources by the implementation of a national strategy for sustainable water quality management. This must be done to ensure a viable future for generations of Australians, because I believe that without proper water quality management we do not have any future.  - Apart from people, water is without doubt our most valuable resource. I commend the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) for his motion, and I congratulate the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) on his expertise in this matter. The greatest disappointment of my political career was to see the present Labor Government, upon its election in 1981, scrap a proposal and a major financial commitment made by the former coalition Government to pipe the WimmeraMallee stock and domestic water supply system. I make no apologies for raising this matter in the debate on this motion, as there could few better examples in Australia today of how a commitment to a national project could provide medium and major employment opportunities, significantly achieve a more efficient and environmentally sound use of water, effect a reduction in soil salinity and improvement in water quality, effectively improve natural creek and river flows, and return an outstanding lake system to its original state. How appropriate in this time of severe economic and social hardship for a Federal government to show the initiatives to advance such a scheme. It was during the desperate times of the 1930s that this unique open channel system in Victoria was built by hundreds of unemployed people. The system comprises 16,000 kilometres of open channels, services 51 towns-a population of 60,000 people-3,000 hectares of irrigation and 13,500 separate properties, and fills approximately 25,000 dams. The Wimmera-Mallee system releases on average 170,000 megalitres from the Grampians storage each year, of which 65 per cent is lost to evaporation and seepage and only 35 per cent is consumed. In the northern Mallee, the losses to seepage and evaporation are as high as 90 per cent. The real benefits from this scheme, however, lie in the fact that, by piping the northern Mallee as a priority and supplying that area from pumps in the River Murray, we would use only 3,500 megalitres to supply the area that today takes 65,000 megalitres of water from the Wimmera-Mallee storage. The quality of the water would also improve, with Murray water being between 250 and 300 BC units whereas the present delivery sees some 800 to 1,400 EC units delivered to the farms. The Wimmera-Mallee system is overcommitted by between 15,000 and 20,000 megalitres each year-and that situation would be overcome by this program, as recommended in the Wimmera River in·· tegrated catchment management strategy report released this month. Some 85 per cent of the total cost of this project would be taken up in the manufacture and laying of pipes to service this area. The pipes, of course, could be be manufactured in the western suburbs of Melbourne, giving a significant lift to employment, as it would in the northern Mallee area. The program would also have great flexibility in that it could be carried out in small sections, and I believe the work could commence within six to nine months of approval being given by this Government. The Wimmera-Mallee system has served the State well since it was built earlier this century, but today its extravagant loss of water places a responsibility on this and future generations to improve and modernise the system. While I look at this scheme as an employment creation program, it is a justifiable public works program which the State of Victoria today needs. Such an employment creation program would be a vital public works prbgram which, as well as supplying work in these desperate times, will complete something that must be tackled sooner rather than later. I invite the Government and, in fact, I challenge the Government through this motion moved today by the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) to closely consider the piping of the northern sections of the Wimmera-Mallee stock and domestic water supply as being very suitable for a public works program to benefit employment in both country and city areas of Victoria. It is an intelligent measure to promote water quality and water savings. The Rural Water Commission in Victoria has done the preliminary design work on this program, and the basic conceptual outline of the total pipeline scheme has been made. I could think of no better program to counter the difficulties that we have in this country today and, at the same time, meet the terms of the motion as moved by the honourable member for Petrie, which is aimed primarily, of course, at ensuring that Australia's most valuable resource is adequate for our use not just today but in the future.",52
27,Mr NEWELL,WATER RESOURCES,"I thank the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) for moving this motion and I commend the contributions of the previous speakers in this debate. The motion is perhaps timely in a sense in that it has been some 200 years of white settlement in Australia that has seen the exploitation, development and use of water resources in Australia. I mention the 200 years of white settlement because I feel it is the settlement on the east coast of Australia that has driven the honourable member for Petrie to move this motion. We need to consider also the impact of the development that will occur in other parts of Australia in the next 200 years. We must not repeat throughout the rest of Australia the mistakes that have been made on the east coast. Indeed, we need to make sure that any further development and use of water resources in Australia are sustainable and sensible. If we are to value this resource, we must do something that has not been done in previous years when, as previous speakers have mentioned, the allocation of water has been somewhat haphazard. Even now, we still have local government authorities reluctant to impose a user pays system, reluctant to impose a metering system so that peopJe are conscious of the volume of water they use and, hence, have an incentive to restrict usage and to use water more sensibly. Anybody coming to this country in the last 100 years would have seen the tremendous amount of water resources we possess and believed that there were no restrictions-a little bit like the pioneering or colonial mentality that we grew up with and that helped deVelop the country. But as we are now finding, this resource is not a bottomless pool. There is a limit to it and we have to make sure that we use it thoroughly. Some of the things we have done in the past need to be reexamined-even our attitude to the development of dams and the use of dam water. Whether it be for residential purposes, for industrial purposes or for agricultural purposes, the usage needs to be very closely examined. The conflict in my electorate reflects exactly what is occurring throughout Australia. Do we dam the rivers for further development, especially residential development such as is occurring in my electorate, or do we leave the water resources and the water courses as they are? Already, quite a number of farmers in my electorate have phoned me, disappointed that the dry season which we normally have in my electorate from July through to the end of the year-or a drier season, as people in some other parts of Australia might refer to it as-has affected the flow in the rivers. The flow has been very much restricted and in some cases has stopped for the first time in something like 100 years. The only other time one reliable water course stopped was during a devastating drought in the previous century. Stagnant pools are developing in that particular water course for the first time in living memory. The W7 site on Wilsons Creek west of Mullumbimby is certainly a contentious issue. The argument is all about population pressure and how much urbanisation we are prepared to allow within a certain area. Such development comes at the expense of agricultural areas, and it is for that reason I am very concerned about it. I sincerely hope that the issue is resolved so that further development is not ad hoc but is restricted so that it is commensurate with the sorts of resources we would like to see. Just this morning we have had news of the devastating effect of the burst dam in the Philippines. I certainly hope we never have that sort of thing here in Australia, but that is the extreme of the types of things that can happen with development along our water courses. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) mentioned the use of rain water tanks in residential areas. I believe that matter has to be re-examined by local government authorities urgently. The Sydney Water Board has almost dismissed that idea because the pollution from the air is too heavy. (TIme expired)",54
28,Mr MCARTHUR,WATER RESOURCES,"The availability of water is critical to Australia's quality of life. In a nation of 17 million people, around 60 per cent live in a relatively thin coastal strip in the south-east. Yet around 50 per cent of many types of agricultural production-such as sheep, fruit and crops-comes from the Murray-Darling basin, which is home to only 1.8 million of the nation's inhabitants. The Murray-Darling basin is an important barometer of the nation's environmental well-being. With much of the land being irrigated, salinity has become a major problem. Some commentators have even observed that desertification of this area may occur, at least in part. That would indeed be a disaster, given that the area in question stretches from the southern quarter of Queensland through the majority of New South Wales and Victoria to the south-east of South Australia. Yet there is some room for cautious optimism. An interesting development is emanating from my electorate of Corangamite. The Colac company Trcecorp Pty Ltd, with Mr Jim Witham as Managing Director, has been awarded the commercial management side of the trees for profit and the environment program of the State Department of Conservation and Environment. Treecorp's role will be to encourage commercial investment in hardwood plantations whose water will emanate from new sources, such as industry, farms and municipalities. I am pleased to say that this venture between the State Government and Treecorp has the support of the Australian Conservation Foundation, as well as the National Association of Forest Industries. This new hardwood planting program should slowly reduce ground water and salinity problems once thought unsolvable.",55
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WATER RESOURCES,"Mr Nehl)Order! It being nearly 12.30 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with sessional order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Taxation Revenue: Distribution",55
30,Mr ANDREW,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Wakefield) (12.30 p.m.)The grievance debate gives an opportunity to express, both to the Parliament and to the gallery, the things that are most burdening one at a particular point in time. I do not suppose anyone enters this place in order to win a popularity contest. The best one can hope for is to have 50 per cent of the people think you are marginally acceptable. I suspect that one of the reasons that parliamentarians are treated with such cynicism and disdain is that we personify the tax collection process. Ever since biblical days, and probably even before them, being a tax collector was a sure way to ensure that one was unpopular. Whilst I, as a member of Her Majesty 1s Loyal Opposition, may say that I am not a tax collector at all and that all those opposite are, the truth of the matter is that in the eyes of the public we are all involved; and I am guilty, I have to say to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), by association. My concern about tax collection is this: we have seen during the period of this Government a dramatic rise in the way in which conspicuous taxes, such as income taxes, are \collected.",55
31,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Nehl)Order! I just ask the honourable member for Lowe to observe the courtesies of the House by not walking between the chair and the honourable member who is speaking.,56
32,Mr ANDREW,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It is said that Commonwealth revenue has increased by something like 130 per cent, which is well above the inflationary increase. In the hidden tax area, in the taxation that the Opposition, for example, has focused on-the wholesale sales tax-it is known that, while the community at large does not know what it is paying in wholesale sales tax, the wholesale sales tax revenues to the Government have gone from something like $4.9 billion when the Opposition ceased to be in government to over $12 billion in 1991. The reason I rise to grieve about these things is simply that the Government and Government members opposite not only acknowledge that this increase has occurred but, worse than that, they are proud of it. They justify the increase in the name of equality and frequently parade in this place with self-righteous speeches about how much more effectively they are distributing what they see as the nation's wealth. They are entitled to do that. But I take umbrage at and grieve about the way in which they then paint us, the members of the Opposition, as-in their words-unfeeling and lacking in compassion because we do not applaud their capacity to rake in Commonwealth revenue in the way in which they have shown they are able to. They say that the milk of human kindness resides on that side of the House and that there is a monopoly on compassion on that side of the House, while we are seen as being devoid of any sense of feeling about what is happening to people who are unemployed or suffering in the community. I rise this afternoon to express my umbrage at the monopoly on compassion that the ALP claims to have. Thinking about this word, I went back through the dictionary to discover just what compassion is. I found that 'compassion' is derived from two Latin words, 'com' and 'pati', which translated mean 'to suffer with'. Frankly, none of us can claim, as tax collectors, to have compassion because tax collection has nothing to do with our capacity to suffer with the people who are suffering in Australia. In the loads of self-righteous speeches that we have had peddled at us from the people opposite, we have not had one suggestion ever-from either side of the House for that matter-that we ought to cut our salaries or lower the quality of the scotch in the members' bar in order to be seen to be truly compassionate or in any sense identifying with the people around Australia who are not as privileged as we are. My contention in this debate is that one cannot claim as a government-Liberal or Labor-ever to be compassionate because the measure of a person's compassion is the measure of how deep they dig into their pockets, not how deep they dig into mine. I do not stand here this afternoon to be judgmental about the ALP. I do not suggest that it has failed any more than we did to meet that mark. What I take umbrage at is the judgment levelled at me in the name of compassion. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that compassion is measured by the depth to which we reach into our individual pockets, and no one of us has the capacity to pass judgment on the other on that point. It is not a matter of the depth to which honourable members opposite, as a tax collecting agency, are prepared to reach into my pocket or the pockets of other Australians. I did not rise to endorse the sentiments expressed by Mr Kerry Packer when he appeared before the Select Committee on the Print Media, but I was rather interested in one or two of his comments which I want to bring to the attention of the Parliament in the context of my remarks this afternoon. Mr Packer, so the Sydney Morning Herald tells us: . . . refused to answer questions about how his companies managed to pay just 10 per cent tax. He said he wasn't prepared to go through his tax arrangements 'with you or anybody else', but did say he paid only what he could not legally avoid. Anyone who did otherwise needed their head read. Then he is reported as having gone on to say this: You (politicians) are not spending it so well that we should donate extra.  much matter. The measure of our capacity to be compassionate in the community is the measure of the preparedness that we have as individuals to recognise the needs of brothers or sisters, as the case may be, and not the way in which we simply go about generating tax income. We cannot claim to be compassionate in any party, in any government, because all we do as a tax collectors is take someone else's resources and spend them without their explicit authority. The danger is that in the process of generating additional tax revenue and sending it to people who we think desperately need it, even with the best intention in the world, we run the risk of simply remotely condemning those people to a cycle of dependency on government. We see that more credibly in 1991 than we have ever seen it, as we find people who are now moving into their third generation of being unemployed. The debate in this chamber yesterday morning made much of industrial relations and what was seen as the failure of the Opposition to develop what was called a compassionate industrial relations policy. Let me remind honourable members opposite and the community at large that all the Opposition has been about in pleading for a different approach to industrial relations has been to allow people the right to choose to work or not to work, the right to choose to take a risk or not to take a risk, and the right to choose to belong to a union or not to belong to a union. Frankly, there has been no intention here to remove from any employee the right to work under an award and no intention to abolish a minimum wage, but in fact an endeavour to allow people to find work and so find a real sense of accountability, independence and self-esteem. I represent a rural electorate. I find it galling that people opposite should suggest for a moment that they have a monopoly on compassion when they can treat Australia's farmers as they have treated them in the last two weeks over the whole question of the family allowance. The difficulty that we have had as an Opposition getting effective hardship provisions to allow farmers who are asset rich but desperately cash poor to be recognised by members of this Government suggests that they know little more about compassion tllan we do. Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not stand here passing judgment on Government members; I stand here pointing out to them that no-one can claim to be compassionate as tax collectors because the measure of compassion is the measure of how deep we reach into our individual pockets, not how deep we reach into other people's.

33,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In the time available to me, I wish to touch on three separate topics. The first relates to the media. Unfortunately, the current national debate on media ownership and concentration has predominantly focused many people's minds on capital cities. The vast number of people in Australia who live in regional areas seem to be ignored. The areas of Newcastle and the Hunter Valley in general are about to see substantial expansion in diversity in media with the introduction of two new television channels. In Newcastle the entry of Prime and Northern Rivers Television, with a local news coverage, will ensure a diversity in that form of media. While, admittedly, that will add some difficulties to the advertising market and the marketplace, I do not doubt that over time they will be resolved. However, those people who are focusing on the future of the Fairfax organisation all seem to be ignoring the fact that, regardless of who acquires Fairfax, the likelihood is that the Newcastle Morning Herald will be purchased by Rural Press Ltd, which currently owns the Maitland Mercury and the Newcastle Star. This would mean that the vast bulk of the print media in the lower Hunter would be run by one organisation. On the one hand, many people who are concerned about diversity and lack of concentration could well be forcing a much greater concentration within the print media upon the Hunter region. Whilst the Newcastle Herald and I have at times had differences of view-it has its funny little ways; it tends to desource material, plagiarise and have its own perspective on what is news-the fact is that it is predominantly a local print media. Its profits may end up in Sydney, but its services, people, personnel and driving forces are normally intensely parochial, perhaps at times too intense. I suggest that the people who talk about floating Fairfax should start to consider as part of that argument-whether it is Mr Packer, AIN or Mr O'Reilly-the advisability of being prepared to hand over to an existing print media in the region the running and control of the Newcastle Herald. It would make a lot more sense if the Newcastle Herald was floated on the Hunter region capital market. I think that many in the region would see this as a fine investment in the future diversity in our the media.",57
34,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Nchl)Order! The honourable member for Newcastle will resume his seat. The Chair would be grateful if the honourable member for Bradfield would pay the courtesy to the speaker who has the call of not walking between him and the Chair.,58
35,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I suggest that the Joint Select Committee on the Print Media takes these comments on board. It may also consider suggesting to Mr John Fairfax from Rural Press that he make himself available for discussion as to what his intentions and views are. He has made it quite clear publicly that he seeks to acquire the Newcastle Herald. It is appropriate that the sixth largest city in Australia is considered. If it was Hobart, for example, which is much smaller, there would be a national interest because it is a capital city. It seems to me that the regional centres of substantial size are disadvantaged. Much of what I say may well apply to the Illawarra and other parts of the country. I think it is quite important that we do not lose sight of these flow-down implications in terms of media concentration. Secondly, I pay some recognition to those people in the Newcastle industrial complexes who have been so pioneering in the last five or six years. The changes within the industrial workplaces in Newcastle have been truly magnificent. It has not been easy. It has been a difficult process for management, trade unions and the work force. However, there has been an acceptance that the future of their industries and of the industrial base of the Hunter depends not so much on preserving a particular job in a particular company but on making sure that a company can preserve and expand its marketplace and, with that, the potential of developing new products and new companies that can also compete. These changes have never been more noticeable than in recent weeks when 19 companies in the metals industry in Australia received substantial support in the form of the world's best practices awards. Three of the 19 were, in fact, Hunter based companies. I refer particularly to Goninans, Tubemakers and Anderson Rea. The fact that virtually onesixth of the recipient companies were Hunter based confirms yet again that our companies have been working very well in the areas of staff management and union liaison. The world's best practices scheme is aimed at helping those companies which pioneered the changes and developed a highly sophisticated and highly competitive capacity in their particular fields to spread those skills to other companies. Of course, the Government's support-which in this particular case totals $1.4m, shared by the three companies-is to help those companies pass on those skills. The conummity is unreasonable if it expects companies to help organisations other than themselves. This, to my mind, is a superb investment of taxpayers' funds. While not referring to myself, Parliament and parliamentarians have been playing a role in this process. I want to give particular recognition to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, which is inquiring into the shipbuilding industry and is having hearings in Newcastle on 4 December. It has been the preparedness of parliamentarians and government agencies to go into those areas to look at them first-hand that has been so encouraging. Firstly, it encourages companies. Secondly, it ensures that the nationally based organisations-whether they be politicians, Parliament or departmentshave direct feedback from people at the coalface. I mean'that almost in a literal sense. The fact is that it is very difficult for companies that operate in an individual context to relate at times to the national perspective, national goals and national objectives, which always seem so abstract and so remote. The preparedness of parliamentarians to hold committee meetings in Newcastle, whether in relation to the shipbuilding inquiry shortly to be held there or the ports authority inquiry of recent times, has been encouraging. Before this Government, only one parliamentary inquiry had ever held a meeting in Newcastle. From recollection, it was held in 1973-74 and it was on a highway environmental issue. The fact is that the Parliament itself tends to lose sight of the realities on the ground. We hear honourable members talking about their own electorates and their own areas, yet as parliamentarians they tend to ignore everybody else's. I think it has been the preparedness of some of the parliamentary committees to visit these centres and talk to the people involved in the industries that they are looking into which has been so encouraging and informative. My final comment is about the health scheme. I pay tribute to the emotionally involved and committed people who work in the health care system in the Hunter and who find it difficult to accept the dry economics of the State Government. I also pay particular tribute to the staff of the Mater Hospital, who are currently caring for a very dear friend by the name of Mrs COlllmie Foley. The health care workers know that life is tough under State politicians and their government's dry economic rationalism. But deep down we do care. The hospital workers' caring more than justifies their actions in the hospitals at Wallsend and at Newcastle over the last six months, as it will in the months ahead. With those comments, Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the House. Asia-Pacific Region",58
36,Mr CONNOLLY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I wish to speak this afternoon about the developments in the Asia-Pacific region and, in particular, the role of Australia in the growth of the region and, of course, the role of this Parliament in that context. There is no doubt that the focus of world economic power has shifted substantially since the Second World War. The Asia-Pacific region now accounts for almost 30 per cent of the world's population and 20.5 per cent of the world's gross domestic product. It is set to become the world's largest regional economy. The average growth of gross domestic product of the East and South East Asian economies in the period 1965-1985 was 6.2 per cent, compared with a world average of 3.5 per cent. The region increased its share of world exports from 7.7 per cent in 1950 to 19.5 per cent in 1986, while its share of world imports also increased in the same period from 8 per cent to 15 per cent. You will appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker, that on the basis of those statistics alone the role Australia should playas part of the region is of fundamental importance. With the economic growth of the region there is a need to develop the capacity of the representative parliaments of the region to participate in the closer identification of regional problems, of regional solutions and a better understanding of the cultural, historic, economic and social variables which are manifestly present. There has been a trend towards greater cooperation in regionalisation, particularly in the establishment of ASEAN, APEC, the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference, PECC, and the Pacific Basin Economic Council, PBEC. These organisations are devoted principally to encouraging economic and trade links between member countries and operate mainly at ministerial, official and private sector level. Apart from regional branches of international organisations such as the Inter-Parliamentary Union, there is no entity with a wide regional membership that provides a forum for the representatives of the peoples of the Asia-Pacific region. While ASEAN has established an interparliamentary organisation for its own members, which-by nature is therefore limited, there is no overall Asia-Pacific parliamentary association as such. Consequently, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is worth noting for the record that progress is being made in this very important area. The first initiative was that of the Japanes y. In April 1990, th-ecretary-General of the J apanese Liber-l Democratic Party and // the delegation which he brought to Australia, including Mr Tatsuo Ozawa, gave the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) a proposal for a Pacific parliamentary league for educational, cultural and economic cooperation. Subsequently, discussions were held with other officers and members of this Parliament, including the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) and me. I met with Mr Ozawa in Japan in July 1991 and at that meeting he discussed in detail his proposal to have an inaugural steering committee meeting in Singapore to discuss the preparatory arrangements for the establishment of what was then called a league. Mr Ozawa accepted my offer to prepare a discussion paper for the Singapore meeting and on my return to Australia. I prepared and circulated a paper, after full consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), his Department, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Presiding Officers. The paper, inter alia, recommended that an assembly for parliamentarians in the Asia-Pacific region be formed and that it be associated with APEC. I seek leave of the House to table the substance of that report. Leave granted.",59
37,Mr CONNOLLY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Cooperation in the broader context is a relatively new concept in the Asia-Pacific region. Historically, there are few examples of regional cohesion, largely due to the region's diversity. However, in the light of new global economic restructuring, the uncertain future of global economic markets and the changing economic profile of the Asia-Pacific region, there are economic and political imperatives that justify a shift regional relations including closer cooperation. Therefore, an assembly of parliamentarians is clearly needed to further encourage greater cooperation, cohesion and understanding in the region and a trans-Pacific meeting of parliamentarians would provide opportunities for the representatives of member countries to maintain more effective dialogue face to face with regional partners whether on economic, cultural, political, social or other fields of endeavour. It was in this context that I recommended that there be an association between the new organisation-which is to be' called the Asia Pacific Parliamentarians Forum-and APEC. I did this for a very fundamental reason. APEC is a recently established forum for economic cooperation with a broadening membership base and considerable potential for securing economic benefits for all its members through cooperation. The APEC forum is the first attempt to cooperate across the region. It includes members of ASEAN on the Asian side of the Asia-Pacific region, Japan, China, and Korea, the United States and Canada, and soon Mexico, and Australia and New Zealand to the south, The parliamentary forum could provide a most constructive and effective means for focusing consideration on the issues discussed by Ministers. I emphasise that APEC is a meeting of only Ministers and senior officials. APEC does play an increasingly important role in regional cooperation. As its membership is obviously going to increase in future years, an assembly would also be linked through APEC with a growing regional information base, Importantly, the assembly could act to widen the forum for discussion of issues raised in APEC meetings. Representatives of the APEC ministerial forum could report to the assembly annually on the activities of APEC and act as a sounding board for the representatives of the region. Putting it simply, while governments would meet in APEC, the people's representatives of the Asia-Pacific region would meet face to face in the assembly. The outcome of that discussion was that I recommended the establishment of an as to sembly for parliamentarians in the Asia Pacific region that would be associated with APEC for the transfer of information, as we]] as, of course, association with other regional organisations. I also recommended that the assembly's agenda should include matters of regional significance in any field, including issues raised at APEC meetings and that a representative of APEC should report to the assembly and so forth. The document that I wrote was the basis of our discussions in Singapore. At the conclusion of those discussions a steering committee was established. It released a final report in the Memorandum of Understanding of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum. I seek leave of the House to incorporate this document in Hansard. Leave not granted. MR DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)-A document can be incorporated in Hansard only if it accords with the guidelines of the Standing Orders; unfortunately it does not. However, if the honourable member wishes it to be tabled, I will seek leave for that to happen.",60
38,Mr CONNOLLY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,I seek leave to table the report. Leave granted.,61
39,Mr CONNOLLY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"This is an important document because, for the first time in the history of the region, nations of varying backgrounds have been able to get together to agree that the objectives of our effort must be to advance the interests of democracy, freedom, peace and prosperity in the region, to open and maintain non-exclusive cooperation in support of liberalisation of international trade, and to support nonmilitary cooperation while having an interest in the issues of regional peace and security. Also, the forum will maintain the closest possible relations with regional institutions, particularly APEC and ASEAN, but also PECC, PBEC, and SPF, the South-Pacific Forum, to ensure a free flow of information between the forum and those organisations. While the forum meetings and the work of its standing committees are intended to complement the activities of these institutions, the forum will determine an independent agenda. I should also relate to the House that the honourable member for Adelaide, on behalf of the Speaker, subsequently issued an invitation at the Singapore meeting for the inaugural conference to be held in Australia. We are still in the process of negotiating where that will take place, but the significant fact is that the first important steps have taken; there is no going back. We have seen over recent decades the tremendous role played by interparliamentary organisations in the context of East and Western Europe. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca), who is at the table, was the leader of the Australian delegation to the North Atlantic Assembly last year. We reported to this Parliament then that the role which that organisation played in building bridges between East and Western Europe was of fundamental importance and totally supported the work of other organisations such as the Council of Europe, which many members of this House have continued to attend. It is not logical that a region of the world which now includes over 30 per cent of the entire population of this globe does not have the capacity to build a new regional institution which will incorporate within itself the objectives which I have already enunciated. It can bring together men and women representing the peoples of the region, in all their diversity, to develop a happier and more contented future where we can build on the successful economies which we can now clearly see developing in this region and give to our people security and hope for the future. The Thrkish Community",61
40,Mr FERGUSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Reid) (1.00 p.m)Approximately three years ago the Ethnic Affairs Commission of New South Wales produced a document entitled Ten Years After. It dealt with the particular problems of the Turkish community in Sydney. It made reference to the Turkish community's limited access to government authorities; the lack of Turkish interpreters, which related to the cancellation of courses at a CAE; the limited number of Turkish courses in the high schools of New South Wales; and the overall unemployment pattern of that community. The report said that all of these problems could be partly traced to the correlation of Turkish migration in this country with the onset of Indo-Chinese refugees. In other words, to some degree the Turkish community had been been neglected because of Australia's emphasis on helping· to resettle refugees. That report, which was fairly objective in its analysis, has been followed by a variety of publications in regard to the Turkish community. The most recent to deal with the delivery of services to the Turkish community is the document produced by the Administrative Review Council entitled Access to Administrative Review by Members of Australia:SO Ethnic Communities. The report deals with the way in which that community perceives its rights to appeal to various government and semi-government authorities. This is of some importance to me. For instance, according to the 1986 census, there were approximately 2,900 Turkish born-and I stress that they are not the children of Turks, but Turkish born-citizens in the municipality of Auburn. These people constitute a very significant proportion of the 24,500 Turks in Australia. To put those figures in a different context, in the municipality of Auburn, which is central to my electorate, 35.4 per cent of the population were born in non-English speaking countries and of those 13.5 per cent came from Turkey. So my interest in these matters is long standing. The Administrative Review Council had the cooperation of a significant number of social workers in the community, such as Saliha Bektas from a Turkish child care group; Kaya Cakir, who is a youth worker for the Sydney United Soccer Club; and Besin Karasu and Oya Aytac from the Turkish Welfare Association. Indeed, some perhaps predictable but very worrying results came from that survey. In the end, the Council came up with some very commendable recommendations. It is worth noting why it chose the Sydney Turkish community, along with Melbourne's Vietnamese community, to explore the level of knowledge about appeal rights within the community. On page 14, the report states: The Turkish community in Auburn is a relatively long-settled group. A large proportion of the population is old and many people are financially dependent on some form of pension or benefit. Many are neither skilled nor confident in written spoken English. Of course, the 1983 survey of languages in this country showed that the Turkish community, of all migrant groups, had the lowest level of English usage. Of course, the community is characterised by other social denominators: a very high level of intermarriage with Anglo-Saxons; very high unemployment patterns; and low educational achievement. The survey showed that the Turkish community had a very low level of recognition of their rights. The Council also went on to carry out a pattern of information to the community over the period of a year and then assessed the impact of that campaign. The program was found to have had a major effect. For instance, in, 1990 only 23 per cent of the Turkish community knew of the existence of the Ombudsman; a year later, that figure had been raised to 52 per cent. In 1990, only 41 per cent of the Turkish community knew of their right to appeal in immigration matters; it had increased to 71 per cent a year later, a fairly significant increase. Only 41 per cent of the 200 Turks surveyed-it was a fairly worthwhile survey-said they knew anything about their rights to appeal to Telecom about telephone bills; a year later that figure reached 83 per cent. These figures tend to indicate that there had been a successful effort by the people making the review to actually have an impact on the community and have some effect on their level of knowledge. It is interesting to note some of the novel approaches made by this survey because they are relevant to government authorities, to getting the message across, and to giving people access and equity to the government of this country. I will just go through some of the processes which represent a fairly novel approach from the standard departmental role of producing 50,000 copies of a document on social security or pensions, or whatever, in Turkish, and leaving it in the back room for the next six years. The efforts made by the Council included having the Turkish paper Yeni Vatan run what it called an agony column, over a or period of months, setting out various questions on these issues from supposed readers, under the title Marco Pasha, a significant force in Turkey. The Council's efforts also included having the Turkish radio program on 2EA broadcast a soapie covering the same issues. The show discussed delivery of services and how people go about appealing to different government departments. The Council carried out a variety of interviews with government authorities on talk back radio. It used the mosque at Auburn in my electorate as a central distribution for information, as well as holding public meetings that were fairly well attended. It engineered the inclusion of a 90-second message in Turkish in all Turkish language videos obtained from the major shop in the electorate. Over a year, we saw a sustained campaign which, from the statistics produced, succeeded in accomplishing a greater level of knowledge in the Turkish community of people's rights. As a result of this survey, the Administrative Review Council, which, as I said, great cooperation from the Turkish community, came up with a number of fairly firm suggestions for the Government and for various departments and authorities that have appeal rights and were subject to the review. Amongst those suggestions was that there should be a greater market orientation by the various authorities in the way in which pursue their roles, that the Ombudsman should be the central reference point in producing this knowledge to the communities, and that the various authorities should playa leading role in the dissemination of inforthe mation to the community. The Ombudsman was seen as a very important centre to the whole thrust of improving access and equity expired) to various communities. It was also said, in regard to publicity material, that there should be not only checking of translations for accuracy but a greater emphasis on cultural appropriateDawkins), ness. Overall, the survey showed amongst Turkish social workers a worrying level lack of knowledge of grants-in-aid. A number of workshops were held in the local departanalysis, ment offices and people were also taken State headquarters. However, as I said, there was a very disturbing pattern of a lack knowledge by the workers themselves of what could be open to the Turkish community. was stated that they should have a greater inter-relationship with the various agencies and should be brought in more often for various training courses. A network of grantin-aid workers was formed to provide organisational advice and facilities. In regard to translators, it was emphasised that financial provision for translators should point be made by the review bodies and that they should critically examine the way in which information was currently provided by those agencies to the general public and, more particularly, communities that had a very low level of English. Other suggestions included very strong staff involvement in the planning of publicity activities. As well, as a result of this survey, it was suggested that there should be a greater willingness by authorities and agencies to look at a more diverse range of promotional and educational ways of conhad very veying the message. Finally, there was concern that there was very strong duplication and gaps in delivery the of knowledge from the communities, and there was an emphasis on their trying to work more closely together. I should say that the vast majority of the agencies interviewed came down with a fairly positive response in they their actual endeavours. Those that were covered were Telecom, the Department of Immigration, the Australian Taxation Office and Customs. In general, there was a fairly positive indication that they were trying to do job, but perhaps they need to ensure that they are more willing to try the different, perhaps the unusual, in presentation. (Time Parliamentary Committees",61
41,Mr CHARLES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"La Trobe) (1.10 p.m.)a My grievance today is with the Minister for also Employment, Education and Training (Mr the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) and of the Executive Government. The most important functions of this Parliament are those of evaluation, re-evaluation and into scrutiny of legislation. The Australian Constitution and the Westmmster system for of democratic government provide for the appointment of parliamentary committees. Those It committhes have a responsibility to investigate issues and collect data from the community in a manner that the House, as a body, is unable to accomplish. As explained in House of Representatives Practice: Because of their compositionbeing taken from all partiesand method of procedure, which is structured but generally informal compared with the Houses, committees are well suited to the gathering of evidence from expert groups or individuals. In a sense they 'take Parliament to the people' and allow direct contact between members of the public by a representative group of Members of the House when engaged on programs of hearings, visits or inspections. Not only do their programs enable their members to be better informed about community views but in simply undertaking an inquiry committees may promote public debate on the subject at issue. The all-party composition of most committees and their propensity to operate across party lines are important features. This bi-partisan approach generally manifests itself throughout the conduct of inquiries and the drawing up of conclusions. Committees oversight and scrutinise the Executive and can contribute towards a better informed administration and government policymaking process. In respect of their formal proceedings committees are microcosms and extensions of the Houses themselves ... There are some doubts as to the actual limits of the powers of investigation which may be exercised by or delegated to committees. Some would claim committees have unlimited power, but on the other hand the considered view is that their investigatory powers are limited to those matters over which the Parliament has power to legislate. Whatever is the real situation, and unless and until such time as the courts make a definitive ruling, the standing committees, as appointed today, still make use of those very wide ranging powers of investigation and inquiry. Many thousands of hours and probably millions of taxpayers' dollars are spent each year on and by the standing committees of the House of Representatives. Such expenditure of time and money is called into question when there would appear to be little cognisance paid to the committees' reports by the Ministers concerned. For the last 18 months, I have had the privilege and responsibility of being the Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. Our committee members have travelled many thousands of kilometres, crisscrossing Australia, in order properly to carry out the functions demanded of us as members of that body. Thousands of pages of transcript and report have been made from hours upon hours of hearings, submissions, site visits, et cetera. Many Australians across a broad range of the community have l given freely of their time to participate in the investigative processes of our parliamentary committee. At this point, we could be congratulating ourselves on a job well done. Is that not what the committees are for-to go out to the people, let them have their say, write it down, prepare a report with recommendations and table it in the Parliament in anticipation of a positive ministerial executive response? It is true that part of the role of our Committee has been fulfilled to this day. However, there is one extremely worrying factor and that is the apparent disregard with which the Ministers concerned have treated such reports. Real democracy comes into play when the Minister heeds the recommendations of his standing committee and moves to implement those recommendations. Parliament starts to become irrelevant, it begins to lose its relevancy, when Executive Government-Ministers-disregards and treats with derision the recommendations that come from the investigations of a standing committee of this House. The House of Representatives Practice states: It is fundamental in the concept of responsible government that the Executive Government be accountable to the Parliament. In this Parliament in recent months we have seen the tabling of a committee report into literacy needs in the workplace titled Words at Work. The terms of reference for the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training inquiry into literacy needs in the workplace came out of the International Year of Literacy, when appalling figures from the Wickert study suggested that more than one million Australian adults are functionally illiterate. The Standing Committee received submissions from 35 individuals, 40 organisations and 19 schools and other educational institutions, as well as 14 government departments and agencies. A number of exhibits were presented. The Committee conducted nine days of hearings in Canberra, Melbourne, Hobart, Adelaide, Perth, Brisbane and Sydney as well as many regional centres. Site visits, inspections and informal talks were held on a further seven days. Many more days and nights of domestic committee meetings were held to discuss the results and comments obtained from the public program, and a final report was prepared, re-prepared, drafted, re-drafted and finally tabled in the Parliament in May of this year. Since that date the silence has been almost deafening. Executive Government has made the Committee just like a ball of cotton wool: you can see it, you can feel it, but it will not hurt when it hits you. The Committee's report was virtually ignored by the Minister in the preparation of his White Paper entitled Australia's Language-the Australian Language and Literacy Policy. That White Paper is a live demonstration of the irrelevance of Parliament and the committee system and the contempt in which the Committee is held by the Minister. It is clear evidence of the excessive power and manifestation of the distance of Cabinet from the people. Executive Government controls the agenda and has become distinctly remote from the average Australian it is intended to serve. On 2 November 1989 a committee report entitled The Restless Years was tabled in the Parliament. That report was also the result of many hours of hearings, consultation, committee time and so on. That report was not responded to for 18 months-not until 28 May 1991. In the meantime there was an election and a new round of members joined the Committee; one must question the value of the final response by the Minister when so much had changed in the community in the intervening period. The committee system can work, and work well, if the relevant Minister is prepared to listen and defer to the more informed comments and recommendations made by his committee. In order to make government more responsive to the will of the people, Ministers must be more willing to listen to and take heed of standing committee recommendations. I would like to see committees used to the fullest advantage where Ministers can utilise the expertise of all members of parliament and the general community across party lines to implement strategies that should work for the good of the nation as a whole and not just to get bogged down in petty party politics and philosophies. We must not allow the Parliament to degenerate into a loose knit group of independents like the United States Congress. That House of Representatives is made up of Democrats and Republicans, yet works as a House of independents where noone is willing to take hard decisions for the good of the nation. Each congressman is virtually mortgaged to his or her financial backers and is often more subject to that influence than that of their party or their broad constituency. When Parliament is made more relevant, by giving committees greater or expanded powers and increased public exposure, then Executive Government will be more responsive to the needs and desires of the majority. Surely we would all benefit from the combined wisdom of cross-party consultation. When, after months of committee work and the tabling of a report with recommendations on student financial assistance, the response is to call in a consultap.t to investigate Austudy, one must truly question the relevance of the standing committees as an arm of the Parliament. This is indisputably an example of Executive Government thumbing its nose at the Parliament and the people. If the committee system is a method of taking the Parliament to the people then surely the people must be able to use that system as a conduit to the Parliament, with government heeding the responses of the people by initiating the recommendations so made. Gladstone: Development Opportunities",63
42,Mr COURTICE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Hinkler) (1.20 p.m.)Today I would like to issue an invitation to every large businessman and manufacturer, every large mining company and every other large company, in Australia and intemationally, to come to Gladstone if they wish to invest in and to develop the resources of this nation. In Gladstone we are pro-jobs and prodevelopment. I am throwing down the gauntlet today to those companies that say it is too hard to get on with the job in this country. It is not too hard to get on with the job in Gladstone. I am issuing that invitation and a challenge to those large companies to come to Gladstone and see what we have to offer. On an even broader basis, I invite them to come to my electorate of Hinkler and see what BHoela, a city that has just been included in my electorate through redistribution, and Bundaberg have to offer. We have the most equable climate in the world. We have the southern end of the Barrier Reef. We have more moderate sunny days than anywhere else in Australia. More importantly, particularly in Gladstone, we have an attitude that is pro-industry and pro-development. I say again: come to Gladstone. Another aspect should be encouraging for investors. We now see interest rates at one of the lowest levels for many years. Interest rates have come down and, of course, inflation is down. Inflation has been the key to getting rates down and becoming more competitive. I am sure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, representing an,. electorate that is also keen on exports, can uilderstand that unless we get inflation down and holdit down we do not have the capacity to be competitive. We in this country can proudly say that we have achieved that, and now is the time to see money invested to develop the resources we have. Of course, in Queensland we have an abundance of resources. The Bowen Basin, in particular, is rich in not only coal reserves but also natural gas. It has a massive potential for energy and the reserves that can be used to develop downstream processing of our resources so that the profits and the productivity stay here in our nation. That is what it is about. That is the challenge I issue to all those people who are saying it is too hard to invest in this country. It is not too hard to invest in Gladstone. We have a task force that I established in 1987 and that is made up from the community. It represents the union movement, small business, the Metal Trades Industry Association, the Gladstone Port Authority, the Gladstone City Council and the Calliope Shire Council. Those groups work together to encourage development. We wish to encourage jobs for our youth and for our long term unemployed. I will mention some of the exciting things that are happening now in Gladstone according to the latest project status report from Gladstone Area Promotion & Development Ltd. That organisation does an outstanding job in promoting our district. Peter Corones, who is the manager, has been to Canberra; he has met and personally knows many of our Ministers. He has always had his doors open to any businessman, any tourist operator, who is interested in coming to central Queensland. In the last 12 months, 22 projects have been completed in the Gladstone area at a cost of $285.64m. These projects include the completion of the gas pipeline from Gladstone to Rockhampton at a cost of $34m, Minproc Chemical Company's sodium cyanide plant at a cost of $54m, ICI's chlorine and sodium cyanide plant at a cost of $85m and Queensland Alumina's bauxite treatment plant at a cost of $32m. Currently under construction in this area are projects totalling $207.08m. These include an upgrade by Boyne Smelters Ltd of $67.9m; a Queensland Electricity Commission power station upgrading of $42m; a Gladstone City Council pollution control plant, $4.2m, ICI Australia's ammonium nitrate plant, $70m; and ICI Australia's nitric acid plant, $18m. I think it is exciting to be able to say that we have under way projects worth over $200m and we have just completed projects of almost $300m. Of course, projects that are currently under investigation include the proposed conunercial demonstration plant for oil shale by Southern Pacific Petroleum. The estimated starting date of construction is June 1992 and the estimated cost is $ 145m. The work force that will be required during the construction stage is expected to reach 215. The Federal Government has reduced the impediment by forgoing the excise revenue over the next 10 years to give the project the opportunity to get up and run. If this technology is perfected and if we get up and use this massive reserve that Southern Pacific has the rights over, we will become less affected by the international vagaries of the Middle East and the problems with oil there. At the end of the day, we are talking about developing jobs, developing our resources for our country. It is only through developing our resources that we will be strong enough to look after our environment and to look after the social structures that people on both sides of this House are very proud of. The environmental impact study for the proposed Curtis Island resort has been completed by Monte Christo Holdings, and is currently awaiting State department approvals. The estimated cost of stage one is $80m. A feasibility study is currently under way for Minproc's ammonium nitrate plant. A decision on the go ahead for this project is expected in the next six months. Completion of a feasibility study and investment proposal on the special steel mill is expected by the end of this year. The expected work force for the construction of this plant is some 1,200 men. The starting date for construction could be some time in the next 12 months. The estimated cost of this development is $800m. A decision is expected in the near future on the go ahead for the air separation unit for CIG at an estimated cost of $30m. Depending on successful negotiations with the Queensland Government and Boyne Smelters Ltd, a third aluminium potline could be a big bonus for our region. The estimated cost of this project is $820m and would require a substantial work force. I would hope that the State Government and Comalco can work out an arrangement with regard to power generation to get this up and running. While I do concede that aluminium prices have gone down, now is the time-the environment-for Comalco to actually make the bold decision and kick the thirdpotline goal. If we get that under way, it will be a massive boost to our already large aluminium industry - Today Federal Government approval has been received for a floating hotel proposed by Fitzroy Reef Resort at an estimated cost of $40m. The work force has been calculated at 50 during the construction stage, with a further 50 being required at the operational stage. Gladstone Port Authority has a number of construction works under investigation. These include extending the stockpile storage area at an estimated cost of $22m, the construction of a slipway at $5m and the construction of a marina bridge for $3.6m. The mineral lease for Pivot Group Ltd to process beach sands has been approved with conditions. The estimated starting date for the project is 199394. The plant would require an operational work force of 130 men. Of course, the great news this week was the commitment by both the Commonwealth and State governments of $20m and $5m respectively to ensure that the research and development for the pilot plant for the magnesium industry gets up and running. Once we are able to demonstrate the technology necessary, we will see a magnesium smelter in Gladstone. Of course, that offers a magnificent opportunity for us to corner the metals industry, not only for Queensland and for our city of Gladstone but also for Australia. It is unfortunate that I can speak for only 10 minutes, because I believe that I could spend an hour talking about the potential that Gladstone has to offer for industrial development. I just hope that every businessman out there and everyone who believes it is too hard will come up and have a look at what we have to offer. The only people out in the streets with placards will be those saying, 'We want you to invest, we want jobs for our kids and we are on your side'. That is the message that I want to get across today. We want investment in Gladstone, we want to see industrial development and we are ready to take on anyone who will come up. We will help them to develop the resources that Queensland has in abundance and support them in every way possible. Effects of Unemployment  I wish to draw the attention of the House to the positive efforts of community groups throughout Australia, but particularly within the Mallee electdrate, working in a united.ahd positive way to arrest the decline in social and economic viability of our towns, cities and districts that they serve. My grievance today is concern at the extreme levels of unemployment and the tragic exodus of young people from our region which, if not stopped, will culminate in a generation of our most skilled, capable and enterprising people being lost from our communities. Recently, the Sunraysia Development Corporation produced a report of which I have sent copies today to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and key Government Ministers. It is a chilling document indicating the shocking and stark realities of the current economic and social crisis which is ripping apart the very fabric of our rural societies. I get no pleasure out of raising these issues, but it seems to be the only way to get the Government to take notice and to acknowledge the horrible legacy of the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating)-the recession engendered by him and cultivated and nurtured by Government policies. I will provide the House with some facts from that report. One voluntary social support group, Mallee Family Care, now has two full time counsellors working 60 to 70 hours a week in an effort to assist the needs of people scattered over 2,000 square kilometres. They have reports of families who feel forced to leave the area through embarrassment about their financial failure. Emmaus House, a social support group which supplies meals at night to needy people, reports a 25 per cent increase in its service in the past 12 months. Forty adults who otherwise would not have enough to eat are being fed there each night. There has been a shift in the services at Emmaus House from providing to derelicts to now catering for families. We really wonder where the Prime Minister's promise about child poverty has ended up. The Christian Outreach Centre in the city has witnessed a 25 per cent increase in alcohol related problems and is now providing counselling for people who have never had a history of violence. In fact, the Centre is now providing counselling for professional people. Previously, this group was never represented. We are all aware of men who have lost their jobs but have not admitted this to their families. Their life is a daily charade of pretending to go to work. These men do not know how to explain the reality of unemployment. The total number of Sunraysia people who claimed social security benefits in March 1990 was 2,000. Today, that figure stands at in excess of 2,500-a 25 per cent increase in one year. The Department of Social Security reports increases in the number of wives and sons of farmers now claiming unemployment benefits. The Department estimates an increase of 20 per cent. Sunraysia police report an increase in credit related crime. The police report a significant increase in domestic violence from 1989 to 1990 and expect a further increase for this year. The Salvation Army in our region has spent more than $65,000 assisting people in need during the last 12 months. The value of food vouchers distributed in Mildura alone by the Salvation Army increased from $18,554 in 1989-90 to $28,550 in 1990-91-a 54 per cent increase in just one year. We can also look at family law applications to see what is happening in the area of family separation. Tragically, since October 1990 there has been an increase of 20 to 25 per cent compared with the previous corresponding year. Mildura City Council reports that there has been a 30 per cent increase in municipal rate receipts, many of which are now being paid quarterly instead of annually. One hundred and seventy-four summonses have been issued to defaulting ratepayers. A further 120 people have been forced to make arrangements outside of standard rate options to clear their debt. This is a tenfold increase. This impact is further highlighted by the fact that 50 per cent of rate payments in default to the Mildura City Council are from commercial, tourism or industrial premises. Previously, defaults were restricted purely to residential properties. Two men recently appeared in the Wentworth court charged with having shot a calf for food after they had failed to find any goats or rabbits for their families. Tragically, there were as many suicides as road fatalities in 1990 in the Sunraysia area-lO people committed suicide, while 11 died in road accidents. Tragically, half of those who committed suicide were between the ages of 25 and 44. The support group that I have already referred to, Mallee Family Care, is just one support agency, but it is processing five bankruptcies per week, of which 60 per cent are individuals, 20 per cent farmers and 20 per cent small business people. Figures from the Department of Social Security, when analysed in conjunction with historical unemployment figures of the Sunraysia, indicate unemployment for Sunraysia is about 20 per cent, which is approximately 100 per cent greater than the State average. We see commercial properties typically sitting idle for up to 15 months before a tenancy is obtained; we see residential ty values dropping 20 per cent in the past 18 months; and the property sales volume is approximately 50 per cent lower than in 1989. Reports from the Commonwealth Bank and the National Bank describe the commercial property market as dead, with many commercial buildings, particularly motels, on the verge of collapse. The tourism industry in the Sunraysia region is its No. 1 industry, contributing in excess of $90m annually to the economy. The survey of the Sunraysia Tourist Attraction Association shows a major downturn in business this year-between 40 and 50 per cent. The majority of tourist attraction operators in Sunraysia have been forced to dismiss staff. Between 60 and 80 per cent of permanent and casual staff have had their work hours drastically reduced. Due to the inability of the lessees to pay rent, three freehold motel mortgage auctions have taken place in the last 12 months and two motel leases have been taken over by the lessors. Houseboat operators-the introduction of houseboats has been one of the initiatives taken in our region over past years-report that 15 jobs have already been lost this year. One takes absolutely no pleasure in raising these issues. But how can we get governments across Australia to take notice and to show a recognition that commitment to the wealth producing sector is not just needed, but is essential for the standard of living of all Australians? I have farmers in my electorate living on less than $100 per fortnight; some live on rabbits shot on their properties, with one Mallee farmer having lived on rabbits and galahs for the past nine months. We all know of children being forced to leave school to save on farm labour costs. While Australia is spending millions of dollars promoting a Buy Australian campaign, recent attempts by State health Ministers to enforce country of origin labelling products have, in my view, failed and there seems to be no urgency to ensure that anti-dumping procedures are adequate to counter the corruption and subsidisation of world trade. One of the saddest situations is in the education, employment and training area. The proper- number of people in the Sunraysia area registered as unemployed was 40 per cent higher at the end of March than for the previous quarter. The current recession has hit all industry sections in the Sunraysia, but particularly retail, building and hospitality. Students have had to withdraw from tertiary studies owing to parental inability to provide financial support. An increasing number of people from rural areas are attempting to find employment, relinquishing skills training programs. While an increasing number of people seeking assistance do not fit into long term unemployment categories, there is a need for change to ensure that our most skilled, best qualified people unemployed also have the opportunity to take advantage of training opportunities. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) called on business to show some initiative and issued an invitation to business to be positive. I issue an invitation to the Government today to do something about our industrial relations situation and our outmoded work practices that are denying our youth self-esteem and work experience; to show some initiative in the area of taxation reforms in order to restore personal incentive and remove the burden of sales tax, once again returning the balance to the productive sector and giving some incentive to savings. I invite the Federal Government to reduce government expenditures in those areas that are not of a high priority and tum the real responsibility of government back to education. (Time expired) Interest Rates",65
43,Mr LES SCOTT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I too would like to make some remarks this afternoon about industry and, in particular, the interest rate reductions which have been going on for some time. I am sure that the further reductions yesterday were welcomed by everybody. The point that I really wish to grieve on relates to interest rate reductions. It is essential that the full reductions that were announced yesterday should be passed on to our business community in particular. Our housing sector would welcome that initiative as well. It is interesting to look at Reserve Bank statistics showing the reduction in 11 a.m. call interest rates over the past 12 months. Up to yesterday they had dropped by 4.5 per cent. The further one per cent reduction yesterday means a total decrease of 5.5 per cent. Unfortunately, the same reduction has not been seen in overdraft rates. Up to yesterday we had seen only a 3.5 per cent reduction; the best reduction made yesterday was 0.75 per cent, so the total overdraft rate decrease has been only 4.25 per cent, compared with the 5.5 per cent reduction in official rates. Interestingly, the base rates that banks charge compared to their margins-they have some flexibility in setting loan rates by being able to add a margin-have increased over that 12-month period. Twelve months ago we were looking at a margin of only 2.25 per cent, the difference between 17 per cent and 19.25 per cent. The recent September figures indicate that gap has now broadened to 3 per cent and there is certainly a lot of evidence to suggest that it is higher than that. But the figures for September of this year indicated a 3 per cent margin-from 13.5 to 16.5 per cent-showing a widening of that gap of 2.25 per cent. In my community, the business sector is taking many initiatives and I am sure that it will take advantage of the reductions made to date and would certainly welcome further reductions. In the short time available I would like to make some reference to the innovative things that are happening in industry in my electorate. A lot of credit must go to our local city council as well for the initiatives it has taken to encourage industry to the area. Organisations such as Pepsi have moved their operations to the city of Ipswich, which has eased dramatically the unemployment problems that we are all very concerned about at the moment. Many other industries, small and large, are thinking about moving their operations to Ipswich because there is little doubt that as time goes on that particular region of Australia is going to expand. When I spoke to the neighbouring Moreton Shire Council last week it indicated that its area of Queensland compares to part of the Sydney region some 40-odd years ago. The populations of Ipswich and Laidley now equal those of Parramatta and Penrith 40 years ago. This was just after the war and, if one takes the statistics from 1947 to 1986, one sees that Katoomba then can be similarly compared to Toowoomba now. Mr Taylor-A great city.",70
44,Mr LES SCOTT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It is quite interesting to look at the growth patterns we can expect over the next 20 to 30 years; we will see that sort of expansion. The honourable member for Groom and I will probably have much smaller electorates if the population growth in those areas is as indicated. Another big development is projected for the eastern part of my electorate, around Camira. A whole new city is to be developed. It has my full support and, from what I can gather, the full support and encouragement of the local shire council as well. Much infrastructure will have to be put in place to ensure that it is a success. It shows the growth of activity in the south-east Queensland region at the present time and it augurs well for the future of the State, particularly with the innovative ideas that are coming forward at the moment. I call on the banking industry to play its part in helping industry by ensuring that interest rates are reduced.",70
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Nehl)Order! It being 1.45 p.m., in accordance with standing order 106, the debate is interrupted and I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Homebush West Pharmacy",70
46,Dr BOB WOODS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The brutal irony of the Federal Labor Government's health policy is that even when it is achieving its stated goals, which is seldom enough, it actually manages to hurt people. Indeed, in my Own electorate of Lowe, people are nOW being hurt because of the ruthless manner. in which the Federal Government's Pharmacy Restructuring Authority is seeking to cut total pharmacy numbers. I refer to the Federal Government's PRA paying the former community chemist at Homebush West thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money to close his doors. Moreover, the Government will not now approve the application of a new local chemist to open a badly needed pharmacy. The result is that members of a community which is composed mainly of aged pensioners and low income families from non-English speaking backgrounds are now having to walk two kilometres across a desolate industrial yard to have scripts filled or to get basic medical advice from chemists. The Federal Government is yet again allowing accountants and bureaucrats, rather than medical professionals, to make health policy decisions. Calculators are pulled out; compassion is thrown away. It is hard to believe that this same Federal Government loudly praises itself for allegedly providing health care to all Australians. Talk is so cheap, but the reality is very different. Thankfully, in the face of the Government's crass display, the Homebush West community has stood up for its fundamental health care rights. Last week, 2,000 signatures were gathered; today, dozens of letters were the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) protesting this absolute insensitivity. I join that community in calling for the PRA to immediately reverse its ludicrous stand and let a community chemist open in Homebush West. The PRA should stick to its calculators and stay out of our community. We must look after the needs of the aged and the disadvantaged in our communities in general and Homebush West in particular. The Liberal and National parties will do just that. (Time expired) Consumption Tax",71
47,Mr LINDSAY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Every month since March has seen a gradual improvement in unemployment figures in the Townsville region, except for the last couple of months when the close-down of the sugar cane crushing season has seen a slight rise in unemployment figures; for example, last month there was an increase of nine unemployed people. As the economy picks up, further recovery is anticipated in the employment market. This recovery would be all for nothing if there were to be a consumption tax. North Queensland could face unemployment the like of which it has not known since the Depression of the 1930s, if Canada's experience of a consumption tax is any guide. According to an issue of Time magazine dated 30 September, job losses in the retailing industry in Canada since a consumption tax was introduced on 1 January this year are estimated at 14,000. It should be stressed that the federal consumption tax in Canada is imposed at 7 per cent, which is less than half the 15 per cent being mooted for Australia by the Liberal and National parties. Time quotes one Ontario study as putting the cost to Canadian retailers from January to September this year at a massive $2.2 billion. Canadians are going across the border into the very United States to shop and many retailers in Canada are going broke as a result. Australia'S fate will be similar if the Opposition introduces a consumption tax. Australians cannot drive over the border into another country to shop, so they will be sent to stuck with a consumption tax and have nowhere else to go for cheaper prices. Spending by Australians would almost certainly go into sharp decline, resulting in massive job losses in small and large retail outlets. Just as smaller centres in Canada are found to be suffering the most, cities and towns in regional Australia will be hurt very badly. (Time expiredAustralian Labelling Laws",71
48,Mr ANDREW,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to echo the sentiments of the honourable member for  ed in a debate just prior to statements by members. He pleaded with people to buy Australian. I note with pleasure that Riverland television station RTS SA, in conjunction with the Riverland Horticultural Council, has proposed that at 10 a.m. tomorrow it will release an advertisement that it has put together. The advertisement points out the advantages for all people, particularly those in the Riverland region, of buying Australian. I commend RTS SA and the Riverland Horticultural Council on this initiative. I call on the Government to take action on what is as important as buying Australian, that is, adequately labelling Australian produce. As a consumer in Parliament House, I find that, if I pick up Spring Valley fruit juice in the canteen, I do not know whether it is Australian or imported; I only know that it is a concentrated product. I think that the need for adequate labelling laws is urgent and the Government should dally no longer. Without adequate labelling laws, consumers cannot know whether they are consuming Australian. The need to buy Australian is critical whether we are talking about bananas, pineapples, citrus fruit or the products of any form of secondary industry. Even the motor vehicle industry would be aided if consumers were enthusiastic Australian purchasers. Consumers would have the opportunity to be discerning if the labelling indicated clearly whether the product was Australian or overseas in originPort Curtis Pottery",72
49,Mr COURTICE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Port Curtis Pottery was established in July 1989 by David Woergoetter and Laurine Field, both of whom are qualified art teachers. Port Curtis Pottery is conscious of the need to supply a quality product. In order to do this, the best quality stoneware clay is obtained from Melbourne; glaze material is obtained from Brisbane; and gas, when needed to fire the kilns, is obtained from Boral in Gladstone. The pottery is fired once, then glazed, then fired again, all according to traditional practice. Because each piece of pottery is entirely handcrafted using traditional methods, it develops a unique character of its own. This has proved to be an ideal selling point as each piece bought as a gift is slightly different. David and Laurine supply gift shops in Darwin, Perth, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Canberra. This proves how versatile the pottery is. It can be used as an everyday item or as a collector's piece. Colours chosen for the pottery are suitable for most modem decors. Port Curtis Pottery is one of the few Gladstone small businesses selling to interstate markets. Six people are employed in order to meet the demands of selling locally and supplying 140 gift shops Australia wide. David and Laurine have plans to expand their business and I am sure that this enterprising couple will continue to go from strength to strength in their chosen field. It is the sort of Aussie get up and go spirit that we need to see right across this country. Logging on Fraser Island",72
50,Mr TRUSS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Yesterday, at 11.30 a.m., 130 years of logging ended on Fraser Island. It was a very sad occasion. Fraser Island makes up some 10 per cent of Queensland's hardwood resources. Timber harvesting has been a way of life for many generations. Another great Australian industry has been lost. Particular mention must be made of the Postan family, who have been working on Fraser Island for more than half a century. It is a great tribute to the careful management of the timber industry on. that island that, after 130 years of logging, the areas that were harvested were still worthy of being made national parks and nominated for World Heritage listing. I want to pay tribute to the island's forestry workers, who are leaving with great dignity. They knew that the decision to end logging was illogical and made for all the wrong reasons. They had not responded to the outrageous provocation of the radical conservationists who tried to disrupt their day to day activities over recent years. Irresponsible radicals had undertaken protest which, on occasions, put their lives in danger. But the loggers went about their work quietly without seeking confrontation or organising media stunts. The local community should be proud of its timber workers and should thank them for the wonderful contribution that they have made to Australia and to the local economy. Their reward is to be offered temporary jobs as garbos, road repairers and toilet cleaners. Importantly, they can be proud of the wonderful order in which they have left Fraser Island. (TIme expired) Design Plus",72
51,Mr LES SCOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Recently, I had the opportunity to open a new business on behalf of the three owners of a joint business in my electorate. The local chamber of commerce and its recently retired chairman, Mark Willis, also participated in this function. This small business is unique. It is called Design Plus and is, in fact, three separate businesses. Peter Rea runs Design Marketing; Leanne O'Donoghue runs Sunset Media Professional Typesetting Service; and Steve Rigby runs Rapid Service Press. It is good to see young people moving into business as these three young people have done. Their idea is innovative. By coupling operations, the group has reduced its costs and, at the same time, has increased the range of services that it can offer, thereby making the business more attractive to potential clients. This concept great potential for many small businesses which may not be able to compete effectively on their own but which, through this type of group approach, could be better placed to meet client expectations. Of course, local business and industry needs to take action on such innovative ideas and take advantage of all the opportunities that are available to them. I offer my congratulations to Peter Rea, Leanne O'Donoghue and Steve Rigby in forming this new business. I wish them well in their future. Tasmanian Greens",73
52,Mr GOODLUCK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"If there is one thing that I hate it is the Greens of Tasmania. The five of them came to this Parliament the other day. I have been coming here for 17 years, yet it is rarely said that I am coming up to this Parliament to do some good for Tasmania. Mr Speaker, my good friend, I hope that you did not give them a pass into Parliament House because they wanted to get in here to try to persuade the Federal Governnlent not to introduce resource security legislation. What they did in Tasmania is cardinal. They cost the taxpayers of Australia $lOm. Who are these Greens? Can anyone tell me their names? They are the saintly Dr Brown; Di Hollister; that other yapper, Christine Milne; and Gerry Bates. Gerry Bates said that I was going to retire at the next election and go into the State Parliament. He would not know what day it is. The Greens will get their just desserts some time. The people of Tasmania will wake up to them and I hope to goodness that the people of Australia will also wake up to them. St Paul's Church, Woodridge",73
53,Ms CRAWFORD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to draw to the attention of the House a very important anniversary that passed last Sunday. It was the tenth anniversary of St Paul's Church in Woodridge. As many members of the House would know, Woodridge is a very poor and disadvantaged area. It has a high level of unemployment and it is very much a microcosm of Australian society. It was in that context that has St Paul's celebrated its tenth year with over 48 nationalities represented. All those people have chosen to make Australia their home. It is important for us to remember that St Paul's Church has provided a central focus for them and offered them enormous support in Australia. Much praise for the project must go to Father Tom Hegarty, who is currently at Sunnybank, and whose vision it was to ensure that the kinds of operations which were happening in local church halls and sheds around Woodridge in fact were conducted in a more substantial building. The church is used for a whole range of activities by the school, local community centres and many commu1'\ity groups. It enables people to participate in English language courses and the like. I think it is very much part of what the living church should be. I am delighted to be able to help celebrate the church's tenth anniversary and see the citizens of Woodridge find solace and support in what is very much a living church. (TIme expired) Media Standards",73
54,Mr TAYLOR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In recent weeks in Queensland there has been considerable public comment on moral standards, prostitution and pornography from Premier Goss down. While arguably Premier Goss is taking a conveniently high moral ground, much of what he said nonetheless reflects increasing public concern about the proliferation of rubbish in some magazines, on the television or cinema screen or in the video market. That concern at the family level is best exemplified by a recent letter from a lady in Toowoomba. She forwarded a colourful extract from a recent Cosmopolitan magazine on women's fantasies: In part, it reads: It had been bought by my 14-year-old daughter. Just by accident my husband saw it. We are both disgusted that our daughter could buy this rubbish. I for one as a parent will make sure I check magazines from now on. I think our Government should do a better job of cleaning up standards. It is never too late. If we all sit back and let our standards fall then they will. I received a similar letter on video standards from a local shire council which in part said: There appears to be a general reluctance by politicians of all parties to act in respect of this most important issue which has the potential to destroy the very fabric of our society. Whilst recognising our legal constraints, I have to say that I share both concerns. Consumption Tax",74
55,Mr COURTICE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Many farmers this year will pay no tax because of the crash of commodity prices, but under the policies of the Opposition, they will pay tax. They will pay consumption tax on the basic necessities of life. The reason that the Opposition has squibbed bringing out its policy is that it is running frightened. Waiting for the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to bring out his policy is like waiting for Elizabeth Taylor to announce her next engagement. Government members are waiting for it so we can hit the Opposition over the head with it.",74
56,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! It being 2 p.m., in accordance with sessional order 106A, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Solicitor-General  to the Attorney-General. I refer him to his extraordinary deal with the Solicitor-General, enabling the latter to get over $100,000 from the Commonwealth for nothing while earning a fortune at the Bar. I remind the Attorney General that he has still not told the House why this deal was done. The Attorney General says that the Solicitor-General is getting the same time off as Federal Court judges; but they do not go back to the Bar and earn a fortune while on the Commonwealth payroll.",74
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member might get to his question.  deal done.?,74
58,Mr DUFFY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Firstly, I repeat what I said yesterday, that the honourable member for Kooyong seems to be obsessed about some sort of a deal. As I pointed out yesterday, the leave entitlements of the Solicitor-General are the same as those of a Federal Court judge, which the honourable member seems to understand, because he indicated that in the preamble to his question. The Solicitor General was granted leave of absence for one year commencing on 1 January 1992. Under his terms of appointment, his entitlements to leave-as the honourable member correctly stated-are those of a Federal Court judge. In addition to that, his recreation leave, or leave combined with recreation leave, is the same as that for a Federal Court judge. I was approached by the Solicitor-General and he requested leave. He then discussed it with me and requested my consent under the Law Officers Act to allow him to engage in private practice. Subject to laying down conditions which I thought were absolutely necessary to indicate that there would be no conflict between the role of a Solicitor General on leave and somebody practising at the Bar and, in particular, in respect of what briefs would be taken and those sorts of matters, I granted him the right, as I was entitled to do under section 9 of the Law Officers Act. It was not a matter of a deal but a matter of going through the processes and determining what would be done in the circumstances that I was faced with. During those discussions, the Solicitor-General told me why, rather than spending a year fishing or whatever else he may have wanted to do, he wanted to spend a period back at the Bar. Those reasons were personal reasons given to me by the Solicitor General, and, quite bluntly, I do not think they are any of the honourable member's business. Unemployment  the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Can he inform the House of the unemployment rate for October? Further, do the figures indicate that recovery is in train?",74
59,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a fact that the ABS released the labour market figures for the month of October today. Those figures reveal a fall in employment of just under 19,000 for the month of September. However, this disguises to some extent an increase in full time employment of 22,500, which I think must be taken as perhaps a glimmer of optimism in terms of the turnaround, perhaps, in the labour market itself. There was a further fall in the participation rate to 63 per cent and, as a consequence, the unemployment rate fell from 10.2 per cent to 10.1 per cent, with the numbers of unemployed falling by just over 12,000. I have been cateful on all these monthly occasions not to read too much into the figures. They have tended to dance around a bit from month to month. Whilst·it is obviously better to observe a slight fall in the unemployment rate than a rise, I would nevertheless caution anyone about reading too much into these monthly figures. Nevertheless, I do note that the trend series has been very stable over the last few months, which does seem to indicate that at least there seems to have been a bottoming in the decline in the labour market itself. From what we can discern, from things such as my Department's leading indicators and other statistics, we should expect by the end of this year a return to a growth in employment itself. That will not, by the end of this year, necessarily lead to a dramatic fall in the unemployment rate, but at least we will see jobs growing again by the end of this year if those predictions, as indicated by the leading indicator, are to be borne out. I would make the observation that whi1st the Opposition has been very enthusiastic about exaggerating the extent of unemployment in this country, and whilst it has always been trying to portray the number of people out of work as being a million, of course it is far less than a m1l1ion, at just over 850,000. One does not take any comfort from the fact that there are 850,000 out of work, and we need to do all we can not only to get those people back to work but also to support them during this difficult period that they and their families are enduring whilst they remain out of work. It does no-one any good, neither the unemployed nor the economy as a whole, for the Opposition to run around, as it has been doing repeatedly, pretending that there are a million people out of work, particularly when one bears in mind that the Opposition's policy is not only to further extend the number of people out of work but also to rip away the support which exists for those people who are out of work. The other point I make is that I have concentrated very much on the circumstances of teenagers, particularly the 15to 19-yearold age group. It is comforting to know that there are about 40,000 fewer young people out of work than there were in 1983. I think that means that the Government has been particularly successful in encouraging more of those people to remain in the education and training system and therefore improve their prospects of getting a job when they emerge from the education and training system. Solicitor-General  Attorney-General. It stems from the answer he just gave in confirming that the leave entitlement of a\ Federal Court judge flows to the Solicitor-General. I refer the Attorney-General to the second paragraph of the background paper. that he issued to the media and others last night, and to the decision of the Executive Council dated 17 December 1990, which indicates that the Solicitor-General was holding office in respect of leave of absence on the same terms and conditions as those which a judge of the Federal Court holds, but only from 17 December 1990-in which case, in less than a year, how can the Solicitor General accrue such lengthy leave? Is this not a retrospective paid leave entitlement? Would he table the Solicitor-General's 1984 terms of appointment, the 1990 terms of appointment, his recent application for leave, and the formal granting of leave?",75

64,Mr DUFFY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I withdraw that the honourable member for Kooyong is either dopey or a creep. It indicates a total lack of capacity the honourable member for Kooyong to research or examine anything.

66,Mr DUFFY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The appointment is dated 21 December 1983. It was exactly the same on 21 April 1988 in relation to long service leave and it was exactly the same on 17 December 1990. On that basis; I have been asked to table those documents. I think it would be delightful if the honourable member for Kooyong would spend a bit of time reading something instead of running around carrying on about deals. From the honourable member's point of view, there is nothing better than a little bit of education in this area.",76

68,Mr HULLS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Prime Minister: can he inform the House of the implications for the economy generally of today's employment figures and yesterday'S reduction in official interest rates?,76
69,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Kennedy for his question. I give my reply on the basis of the appropriate answer given by my colleague Mr Dawkins. Today's labour force survey resultsMr MCGauran-Is he a friend?,76
70,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, friend and colleague. Today's labour force survey figures show that the unemployment rate in October was above 10 per cent. May I say on behalf of the by Government that the prospect of unemployment remaining at that level is unacceptable. The recession, I concede, has been deeper and longer than any of us would have wanted. Certainly the pain it has brought has naturally dominated people's perceptions of the current situation. That is perfectly understandable, Mr Speaker, as I think you would agree. But today's figures also show, as the Minister said, that in trend terms employment has stabilised and that full time employment seems to be beginning to pick up. Certainly on that basis, these figures provide no support for the Opposition merchants of doom and gloom. Of course, these figures, important as they are, are only part of a wider picture and that wider picture is one of an economy in the early stages of a recovery. Yesterday, the Reserve Bank moved official interest rates down a further one percentage point and we are already seeing that flow into reductions in rates for home buyers and businesses. That reduction in rates to their lowest levels for over a decade, let me emphasise, was made possible, of course, by the reductions that we have achieved in inflation and the widespread perception which is reflected in inflation expectations that these reductions will be permanent. The partial indicators show clearly that these interest rate reductions are already leading to a recovery in the housing sector. We have also seen a sustained improvement in consumer confidence. From the behaviour of stocks and from the various business surveys, we can also see the beginnings of a return of business confidence. Mr Costello-Ra, hal Where have you been? You have been out of the country too long.",76
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is far too much noise around the chamber.,77
72,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Just as the Attorney-General suggested that his shadow should read the statistics, when I refer to business confidence, there is, as I hope honourable members would know, a series of surveys which are undertaken by banks and employer organisations and which measure trends in business confidence. When I make the remarks that I do, that from these surveys one can see the beginnings for a return of business confidence, I am referring to those surveys-surveys which, earlier in the cycle, Opposition members used against us. They should not now try to say that the surveys do not exist and should not try to run away from the conclusions which they show. Obviously the economy has been through an extremely difficult period. It would be stupid in any sense to try to write that down, and we do not.",77
73,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Whose fault was that? Dr Bob Woods-Why was that, Bob?",77
74,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is an indication of why those opposite are upset. The fact is that they do not like it, but the fact is that the Australian economy is showing clear signs that the difficult period is coming to an end. It is a tragedy that those on the other side of the Parliament are upset about the fact that the Australian economy is recovering. It is a measure of their real concern for the unemployed in this country. As soon as there are any signs of the economy recovering, they start to get gloomy about it. Mr Sharp interjecting",77
75,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Orderl The honourable member for Gilmore!,77
76,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the cyclical influences begin to move in our favour, the real benefits of permanently lower inflation and a more competitive economy will start to flow through to Australian workers. The fundamental reforms that we have secured and to which I have referred, and which we are continuing to achieve in the Australian economy, will ensure that that flow of benefits, which we have all worked so hard to achieve, will be permanent and of lasting benefit not only to the workers but to the whole of the Australian economy and people. Solicitor-General  the Attorney-General will restrain himself, I would like to ask, as I am only now getting the pages that he has tabled, whether he will in fact table those documents that I asked; namely, the terms of appointment for 1984 and 1990? If in fact, as I must accept without having time to read these documents, the Attorney-General is telling the truth in terms of the leave of absence",77
77,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, come onl That is a bit rough.  always shown great sensitivity on questions of integrity and he ought to be very sensitive today.",77
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Kooyong will ask his question or resume his seat.  satisfies me on the question of leave of absence, why will he not table the 1984 terms of appointment, the 1990 terms of appointment and, if this has been operating in terms or leave of absence since 1983, why did he say in hi- background paper last night that it was operating only from December 1990? Mr DUF.FY - As I understand the shadow Attorney-General, he asked: why did I not table the conditions of appointment or the instrument of appointment from 1984? The reason is that there are not any. The Solicitor General was appointed three times. He was appointed, firstly, on 21 December 1983, which I have just tabled; he was appointed again on 21 April 1988, which I have just tabled; and he was appointed again on 17 December 1990. I cannot find the imaginary appointment referred to. I do not know whether there is any such document for 1983 and 1984. Mr Reith-The background document. Mr DUFFYI have in fact tabled the three appointments of the Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia at the moment. The first is dated 21 December 1983, commencing on 1 January 1984. If the honourable member looks at the background paper, which he has been sleuthing about, he will see that I have said: Dr Griffith was first appointed as Solicitor-General in 1984. That is when he was appointed by an instrument dated 21 December 1983. If the honourable member has a look at the first paragraph, he will see that it says: For not less than five years to be Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth for the period of seven years commencing on 1 January 1984. Therefore, there is no instrument of appointment dated 1984. That is why I have not tabled it. It is December 1983. Interest Rates",77
79,Mr NEWELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. In the light of yesterday'S easing in official interest rates, will the Treasurer explain to the House how this will be reflected in commercial rates? What has been the reaction of the financial market and the housing industry to the further easing in these rates?",78
80,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Following the meeting of the Reserve Bank board on Tuesday, the Government and the Reserve Bank, as honourable members know, agreed to a further one per cent reduction in cash rates to around 8 112 per cent. As honourable members know, this is the tenth reduction in interest rates since January 1990 and results in cash rates of less than half the level of that tim$. The Government expects that this reduction will be reflected quickly in lending rates. But neither the Government nor the Reserve Bank has made any approach, either formal or informal, to the banks to encourage them to pass more of the reduction to anyone type of borrower. The initial reaction of at least one bank has been reduced rates for business borrowers by slightly more than for home lending. That is probably because the banks have been competing very hard in the home loan area and are unlikely to shave margins to win market share. Competition has not been as intense in the business loan sector and there probably exists greater scope for reduction in rates to these borrowers. Let me reiterate what I said yesterday: this reduction in interest rates reflects the further evidence of declines in inflation and inflation expectations. Monetary policy will continue to be assessed on the basis of prospective movements in economic activity, inflation expectations and the world economic outlook. The full effect of past easings has not yet worked through the economy. Yesterday'S lowering of rates and the previous easings will continue to assist the recovery over the foreseeable tuture. The Government is taking a. responsible economic approach, maximising the likelihood that the economic recovery will be steady and sustainable in terms of both economic growth and jobs. It will also be avoiding the risk that inflation will re-emerge. This is not just the Government's view. For example, Professor Ian Harper, Professor of Economics at Melbourne University, expressed similar sentiments, when he said: The Government was taking a responsible economic approach, and maximising the likelihood that the economic recovery would be slow and steady without risking the re-emergence of inflation. This cut in rates has not put us back on the ro1ler coaster and even though it is politically convenient it is economically justified and responsible. Commonwealth-State Financial Relations",78
81,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Now that he has had time to reflect on the matter, what is his position on income tax sharing with the States? Is it still a straw man or does he now favour it and consider it a viable option for discussion at the next Premiers Conference?",79
82,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition raised this question yesterday in the context of a draft document which had been given to him by some source of which we are not sure, but it does not matter. At that stage I had not seen the document, but I make these points about it and about the question it raises. It is marked clearly as a draft. Whether it represents the formal position of the States remains to be seen. In respect of the contents of that document tabled and marked 'draft' let me say quite clearly that it is my view that the proposal relating to taxation appears to me to be for a State income tax. As I have already made clear, that is not an option which finds favour with me. Last night I spoke to Premier Bannon to confirm the arrangements for a scheduled meeting with him and Mr Greiner tomorrow. Mr Bannon told me that he did not regard the proposal that would be put to us as a State income tax. That adviceMr Reith-Nor does the draft.",79
83,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,79
84,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have made it quite clear that as far as I am concerned what I see in the draft is a proposal for a State income tax. Mr Reith-Come on. Have you read it? That is just not the case.,79
85,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This advice that they do not see that they will be proposing a State income tax would be certainly consistent with the public comments that have been made by the Premiers. Mr Reith-That is why they wrote to you.,79

89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Hume and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,79
90,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Sydney Morning Herald of 24 October reported Mr Bannon as saying that he did not believe that Australia would gain anything by giving the States income taxing powers. The Melbourne Age of 26 October reported that Premier Kirner had ruled out a State income tax. On Monday of this week the Australian quoted Mr Greiner as saying: Basically, any notion of a State having anything that could be reasonably interpreted as a State income tax is not on. I have indicated that-not only in my judgment but also in the judgment of all those with whom I have consulted and who have read this-it is the unanimous opinion that the proposal is for a State income tax. All I can say is that Mr Bannon and Mr Greiner will give me their final document tomorrow. I will not comment further on the detail of the document, the status of which is uncertain, before I have received anything formally from the States, which, as I say, I hope and expect to receive from them tomorrow. Norfolk Island",79
91,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories and concerns the rights of residents of Norfolk Island. Why has the Government decided to attach the island to the division of Canberra for electoral purposes for future national elections?",79
92,Mr SIMMONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question.",79
93,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,79
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! If the Leader of the National Party and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition continue to interject I will deal with them.,79
95,Mr SIMMONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Government has decided that any Australian citizen, no matter where he or she lives, should be entitled to the same representation here in the national Parliament. That should extend to the territory of Norfolk Island. At the same time, the Government recognises that special circumstances surround the history of Norfolk Island. On that basis, not all citizens of Norfolk Island wish to be represented in this Parliament. Accordingly, in responding to the House of Representatives report entitled Islands in the Sun, the Government decided to make available the facility of optional enrolment-I stress 'optional' enrolment-for those Australian citizens in Norfolk Island who may wish to vote in Federal elections. Under section 122 of our Constitution, the Parliament may grant parliamentary representation to the territories to the extent and on such terms that it thinks fit. There would be constitutional difficulties associated with allowing people on Norfolk Island to vote in an electoral division within a State. A referendum would be clearly required to alter the boundaries of the particular State. No such constitutional difficulties exist in the case where it is suggested that Norfolk Island be attached to a mainland territory. Indeed, such a provision clearly exists in the case of the Cocos and Christmas Islands, which of course are very ably represented in this chamber by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. Based on advice from the Australian Electoral Commission it is proposed to attach Norfolk Island to the division of Canberra for electoral purposes only. Again, I have every confidence that those people who choose optional enrolment will be extraordinarily represented by my colleague the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. This electorate was suggested because the other ACT electorate, the division of Fraser, includes the Jervis Bay territory. has been suggested by some people that Norfolk Islanders should be free to choose whichever electorate they wish to vote in. The Government considers that the interests of Norfolk Island electors would be more effectively served if they were to vote as part of one division and be represented in this Parliament by a single member clearly answerable to the people of Norfolk Island, rather than having their representation spread across many Federal divisions. The Commonwealth Electoral Act also has a clear residential basis. An exception is made in the case of itinerant electors and eligible overseas electors because they do not necessarily have an identifiable place of residence within Australia in which they can enrol. In the case of Norfolk Island, potential enrollees ordinarily would be resident on Norfolk Island. Therefore, it would be consistent with the approach taken with voters elsewhere in the ACT for territory voters to be enrolled at their address on Norfolk Island. Prime Minister",80
96,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Prime Minister how he can allow the situation to continue which is so poisonous that it has moved the Deputy Premier of Queensland to say: But I will tell you this: in the long term it will be Australia that will be the loser for it.

105,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank him for that interjection. He has asked about new federalism this year. Okay, let us give it to him. We will tell him what has happened to new federalism this year-a matter which was commented on at the end of the conference in most glowing terms by each of the Premiers. So should they have, because this is, together, what we achieved under new federalism then: first, for the first time in the history of this country we will have a National Rail Corporation, under which an AustralianMr Atkinson-It has not started yet.",81

109,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,81
110,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a measure of the inanity and the insanity of those honourable members opposite that they are trying to say that the National Rail Corporation decision has not been effectively made. Secondly, we now have a situation in regard to road transport whereby we will, for the first time in the history of this country, have a system in which registration and matters going to the way in which heavy transport operates and uses the roads will be subject to an agreement under the National Roads Commission. Thirdly, I refer to the electricity ment under which, again for the first time in the history of this country, we will have the processes whereby we will have discussion between and integration of the States on the eastern seaboard and South Australia to bring about a situation that will mean that in the future, as a result of work that this Government has done through the new federalism approach, domestic consumers and industry in the future will be able to receive electricity at prices cheaper than they otherwise would have. Fourthly, in regard to regulation, up until this year, since Federation, we have had a situation in which a manufacturer in one State would have to satisfy a set of regulations there, another set of regulations in another State, and another set of regulations in another State. Under the agreement reached with the new federalism approach, what is recognised and satisfied in one State will be accepted in the other States of the Commonwealth. Therefore, in regard to those four matters of road, rail, electricity and business regulation, under this process of new federalism, which the Opposition seeks to decry, those are the achievements of this year. I simply conclude: that is characteristic of the Government; it is a reflection of the way in which this Government has continued to go about the business of government. It will continue to do it, and it will do it in a way which will mean that when we meet the Opposition in 1993, when finally the people have to make their decision, there will be no doubt about the decision that they will make-it will be the same decision that they made right throughout the 1980s. The Opposition will be rejected again because the basic instability in politics is not in the Labor side, it is in the conservative side. Rural Assistance Package",81
111,Mr COURTICE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy whether he is aware of the criticisms by the Cattle Council of Australia of the new rural assistance package that he announced last week? If so, what is his response to the Council's claim that the Federal Government has failed in the measures announced in the package to recognise the special needs of cattle producers hit grid agreeby the severe drought?",81
112,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of the criticisms. They are unfounded. I think it is generally true to say that the package which was announced by me last week has generally been well accepted in the rural community because it is recognised as providing substantial relief and is targeted to those areas most in need. It needs to be understood against the background of the Cattle Council's criticisms that, firstly, drought is not the only problem besetting rural Australia at the moment and, secondlyMr MCGauran-And interest rates, of course?",81
113,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will come to that in a minute. Secondly, it ignores the criticisms that were levelled at past drought policysomething which the Government has had to have regard to. On the question of the issues affecting rural Australia at the moment, it should be understood that whilst the rural recession is as bad if not worse today than it was in 1982-83, it was predominantly drought that was the cause in 1982-83. The problem is compounded today by low commodity prices and the high level of debt that certain sections of the farm community have had to meet. Therefore, it requires a comprehensive response, not just a response based on drought. This was the point that was well and truly argued in the debate on a matter of public importance in this House a couple of weeks ago. I think it is acknowledged by those on the other side of the Parliament. That point needs to be understood. Our strategy has been to develop sound policy that genuinely meets the needs of those people most affected, that targets that assistance and that is aimed at keeping good farmers on the land so that we have a secure base when we come out of the recession. The second point that needs to be understood is that a lot of rorting used to go on under the old drought policy. That was something that we had to address. The history of drought in Queensland-the State which is experiencing the most severe drought at the moment-is that between 1964 and 1989, under previous National Party administrations, some Queensland shires were drought declared 70 per cent of the time because those announcements were triggered by the State of Queensland. Many other areas were drought declared 50 per cent of the time. Honourable members should understand that more than three-quarters of the drought assistance went to only 16 per cent of the properties-the larger ones. That is the problem we are faced with. We have to recognise the problem on the one hand, but on the other hand we have to stop the rorts and make sure that the relief is targeted to those people most in need. Having said that, I am fully aware of the claims that those affected by severe droughts deserve special consideration. Where droughts are so bad that, for example, the breeding herd is being run down to the extent that it jeopardises - he future development of the industry, I believe that requires further consideration on the part of the Government. I acknowledge that. The rural assistance package that I announced last week will allow for that consideration through a review of the Commonwealth funding arrangements under the NDRA, and the formulation of a national drought policy which all States have said should be dealt with in February. So let us get that point clear to start with. As for the package itself, we should understand that the lion's share of the extra RAS assistance$lOm to New South Wales and $12m to Queensland out of the $30m for the rest of this financial year-is going to the States most affected by the drought. What are the elements of this package? It needs to be seen not just because of its comprehensiveness but because of the way in which it has addressed a number of issues. As a result of the announcement there will be a total of $140m extra over the next two years, made up of $37.5m by way of social security relief, $2m in Austudy extension and $100m in RAS extensions.",82

The reality is that this is a package of significance, it is a package that has substance and it is a package that will provide real relief. For the first time, we have recognised the particular needs of people in the farm community who are not able to access income support mechanisms, and we have provided that relief. We believe that some 2,000 farm families will benefit from direct access to income support as a result of these changes. And why? Because what we have done is to recognise",82

129,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In relation to the increased RAS assistance, I have indicated that it will be $lOOm over the next two years, with $30m this year; I have changed the ratio at which the Commonwealth will contribute to part B of RAS, whereby it will match everyone of the States' dollars with $2, which is a ratio 2:1 instead of 1:1; the national drought policy will, with the agreement of the States, be reviewed in February; there will be twice-ayear reviews of the adequacy of RAS funding, so that if the circumstances have not improved, we will be looking at what else is required in the early part of next year; I have extended the six-month breathing space under part C so that those who want to access income support under that mechanism do not have to make the immediate decision to leave the land; and I have also indicated that I am prepared to review the income equalisation deposits scheme to see if it cannot better fit the needs of those people on the land. That is the comprehensive nature of the policy. It is not just focused on drought, but it does recognise the severe contribution that drought is making to the rural crisis at the moment. This is a package about keeping good farmers on the land; it is a recognition of the severity; it will continue to be monitored. I believe there is a healthy and strong future for agriculture in this country. This package is about securing the base, and honourable members opposite ought to get out and promote its benefits.

Is it not a fact that the Premiers' proposal is for 'shared personal income tax arrangements', that there is absolutely no mention whatsoever of new State income taxes, for the very reasons as stated publicly by the Premiers, as the Prime Minister himself quoted a moment ago? The fact of the matter is",83
131,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Will the honourable member get to his question.,83
132,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The fact of the matter is that the Prime Minister's claims are simply a straw man which he knocked down to disguise his monumental embarrassment at the collapse of the financial relations negotiations.,83
133,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have already answered this question.,83
134,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think the first part of the of question is in order; I am not quite sure whether the second part was a question at all.,83
135,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course 'it was not; but I can very quickly deal with it. As I said in answer to a previous question, the shadow Treasurer refers to the 'Premiers' proposal'. I have been told by Mr Bannon that they will be putting their proposal to me tomorrow. When I see that proposal I will see whether the judgment that I have made in regard to what I find in the draft as being a proposal for a State income tax is confirmed. Until I receive their proposal I have no more to say.",84
136,Mr ONEIL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Communications. Can the Minister inform the House of the progress in providing SBS services to South Australia, in particular to the Spencer Gulf region? Is this program for introducing SBS services on target? Mr BEAZLEYI am delighted to be to say that in no small fashion owing to the constant nagging by the honourable member for Grey, SBS television is indeed scheduled for completion and will be delivered in the Spencer Gulf region, including Whyalla"" during 1993. When that occurs it will obvithe ously be of considerable benefit to all constituents. They are going, to find that SBS television service, when they see it, will have benefited considerably from the better funding that we have been able to arrange SBS in recent times and its ability to get own Australian-developed programming under way as a result of its better capacity through its rights over advertising and sponsorship. When SBS arrives, the honourable the member's constituents will be provided not only with the excellent services that SBS levels? provides now but many more as well. Its arrival will also be an opportunity for them to see not only those services on the cultural side, which are of direct concern to the ethnic members of his constituency, but also the very substantial involvement of SBS in sporting programs and news services. The SBS news is probably the best quality international news that is broadcast. So as a result of the constant efforts by honourable member for Grey, he is going to deliver some very material benefits to his constituents, and they will unquestionably rise up and call his blessing. Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements",84
137,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Prime Minister to recall a statement made yesterday by Dr Carmen Lawrence, when she said: We have never wanted State income tax powers. We wanted a reasonable and guaranteed share of the income that goes from the taxpayers of Australia to the Commonwealth of Australia. SBS Unless the Prime Minister moves quickly to quash any suggestion, for instance, that the States cannot even have considered a predictable and reliable supply of economic revenue, then we are getting nowhere and getting nowhere fast. I ask the Prime Minister to forget the straw man that he constructed in his earlier answer and to simply answer the question: is he or is he not prepared to consider income tax able sharing 1')owers with the States?",84
138,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have already answered this question yesterday and twice today. I refllse to add to what I have said. Road Transport Charges,84
139,Mr WRIGHT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to Minister for Land Transport. I refer him his to the original Butcher report and those the matters subsequently under consideration which directly affect the road transport industry and also Australians living outside the for capital cities. In view of the claims, the its rumours and the scaremongering that are raging about proposed massive increases in road transport charges, will he clarify the present situation and advise the House as to progress being made in negotiations with that industry on the proposed new charging",84
140,Mr GOODLUCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Reduce the price of LPG.,84
141,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would be delighted to. The most important, significant and comprehensive package of reforms ever introduced for road transport in Australia has been accompanied by what is probably one of the most appalling exercises in political misrepresentation ever. I preface my answer to the question by making the observation that the the national benefit of those reforms will represent something like $1.5 billion every year in increased GDP. Some of those misrepresentations which have taken place have been deliberately engineered by people ing around the country, particularly in Queensland. I know the honourable member for Capricornia is aware of this, because brought to me his concern about some of the outlandish statements that have been made people such as Senator Ron Boswell and Senator Bill O'Chee, who have been travelging ling around Queensland deliberately misreprebers senting the circumstances. As a result of misrepresentations and the fear and apprehenwill sion which those persons are causing, many people in the road transport industry who have mortgaged their homes to buy a rig will possibly try to dispose of their rig, at a loss, before the final details are apparent. If bers of the Opposition think that is smart, the credibility of people such as Ron Boswell and Bill O'Chee will be measured when those final results are known, and their credibility will be measured against mine. Opposition members inteljecting",84
142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,85
143,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have already indicated what those proposals will be. In July of this year, at the last Special Premiers Conference-and the Prime Minister has already referred to the reforms that came about in the area of road transport-the most significant package that has ever been put together was agreed to by the Premiers. All we had to do was ensure that the details would become known as they were developed. They will be considered later this month by the Prime Minister, together with the Premiers and the Chief Ministers. They have agreed to introduce uniformity of regulaBoswell tions for road transport operators across Australia. For the first time in the history Australia, that will be done. It has been welcomed and applauded by all the industry, who want that uniformity. In addition, we are in the process of clarifyterm. ing which parts of the road network will the responsibility of each level of government. So there will be greater transparency, less ambiguity, less confusion, less uncertainty greater efficiency, as the Prime Minister indicated. We are also in the process finalising the establishment of a National movRoad Transport Commission so that we will have something which is a little more independent and is divorced from political interference in the uniformity that we want to he has establish and maintain. In addition to that, for the purposes of by equity, simplicity and efficiency, we are seeking to introduce national uniform chararrangements. I know that many memof the Opposition have been repeating these some of the claims that have been made. I now put the matter clearly on the record so that, if any of them continue with any deliberate attempt to misrepresent it, they will be exposed for those misrepresentations, for the dishonesty which lies behind them and for memany damage which is caused to road transport operators as a result of it. In connection with the six-axle articulated vehicles, the officers who were charged with the responsibility for developing a schedule of indicative or possible charges tabled that schedule at the last Special Premiers Conference. It was simply received by the Premiers; it was not endorsed. The proposition that was put forward was that by the middle of this decade there would be introduced in two stages a level of charges which would more closely and more sensibly approach the typcs of costs that the road transport operators impose on that road network. For six - axle articulated vehicles, by the start of 1993 the first instalment of those charges would be made, and by the middle of this decade, 1995, the total charge would be in place. The total charge proposed is $7,000 or $8,000. That accords with the charge that already exists in New South Wales, yet and O'Chee have been saying that the $7,000 will come in in 1993, and that in of 1995 it will be $14,000. That is a lie.",85
144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Minister will the people in withdraw the term.,85
145,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw the That is a deliberate misrepresentation, be and the Opposition knows it. I say to the Leader of the National Party that in Roma he repeated some of that. He is causing fear to and people out there and encouraging them to sell their single rig to some of those big transport of operators, and to lose their home in the process. We understand what the Opposition's agenda is. In response to the honourable member for Capricornia's question, the initial ISC report proposed that the charge for the B-doubles be about $44,000. The schedule of charges that was tabled at the last Premiers Conference suggested that the charge should be $11 ,000 or $12,000 a year. That is what is already paid in New South Wales and Victoria. The ISC's proposal for the triple deck road trains, which was put forward initially in its report of May last year, was a charge of $70,200. The indicative charges, contrary to that, suggest that there should be a 50 per cent discount for those operators, and the 50 per cent discount would represent something like $11,000 in 1995, and at the end of this decade-10 years down the track-there would be a more appropriate level of charges for those operators as well. I make this point as wellMr Downer-Oh, sit down. Mr MCGauran-You are used to audiences not wanting to hear you.",85
146,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure that the Opposition does not want to hear it-but it will. The next point that I make gives a good indication of the absurdity of the position that has been adopted. Mr Fred Finch, the Minister for Transport in the Northern TerritoryMr Snowdon-A donkey.",86
147,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,A donkey.,86
148,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Minister will withdraw that, and he might be less inflammatory in his remarks.",86
149,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw it, but I indicate that he carried out some calculations. He suggested that the additional cost to ordinary households in the Northern Territory from this exercise would be about $700 a year. I knew that that could not be so, so we checked his calculations. He put the decimal point in the wrong place. I will not call him a donkey, but he put the decimal point in the wrong place. It was not $700 a year; at the very maximum it was $70 a year. The more recent work which has been done indicates that in those towns where the greatest impact might be felt, the a4ditional cost per household will be between 16c and 33c a week. In conclusion, I have indicated that the national benefit is about $1.5 billion a year in improved GDP. The whole exercise, as far as the road transport industry is concerned, is intended to be revenue neutral. There will not be one extra dollar, as far as the Government can possibly ensure it, taken out of the road transport industry as a result of this. But the national efficiency under the Hawke Government's micro-economic reform will represent $1.5 billion a year. If Opposition members, by their misrepresentations, are effective in sabotaging that in any way, the responsibility will rest with them, as it should.",86
150,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. Solicitor-General",86
151,Mr DUFFY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, I wish to add to an answer to the first question in· Question Time from the honourable member from Kooyong (Mf Peacock). In tabling the documents, I think I described the document dated 21 December 1983-that is, the document appointing Dr Griffith from January 1984-as the appointment of Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth; that is correct. The second document dated 21 Apri11988 is the determination and telIDS and conditions on which the Solicitor General holds office. It was not a document of appointment, and I am pleased to advise it was not a document which altered the long service leave entitlements of the Solicitor General but did alter, in fact, his recreation leave. The third document was correctly described-that is, the one dated 17 December-as for the appointment of Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth. NA",86

153,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"by leave-I move: That the Prime Minister no longer possesses confidence of this House. We have this morning received another unemployment figure in excess of 10 per cent, which is now the second consecutive figure in double digits, yet all we have is a Government that is totally preoccupied with one job; that is, it is concerned with preserving the job of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who is being challenged by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). He has just left this chamber; he is trying to unseat the present Prime Minister. Only one job is the focus of the Government's attention, when there are nearly one million Australians-and we stand by that figure-who are unemployed and some 500,000 to 600,000 other Australians who are working fewer hours than they want to work because they have been pushed to shorter shifts or onto part time work or because they simply cannot find enough employment to satisfy their desire to work. Yet, in the midst of that situation, we have a Government which is in a total shamblesindeed, a Government which now has broken into open warfare whereby members of the parliamentary party are attacking members of the organisation and vice versa, and as well members of the parliamentary party are visibly and openly attacking each other. The halls of this place are alive with members of both sides of the leadership challenge running around trying to get the numbers to ensure a successful challenge by the honourable member for Blaxland. But the warfare has now become so open that they have actually pitched the firearms. They have fired all the bullets and they are into hand to hand combat as they come out of the trenches. We have had no better example of that than the events of the last couple of days with Senator Richardson attacking the"" Deputy Premier of Queensland because of his remarks that he thought the honourable member for Blaxland ought to be disciplined. Senator Richardson went on the attack last night at a branch meeting somewhere in New South Wales where he referred to the Queensland parliamentary organisation as boozers. He identified one of its members as a racial bigot the and anti-Japanese. He was just getting warmed up, I gather, as far as the newspaper reports were concerned. In response, we have now had the Deputy Premier of Queensland coming back and referring to Messrs Keating and Richardson and other members of the New South Wales Right as having absolutely no concern about this nation at all. As long as they get their mate up, they are not interested in anything but themselves. Similarly, we have had other leading members of the ALP in recent days, like MCLean, I think a vice-president of the ALP, making a very hardline statement that if Paul Keating were to become Prime Minister it would be a disaster - ational1y. This is the state of the warfare which has broken out in recent days, and some very detailed statements have been put on the record about the role of the relative parties in this fight. For example, this morning on AM Burns said: The thing about Mr Richardson of course is that he likes the personal attack because he can't defend what he is doing there. All these people that are rushing out to defend Keating now know that the New South Wales Right have made up their mind to destroy the Government if they can't get the leadership. They don't care about the Labor Party. They don't care about the rank and file. They don't care about the unemployed. They haven't done anything for the unemployed for years these fellows and it's about time someone told them straight, 'We're sick of it'. I could not agree more. The people of Australia are absolutely sick of the fact that the Prime Minister has not got the capacity to lead this country, has not got the capacity to pull his troops into line and has not got the capacity to deliver any significant reform in this country. It is now 18 months since the last election. The only thing he has done for the unemployed in that period is to increase their number. Under his own policies and by his own admission, those numbers are going to keep going up through to 11 or 111/4 per cent, as revealed in leaked documents, in the course of the next six to 12 months with no prospect of substantial improvement in the first half of the 1990s. Indeed, using the Government's own model and analysing its own forecasts, we see that the unemployment rate in Australia will still, under its policies, or its policy inactivity, be near 9 per cent in 1995-96. The people of Australia are sick and tired, as Mr Bums accurately put it, of the fact that this Prime Minister is so weak and so indecisive and so incapable of carrying a divided Caucus that he is doing nothing to ease the pain of those who are unemployed. Indeed, some of the things he has done in order to keep his job-like the commitment to occupational superannuation-are simply going to add to the number of unemployed; another 100,000 jobs are going to be lost as a result of that initiative. When we look back over this Prime Minister's term in office, we see that he has been very conscious of his place in history, very conscious of the monuments that he might build and that historiap.s might look back on and might judge him by in years to come. He has been the man of many monuments. Let us take a few minutes to look back over the period since the early 1980s when this man has been Prime Minister and look at some of the monuments he has attempted to create, all of which have been tom down either by his own inability to deliver or by the very deep-seated and poisonous factional wrangling that now characterises this Government. The first great monument was, of course, the idea of consensus. Do honourable members remember that? This man came in, in 1983, and he would do what nobody else could do-bring the country together. The only people he has really succeeded in bringing together in recent times are of course failed businessmen and bankrupts with their lawyers in court, or unemployed people meeting CES officers in order to get their dole cheque. That is his first monument-a failure as characterised by the size of the unemployed. There are nearly one million Australians presently unemployed and that number is likely to go higher. The second great monument of this man was that he would be remembered as the international statesman. We have just seen an example of this yesterday when he reported to this Parliament on his time at the Harare Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. He tried in a very distorting way to overstate his successes and, of course, his importance to that conference. So he is the international statesman. We will never forget some of the monuments he has left on the international stage. The MX missile crisis was a great start. Then of course there was the trouble with Fiji-two coups and he missed them both. Malaysia-sorry, he says that he has fixed Malaysia. We are yet to see what price he has paid to fix the breakdown in the relationship with Malaysia. Then, of course, there is the tussle with India and the sale of the Mirage jets to Pakistan-a very timely international initiative, one that will stand long as a monument to this man on the international stage. We have, of course, Papua New Guinea and the basic problems in Bougainville. We are so influential in PNG that we could not even be the honest broker when it came to the Bougainville negotiations; we could not even playa role. Then, of course, there is Chinathe love affair that became outright hatred when it was caught by the events of Tiananmen Square, and then the emotion and the rush of blood to the prime ministerial head when he allowed all those Chinese students to stay here, as if they were political refugees. There was the Johnson Atoll debacle at the Pacific forum last year. One magazine article that I read referred to the Prime Minister trying to get back into that issue and back into a position of influence in PNG. It described him as something like a little sheepdog chasing around after Ratu Mara. There are all these outstanding monuments to the international statesman. It is always good to have an opportunity, when times get tough at home, to polish up the idea of being the international statesman, so he runs on that issue, does he not? It is always good for a run. Yesterday we noticed that George Bush had the good sense to recognise that when one has problems at home one stays at home and fixes the problems. The Prime Minister's monuments as an international statesman will long stand him in poor stead. If we go back to 1984, in the heat of the election campaign, what monument 'was there? Tax reform. Do honourable members remember that? All we got were the nasties. He did not deliver the reform and the people of Australia have suffered ever since with high marginal tax rates, massive disincentives to work and to save. An inability to carry the ACTU on that occasion destroyed yet another monument. There was of course the monument of how the Prime Minister was going to create employment in this country. For a long time he boasted of the 1112 million jobs that would stand through the tides of history as his monument to this country. He forgot to mention, of course, how he achieved the 1112 million jobs-at the cost of about $70,000 in debt per job. Any fool can do that. Any fool can keep borrowing if there is no limit to the overdraft and can overheat the economy and create unsustainable jobs. But of course reality has come through. It is now quite clear that he cannot hang on to those jobs, and the one million unemployed are a constant reminder of the failure of the monument of employment under this man. Then of course the Prime Minister was going to be the world's greatest environmentalist. There was the world's greatest environmental statement. Remember that? Remember the one billion trees? How is he going? The only hole he has dug is for himself. So much for that monument. Now he has jettisoned the environmental movement. I see it has actually backed the contender, as recently as yesterday, in the leadership stakes. The environmentalists have given up on the Prime Minister because he could not deliver monuments of any substance to them. The next monument was to be micro reform. Was that not to be the monument to the third term of the Hawke-Keating Government? It was certainly micro. It is so micro that we have been searching the records for it and we have found absolutely no evidence to substantiate that. The Prime Minister knows we are right on that because Ministers are in here day after day getting dorothy dixers to try to demonstrate the fact they have made some progress with micro reform.",87
154,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,We get no questions from your backbenchers on this.,89
155,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"The Leader of the House is a very good example of this. He was up here yesterday, or the day before, talking about how our waterfront was now matching best international practice. He was saying that we have the most efficient waterfront in the world. To give one example, the Minister for Transport and Communications cited the port of Melbourne. I was particularly struck by that example. Recently a ship, the La Perouse, left the port of Melbourne having been loaded at the rate of eight containers per hour. It went across the Tasman to New Zealand, to the port of Auckland-which, by New Zealand's own admission, is not anywhere near best international practice-where it was unloaded at the rate of 32 containers per hour. We are a long way short of New Zealand, and New Zealand in tum is a long way short of other international ports, ports of the capability of Singapore. It is absolute nonsense. It is living proof that micro reform has been all micro and no reform. Of course there is the other monumentchild poverty. Remember that? We were going to eliminate child poverty. This was another monument designated in an election campaign, in the 1987 policy speech. Of course, it was not long after that that the Government put interest rates up and, as the Archbishop pointed out to the Prime Minister, the increase in interest rates put more children into poverty in this country. This was another monument that came crashing down because of the inability of this man to actually deliver the policies required to achieve them. Then there was the wonderful monument that was built, probably the most outstanding and most memorable monument, the one to dishonesty and lack of integrity, associated with the Kirribilli conspiracy, the deal that was done to pass the prime ministership across to the honourable member for Blaxland-with their mates there. Mr Beale-Who was there?",89
156,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"Just two people were there. The honourable member rightly points out there were two people there, the head of the ACTU and a leading business mate of the Prime Minister. Big business, big unions even determine the prime ministership in this country. What a monument that has been because, for the last 18 months, the poor old honourable member for Blaxland has realised that the Prime Minister did not deliver that monument either. The Prime Minister hung on to that one. He was not going to let the honourable member for Blaxland in here. He cheated on him. Finally, today we have before us the last of the great monuments. This one, in the Prime Minister's own words, was going to be it. This was the one that really mattered. This was the one that would be historic and monumental. This was new federalism. We have seen in the last few days the extent of, the shambles that is new federalism. The Premiers are desperately trying to get some sense back into this debate. They have been producing their own papers, dissatisfied with the work done by Commonwealth officials. They are putting genuine proposals. It has always been very difficult to deliver these in this country when there have been political overtones that have stopped economically rational and sensible decisions being taken. Yet this man has not got the courage to back a particular view. In fact, his view shifts depending on the circumstances. The Prime Minister goes into the Caucus and tells them, 'You don't have to worry; there is no chance of income tax sharing with the States. Don't worry, I don't favour it; don't you worry about it'. And then out comes the document that shows that behind the scenes the process has been continuing. His officials, in fact, have been involved in the process and have been delaying meetings and creating circumstances where perhaps they might be able to salvage something. The last monument has again collapsed because of an incredible lack of leadership on the part of the Prime Minister. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it would be great, it would be entertaining, it would be genuine vaudeville if there were not nearly one million Australians unemployed left with absolutely no hope of getting back into the work force. In fact, their only hope is to be joined by others who will be unemployed in the course of the next 12 to 18 months as a result of the policies that this Government is pursuing. It might be great entertainment if it were not for the fact that we have the worse economic circumstances this country has seen in 60 years. I put it to the Prime Minister that if he is interested in monuments then the real monument that he is going to leave is that of a lost generation of Australians. The current generation of Australians is about to leave a lower standard of living to their children than they in fact have enjoyed themselves. It is a very large price to pay for the vaudevillian approach to policy making that has been characteristic of this Prime Minister. Yet the staggering thing is that right through the last 18 months he has had the support of the Opposition on a lot of these key policies. Do honourable members remember a year ago, 15 months ago, when he and the Treasurer and others attacked me for daring to float the idea of reform of Commonwealth-State financial relations? They used to come in here and talk about balloons going up-floating balloons, floating ideas-one of which the Prime Minister grabbed onto and tried to make one of his monuments? We were there; we were prepared to state a case. We were prepared to actually attend the Special Premiers Conference and to make a contribution. The Prime Minister knows that it is essential to get bipartisan support to make major change in Commonwealth-State relations generally and Commonwealth-State financial relationships in particular. We were genuine. We offered support. All the Government did was mock us. In fact, it ended up losing the issue. Similarly, other issues have come upissues such as Medicare. Medicare is a shambles. The Medicare system is collapsing. We all know that some fundamental changes have to be made to the Medicare system in Australia. The Government made a tentative step in the last Budget; it went for a $3.50 payment. We did the right thing again; we offered bipartisan support. We stood there. In fact, I think we argued the case more strongly than the Government did. What happened? The Prime Minister could not deliver his Caucus again. He cannot deliver his Caucus now. He could not deliver his Caucus on that issue either. And so we could go on with all the major issues that have been on the agenda in the last 18 months. We have taken a responsible and, in many cases, a bipartisan position to try to get some genuine reform in place in this country, but this Prime Minister does not have the capacity to provide the leadership that is required in the worse and deepest recession in 60 years. Indeed, the entire focus is now on stopping the honourable member for Blaxland from getting his job. He does not care less about the nearly one million jobs of other Australians that have been sacrificed on behalf of all these monuments. He cares about keeping his own job, and he will do anything to ensure that he does. Even when, for example, the opportunistic ex-Treasurer decides to pick an issue, such as the new federalism issue, on which to take a position which, as it happens, is opposite to what he has taken in the past-what does that matter? He is on his way to the leadership and he will use anything he can to get thereand issue a challenge which is loosely based on a genuine policy difference, this guyMr Beale-Loosely!",90
157,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"Yes, loosely; that is a good pun. This guy, this Prime Minister, cannot address that issue. He cannot take up the challenge of fighting for what he knows needs to be done in this country. He sees the issue as a leadership issue, a challenge to his leadership. He does not see the issue as an opportunity to fight for what he knows is right in this country. He has all the Premiers on his side and all the members of the Opposition on his side in terms of the public statements we have made, but he is fighting just one battle with the ex-Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it is a very sad commentary on the state of our conation that this Prime Minister does not have the capacity to be truthful about the state of our economic circumstances or to put in place the policies that he knows deep down are required in order to tum this country around. It is particularly sad when support for the issue of new federalism is as widespread as it has been from the Opposition and from the Premiers in particular. There will be a very clear contrast going into the next election. There will be a party on one side that is prepared to fight and argue for fundamental reform of this country, compared with a group of people who want to fight just for one job. We are going to fight for the jobs of the one million Australians that the Prime Minister has taken away. We are going to fight tooth and nail every day to the next election, politically difficult as it might be, in order to give them a chance for hope, in order to avoid the possibility that there will be yet another lost generation. Yet this Prime Minister does not have the capacity to see the problem, let alone provide the solution. He should be totally condemned and in no way should enjoy the confidence of this House.",91

171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The honourable member for Mayo!,92
172,Mr HAWKE,PRIME MINISTER,"Perhaps we can encapsulate the nature of the misrepresentation by the comment he made at the end of his speech, where he saidMr Downer-There are just a few where the television cameras are. Look at them all where the television cameras are.",92
173,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,I warn the honourable member for Mayo.,92
174,Mr HAWKE,PRIME MINISTER,At the end of his speech the Leader of the Opposition assumed his sombre voice and said that this present generation of Australians-these people in 1991-were going to be handing over to their children a lower living standard than they had experienced when we came to office. This is an outright lie.,92

177,Mr HAWKE,PRIME MINISTER,"It is a deliberate misrepresentation. Mr Fife-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: the Prime Minister did not withdraw. Mr DEI)UTY SPEAKER-The Prime Minister should not use the words 'deliberate misrepresentation' or 'outright lie'. Mr Fife-We require him to withdraw.",92
178,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,I am calling on the Prime Minister to do so.,92
179,Mr HAWKE,PRIME MINISTER,"I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. The fact is, as has been put to this House on a number of occasionsMr Beale-Withdraw! Mr Snowdon interjecting",92
180,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,"Order! If the honourable member for Bruce had ceased interjecting, he would have heard the Prime Minister withdraw. I also remind the honourable member for the Northern Territory to remain silent.",92
181,Mr HAWKE,PRIME MINISTER,The fact is that per capita real household disposable income is 10 per cent higher now than it was in 1983. That is a fact. I wish to take up as far as I can in the time that is available to me the reference toMr Beale-About a year.,92
182,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,I warn the honourable member for Bruce.,93
183,Mr H,PRIME MINISTER,"WKE-I wish to take up the reference to the external and internal propositions that the Leader of the Opposition made in his speech. He made the observation, for reasons which escape me, that in the period since 1983 I have sought to establish a number of international monuments. He proceeded to make reference to a number of issues. I am not particularly interested in spending a great deal of time talking about the achievements of this Government internationally. As the Leader of the Opposition has raised the question of the international achievements of this Government under my leadership, let me refer to what we have done with pride. Let me contrast it with the abysmal record of those opposite when they were in government. It is not surprising that this Government has a large number of remarkable achievements to its credit because as far as we are concerned, as distinct from those opposite when they were in government, we have never regarded the conduct of international relations as a method of trying to advance political disputation within Australia. When members of the Opposition were in office, they had a prism in their eyes. When they looked at what was happening in this region, they asked themselves how they could engage themselves either directly in conflict or in other ways which would increase conflict within Australia. As distinct from that approach, we have seen the conduct of international relations as a responsibility on the part of the Government of this country to try to ensure that those less fortunate than ourselves should have their position advanced and, in so doing, increase the security of this country. On - hat principle and according to that philosophy, let me refer to these facts, not opinions. First of all, it was this Government under my leadership which established the Cairns Group when the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) was the then Minister for Trade. This initiative, taken some five or six years ago, is still a significant and influential feature of the Uruguay Round at this stage. It has made a continuing positive contribution which has been recognised by the Europeans, by the United States and by the countries of this region and beyond. It is the voice of reason. It has been chaired by Australia from the beginning. In this period of incipient insanity in the conduct of international trading relationships, it is the Cairns Group, founded and continuously led by Australia, which has been the resounding voice of sanity. As a result of the position of Australia leading the Cairns Group, if there is, as increasingly likely it may be, a positive result out of the Uruguay Round to a very considerable extent, it will be due to the initiative in the first place by the honourable member for Fremantle in his former capacity as the Minister for Trade, followed by Minister Duffy and now followed through by Minister Blewett. That is the voice of Australia. I have not used the word 'monument'. If those opposite want to talk about monuments and about the time when this Government and the people of this country look back on this basic question of trying to get sanity in international trading relationships, I will be pleased to look at the establishment and the work of the Cairns Group as a monument because it will be a fitting monument, both to the philosophy and to the hard practical application which has marked and characterised the conduct of this Government in international relations. Let us go beyond that. Let us look at the issue of Cambodia, currently in the news. In talking about the leadership of my Government on the issue of Cambodia, I will contrast it-as I inevitably must do when talking about the area of Indo-China-with the way that those opposite, the conservatives in this country, conducted themselves in regard to Indo-China when they were in office. What was their approach? What was their philosophy? All they could talk about was the creeping spread of Chinese communism. They did not begin eyen to understand the historic and foundation-l differences between China and Vietnam. All they did-and in the process conscripted the young men of Australia to go to fight and die in Vietnam-was to preach conflict. They thought, they taught and they preached conflict-a conflict based on a false philosophy and a false premise. Against that, it has been this Government which has given honour and recognition to the Australian men and women, as was their due, who went there under the direction of those opposite. Those opposite virtually ignored them when they came back. It was this Government that gave them recognition and decency. What we were concerned about from the day we came into office in 1983 was to ask, 'What are the things that need to be done to bring peace and stability to that tragic area?'. From the first day that I was Prime Minister I said to my first Foreign Minister, Bill Hayden",93
184,Unknown,PRIME MINISTER,Opposition members interjecting,94
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! Members of the Opposition! The honourable member for Moore! The honourable member for Groom!,94
186,Mr HAWKE,PRIME MINISTER,"I said to Bill Hayden, 'I believe that Australia has a patticular capacity to play a constructive role in Indo-China'. That was because this Government was coming in as a government which was seen as having clean hands in terms of its approach to that region. It was not a country which was in any way seen as a threat to the region. For those reasons, this country was able to speak directly with the participants. Also, because of our special relationship with the United States, we were able to speak directly with the United States and other major powers. From day one, under the instructions which I gave in that regard, we have followed the path of trying to bring peace to that tragic region. There has been talk about monuments. Let me say this: there is no greater monument of which I am proud as Prime Minister of the Hawke Government in the international sphere than that at this moment we have my Foreign Minister, Gareth Evans, being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. There can be no greater monument than that. I read out in the House earlier this week the statement by the French Foreign Minister. That was a statement from a most unlikely source, but a fulsome and direct statement that it was Australia, under my prime ministership, which had played the leading role in bringing peace to Cambodia. So there we have it: the Cairns Group is a monument. In Cambodia there is peace under the Australian red book plan adopted by the Permanent Five; that is a monument of which I am proud. But I hope we do not stop there when we are talking about international monuments. We have created APEC. We did not, like those opposite did when they were in office, just talk in the vaguest terms about our interest being in this region. Through the hard slog and work of my Foreign Minister and Ministers assisting in the trade area, we have consistently, in a bilateral and in a multilateral fashion, sought to shape a reality for Australia where we are no longer seen, as we were for so long under conservative rule in this country, as a mere European outpost in the Antipodes. We have shown that we are really a country that will increasingly be enmeshed with Asia. In the result, we have seen that, through a series of bilateral relationships, we have increased very substantially our trading relationships with these countries. But we have gone the next step and created APEC. As honourable members will know, APEC was my personal initiative, which was followed through for me by my Foreign Minister. As the result of an Australian initiative, we now have this institution, which is being increasingly recognised as an instrument that will assist the processes of cooperation between the nations of this region. What does that mean? There has been talk about monuments, monuments that are just there for people to pay obeisance to mean nothing. The best sorts of monuments are those that, when one leaves office, one can look back at and say, 'That institution there, which I created, is continuing year after year to improve the welfare of Australians in tenllS of their relationships with the whole Asia Pacific Rim'. That is what APEC has done. The value of that continuing effective monument has been attested to by the leaders of ASEAN, the United States of America, Canada, Japan and South Korea. Just next week in Seoul at the ministerial APEC meeting, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong-the three Chinas that are referred to-will then be taken into APEC. Those opposite used the word 'monument'; it is not my word. I have not gone around seeking to say, 'That is the monument I have created'. Those opposite introduced the concept. I have embraced it and said, 'All right. If you want to talk about monuments, in my sense I say that a monument is something one can look to that remains after one's term in office and which marks in continuing terms the contribution that one has made.'. Therefore, if I am able to say, firstly in regard to the Uruguay Round, that the outcome is better because of what we have done, then I regard that as a magnificent monument. If I am able to say that there is peace in Cambodia largely because of the Government which I have led, I regard that as a monument of which I am proud. If I can point to a continuing institution, APEC, which means that there is a greater stimulation of economic cooperation between the countries of the Asia Pacific Rim, I say that that is a monument of which I am proud. (Extension o/time granted) They were the ideals in the opening contribution of the Leader of the Opposition. I conclude in this area about the international side of things by saying that, by any objective evidence, by the standard of the publicly given acknowledgments of what my Government has achieved in this area in regard to the Uruguay Round, the Cairns Group, APEC and Cambodia, they are the enduring monuments which will stand as a tribute to the Government which I have had the honour and the privilege to lead. It is true to say that in no other period Australian Federal history have we had a government which has made such a single, positive, constructive contribution to the international community as has the Hawke Labor Government. I have disposed of the Opposition's external observations. I come now to deal, relatively briefly, with the pathetic observations made by the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the internal domestic situation. Perhaps the best way I can do that is not to go to some allegedly friendly source. The Leader of the Opposition made much of the question of micro-economic reform so I will read out some material which I passed to my colleague the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) earlier this week. All honourable members will recall that, when it came to the question of micro-economic reform, what was laid down by those opposite-and indeed what was laid down by nearly every commentator in this community as the litmus test of achievement in the area of micro-economic reform-was the waterfront. I will read to the House from a source which is not regarded as pro-Labor. There is one thing that could never be said about Captain Richard Setchell, the head of Conaust: he has never been accused of being pro-Labor. He is not overtly Labor and he is not closet Labor. This is what Richard Setchell, the head of Conaust, one of the biggest operators on the Australian waterfront-so presumably someone who knows what he is talking about-had to say on 24 October: I believe that we will produce an internationally competitive waterfront by the end of this yearin other words, just a matter of weeks away. They are his words. Mr Tim Fischer-He is wrong.",94
187,Mr HAWKE,PRIME MINISTER,"Oh! Fischer says that Setchell is wrong. Mr Fife-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. Earlier today a member of the Opposition was asked by the Deputy Speaker to refer to an honourable member on the other side of the House by his title, not by his surname. Would you direct the Prime Minister to do so?",95
188,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The Prime Minister might of refer to the Leader by his title-and the Leader might not interject.,95
189,Mr HAWKE,PRIME MINISTER,"We now have the lovely spectacle of the Leader of the National Party knowing more about the waterfront than Captain Setchell. Captain Setchell makes the judgment, but this great authority, the Leader of the National Party, says, '1, Tim Fischer, the leader of the National Party, know better than Richard Setchell'. That is a measure of how pathetic those opposite are. What else did Captain Setchell go on to say? He said: fucreases in productivity we expect will be in the region of 60 to lOOper cent. He went on to say: By the end of this year I think we will have put to bed a lot of the sceptics' criticism about not being an internationally competitive waterfront. Those opposite made the test; they made the hurdle. It was those opposite, not us, who said, 'The achievements on the waterfront are the litmus test of whether this Government has got the philosophy, the guts and the application to produce refonn'. Those opposite made the test. I am telling them that we have passed that test with flying colours. Mr Snowdon interjecting",95
190,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The honourable member for the Northern Territory!,96
191,Mr HAWKE,PRIME MINISTER,"Captain Setchell went on implicitly to make a comparison with the poor, pathetic mob opposite, because he had this to say: We would like to think that we have achieved something that no other government (has achieved), and I don't push any particular political barrow. There we have it. The bloke who has been there; the bloke who suffered through all the years of ineptitude from those opposite, when they would not do anything, when they talked and talked, when the rhetoric was large but the achievement was nothing; the bloke who sat there and suffered under those opposite, year after year after year, had to wait for the Hawke Labor Government to get the refonn. That is what he has had to say. He then said that this Government was prepared to take it on. We did it. We took it on. Let me compare the only contribution from those opposite with ours. We have produced the results, and we are the only government ever to do it. What has been the contribution of those opposite?",96
192,Mr LAVARCH,PRIME MINISTER,Nothing.,96
193,Mr HAWKE,PRIME MINISTER,"The honourable member is wrong. It is not nothing. The contribution of those opposite was to say, 'We would put the troops on the waterfront'. That is the contrast. The Leader of the Opposition said that the people would have a choice. My God, they will have a choice! They will have a choice on this issue between a party and a government led by Hawke, which has done what no other government has ever done before-we have refonned the waterfront and we have made it internationally competitive-and, against that, those opposite, who say that their concept of how to bring about refonn on the waterfront is to put the troops in. I know what choice the people of Australia will make on that one. I know I have only a moment to go, but I suppose that what is almost the best test that one can make of a government's concern about the people is to see what it does about the aged. When I became Prime Minister of this country, the age pension represented just over 22 per cent of average weekly earnings. Under my leadership that is now 26 per cent. I do not regard that as a very bad monument. That is something I will look back on with pride. But what I will look back on most of all with pride is the fact that, after 8 112 years of getting nothing from those opposite except cynicism and opportunism, I have led a band of Ministers, supported by a Caucus, who have said that they will take the tough decisions that those opposite have never been prepared to take. That is why, as I said, we will do to those opposite in 1993 what we did in 1983, 1985 and 1988.(1ime expired)",96
194,Mr TIM FISCHER,PRIME MINISTER,"I have to ask: is that the swan song of this Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)? The real monument to this Prime Minister is not only the one million unemployed but also the minuscule rate of waterfront refonn as manifested by one statistic. 1 would like the Prin1e Minister to listen to this statistic because it comes from the chainnan of Fletcher Challenge at the eleventh annual meeting of shareholders, last Thursday, 31 October, when Sir Ronald Trotter said: . .. port reform has meant that in the last three years the cost of moving a tonne of newsprint across the wharf in New Zealand has dropped by two-thirds, so today it costs $4 in New Zealand compared with $24 in Australia. What progress with waterfront reform does the Prime Minister refer to? It has been minuscule progress, especially when compared with best international practice. So I support and second this motion moved so ably by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). I want to highlight something to the House. Halfway through the Prime Minister's speech, this critical speech in which he tried to rescue his right to sit in that office, guess how many honourable members were present on the Government back benches? It is a very interesting number. I counted them, and I had the number verified by honourable members on my left and right. There were exactly 44 members of the Government in the House to hear the Prime Minister, not even the full number. That is the same number, but a different set of members, as those who voted for the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) for the leadership of the Australian Labor Party. I want to put a challenge to the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) and to a number of the left wing members present. The challenge is this: they do not even have to cross the floor to prove their point and vote for us on this motion. We do not even ask them to do that. All that we ask is that 10 of them abstain, and they will have the result they seek-a new Prime Minister of this country, because this Prime Minister would have to resign. It is unfortunate that only members of parliament will be able to vote on this censure motion, because I can tell you now, Mr Speaker, that there are 859,900 Australians who are unemployed today and who, if they had the chance, would want to vote on this motion because they want to vote this Prime Minister out of office right now, not just because his policies have generated their unemployment but because, while Australia has been slipping down the slide towards deep recession and depression, the Prime Minister has been indulging in a paranoid preoccupation with just one job-his job-not the jobs of a million unemployed. From time to time a lot of mail comes across the desks of members of parliamentfrontbenchers and backbenchers. I want to quote particularly from a letter I received this morning which I think summarises the mood of the country very well. It came from Queensland, from a man I respect greatly, a great person who served his country in Vietnam and in other conflicts as well. He wrote to me, and I quote exactly what he said: Out there in this country of ours there are a lot of signals. In the young, a feeling of sadness, even of the inevitability of their going on the dole. It is a worry for they see it as 'It is not my problem, someone else will fix it'. In the age group of the 30s to the 40s, married with kids, there are so many out of a job for the first time in their lives. Disbelief. It is not happening to me. Then going on to deep despair. In the elderly, fear, even terror. He continued: They're just old and don't want any worries. My dear friend, these three groups need more than clever stuff from Canberra. They need a real vision. I say amen to that. Those groups need a change of government. They need a Prime Minister who will bring real leadership and real discipline to his Government. At the moment, that is exactly what he has lost. He is paralysed in his leadership. The only time the Prime Minister has acted recently was when he instructed the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) in Bangkok to reverse the one accurate comment which had come from a Minister in many months. In Bangkok the Treasurer got it correct. He said we were in the worse recession since the Great Depression. That was the one time the Prime Minister acted. He forced the Treasurer to correct that statement and to say that he was wrong when he spoke in Bangkok. Well, the Treasurer was wrong when he said he was wrong in Bangkok. It is a pity the Prime Minister acts on an occasion like that but fails to act on the uranium policy development of this country. He described that Labor uranium policy as very illogical, and he failed to have the courage to raise the issue and speak to it at the Hobart conference. Can honourable members guess what the Prime Minister was doing during that debate at the Hobart conference? The whole nation could see he was doi-g a crossword. At the Hobart conference, at a time of crucial decision making in a key policy area, there was the Prime Minister doing a crossword at the counter. The Prime Minister has failed to act in respect of tax reform, as detailed by the Leader of the Opposition. He failed to act properly with regard to a minor decision, a third level decision, a third-order decision, the decision in respect of Coronation Hill. Mr Wright-You should have rehearsed this one, Tim. It's bad.",96
195,Mr TIM FISCHER,PRIME MINISTER,"I happen to know that the honourable member for Capricornia secretly supported renewed mining at Coronation Hill. He is trying to give some latent support to the Prime Minister. It is too late for this Prime MiJlister. This Prime Minister failed on all those key benchmark decisions and he is going to have to answer for it. I will dwell briefly on another area of failure, South Africa. Never has there been a better moment for decisive action to lift sanctions, to resume direct flights. Can honourable members guess what happened last weekend? The United States, I tell the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), was back with direct flights to South Africa. For several months Austria has been back there with direct flights. Eleven European airlines are flying direct to Johannesburg. But no, Australia must wait and delay, and wait and delay, and miss the boat again with regard to South Africa. We should lift all those lingering trade sanctions now, forthwith, no ifs, no buts. If we had a Prime Minister who showed some leadership, we would have lifted all Australian trade sanctions on South Africa by this day. We have failed to do so. In answer to a question, the Prime Minister referred to the National Rail Corporation. It is about time the House got the correct information. Government members should check on our record in relation to the National Rail Corporation. Which government took the action and put up the dollars to bring about the standardisation of rail between Sydney and Melbourne, between Sydney and Perth and between Sydney and Adelaide so at least we could start to have trains run between our key capital cities on the same gauge? It was a Liberal-National Party government. Which government built the new standard gauge line from Tarcoola to Alice Springs? Yet again it was the previous Fraser-Anthony coalition Government. Let this Government demonstrate that it can perform on the matter of the National Rail Corporation. It announced that this Corporation would be in business by now. It will not be in business until next year, in operational terms. The sooner it is in business the better. We have been waiting and waiting. We want to see action rather than rhetoric with regard to these matters. The real issue in all of this is discipline. The real issue is the ability of the Prime Minister to apply discipline to his own back bench, to his own Ministers. It is an extraordinary situation when so many have spoken out without hesitation. Last night's exercise was the ultimate in absolute chicanery and duplicity. The doublecross was on. Guess who introduced the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) at last night's famous Labor dinner in Canberra? There was the fleeting scene of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), that great supporter of the honourable member for Blaxland, introducing that great Minister for Social Security, the number cruncher extraordinaire. As a consequence, it has all now been lard out. What the Deputy Premier of Queensland had to say is very interesting. I want to read it into the House record. He said this morning: Don't care aboutthe rank and file. They don't care about the unemployed. They haven't done anything for the unemployed for years. It is about time someone told them straight. We are just sick of it. Then the Deputy Premier went on to say in very clear cut terms: But I'll tell you this. In the long term, it will be Australia that will be the loser for it. The Keatings and the Richardsons are not really interested in anything else other than themselves. The truth is out. The Deputy Premier of Queensland speaks up. And what happens here? The Ministers splay in all directions. The Ministers have no discipline, no Cabinet solidarity, no capability to act like a Cabinet in accordance with the Westminster convention, no capacity to deliver-to this nation, to the million unemployed, to all those out there seeking jobs or to the drought stricken-the fundamental reforms required. Then we have the ex-Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland, who said: Bob gave a C(- - ....·litment to me and then broke it, and I won't se-. _ a person who can't keep their word. He was joined by Wally Curran, who said: There's no de' :'the still wants to be Leader. Of course, he is referring to the honourable member for Blaxland. I think this country deserves better. We have often been told that this year, 1991, is the centenary year of the Australian Labor Party. We have a million unemployed, record bankruptcies, the total failure of prime ministerial leadership, the total failure of the Prime Minister to address the issues which we have laid down before the House during the course of this Budget session and during the course of this no confidence motion. They are some centenary present for the nation as a whole! It is some centenary the Government has delivered on a silver plate! People are walking off their farms. People's children cannot get jobs. People whose standard of living has plunged deserve better. They want better. They want a change of government. They want a change of prime ministership. As I said last Tuesday, never before in the history of Australian Federal governance has so much damage been done to so many by so few. It has been done by the Prime Minister, the former Treasurer, the current Treasurer and, indeed, the Minister for Transport and Communications, who no doubt will get up and bluff and speak out loudly during the course of his address here but who cannot answer the real question: when is the Prime Minister going to exert his leadership? When is the Prime Minister going to bring control to his Cabinet? When is the Prime Minister going to bring control to his Caucus? When is he going to bring an end to all the chaos in the Caucus in the interests of all that Australia has a right to deserve? The Prime Minister has failed miserably in terms of the leadership he has provided to this country. The Prime Minister has reached the stage where he should either shape up or resign and bring on a vote of confidence to sort out this issue once and for all. We know that many farmers and others are disappointed about the refusal of President Bush to visit Australia. It is a particular disappointment in Cairns, Sydney and Canberra that President Bush will not be proceeding with that visit to Australia. I wish he were. It would have allowed farmer groups to meet with President Bush to discuss the export enhancement program and other issues. But there was one smile on the face of one backbencher yesterday when that information came before the House. There was a smile on the face of the honourable member for Blaxland because he now knows that he will build on that greater timetable flexibility created by the fact that, sadly, President Bush will not be speaking on the floor of this House on the first Thursday in December. The honourable member for Blaxland will use that to manoeuvre himself further towards the leadership of this Government. It is time for this Prime Minister and for this Government. The people have had enough. The Liberal and National parties stand ready to take the tough decisions on industrial relations and to take the tough decisions on tax reform. Soon enough, members opposite will see why that dynamic package stacks up for all Australians. That dynamic package will deliver less government, more jobs, more incentive, more productivity and less tax overall. Enough is enough. It is time Australians had a fair go. It is time this Prime Minister departed his office.",98
196,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"Swan-Minister for Transport and Communications) (4.00 p.m.)We have had two speeches now from the Opposition which are supposed to be arguments for a want of confidence in the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It is a serious matter when an opposition brings down such a motion for the consideration of the Parliament. It is expected to be accompanied by argument as well as rhetoric. Nobody dismisses the view that there ought to be some rhetoric involved in it. All we have had from the Opposition are, simply, catalogues with no argument attached to them. For example, a statement was made by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) that the Government had failed in foreign policy. He said, 'Think of it-India, Fiji and Malaysia'. There was no argument around any of those topics. It was simply a sort of naming of the parts. We did a bit of a global survey and proved that he had picked up a globe at some point of time and pointed out one or two countries on it. Then we got down to the statement of the Leader of the Opposition about our having failed to achieve in the micro-economic reform area. Was there argument attached to that? No. There was only one example taken of one ship on the Melbourne waterfront as though that, in itself, constitutes a measure of what is taking place on the waterfront; he did not look at the statistics that Conaust Pty Ltd has been putting out lately. I think that is a problem that this country has. There is always the possibility-I do not think in the immedia.te future at all-that an opposition will become a government. Then there will need to be people capable of forming a front bench. The problem that have with this Opposition is the utter turity of those who lead it. There are more mature people along the Opposition front bench, but leading the Opposition is a fifthprocess. rate academic with a fourth-rate political presentation in this place. That is all. He absolutely no conception of the breadth of policy issues that he would have to confront if he were to become Prime Minister. We have an Opposition that ignores, of course, own paltry record in all of the areas that has chosen to discuss. Hitler's armaments Minister, Speer, was finally released from a well-deserved, but a sufficiently long, period of imprisonment the late 1950s. He came out after about eight or nine years following his conviction at Nuremberg and was asked by a person from the press what he thought about the insidious, creeping developments of Soviet communism. The response of the former armaments miniswas ter, Speer, to this journalist was, 'With a political record like mine, why would want my views on anything?'. Indeed, why would we want the views of the adviser to the Government which immediately preceded ours? It was a government' of 71/2 years of complete failure in all the areas that it now suggests for us a test. The former government had one of the principal advisers to it, albeit a meritorious player, in the words of one of its erstwhile colleagues, Senator Stone, during the course of the deVelopment of the policy of that Government. The most appalling thing about the demonisation of the achievements of this Government by the Opposition and the propositions that it presents to the Australian electorate is that they are based on the deepest deceit. It is not a position which I would attribute to all members of the Opposition. For example, the other day the Opposition spokesman on industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong e Mr Howard), when he made statements about unemployment, had the honesty to say that in the term of that Government-if the Opposition were successful at the next election-unemployment could not be expected to fall. It would remain well above 9 per cent. We also had two brief moments of honesty we a long time ago from the now Opposition immaLeader. In contemplating what he calls 'reforms', there would necessarily be a substantial inducement of unemployment via that Given that he actually has no capacity to talk with the union movement or even has to remotely understand what the Australian the labour market is all about-the sorts of propositions that are encapsulated but by no means totally represented by his enjoyment of its the prospect of placing troops on the waterit front-means the only way that the Opposition can get reform through, if it can be called reform in the policies of the Opposition, is by not major destruction of the organisations that in protect the living standards of the ordinary Australians in this community. That is its position. Well might the Leader of the Opposition begin his speech by ranting at the Prime Minister for his election slogan at the time he first elected in 1983. Well might he criticise him for having a slogan of consensus, you for basing a policy on a view that all Australians have to live in this country, are entitled to expect a decent standard of living, and are entitled to expect decent treatment in a democratic community. This is because its program is not capable of implementation without shattering the living standards and life expectations of very large numbers of Australians. It says, in sleight of hand in its policy, that it will have a set of propositions which will massively reduce the size of the Government. In terms of outlays, we now have probably the second or third lowest position of the OECD nations. One cannot reduce outlays further without seriously attacking some very damaged groups in this community. One has to go in after the pensioners; one has to go in after the unemployed. The Opposition should remember not to sell us this line in its moments of honesty. It knows, under its proposals, that unemployment will remain high for very long-not for nine months. Its proposal is to go in straight for the jugular of the most defenceless people in this community and, on their corpses, build the tax breaks for the wealthiest. That is the position that will be presented to us in a few weeks time by the Opposition when it comes to discussing how it will make way for its consumption tax. The Opposition will incorporate a whole series of false assumptions on the product privatisation and on the area of savings. the horrifying thing is that the Opposition may-if it is ever elected-really attempt to do that. If it does, then the people country, as the people of New Zealand have, will rue the Government that has been placed upon them. I do not make that statement in partisan way. The people of New Zealand rued the Labour Government that they elected and they have rued in spades the conservabottom tives that they replaced them with. If there one ideological homeland that the Opposition has sought and touted around this chamber, is not in fact-as I thought it might Maggie Thatcher's Britain. At least she had a bit of brass, confidence and forthrightness about her. It has not chosen to model itself Maggie Thatcher. God help us, it has chosen to model itself on New Zealand. That is an indication of the very smallness of the minds of Opposition members. Can one imagine Bob Menzies walking into this place as the Leader of the Opposition and making a speech like the one that was made here? Can one imagine Gough Whitlam walking into this place and making a speech like the one that we have heard from the Opposition Leader on a serious censure motion? Can one imagine Bill Hayden walking into this place and making a speech like the one that we have just heard from the Leader of the Opposition here? We have on our hands here a child-a political childwho is one of the newest members of this place with virtually no political background at all. He is going to move across this nation like an avenging angel, add to his CV and, when he finally retires to the south of France and is taking his gin slings with the rest of the teams in the merchant banking community whom he will have rejoined by then, be able to say, 'Well, back there in the 1990s, last century, I did govern a rather paltry little place for a while, but one went on to bigger things as one moved on to the bourses in the Northern Hemisphere'. That is his position. He is visiting; he is passing through. He will devastate this nation if he gets a chance. He cannot stand up here in this chamber against a Prime Minister who has managed to be elected more times as of Prime Minister than anyone bar Bob Menzies. But The Leader of the Opposition cannot simply dismiss the record of the Prime Minister with reference to the foreign policy area by naming of this a series of countries. Then those opposite go on to talk about a micro-economic reform and simply dismiss it by saying, 'Yes, you haven't achieved it'. Honourable members require more intellectual than that. If honourable members is opposite are actually going to give this country any form of effective leadership, they it require a capacity to argue it. To give some behope to the people of this country, they require a capacity to meet people at their points of need. Those opposite cannot. They on will dress up their package and point out to the people, despite what they now say, that the GST will not produce unemployment, that it will employ people and that in the wholesale sales tax area there are some goods and services in every day use that are taxed; and they will reduce the taxes in those areas but place a tax on the necessities of life, the means by which people survive. However, what honourable members opposite will not say to the people is that they will reduce the taxes on luxury goods such as Mercedes, Ferraris and jewellery to the very level of taxes on food. They will attempt, as they always have, to fool the ordinary people of this country into carrying the burden of taxation. We are not about imposing tax burdens on the rich in this country; we are about creating equitable tax systems. Opposition members came into this place and talked about whether there were any monuments around. I will name one or two, although I do not think it is sensible for any government or opposition to talk in terms of monuments; it is childish. The life of the nation goes on. The nation changes character. The past is a foreign country. Each generation comes through and does its best with it and passes it on to the next generation. None of us are here timelessly; we all move on. We do not talk about monuments. However, the Opposition introduced the topic of monuments, so let us go through that in regard to taxation. Honourable members opposite say that they wish to assist us to implement an unfair taxation system. We say to honourable members opposite, 'No thanks. We do not wish to implement an unfair taxation system on your behalf'. When we introduced a fair taxation system-when we introduced capital gains taxes and fringe benefits taxes, and when we asset tested welfare-honourable members opposite were dragged kicking and screaming to finally vote for us on that a couple of weeks ago. Their leader had to come in and enforce unity on honourable members opposite. Every one of those particular taxation propositions was carried over the dead political bodies of the successive leaders of honourable members opposite, as they fought us tooth and nail on everyone of them. What it did enable us to do was to lower the top marginal tax rates. It also enabled us to lower those rates further down. It gave ordinary businessmen in this community a modicum of a feeling that they would be at least prepared to pay their taxes-none of them like to pay their taxes-and not go through massive evasion loops as was done in the 1970s. In contrast to that, I ask honourable members opposite to remember their own taxation record. Off the back of the introduction of fuel taxes in this country, honourable members opposite permitted to flourish a massive evasion of income and company taxes. That was their last achievement. That was actually not overt; they did not actually announce that as a policy objective. That was actually nearly what was achieved. Now honourable members opposite have actually announced the policy objective. They will now permit massive changes to the upper levels of the taxation systems and bring in underneath an imposition on the ordinary people of this country. But there is one other thing. Honourable members opposite will say to ordinary people, to the pensioners, the unemployed and others, that they will adjust social benefits in this country to ensure that the very worse off do not get the impost of an increased tax burden as a result of that. They will ask those poor people to believe that, at a time when they are massively slashing social expenditures in order to be able to put this policy in place, they will be reliably compensated. There is one thing going for us-there has been a massive shift in the inflation rate and inflationary expectations in this country, which bodes well for the people. There are many achievements of this Government, but that is one which honourable members opposite always sought and never achieved. That is an achievement which has not come off the recession; it has come off wages policy. That is what has produced the change in the inflation level. Honourable members opposite will take that and blow it up against a wall. They will change the inflationary expectations in the wrong direction. If those opposite get into office they will place this country back on the old treadmill which we were on for years and which will ensure that we will never improve our international competitiveness. This is a shameful motion. It is being pursued shamelessly by the ridiculous people who proposed it. We need discuss it no more. I move: Thar the question be now put. The House divided.

197,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"by leave-For the information of honourable members, I present the exposure draft of the Broadcasting Services Bill and an accompanying explanatory document outlining the rationale behind the provisions contained in it. I am making a statement on the overall directions of key provisions in the Bill and its status. NA The draft legislation is the culmination of the most significant effort in several decades to finally bring the Broadcasting Act 1942 up to date and, more importantly, to establish a regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry that will serve Australia into the next century. The Government's micro-economic reform agenda has already achieved landmark reforms in telecommunications, domestic aviation, the national rail system and the waterfront. Now it is time to turn to the antiquated, even nightmarish, legislation that regulates the broadcasting industry. Of course, broadcasting is different from some of the other service industries; it does not have the same impact on economic efficiency. Nevertheless, in the future it will be of very great significance in the development of information and entertainment services as technology drives communications industries together. This draft legislation is not only intended as a basis for dealing with the problems in broadcasting caused by an overconcentration on legalism. At the same time it aims to be more technology neutral, dealing with broadcasting services, whether delivered by radio transmitters, satellites or cable. This Bill does not represent a finalised government position. The Bill has been developed following a long period of review PAIRS and analysis-a review that was initiated in response to a perceived need for change from both within government and the industry. It forms the basis on which wide-ranging public consultation can be undertaken. Following that consultation process, which I will outline shortly, and in the light of views expressed, the Government will be in a position to settle the final form of the Bill for introduction into the Parliament during the autumn sittings in 1992. The Bill before you provides a coherent regulatory framework based on a need to accommodate' the future, not a desire for change for change's sake. It continues to recognise that broadcasting is an integral part of national identity and culture and of our democratic society. While this means that there must continue to be obligations placed on broadcasters, the Bill has nonetheless been developed in the context of the Government's broader micro-economic reform agenda, and seeks to promote sensible competition and structural adjustment in the industry, allowing it to take advantage of new technologies as they become available. Since 1983 there have been some 20 substantial amendments to the Broadcasting Act 1942. Further ad hoc amendments will only add to its complexity and the potential for more loopholes to be created and exploited. We need a new Act capable of allowing the broadcasting industry to respond to both the complexities of the modern marketplace and innovations arising out of technological developments. Continuing to inhibit the natural development of this industry through unnecessarily cumbersome regulation will disadvantage consumers and be detrimental to the longer term prospects for Australia. The limitations of the current Act have constrained development and structural adjustment of the broadcasting industry, and thus diversity for consumers. It has blinkered us to the technologies looming on the horizon, allowing us to only slowly accommodate technologies that have been available for years elsewhere. Despite the consensus on the need for change, it has to be said that there have been predictable pressures to protect those parts of the current regime that serve specific interests. I have been mindful of the need to balance the diverse, and often conflicting, aspirations of interested groups in developing a regulatory framework to serve the public interest in all its dimensionssocial, cultural and economic-while also meeting the needs of a changing and growing industry. Worldwide, nations are having to come to terms with new demands on broadcasting, in particular in the commercial sector. The advent of satellite broadcasting, with its transborder possibilities, coupled with new technologies such as digital audio broadcasting that have the potential to remove scarcity of the spectrum for radio, will irretrievably influence the diversity and types of services available to consumers. We cannot and must not continue to ignore these changes. If we do, we run the risk of having them externally imposed, or of missing out altogether on development opportunities for our own industry. This statement and the draft Bill represent a comprehepsive response by this Government to three reports by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. The reports are entitled Role and Functions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, Role and Functions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal-Supplementary Report, and To Pay or Not to Pay and other new broadcastingrelated services. These reports made a valuable contribution to the development of the draft Bill and I thank the members of the Committee for their efforts. The Bill provides a consistent, yet flexible, regulatory framework within which the industry will be able to accommodate this change yet operate with confidence and a sense of predictability, while also providing for proper commercial and public accountability, consistent with our international obligations. In the interests of regulatory certainty, and so as not to unnecessarily impede commercial operations, it is important that regulation of broadcasting services should, to the greatest extent possible, be consistent with wider commercial law. However, it is recognised that, where regulation seeks to achieve specific gov-mment objectives for broadcasting services, this cannot always be the case. For example, to meet our objective of keeping these services firmly in Australian hands, foreign ownership laws that are more stringent than for any other industry are applied. Similarly, given the limited competition in the television industry, it is important to ensure that any special provisions that recognise and allow the wider commercial market to operate should not do so in a way that would further limit that competition. Mechanisms would include requiring prior approval of any commercial transaction that would, incidental to the objectives of that transaction, temporarily breach limits in the Act, and the imposition of strict time limits to rectify it. I do not propose to detail the provisions of the Bill. The Bill itself and the explanatory essay accompanying it provide a far better basis on which people can make their judgments. There are, however, one or two features that I would draw to the attention of honourable members. For the first time broadcasting legislatiqn will contain objects that set out clearly the outcomes the Parliament wishes to see from its role in the regulation of broadcasting. This will assist the formulation of decisions and guide the ongoing administration of the Act by the regulatory authority and enforcement through the courts. These objects are: to provide a regulatory environment that will facilitate the development of a broadcasting industry in Australia that is efficient, competitive and responsive to consumer needs; to promote the availability to audiences throughout Australia of a diverse range of radio and television services offering entertainment, education and information; to encourage diversity in control of commercial television broadcasting licences and commercial radio broadcasting licences; to ensure that Australians have effective control of licences of that kind; to promote the role of broadcasting services in developing and reflecting a sense of national identity, character and culture; to promote the provision of high quality and innovative programming by providers of commercial broadcasting services; to encourage providers of commercial and community broadcasting services to be responsive to the need for a balanced coverage of matters of public interest and for an appropriate coverage of matters of local significance; to encourage providers of broadcasting services to respect prevailing community attitudes to matters of taste and decency; and to encourage the provision of appropriate means for addressing complaints about broadcasting services. Each aspect of the Bill reflects these various components to a greater or lesser degree. A further feature of the Bill is the emphasis on dealing with each type of service in a consistent, but not necessarily uniform, fashion. This approach recognises that various media and the information and entertainment services within them have a different power to influence the Australian public. For example, free-to-air broadcasting is more pervasive and persuasive than a restricted narrowcast service-thus the regulations that apply must reflect these varying abilities to influence. Hence where new services are demonstrably different from mainstream broadcasting, they should not be subjected to the same degree of regulation. However, where a service is within the parameters of traditional broadcasting, the appropriate regulation should apply, regardless of how the service is delivered to consumers. The control provisions are a key reform of the Bill. The concept of control is now fairly well developed in corporate law. It rightly focuses on those in a position to exercise control over significant aspects of a company. It accepts that control can arise through a variety of mechanisms, including voting rights, contractual rights of direction or personal influence. Consistent with this approach, the provisions of the Bill focus on the important dimension of control of a licence where direct owhership limits are only one factor. They recognise the increasing complexity of corporate structures in the global marketplace. They therefore move from the rigidity of attempting to describe every possible ownership or control structure-the approach of the current Act that creates opportunities for avoidance-to laying down unambiguous conditions and limits that must be observed by licensees. The Bill then confers on the regulatory authority, the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the power to investigate and act on any suspected artifice or arrangement that may seek to contravene them. Specific limits on matters such as holdings of equity and voting interests must be set where ownership itself is an issue and to provide prima facie guidance as to levels that could lead to control. While the numbers are open to debate, I believe that the Bill provides a robust framework to enforce those limits once set by the Government. It will ensure that the spirit as well as the letter of the law is met. The print media inquiry is currently considering foreign and cross-media ownership. Any finding that could affect broadcasting services or cross-media limits will be considered in the context of this Bill. The innovative approach to control in the Bill may in fact provide some useful ideas for the inquiry. I The Bill makes specific provision for the regulation of pay TV and embodies the Government's decisions on ownership that I announced on 9 October. However, as a new industry with an as yet undetermined structure or market base, it could jeopardise the industry's viability before it began if we were to lock in specific limits before we had the opportunity to discover more details of that market. This will enable appropriate levels to be determined by the Government following the consultative phase for inclusion in either the Bill or the licensing arrangements and then enforced by the ABA. The Bill provides for a more transparent and accountable planning regime for new services; for streamlined administrative processes in regard to licensing of services, particularly in relation to renewal of licences and inquiries procedures; and a more flexible and effective sanctions regime. Most importantly, the Bill maintains support for Australian content, quality children's programming and observance of community attitudes towards taste and decency. It also ensures that commercial and programming control remains firmly in Australian hands. As I mentioned earlier, the Bill is not the Government's final position on the new legislation, but an exposure draft intended to facilitate community consideration of the issues. There is no artifice in that; that is exactly what it is. It is not a Bill endorsed by Cabinet. We are here to hear the views of all those who wish to contribute to the debate on this matter. A widespread process of consultation will be undertaken over the next three months on several fronts. I intend to make myself available to speak at a number of maj01 conferences on issues arising out of the review of broadcasting and to receive the views of any interested parties who want to make a submission. Senior departmental officials will be available to explain the Bill at relevant major conferences and seminars held over the next few months, as well as conduct an intensive program of bilateral discussions with all parties on issues arising out of the Bill. My Department has established a streamlined process to receive requests for the relevant documents and to answer queries about the issues. The Caucus subcommittee on broadcasting, chaired by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), will be initiating widespread community consultation on the Bill and related documentation, and will report to me in February next year. The Bill and supporting documentation are now available for comment and response by formal submission until the end of February 1992. Contact officers in my Department who will coordinate responses are identified in the material accompanying the Bill. My staff have of course put a lot of work into this. The relevant officers are in serried ranks above us, and I thank them for the work they have put into this, which has been an extraordinary labour not of love, I suspect, but of something else, over the last few months. I think they have done a fine job on it. I look forward to the vigorous debate that will ensue over the next few months and the outcome in the form of new, relevant and forward looking broadcasting legislation. I present the following paper: Broadcasting Services Bill 1991-Ministerial GATION Statement, 7 November 1991. Motion (by Mr Griffiths) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.

200,Dr BLEWETT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"by leave-I table the Second Annual Report to Parliament on the International Development Cooperation Program and the First Comprehensive Environmental Audit of the Australian International Development Cooperation Program, and I will make a brief statement. The 1989 review of AIDAB by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended that an annual statement be made on the aid program and the extent to which it has met its objectives over the year. This is the second such statement. The first was tabled last year by Senator Evans. In reviewing the events of the past year, I should first note that ministerial responsibility for the aid program was transferred to me, under the new title of Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, from 1 February 1991. This addition to my portfolio responsibilities has given me considerable professional and personal pleasure. Overseas aid is an area in which, I have held a very special interest throughout my adult life. Indeed, it is my firm conviction that the quality of any developed country's aid program provides an excellent measure of its wider characteristics. If it is a good international citizen, it is generally benign to its own. If it shows compassion abroad, it will show even more at home. I submit that by any measure, Australia has passed the test of good international citizenship in 1991, despite the unprecedented demands that have been placed upon us. Australia's aid program has been stretched to its limits during this period of enormous global upheaval. But its ability to respond to rapidly changing events efficiently and effectively has not faltered. The highlights of 1991 for Australia's aid program largely reflect the significant events which have taken place across the world during the past 12 months-and that, in itself, is evidence that we are both relevant and flexible in our overseas development activities. Most of these events are set out in greater detail in the document that I have tabled, Program but some deserve speCial mention here. Aid Volume The most significant highlight of the year has been the Government's decision to increase total official development assistance (ODA) by more than $50 million to $1,314 million-an increase in real terms of one per cent. Hopefully, this is the first step in pursuit of the goal set for us by the ALP National Conference in June to raise aid to 0.4 per cent of GNP by 1995. The Budget increase is of such significance because it allows us to expand our commitment in priority areas without decreasing activities in other areas of the program. Increased Emergency Assistance For example, this increase in funding has enabled us to maintain emergency, relief and refugee assistance at the record amount of $64 million allocated last financial year. This week marked the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Australia's support for UNHCR and other organisations striving to relieve the plight of refugees is now more pressing than ever. There are currently more than 15 million refugees in the world, and this number is growing. Last financial year, we provided over $2 million in emergency assistance for the victims of the cyclone in Bangladesh and over $14m to alleviate the dire situation in the Horn of Africa. During the year, we provided $l1m to help those displaced by the conflict in Afghanistan. Almost $8m was given in response to victims of the Gulf war, and $7m for Mozambicans who have had to flee from the fighting in that country. Over $4m was provided to displaced Cambodians, both within Canlbodia and on the Thai border. Another $1. i3m was made available only two weeks ago to help repatriate displaced Khmers. This financial year, the Government has also made over $1m available to help victims of the floods in Cambodia. In the last three months, the Government has made $200,000 available for urgently needed relief supplies for victims of the conflict in Yugoslavia. South Africa Australia has been at the forefront in providing assistance as apartheid is dismantled in South Africa. Development cooperation with southern Africa provides a tangible demonstration of Australia's commitment to assist in this process. We are now well into a second triennial pledge of $110m for southern Africa and the front-line states. In June this year the Government announced that Australia would provide $2.3m to assist the anti-apartheid community in South Africa develop its capacity for economic planning. This is in recognition of the considerable economic challenges that will confront any government elected once apartheid is finally scrapped. Cambodia-Vietnam In Cambodia and Vietnam we have a reputation as a respected intermediary in negotiating a solution to the conflict in bodia. The Government is determined that contribution to the peace process will complemented by assistance to rehabilitate Indo-China. We have recently decided to resume direct bilateral aid to Vietnam, and formation of the Supreme National Council Cambodia has opened the way for direct bilateral assistance to that war torn country. To date, $6.4m has been allocated for each Cambodia and Vietnam in 1991-92 for aid tralia's provided through non-government oron ganisations and multilateral agencies. This will consolidate the goodwill generated by our World Bank. important role in the process that led to the peace agreement signed in Paris last month all parties to this conflict. The involvement of Australian businesses in the development cooperation program been one of our real successes. Following major restructuring of the development import finance facility, DIFF, during the year, funding for this program has been increased by $9m to $93m in 1991-92. This scheme combines development funds with export credits provided by the Export Finance and Insurance Commission, EPIC, for Australian companies bidding for development projects. In this way DIFF helps to ensure that the program is identifiably Australian, raising the profile of Australian products and skills in developing countries. By encouraging Australian companies to prove themselves, DIFF has opened up opportunities for considerable follow-on business for Australia. Environment An important measure of the quality of our development cooperation is its ecological sustainability. Environmental issues must be taken into account if development is to continue in the longer term. This does not mean that we should forsake development. Indeed, it will continue to be vital if millions of people are to escape the grip of poverty. But we must also be concerned about the quality of development. As I emphasised in January when launching the interim policy statement, Ecologically Sustainable Development in International Development Cooperation, environmental degradation, both in our Camregion and globally, is an important concern our for Australia. We can assist developing be countries to adopt strategies which place fewer demands on the environment. The environment assistance program for develthe oping countries announced by the Prime in Minister (Mr Hawke) in 1989 was effectively quadrupled in this year's Budget, and $80m will now be provided over the next four of years. This will include funding for Auscontribution to the Montreal Protocol Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and the global environment facility of the The Government's commitment to ecologicby ally sustainable development was also underlined during the year by the commissioning of a comprehensive environmental audit of the has development cooperation program, which I a am also tabling today. The report was conducted by Emeritus Professor Derek Ovington, and meets a commitment given by the Government in response to the Senate committee report on aid and the environment. It provides an overview of all activities undertaken by AIDAB, including over 760 bilateral projects. The release of the audit is timely. It provides clear evidence that environmental concerns are being progressively incorporated into the program. Professor Ovington and his team have made a number of useful suggestions which I am happy to commend to AIDAB and others associated with the development cooperation program. The report also gives substance to a record of understanding between AIDAB and the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. This was recently endorsed by both myself and the Minister, Mrs Kelly. It acknowledges that under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, the international development cooperation program is subject to the same rigorous process of environmental assessment as projects in Australia. Poverty Alleviation Reducing poverty in the Third World is the central humanitarian challenge that is today confronting us all. I emphasised this in launching the paper Poverty Alleviation Through Australian Development Cooperation in May this year. When launching the paper, I announced a broad poverty alleviation strategy to be followed by AIDAB. I believe that the best way that this problem can be addressed is to increase a country's national income and to ensure at the same time that economic growth is closely linked to better living standards for all. The poverty alleviation strategy now being implemented by AIDAB will include increasing the proportion of aid directly targeted to raising the ability of the poor to take advantage of the economic opportunities provided by growth. The Government continues to recognise that non-government organisations are an effective mechanism for delivering aid directly to the poor. During 1990-91, almost $67m of our development cooperation was channelled through NGOs. This was an increase of over $11m on 198990. Of this, the women in development fund was doubled to almost $0.8m in 1990-9l. The Government is now reviewing the extent to which women in development objectives have been incorporated into the wider program. Agricultural Research Agricultural research has improved the lives of the poor. The green revolution in South Asia was possible largely because of work by organisations such as the World Bank's Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, CGIAR, and the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, ACIAR. Research carried out by these institutions has also been important in reestablishing rice production in war tom areas of Cambodia. The Government this year increased funding for ACIAR by almost $2m to $18.9m and for international agricultural research organisations by over $1m to $7.4m. As well as the benefits that this brings to developing countries, Australia stands to benefit substantially from cooperation in international agricultural research. Australian farmers have had access to wheat genotypes derived by these organisations, and the value to Australia of consequent productivity increases has been conservatively estimated at $2 billion. In addition, surprising though it may seem to some, growth in the agricultural sector in developing countries is also good for Australian farmers. Improved agricultural productivity in developing countries raises overall growth, boosting urban incomes and generating demand for Australian exports such as wheat and beef. Australian wheat exports to Indonesia, for instance, increased by over 50 per cent in real terms from 1980-81 to 1989-90. This is at the same time as agricultural output in Indonesia grew by over one-third. Human Rights Human rights are an important aspect of development. Political freedoms can improve the ability of the poor to engage in productive activities and can spur economic development. By broadening Australia's relationship with developing countries, aid can increase the opportunities for Australia to raise human rights issues. Australia understands that fundamental human aspirations may be recognised in different ways. But the rights defined in the illternational Bill of Rights are universal. I do not believe, however, that development cooperation should be automatically conditional on recipients becoming more democratic. This does not mean that the Government is not concerned about human rights. Australia has been more outspoken than many other countries on this issue. Last year we raised more than 460 human rights cases in over 82 different countries. It would be nice to be able .to believe that suspending aid would automatically force offending governments to recognise fundamental human rights. Such an idea has a strong visceral appeal. The Government is prepared to suspend aid if the situation warrants it. We have suspended the program to Burma and have stopped new activities in China following events in July 1989. But the reality is that, in many cases, suspending or reducing aid can harm most those who are already repressed, without placing any significant pressure on governments to reform. Why Engage in Development Cooperation? One of the most interesting aspects of year for me has been to examine together aid and trade issues arising from the developtained ment cooperation program, and in the portfolio as a whole. In helping countries develop, the development cooperation proincreases gram plays an essential role in furthering Government's wider foreign policy objectives. Aid has real and very substantial benefits Australia. Simple slogans like 'charity begins home' fail to appreciate the nature of developstrong, ment cooperation. Aid is not charity. By cooperating with countries to promote development in the Third World, we promote direct Australian interests. In this sense, believe that 'development cooperation' is help. more applicable to the program than 'aid'. I should make it clear that I do not believe our development cooperation is in any way devalued by frankly acknowledging that the program serves tangible Australian interests. What is important is that there is a coincidence between moral and prudential interests. If the program did not effectively promote development, we would lose many benefits. Australia is located within a region of developing countries. Our fundamental security interests-whether economic, environmental or political-are inextricably tied up with the political stability and economic development of countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Development cooperation with the countries in our region and beyond strengthens Australia's security. Economic Security On the economic front, development cooperation brings both broad and specific benefits. Although it is the specific benefits which are more tangible, it is perhaps the broader benefits which are more important. ill the longer term, Australia's international economic security is heavily dependent on successful growth and development in our region. Some countries in Asia have done well in recent decades, but we should not assume too easily that the economic environment in our region will remain favourable. ill a number of countries in our region-in the the Philippines, Cambodia, Vietnam, Burma and the Papua New Guinea-the obstacles to suseconomic development remain substantial. Recent economic successes have given to rise to new challenges. There have been rapid in the demand for energy, growing the environmental problems and rising employment expectations on the part of young people for as education standards steadily improve. We in Australia have a shared interest with at the people of the Asian region in seeing sustainable and equitable economic development proceed in the next few decades. Of course, Australia's development cooperation will not guarantee that this broad objecI tive will be achieved, but it will certainly Assistance can be effectively targeted to overcome structural obstacles that constrain a country's ability to generate ·wealth. By contributing to the investment capital available in developing countries, our development cooperation can provide the physical and institutional infrastructure, such as the roads, bridges and energy supplies necessary for economic growth. By providing education and health care, we can assist people to make the most of opportunities for productive work. We can also assist governments to implement the macro-economic, micro-economic and institutional strengthening measures necessary to achieve stronger growth. Through our involvement with multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, we help to finance loans to assist developing countries introduce structural adjustment measures. In addition, the creation of a Pacific Economic Policy Section in AIDAB has enhanced Australia's capacity to make a well-informed contribution to policy dialogue with the countries of this region. In working to increase growth, development cooperation does not stand alone. It is actively complemented by the Government's trade policy. During the year, Australia has energetically advocated a greater level of coherence between the aid and trade policies of donor countries. We have worked to ensure that the high levels of protection in developed countries, especially in agriculture, do not take away with one hand the benefits that development cooperation provides with the other. By encouraging sustainable and broad-based growth in Asia, the development cooperation program provides new opportunities for an increasingly outward looking Australia. As developing countries in Asia especially grow, so too does their demand for our exports. Australia's trade with the six ASEAN countries, for instance, has increased dramatically as these countries have experienced economic success. Our trade with these countries jumped from $3.75 billion five years ago to $9.8 billion in 1990-91. Our involvement with multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the specialised United Nations agencies provides further export opportunities for Australia. The $30 billion spent on goods and services by these institutions every year offer promising opportunities for efficient Australian companies. We need to work harder in this area to ensure that we reap the full gains. But these organisations already buy more from Australia than we contribute to them. Transnatiomd Problems Cooperating with developing countries to solve transnational problems is a second area from which Australia and developing countries both have much to gain. As I emphasised earlier, the Government has been active to ensure that we promote ecologically sustainable development. Pollution in our region and the emission of ozone depleting gases are serious concerns for Australia. Similarly, cooperation on issues such as narcotics benefits all of the countries involved. Valuable assistance in law enforcement to stem the trade in narcotics has been provided to Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. Political Security Thirdly, development cooperation has important political benefits. For reasons of fundamental national security, Australia needs to build more diverse and substantive links with neighbouring countries. Development cooperation is an important element in this, as effectiveness reviews of the China, Cambodian and Indonesian programs have found. The geographic focus of the program reflects a solid commitment by Australia to build ties with the countries of Ouf. region. Over one-quarter of Australian development cooperation is with Papua New Guinea. Including our assistance to Papua New Guinea, Australia is the largest donor to the Pacific countries. We are also the fourth largest donor to ASEAN. Now more than ever, our development cooperation with the Asia-Pacific region is likely to be important. The need for massive financial assistance to eastern Europe and the Soviet Union has raised the very real fear among developing countries that aid will be diverted. y./e have an important interest that this does not occur. But if we are to be taken seriously, our own cooperation with this region must not decline. This does not mean that we have ignored the pressing humanitarian needs in eastern Europe. We have continued the Australian program of training to eastern Europe, and have extended this program to include the Soviet Union. We will contribute $45m over five years to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. But this has been additional to our development cooperation; it has not been at the expense of developing countries. Initiatives by the Government during 1991 have significantly improved the high quality of our development cooperation. We can be confident that our development cooperation is a positive contribution towards improving the lives of many in the Third World. This is only half the story. The development cooperation program reflects the humanity of the Australian people. But the Government has firmly in view the vital national interests are served by helping the countries in our region to develop. The development cooperaam tion program is an essential element in Australia's broader foreign policy. Cooperating to encourage development has substanreport, tial benefits for Australians as well as for people in developing countries. In the long term, development cooperation is an investment in Australia's economic, environmental and political security. Development cooperation helps each one of us. I present the following papers: Australia's International Development CoopeEvaris) ration Program-Annual audit of the environment in the Program, October 1991-Second annual report to Parliament-Ministerial Statement, November 1991. Motion (by Mr Griffiths) proposed: That the House take note of the papers.",109
201,Mr RUDDOCK,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"In responding on behalf of the Opposition to the speech of the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett), I first congratulate him on his appointment as the Minister responsible for Australia's overseas aid program. I am gratified by his ongoing commitment and personal interest. As a member of the then Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which undertook the review of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau and Australia's overseas aid program, I was one of those who enthusiastically encouraged the Government to appoint a Minister responsible for development cooperation, as we on that Committee called it. We set out the reasons why we believed it was so important that there be such a Minister. We saw it as being particularly important for Australia to maintain its Conclusion relations with the South Pacific. We noted that Australia was a major aid contributor to these countries where this was the major part of their economy. We saw it as being important in sending a powerful signal of Australia's commitment to regional prosperity and peace at a time when relations in the South Pacific were more complex and volatile. I could read at great length from the report that of the parliamentary Committee enjoining the Government to make such an appointment. I delighted that the Minister holds that appointment. I add, however, that when the Government responded to the Committee's it told us it had no intention of making such an appointment and argued rather fulsomely against it. That perhaps shows that governments are capable of learning the error of their ways. The Government suggested that it may cause some conflicts and difficulties with the principal Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth , and the joint Department for which this Minister is responsible. I think those 7 arguments had less weight, but obviously when the Government responded to the Committee's report at the time, it thought they had some weight. I do not intend to delay the House because I have little time to respond to this Second Annual Report to Parliament on Australia s International Development Cooperation Program. I thought I would look at the basis upon which we are receiving this report. The Minister is no doubt aware that this arose from the review by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. The Committee spent a great deal of time dealing with its concerns about the effectiveness of the aid program and about accountability. The Committee, which had been asked to undertake a review of Australia's overseas aid program following the Jackson Committee report, was seriously critical of the extent to which evaluation of aid programs occurs and is conducted. It was anxious that AIDAB should organise its staffing to undertake a significant volume of evaluation activities and it was certainly of the view that that should not cause reductions in program management or policy capacity. The Committee recommended in a rather full way that the Government should have a review which is presented to Parliament on a regular basis. The Committee's resolution was in these terms: The Committee strongly supports the proposition that, the Minister should make an annual Parliamentary statement on the Aid Program, and the extent of its success in achieving all its objectives. The Government in this case said, 'The Government agrees that such an annual parliamentary statement on the aid program would be appropriate'. It would be perhaps desirable-I do not mean this as a trite comment-for the Minister to look at what the Committee said about what it had in mind in terms of accountability. If one measures this statement against the Committee's requirement, I regret to say to the Minister that the statement does not fulfil that need. The Committee noted that AIDAB reports to the Senate at Estimates committees, that it had been subject to periodic reviews and that it has an annual budget paper and a chapter in the Department's annual report which has some useful information on expenditure initiatives. It went on to say: But they are inadequate documents for full accountability to the public. Neither provides a comprehensive or analytical discussion of policy. A recurring proposal, originally contained in the 1982 report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is that the Minister should make . . . a statement on the conduct and policy basis of the Aid Program... It went on to say: This Committeethat is, the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committeesupports this proposition. The utility of the Ministerial statement depends to some extent on AIDAB making more effort to identify program successes and failures. While administrative issues are still the easiest things for a bureaucracy to talk about, they are not the matters which most concern the community or its representatives. It went on to say: It must 'tell us how our aid money is allocated in terms which reveal the development impact of our aid spending' ... I have to say that, while I am delighted that the Minister is in the position that he is in and is going to devote the time and effort to this work, I certainly hope that he will take up that Committee report's recommendations and my reminder of the need for such accountability. In the report that he has presentednot in his speech-I find only two elements which meet what the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee had in mind, and they are in the discussion on pages 17 and 18 dealing with improving program delivery and review mechanisms. The report states: As part of this, Vision 91-AIDAB's corporate objective for the year-has concentrated on aid quality. A major initiative during the year has been to improve planning and design of the program. The processes by which AIDAB's country and global programs are developed have been revised. All forms of assistance to individual countries will be integrated within an overall strategy. It also states: The key feature of the new arrangements include the introduction of decision points at the end of each stage of an activity. This will avoid poor projects being continued and provide a better audit trail. Over the page it states: Considerable efforts have been made to strengthen the review process. . . Program effectiveness reviews were initiated in 1990. They were in relation to China, Indonesia and Cambodia. It also states: A summary of lessons . . . has also been published. I would have thought that those documents, along with the document that the Minister has tabled today-a very substantial and useful document in relation to one aspect of accountability, that is, the Annual Audit of the Environment in the Australian International Development Cooperation Programwould have been tabled. As part of my own preparation-as the Minister knows, one has only an hour or so to undertake preparation for such a debate-I thought that I should seek out these reviews and have a look at them because they were not presented to me as part of the documentation for today. I was told that nobody in the AIDAB library was able to assist me. They were not aware of the documents and could not make them available. I checked with the shadow Minister and he was not able to make them available to me. I hope that, in future when these matters are being looked at, consideration will be given to including not only a detailed statement of the sort that the parliamentary Committee envisaged but also all of the review documents so that the Parliament can be properly informed and prepared for a detailed debate on this issue. Accountability is a matter of very siderable moment. In the short time that left, I want to take the opportunity today deal with a couple of matters that have been raised in the Minister's statement to the Parliament-a statement which has been largely assertion and very much a disappoinsolution. ting statement. The first matter that I would like to take is the comments in relation to aid volume. do so against the context of what the Minister would remind me is my own Party's view that, in the present disastrous economic situation that this country faces, aid programs can no more be quarantined from government expenditure review than can other programs. The Minister has noted that this year the Government has increased by more than $50m the $1,314m that is allocated as part of Australia's overseas aid program. He did point out, but it was discovered further in statement, that $20m of that additional is money that was to be allocated for global environmental programs with which the Government is involved. On page 6 of his statement it was made clear that $80m is to be provided over four years as Australia's contribution to the Montreal Protocol' ozone depleting substances and the global environment facility of the World Bank. It seems to me that, when one recognises that those fundings are being made out of the aid budget, it makes the increase less meaningful. But the point that I want to make in relation to this, and what we find disappointing about the Government's presentation in this area from time to time, is that the Government has made many reductions in Australia's overseas aid over time-at a time when Australia was comparatively more prosperous than it is now-and they were cuts that were made in the context of a government which had given ongoing commitments to maintain aid at real levels. The difference between the Government's position and the Opposition's is that we are spelling out frankly the position that we take on this matter. The second point that I want to make relates to the issue of additional new developments that the Government has outlined, conparticularly in relation to Cambodia and is Vietnam. All of us anxiously watched what to has occurred in relation to Cambodia and we certainly desire that the Government's intervention, such as it has been, will assist in ensuring that there is an enduring peaceful We watch hopefully for that. We do have considerable doubts still about what might be the possible role of the Khmer up Rouge in this, but obviously in the context of I the changed environment the Government has moved to make certain changes in the way in which aid is provided to Vietnam, and presumably is foreshadowing that government to government aid on a bilateral basis may eventually be provided for Cambodia. But I find disappointing the capacity of this Government to be able to assist in that area and the prospects of assistance that are held not out. On the Government's own estimates, his Australia will provide $6.4m to Cambodia and $50m Vietnam in the year 1991-92. While the Government says that this is an increase on the $5.4m provided to Cambodia and $5.8m provided to Vietnam, the fact is that very substantial aid is already provided to each of those countries through the voluntary, nonon government organisations that the Government has used to provide assistance in those regional countries to date. The point that needs to be clearly understood is that, if the Government is to make substantial aid available to Vietnam and Cambodia, it is going to have to provide substantial and additional funds beyond those which have been allocated to date, or it is going to have to diminish the funds that are provided presently through voluntary organisations in order to provide the funds on a government to government basis. When we look at the nature of the programs and the success of the programs that have been undertaken, particularly in places such as Vietnam and Cambodia, one wonders whether that would be the most effective and most appropriate way to provide that support. Will simply shifting the funding provide better and more effective aid delivery to Vietnam and to Cambodia? One of the programs that I have seen where the Government has provided funds was detailed in the environment report that was tabled today. That was the irrigation project of Australian Freedom from Hunger where we have spent, up until May this year, $1.6m on trying to restore the agricultural capacity of Brown, R. J. fields that were devastated during the Khmer Rouge period and where people were unable to undertake farming in a reasonable capacity. Duffy, M. J. If time had permitted I would have taken the opportunity to talk about the Government's priorities in the program, because the Opposition has considerable concerns about the way in which the Government funded aid to South Africa, in particular, through organisations such as the ANC. I am sorry that such limited capacity for debate occurs on a topic as important as this.

203,Mr DUFFY,AYES,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. On 23 July 1991 the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) and I announced a range of measures which NOES the Government would be taking to restore confidence and stability in the unlisted property trust industry. As part of that approach, the Government decided to legislate, with effect from the time of the announcement, for the imposition of a standard 12month notice period for the withdrawal of funds from existing 'public' unlisted property trusts. As you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, real estate is a long term investment. However, managers of unlisted property trusts are required by law to buy-back unitholders investments when requested to do so. This requirement has usually been accommodated by a provision in the relevant trust deeds enabling the management company to redeem from the assets of the trust units which it is required to buy back. The relevant legislation does not provide for maximum or minimum periods within which buy-back or redemption requests must be met. This period has been set in the relevant trust deeds. Most investors were, until mid-1990, able to withdraw their NOES investments by giving between one week and two months notice. With the downturn of the commercial property market, such redemption arranPAIRS gements have become unworkable. Unlisted property trusts are unable to attract new investments or sell property at realistic values in the current depressed market. Both these avenues had previously provided management companies with the liquidity necessary to meet buy-back or redemption requests on short notice. The realisation that property values had slumped and adverse perceptions created by difficulties in relation to the Estate Mortgage trusts and other corporate collapses resulted in increases in the levels of withdrawals. As a result, most of the unlisted property trusts which were not ""linked to financial institutions were, in the second half of last year, forced to call meetings of their unitholders to seek their agreement for temporary freezes on withdrawals and/or to adopt extended withdrawal notice periods. In 1990 the relevant regulatory agency at the time, the National Companies and Securities Commission, acted quickly to attempt to restore confidence and stability in the unlisted property trust industry. In July of that year, they established a task force which included representatives of the relevant industry peak bodies to attempt to find a solution to the illiquidity of unlisted property trusts. In August 1990 the NCSC issued a set of guidelines, arising out of the work of that task force, designed to enable such trusts to operate on a stable basis. The work of the NCSC was continued by the Australian Securities Commission when it took over the responsibility for corporate regulation on 1 January 1991. In February this year, the ASC recommended to me a number of measures which were designed to ensure that unlisted property trusts could operate a stable basis, despite the weak property market conditions. In brief, these involve requiring such trusts to maintain adequate liquidity levels at all times. A failure would result in the convening of unitholder meetings to consider the future of the trust. While my Department was examining these proposals, the major bank and life insurance company-owned fund managers placed before the Government advice relating to the deteriorating state of the unlisted property trust industry and, in particular, the situation with their trusts. It was apparent these trusts were on the verge of experiencing liquidity difficulties. The Government was convinced, after considering the advice of Treasury and the Reserve Bank, that the property imposition of a standard 12-month notice period was essential if the fund managers were to cope with the difficulties they were facing in meeting withdrawals from their trusts at short notice and the interests unitholders were to be protected. There was a serious risk that a run on trusts would have developed. Despite possible investor perceptions to the contrary, the institutions are not in a position to provide unlimited liquidity support for their fund management subsidiaries. The parent banks especially are not in this position. The Reserve Bank has a policy of restricting dealings of banks with their managed subsidiaries to an arm's length or commercial basis. In these circumstances, a run on the institution linked funds would have almost invariably led to the fire sale of commercial properties into an already weak market. Prices would have been driven down further. As a result, investors would have suffered significant losses. It might be noted that, in any run situation, the more sophisticated wholesale or institutional investors tend to be amongst the first to withdraw their investtments with ordinary retail investors being left to bear the bulk of the ensuing losses. Had we allowed a situation to develop whereby the managers of the institution-linked trusts were forced to place large amounts of property onto the market, this could also have led to broader systemic problems for the on financial system in general. In particular, a significant proportion of the around $29billion of non-performing loans currently being carried by the banking system are to do so secured by commercial property. Faced with a further substantial fall in property values, the banks would have been forced to increase their loss provisioning against these loans and to reassess the asset quality of currently performing borrowers. The consequent reduction in the supply of credit flowing from that process could have led to more business failures and further job that some of losses in the economy. The introduction of the standard 12-month notice of withdrawal period does not of itself the solve the liquidity problems of unlisted trusts nor was it intended to. Clearly, it is necessary for many of those trusts to restructure their operations so as to provide a better match between the essentially long term nature of real property as an investment and of investor demands for ready liquidity. The introduction of the 12-month notice of these withdrawal period is providing management companies and trustees with breathing space parent in which to reach agreement with their unitholders on restructuring proposals. The Government expects all necessary restructuring to be completed by the end of next July. I note that this process has begun. Mr Deputy Speaker, the main features of funds the Bill are as follows: Investors in those unlisted property trusts regulated under corporations law which existed at 23 July 1991 will be required to give 12 months notice in relation to buy-back and redemption requests in respect of units in those trusts. This rule will not apply to unitholders who are in financial hardship. Management companies will, where they are satisfied of such a unitholder's financial circumstances, be required to buy back units as soon as practicable at a discount not exceeding 7.5 per cent. Any disputed cases will be required to be referred to the trustee for determination. There is a mechanism in the Bill to enable unitholders to vary the standard 12 month notice period in circumstances where it is commercially viable to do so. Such variations will require the approval of 75 per cent of unitholders voting at a meeting provided that at least 25 per cent of unitholders eligible to vote do so. A meeting will be able to be convened on the initiative of the management company, trustee or upon a requisition from 50 or one-tenth of the unitholders in the trust, whichever is fewer. In order to avoid a situation where the notice period is shortened in circumstances which may adversely affect the viability of the trust, both the management company and the trustee will be able to apply to the Australian Securities Commission for disallowance of a variation to the notice period. The ASC will be able to disallow such variations where it is satisfied that it may result in a threat to the liquidity of the trust or the liquidity of the management company. In addition, the ASC will be empowered to permit the trustee to refuse redemptions from trust assets where it is satisfied that such redemptions are likely to adversely affect the value of remaining units or otherwise prejudice the interests of the remaining unitholders. This provision is designed to prevent a situation where a trust is forced to sell properties into a weak market in order to meet redemption requests. The granting of permission to refuse redemption requests will not, however, alleviate the management company from its obligations to buy back units in accordance with the trust deed. The Bill will also: require buy-backs and redemptions to be made at the price prevailing on the date of payment as opposed to the date of giving notice; enable unitholders to, with the approval of the management company, withdraw a buyback or redemption request; and ensure that unitholders do not lose any of their entitlements to income or other benefits between the date of giving notice of withdrawal and when they are actually paid out. As I have mentioned, the standard 12 month notice period is part of a range of measures designed to restore confidence in the unlisted property trust industry. Other elements of the new regulatory structure which I announced on 23 July are to be given effect to by the making of regulations under the corporations law. These regulations, which will be largely based on recommendations made to me by the ASC, are presently being developed by my Department in close consultation with the ASC and relevant industry bodies. I expect to release a draft of these regulations for public comment later this month. The principal features of the new regulatory structure are as follows: management companies and trusts will be required to maintain an adequate level of liquidity at all times; a breach of the liquidity requirements will result in the calling of a meeting of investors to consider, among other things, the removal of the manager, the listing of the trust or the winding-up of the trust; borrowings by trusts will be limited to 20 per cent of the gross assets of the trust; and there will be a capital adequacy requirement for management companies. These requirements are designed to overcome the problem of the essentially illiquid nature of property investments in relation to those trusts which continue to operate as 'traditionaI' unlisted property trusts. The proposed liquidity requirements will be framed in such a manner as to automatically require the convening of unitholders meeting to determine the future of the trust before it gets into a position of serious difficulty. Beyond this the ASC will, as I have already outlined, have the power to permit the trustee to refuse redemption requests. Mr Deputy Speaker, the Bill also contains provisions which will be applicable to unit trusts in general. First, the Bill will enable amendments to be made to trust deeds for unit trusts where they are approved by 75 per cent, by value, of unitholders voting at a meeting provided that at least 25 per cent, by value, of unitholders eligible to vote do so. Under the existing law, such amendments cannot be made unless they are approved by an absolute majority of unitholders. While the existing rule certainly ensures that management companies take active steps to encourage investors in unit trusts to participate in meetings where amendments to the deed are proposed, there has been some concern that the existing requirement in many circumstances is too onerous. The proposed amendment was sought by the industry. The Government believes that it strikes a better balance between ensuring that trust deeds are not amended without an adequate degree of investor support and the imposition of costs on unit trusts which are ultimately borne by the investors. Secondly, the Bill contains an amendment which will ensure that unitholders are able to requisition meetings for the purposes of giving directions to the trustee or management company in relation to the affairs of the trust. Such directions must not be inconsistent with the trust deed. This amendment corrects a difficulty resulting from a judicial decision which effectively meant that unitholders were only able to give directions to the trustee in relation to matters concerning the accounts of the trustee or the accounts of the management company. The Bill also contains an amendment to the corporations law to make it clear that the Corporations and Securities Panel has the power to make interim orders pending the final outcome of proceedings brought before it by the Australian Securities Commission. The role of the Panel, on the reference from the ASC, is to determine whether or not unacceptable circumstances have occurred in relation to an acquisition of shares in a company, or as a result of conduct in relation to shares in or the affairs of, a company. Where the Panel declares an acquisition or conduct to be unacceptable, it may make orders to protect the rights or interests of shareholders or to ensure that the take-over proceeds as it should have done but for that acquisition or conduct. The Full Court of the Federal Court recently ruled that as a matter of statutory construction the Panel does not have the power to make interim orders to preserve the rights of persons pending its final determination of an application before it. The amendment in the Bill ensures that the Panel will have such powers. There is wide acceptance of the need for the Panel to have this power. Mr Deputy Speaker, I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.  journed. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1991 Bill presented by Mr Duffy, and read a first time. Second Reading",118
204,Mr DUFFY,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Mr Deputy Speaker, the commencement of the new national companies and securities scheme on 1 January 1991 was the single most important landmark in the history of corporate regulation in this country. It marked the bringing of corporate regulation for the first time under a single national regulator, the Australian Securities Commission, accountable to a single legislature, the Commonwealth Parliament. The transition to the national scheme has been a remarkably smooth one with the Australian Securities Commission quickly taking up its key role of providing regulatory supervision of the activities of corporations and the securities markets. The establishment of the new regulatory framework on. 1 January marked the completion of the first phase of the Government's program to reform the structure and substance of corporate regulation in Australia. The importance of this for Australia should be not underestimated. Without a credible regulatory environment, Australian companies will not be able to attract local or international investors. There can be no doubt that Australia's reputation as an attractive place for international investment was severely tarnished by the activities of some entrepreneurs. This Government is determined to redress that damage and restore Australia's standing as a place for secure investment. Already there are encouraging signs that the Government's resolute action to tum performance in corporate regulation around is beginning to be recognised. The second phase of the Government's reform program involves a sustained and far reaching program of reform of key areas of the corporate law long recognised as in need of overhaul. Throughout the 1980s, the flawed structure of the cooperative scheme not only led to inadequate enforcement of the law but also largely impeded the law reform process itself. This Government is determined to remedy the last 10 years of neglect in this area. Mr Deputy Speaker, as honourable members are aware the corporations law which came into force on 1 January this year introduced some reforms in relation to prospectuses, takeovers and the strengthening of the investigating powers for the corporate regulator. At the time of introduction of th- Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 which established that law, I foreshadowed an ongoing program of corporate law reform. The Bill now before the House is the second major such reform initiative introduced by this Government since the commencement of the new scheme. Honourable members will recall that the first such initiative was the Corporations Legislation Amendment Act 1991 passed by this Parliament earlier this year. The first of the package of reforms contained in that Act brought about necessary and long overdue reform to require companies to consolidate their accounts and those of the entities they controlled so that investors and creditors would be able to determine the true financial position of a company. The second key area of reform included in that Act strengthened the law relating to insider trading so that the pernicious practice of insiders dealing on the basis of price sensitive information could be more effectively attacked. These new laws, which came into operation on 1 August this year, have sent a clear signal to local and international investors that integrity and credibility will be restored to our markets. The Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) deals with reform of other discrete areas of the corporations law, namely, fundraising, the Australian company number provisions and the settlement of securities transactions. In relation to fundraising, the Bill proposes a number of technical amendments which will remove current uncertainties in relation to the operation of the corporations law. Amendments to the Australian company number provisions will finetune those provisions to meet business concerns regarding the cost of complying with the ACN requirements. Other amendments will facilitate new settlement procedures for stock exchange transactions and assist the Australian Stock Exchange to improve the efficiency of its settlement procedures. This will enable the Exchange to offer a service which is comparable with best international practice. This Bill was publicly exposed with the agreement of the Ministerial Council for Corporations in August. A number of submissions have been received from interested persons and organisations. Many of the suggestions for changes to the Bill have been incorporated into the Bill as it is now introduced. In accordance with the heads of agreement between the Commonwealth the States and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation, the Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted on the Bill and has approved its introduction into Parliament. Before dealing in more detail with the provisions of the Bill, I would like to briefly place this Bill in the context of the Government's overall program for the reform of companies and securities laws. In particular, I want to make it clear that this Bill is far from the end of the story for reform of the law in this area. I am proposing that a further corporations law reform Bill, the third this year, be released for public comment later this year. That Bill will contain much needed and long overdue reforms to the law relating to loans to directors and intra-company transactions, corporate insolvency law and directors' duties. It will also facilitate introduction of a fully automated clearance and settlement regime for securities traded on the Australian Stock Exchange. The Government will also bring before the Parliament next year further reforms implementing the recent report of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee on an enhanced disclosure regime for securities. It is my view that the key to fundraising laws which are fair to all participants and which will attract investment is the putting in place of a regime which ensures the timely disclosure of material information to the market. Such laws, together with a regulatory body which has the foresight and readiness to embrace the best information technology to provide an up to date database will, I believe, prove decisive in attracting investment to our markets. For some time now there has been widespread concern as to whether the corporations law provides an appropriate regulatory structure for collective investment schemes. The Australian Law Reform Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee will be reporting on this matter next year. The huge level of funds invested in pooled investments by ordinary Australians makes it essential that there be exemplary regulation of this area. In the law enforcement area, I expect to introduce legislation soon to enable compulsory powers to be exercised by Australian business regulatory agencies on behalf of their foreign counterparts. The internationalisation of securities markets and the rapid transfer of funds across borders make it essential that the ASC be able to assist its overseas counterparts in the investigation and prosecution of offences against securities laws. In tum these agencies will assist the ASC to fulfil its statutory mandate. Another matter which I regard as of the highest importance in the area of the enforcement of the corporations law concerns the self-incrimination provisions relating to ASC investigations. These provisions are currently under review by the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. The Committee's report and recommendations will be examined as a matter of the highest priority when available. It will be clear from the outline I have just given that considerable time and resources are being dedicated to the reform of our corporate laws. Given the regulatory failure and the excesses of a small but high-profile section of the business community during the 1980s, honourable members may rest assured that the Government will continue to maintain the momentum of reform and will continue to do so in close consultation with the business community and related professions. I will now deal briefly with the key features of the Bill before the House. Fundraising As I stated earlier, significant reforms to the regulation of corporate fundraising came into effect under the corporations law on 1 January 1991. The Government is satisfied with the substance of the fundraising reforms. The new provisions have resulted in better information being provided to potential investors and a more informed market. Notwithstanding some criticisms of the provisions, all the signs are that business has quickly adapted to the new fundraising laws. Indeed the significant capital raisings this year indicate that the greater information being provided to the market is facilitating investment activity and confidence. However, the Government recognises jhat experience since 1 January has resulted in the identification of a number of matters which warrant clarification. This Bill includes a number of largely technical amendments for this purpose with a view to ensuring commercial certainty. These ame-dments are essentially those set out in the exposure draft with some minor i modifications as a result of comments made during the exposure period. At the time of releasing Jhe exposure draft in August, I announced that I had asked my Department to review the application of the provisions of the law which prohibit the issue of prospectuses containing materially false misleading statements or from which there material omissions. A range of conflicting views were expressed by various interested parties. Following further consideration of this matter, and in the light of public submissions, it is felt that it would not be desirable to amend section 996 in a manner which would involve any significant policy changes at this stage, without the benefit of public exposure of the amendments. Instead the Bill includes an amendment which clarifies the position section 996 by providing that it does not apply to those offers in relation to which prospectus is not required to be lodged the ASC. The long term approach to civil criminal liability in relation to the offers securities will be reviewed in the context of consideration of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee's recent report entitled Report on an Enhanced Statutory Disclosure System. Other amendments to the fundraising negotiable provisions in the Bill: make it clear that the fundraising provisions do not apply to trading of securities on the stock exchange; clarify how the prospectus provisions apply ber 1991. to other secondary offers of securities; and clarify the operation of various defences against civil liability for misstatements in, and omission from, prospectuses. The regulation of prescribed interests and arrangements-such as unit trusts-under the corporations law has also been the subject of some controversy. Apart from the question of the regulation of unlisted property trusts, which is being dealt with in separate legislation, the issue of whether the trustee or the management company is responsible for the keeping of the books of accounts for prescribed interests has caused particular concern. Pending the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee report on the appropriate regulatory framework for prescribed interests and other collective investment schemes, the Bill contains an amendment to make it clear that the trustee may continue to cause the or books of accounts for prescribed interests to are be kept by the management company. This will avoid unnecessary and costly disruption to the administration of unit trusts. Registration Numbers of Companies and Registrable Bodies The purpose of the Australian company number (ACN) and Australian registrable body number (ARBN) is to provide a simple of way of assisting persons dealing with companies, foreign companies and registrable a bodies to identify those bodies. The ACN and with the ARBN provide a unique nine digit numand ber for each Australian company, foreign of company and other registrable body. A moratorium on the use of an ACN or ARBN currently applies to the requirement for companies, foreign companies and other registrable bodies to display their ACN or ARBN on public documents or eligible instruments under the corporations law. However, companies and bodies are still required to display their ACN or ARBN on their common seal and any document that is required by the law to be lodged with the ASC. This moratorium expires on 31 DecemThe effect of the amendments proposed to the ACN and ARBN provisions will be as follows: cash register receipts produced by an electronic machine and which set out information which is stored in the machine will not be required to contain the ACN or ARBN of the company or body issuing the receipt; alternative abbreviations for ACN and ARBN, without full stops, will be available for use by companies and bodies in all official documents; an advertising document issued by a company which is not also used as a document for undertaking some form of transaction with a person will not be required to contain the company's ACN or ARBN; the ASC will be empowered to exempt a company or bodies that operate in transportation of persons or goods from being required to place its ACN or ARBN on documents that are used in connection with transportation where it is necessary or desirable in the interests of promoting or maintaining consistency in international practice relating to transport documents. Introduction of fixed date settlement for market transactions The Bill also contains important amendments which will facilitate the introduction of a fixed date settlement regime for transactions on the Australian Stock Exchange. The purpose of this regime is to ensure that settlement of a sale of securities takes place five days after the trade. It is anticipated that this requirement will reduce the risk in settlement of share transfers and the claims on the National Guarantee Fund, lead to more certainty for market participants and improve the international competitiveness of the Australian Stock Exchange. The regime being introduced by the Exchange follows internationally accepted standards for settlement of on-market transactions. Failure to implement such a regime in Australia could lead to offshore markets becoming more efficient and more competitive than the domestic market. This will in tum erode the liquidity of the Australian securities markets. This Bill extends the coverage of the National Guarantee Fund to facilities that have been developed by the Australian Stock Exchange to assist traders to comply with the new settlement requirements. The Exchange will also have access to the Fund for losses suffered by the Exchange as a result of brokers defaulting on their obligations under these new facilities. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.  journed.

209,Mr HAND,NOES,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs) (6.26 p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In the context of the Budget, the Government announced measures which would allow for improvements to the arrangements for the recovery of costs to the Commonwealth health and welfare budget which flow from the migration program. The migration program operates to Australia's benefit but there is a level of cost attached to some of its components. The Government proposes to improve existing cost recovery measures, through changes to the assurance of support scheme and through the provisions of this Bill. This Bill provides for the payment, by certain classes of migrants and persons approved for permanent residence, of a migration (health services) charge of $822 to offset Commonwealth health expenditure. Before dealing with the specifics of the let me provide an overview of the assurance of support scheme. In general terms, an assurance of support is a legal commitment made by the assurer to repay to the Commonwealth, States, public or charitable institutions any money or the value of any goods or services paid out to support the person or persons covered by the assurance. The assurance is an essential criterion under the migration regulations for applicants for permanent entry and stay in certain classes and a discretionary criterion in most other classes. The purpose of the assurance is to PAIRS ensure that the burden of some costs which newcomers may generate during their initial years of residence in Australia are borne by their sponsoring families and not by the general community. It is important to note that the existence of an assurance does not mean that any person covered by it cannot receive social security benefits or other assistance. Rather, it means that the assurer is liable to repay any support that is received. A new assurance of support scheme will be introduced by amendment to the migration regulations. The new scheme will reduce the liabilities which the assurer undertakes. First, the validity of the assurance will be reduced from the current five years to only two years. This represents a marked decrease in the time taken to incur debts. Secondly, the debts that may be recovered have been restricted to special benefits and Job Search and Newstart allowances paid by the Commonwealth. Other support costs will no longer be recoverable. The provisions for the recovery of limited health costs were outdated and not operating effectively. As a result they will be removed from the scheme. As a separate but related measure, this Bill provides a more effective means for the recovery of health costs by the Commonwealth. In the Budget context it was announced that the assurance of support scheme would be augmented by a refundable bond and a non-refundable health charge. The charge, introduced by this Bill is to be paid in addition to the Medicare levy. It will offset part of the cost to the Commonwealth of providing access to medical, hospital and Bill, pharmaceutical benefits to certain migrants during their first two years as permanent residents in Australia. The charge affects only those migrants in respect of whom the assurance is an essential criterion-parents who meet the balance of family test, aged dependent, last remaining, special need and orphan minor relatives and the Lebanese concession. The payment of the charge will in no way affect the existing requirement that all migrants have to satisfy Commonwealth health standards. If all criteria are met for the grant of a yisa or entry permit and if the charge is paid they will enter or will be approved to stay in Australia as permanent residents. As new permanent residents they have immediate access to our health and welfare systems, but are unlikely to have made the same lifetime contribution through taxes as other Australians. The health charge will enable the Government to recover an estimated SO per cent of the average medical, hospital and pharmaceutical costs incurred by persons covered by the assurance and will result in an additional estimated revenue to the Commonwealth of $9.9m in a full financial year. The introduction of the bond and the health charge reinforces the understanding by applicants and persons who give assurances of the costs of migration. It is expected that this will result in more careful consideration by the parties involved of their financial commitment. This Bill imposes the charge on applicants in the classes I have mentioned who have lodged their applications on or after 21 August 1991. It provides that the charge be paid after all other criteria are met and before a visa or entry permit may be granted. It also provides for exemptions from the charge for those persons who withdraw their applications. Persons who have paid the charge in respect of a class of visa are also exempt from paying any charge for the grant of the equivalent class of entry permit. To ensure that the charge retains its value in relation to health costs in future years, Bill provides for the indexation of the charge on an annual basis in line with the all group consumer price index. These measures will provide a more effective approach to the protection of the Commonwealth's health budget than was available under the old assurance of support scheme. I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned.",129

As honourable members would be aware, this motion suspends the 11 o' clock rule for the remainder of the session. It is normally an essential motion to pass before a guillotine is brought into place, and we are about to do that with motion No.7, which we shall deal with immediately after this.",130
212,Mr FIFE,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"The Opposition does not oppose the proposal by the Government. The arrangement that the Government has in mind, of course, is to provide additional time for business to be dealt with. The Opposition, of course, always supports such a motion. Our view is that the Government really does not make sufficient time available to deal adequately with its legislation, so this motion has our support. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That, in relation to the proceedings on the following Bills, so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the House making one declaration of urgency and moving one motion for the allotment the of time in respect of all the Bills: Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1991; Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991; Migration Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991; Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1991; Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991; Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1991; Income Tax (Deferred Interest Securities) (Tax File Number Withholding Tax) Bill 1991; .

213,Mr FIFE,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Hume-Manager of Opposition Business) (8.03 p.m.}-This motion, of course, does not have our support because it flies in the face of the previous motion. The previous motion, which was to suspend the 11 o' clock rule, was designed, as I said a moment ago, to provide additional time for Government business to be dealt with. What is proposed now is the introduction of the guillotine, which will reduce the amount of time that will be available on some very vital Bills. The House will be aware that I have repeatedly protested against the practice of this Government of resorting to the guillotine to process its legislation. Sadly, I am having to do it again, though only a few weeks ago I had hoped-and I made this comment in the House-that for once we would have a session that would be guillotine free. When I expressed that hope during the debate on Parliamentary Secretaries, I acknowledged that this current sitting has been better managed than sittings in the past. I want to repeat that, despite the fact that the Government has decided tonight to introduce the guillotine, this current sitting has been better managed than those in the past. Notwithstanding that the Government will not be in office for much longer, I am sure that by the time it leaves office it will have a better understanding of how the House should be managed. While this guillotine may not be as harsh, so far as time is concerned, as some that we have experienced, the Government nevertheless is again short-circuiting the legislative process. It is curtailing debating time and, as a consequence, the proper scrutiny and analysis of the legislation. In the previous sitting we had the outrageous situation in which the Government put through no fewer than 37 Bills under the guillotine, and they had to be dealt with in four days. At most we got 40 minutes on each, apart from one on which a mere 15 minutes was allowed. On this occasion we are not being subjected to such a tight regime, but the ruthlessness with which this Government has been prepared to apply the guillotine does not offer much comfort for the future. The loser in all of this is Parliament. Ever since this Government came to office, the process of downgrading Parliament and its proceedings has been going on. The use of the guillotine is just one of the forms that are part of the downgrading process. The Hawke Government has been notorious for nibbling away at the edges and for bringing in major changes through the back door. It is the old Fabian device of gradualism, of which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has been a faithful adherent since he enunciated it in a speech in 1984. I know that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) will say that having to use the guillotine is all the fault of the Senate and the Macklin amendment, but this recurring bunching of legislation at the end of sitting periods suggests a breakdown in Government management processes. It is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that legislation is processed through the Cabinet procedures and brought into the House to allow proper debate. This, of course, must also mean that sufficient time be given for the Opposition to consider adequately such legislation before it comes up for debate. A lot of the measures being dealt with under the guillotine during the last few weeks of this sitting, as well as previous ones, are contentious and complex. It is therefore essential that a reasonable allotment of time be provided to allow serious scrutiny of this legislation. It is just not good enough for the Government to rush legislation through when this country is having to contend with the most serious economic situation that it has faced in the past 60 years. At this late stage, I appeal to the Government to take Parliament seriously, to reconsider its decision and to abandon the practice that it has adopted during the past few years of curtailing discussion. I appeal to it to allow the chamber more time to discharge its proper legislative functions in the interests of the electorate. The Government is proposing to curtail debate on no fewer than 11 pieces of legislation-the Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1991, the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991, the Migration Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991, the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendmeht Bill 1991, the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1991, the Income Tax (Deferred Interest Securities) (Tax File Number Withholding Tax) Bill 1991-a most important piece of legislation-the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1991, the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991 and, last but not least, the Financial Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. All of those Bills are important pieces of legislation and the Government, by weight of its numbers, in the next few minutes will curtail debate on that legislation and will force it through, a lot of it with only a minimal amount of time available for both scrutiny and debate. Some of the Bills that must pass through this House under guillotine have been introduced into the House of Representatives only today. Many of those pieces of legislation have not yet been scrutinised by the shadow Minister concerned, and they certainly have not been to the shadow Cabinet. The first opportunity that we will have to consider the legislation that I am referring to in the Opposition joint party room will be on Tuesday of next week. The Opposition deplores the action of the Government-repeated session after session-to steamrolliegislation through the Parliament in this way. We oppose the motion. Question resolved in the affirmative. Declaration of Urgency",130

215,Mr HAND,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs) (8.25 p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. I explained in my second reading speech on the Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill the Goverdment's decisions in the Budget context in relation to the assurance of support scheme and the imposition of a health charge. That Bill imposed the liability; however, to give effect to the collection of the charge, changes to the Migration Act 1958 are required. This Bill makes the necessary changes to the Migration Act 1958 in relation to my powers to grant or refuse visas and entry permits in that such grants in the affected classes cannot be made unless the health charge has been paid. The Bill also requires that applicants be notified of the requirement and that their visa or entry permit cannot be granted until the payment is made. The Bill also amends the regulation making power to allow for the remission, refund or waiver of the charge. Regulations will be made providing refunds to those applicants who, after having been granted a visa, do not travel to Australia. As I indicated in introducing the Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill, the health charge will enable the Government to recover an estimated 50 per cent of the average medical, hospital and pharmaceutical costs incurred by persons covered by the assurance and will result in an additional estimated revenue to the Commonwealth of $9.9m in a full financial year. I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Hand, and read a first time. Second Reading",133
216,Mr HAND,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSIDP,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs) (8.27 p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The main purpose of this Bill is to allow for the registration of some people as citizens by descent who formerly were eligible to register but did not do so for a number of reasons. The situation which I seek to remedy arises from amendments in 1984 to the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 which limited the registration of Australian citizenship by descent to persons under 18 years of age as from 22 November 1986. My attention has been drawn to some people who, as children, were included on their parents' Australian passports and were subsequently issued Australian passports in their own right over a period of many years. These people have always assumed that they were Australian citizens and did not register because they were unaware of the fact that they had been required to do so to become Australian citizens. The Stewart Royal Commission Of Inquiry Into Drug Trafficking recommended tightening passport issuing procedures and the Passports Act 1938 was amended in 1984 to provide that Australian passports could be issued only to Australian citizens. To meet that provision all Australian passport applicants have to prove they are Australian citizens. When some former passport holders have applied for Australian passports they have discovered that they are not and never have been Australian citizens and are therefore not eligible for Australian passports. The particular group of people consists of those who were born outside Australia to parents who were Australian citizens and, although eligible to be registered as Australian citizens until 21 November 1986, have not been so registered. Because the people concerned are now over 18 years of age, they are not eligible to be registered as Australian citizens by descent under the current provisions of the Act. Where they are permanent residents of Australia, they can obtain citizenship under the provisions of the Act relating to the grant of citizenship. Most who have come to notice cannot obtain citizenship under these provisions because they do not have permanent residence in Australia and this naturally causes them a great deal of distress and inconvenience. If they are outside Australia, they cannot return unless they meet the criteria of the migration legislation. It was not foreseen in 1984 that there were people in this category and legislative provision was not made then to protect them. This Bill proposes a new section We of the Act which will enable people who are in this situation and have a close association with Australia to apply for registration as Australian citizens by descent, even though they are now over 18 years of age. The Bill requires that, for an applicant in these circumstances to be registered as an Australian citizen, he or she must have at least one natural parent who was an Australian citizen when the applicant was born and who is an Australian citizen when the application is submitted. If that parent is dead when the appJication is submitted, then the parent must have been an Australian citizen at the time of death. The applicant must now be 18 years of age or more and have been born outside Australia. The applicant must also have an acceptable reason for not being registered as an Australian citizen. I believe that in most cases the reasons given will be that the applicant had previously been issued with an Australian passport and has thus reasonably assumed that he or she was an Australian citizen, or the applicant has been enrolled under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 for some years or the applicant was una ware of the registration provisions of the Act. Apart from the 'acceptable reasons' specified in this Bill, other 'acceptable reasons' for failure to register as an Australian citizen may be specified in the regulations. An application will be subject to the normal fee for registration as an Australian citizen by descent and, because of the age of the applicant, subject to a good character requirement. The number of people able to obtain Australian citizenship under this proposed amendment is expected to be small. However the distress and inconvenience caused to those affected people is sufficient to justify this amendment to the Act. Consequential to the major amendment, this Bill proposes an additional amendment to section lOB of the Act. This amendment is necessary to ensure that children of people who obtain Australian citizenship under the major amendment to the Act, as I have outlined above, or under the existing section 11 of the Act, are considered no differently from children of people who obtained citizenship under the current provisions of section lOB or the former section 11 of the Act. The amendment will require that before a person under 18 years of age can acquire Australian citizenship by descent through a parent who also acquired Australian citizenship by descent, that parent must have a close association with Australia as already prescribed in section lOB of the Act. To emphasise that close association, section lOB requires the parent, in these circumstances, to have been lawfully in Australia for at least two years at any time prior to the registration of the person as a citizen by descent. The Bill puts forward two further amendments. The first of these provides for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of a decision to refuse an application for registration as an Australian citizen under the major amendment I have already outlined. The second is to ensure that the current section 11 is consistent in this respect. Finally, there are five other minor amendments which are listed in the schedule to this Bill. These amendments relate to references in the Australian Citizenship Act to the Migration Act 1958. When the Migration Act was amended in 1989 its sections were renumbered. I am taking the opportunity with this Bill to correct those section numbers of the Migration Act which are quoted in the Australian Citizenship Act. I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned. STATES GRANTS (SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Staples, for Mr Dawkins, and read a first time. Second Reading",134
217,Mr STAPLES,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSIDP,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill proposes to amend the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1988 to give effect to decisions on Commonwealth programs for schools in 1992 announced in the 12 March industry statement and in the 1991-92 Budget. It will also provide for supplementation of grants appropriated for schools programs for 1991 and for initial appropriations for schools programs for 1992. The proposed new national element of the country areas program will provide funds for national projects to increase the number of students in country areas completing 12 years of schooling. The proposed new school language and literacy program, announced in the context of the White Paper on the Australian language and literacy policy, will have four elements: - under the priority languages incentive element schools will be eligible for $300 for each year 12 student completing a course in a priority language, up to a maximum of 25 per cent of all year 12 students; - under the community languages element funds will be provided to support the study of community languages at school level; - $1.024m will be available under the literacy and learning national element in 1992 to support national projects aimed at enhancing language, literacy and learning; and - professional development programs related to enhancing literacy and learning at secondary level will be supported under the literacy and learning general element. The existing ethnic schools and literacy and learning programs will be subsumed under this new program from 1992. The Bill also provides additional funds under the award restructuring assistance program to meet the Commonwealth's share of the cost of the introduction of advanced skills teacher positions, and of the increase in the salary benchmark for 4-year trained teachers to $38,000 per year. As announced in the 1991-92 Budget, this Bill also proposes to defer part of total expenditure on government schools under the senior secondary support element of the capital grants program until the 1993 program year. It also provides for stage 1 in the implementation of the phasing out of prospective cost supplementation arrangements for nongovernment schools. By 1995, nongovernment schools will be supplemented retrospectively, in December of each year, as is currently the case for government schools. Recent amendments of the Migration Act 1958 necessitate consequential amendments to the States Grants (Schools Assistance) A.ct 1988 to ensure that refugees remain eligible for the relevant schools programs. The Bill provides for' additional funds for 1991 programs in line with cost supplementation arrangements to bring total funding for 1991 programs to an estimated $2,503m. It appropriates an estimated $2,592m for schools programs for 1992. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Dr Bob Woods) adjourned. BANK INTEGRATION BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Free, and read a first time. Second Reading",135
218,Mr FREE,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSIDP,"Lindsay-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (8.37 p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bank Integration Bill 1991 will facilitate the integration of savings banks and trading banks. Following the liberalisation of banking regulation in the mid-1980s, the differential treatment of savings and trading banks became increasingly unnecessary, and the Government decided to remove the distinction for regulatory purposes between them. The Banking Legislation Amendment Act, which received royal assent on 7 November 1989, included amendments to give effect to the Treasurer's announcement in the 1988 Budget of the removal of the distinction between savings banks and trading banks. The removal of this distinction was aimed at enabling banks within the same group to have better use and allocation of funds, simpler funding and accounting arrangements, and greater flexibility in servicing customers. In the course of preparation of the draft legislation in 1989, it became apparent from discussions with the banking industry that, notwithstanding the fact that the legislation removed l,egislative barriers to the integration of trading banks and savings banks, there remained significant administrative costs and legal difficulties. Given the urgency associated with other provisions of the Amendment Bill, it was considered inappropriate to defer passage of the legislation to incorporate further amendments. Accordingly, the Government indicated in 1989 in the second reading speech to the Amendment Bill that consideration would be given to further legislation to facilitate integration. This Bill serves that purpose by including provisions which facilitate the transfer of the assets and liabilities of each savings bank subsidiary to its trading bank parent. That transfer is, in the main, achieved through the principle of universal succession, but it is assisted by exemptions from most Commonwealth, State and Territory taxes and fees and by providing for tax neutrality under income tax law. The legislation will thus give further encouragement to savings and trading banks to amalgamate, consistent with the legislation passed by the Parliament in 1989, and in doing so will also simplify the prudential supervisory role of the Reserve Bank. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Dr Bob Woods) adjourned. NA BILL (No.3) 1991 Bill presented by Mr Kerin, and read a first time. Second Reading",136
219,Mr KERIN,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I move: That the Bill be now read The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) will give effect to the measures announced by the Government in the industry statement of 12 March 1991, Building a Competitive Australia. The Bill will extend the existing wholesale sales tax exemptions to cover a wider range of business inputs for use by goods producers and certain other categories of persons. Goods producers include those persons carrying on business in the primary production, mining and manufacturing sectors. Other persons that will become entitled to exemptions include research and development entities and cargo handlers at sea and international airports. Exemption will also be available for subcontractors to goods producers or to any of the other eligible persons. These measures demonstrate the Government's commitment to reduce the costs incurred by Australia's goods producing sectors. Goods producers will be able to be more competitive in both domestic and international markets as a result. The cost to revenue is estimated to be $445m in 1992-93, which will be the first full year of operation of the measures. The overall benefit to Australian business, allowing for the flow-on effects of reducing costs earlier in the producalso tion chain, is expected to be over $1 billion in that year. The Bill will extend sales tax exemption to a wider range of goods used in production related activities such as: research and development or engineering and technical design of goods or production processes mine site rehabilitation the transport of goods by rail, pipeline or conveyor between production premises, eligible storage facilities or exempt ports storage, handling or dispatch of finished goods, raw materials, work in progress or business inputs certain ancillary and supporting activities which ensure the efficiency of the production process. :These include: - training production staff - accident prevention a second time - pollution control - lighting or cleaning of production premises - schedulihg or costing of production. This Bill will introduce a new general definition of primary production operations. This will place beyond doubt that exemption will be available for general purpose tools for use mainly in carrying out such operations. Research and Development Entities In addition to goods producers carrying out research and development, this Bill will also apply to certain research and development entities, such as those registered with the Industry Research and Development Board. These entities will be eligible for exemption or refunds of tax which has been paid on equipment or materials used for researching or developing new or improved Australian goods or production processes. This will assist specialist R&D organisations, even where they are not working under contract to goods producers. All of the new exemptions will be subject to a main use test, that is, goods will qualify for exemption where used more than 50 per cent in one, or a combination of, eligible activities. Sea Cargo and International Air Cargo Handlers This Bill will provide new exemptions for goods used by persons operating storage or handling facilities for sea or international cargo. These exemptions will also include ancillary or supporting activities carried out in relation to the cargo handling process. This important new measure will reduce the operating costs of Australia's sea ports and international airports and the benefits will flow on to all goods for export. This will enhance the opportunities for Australia's exporters to be truly competitive in international markets. Subcontractors Subcontractors will now be entitled to exemption for a wider range of equipment or materials used in work carried out for goods producers. It will be a requirement that the goods producers, or other eligible persons, would have been entitled to exemption had they used the equipment in the same circumstances. This recognises that there is now a greater demand by goods producers for specialist contractors to carry out activities that traditionally have been performed by the producers themselves. Removal of Existing Exclusions Under the current sales tax law, certain goods are specifically excluded from the various exemptions applicable to agriculturalists, miners and manufacturers. This Bill will remove many of these restrictions, thereby extending exemption to the following classes of goods when used in qualifying circumstances: lubricants office furniture, equipment and consumables general purpose road vehicles when used exclusively within or between contiguous Use production premises. Transitional Refunds The Bill will allow for special refunds where stock on hand has been purchased inclusive of sales tax after 12 March 1991, and where those goods are used for the first time after the commencement of this Bill, in newly exempted activities. This important transitional provision recognises that goods producers should not be disadvantaged merely because they are holding tax paid stocks of air goods which will be used for the first time in exempt circumstances after the legislation takes effect. Commencement The changes made by this Bill will apply to all taxable dealings that occur on or after the date of royal assent. Financial Impact The net revenue cost of the proposed changes is estimated to be $240m for the 1991-92 part year, and $445m in 1992-93. I present the quite excellent explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Bob Woods) adjourned. NA BILL 1991 [COGNATE BILL: NA BILL (No.2) 1991] Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 August, on motion by Mr Howe: That the Bill be now read a second time.",137
220,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Mr Hollis)Order! I understand it is the wish of the House to have a cognate debate covering the Health Insurance Amendment Bill and the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No.2). There being no objection, I will allow that course to be pursued.",139
221,Dr BOB WOODS,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I rise tonight to address the Health Insurance Amendment Bill and the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No.2), which cover a range of issues, some of which are very important. They relate, for example, to the changes announced in the Budget for co-payments by patients for visits to their local GP. I do need to remind the House about the fracas-I think that is a fair description-that occurred in the Labor Party Caucus when discussion was initiated. As the House will recall, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Affairs (Mr Howe) suggested there might be a co-payment. He suggested a $3.50 copayment was the appropriate level, and that this would be implemented by a series of measures, which I will come to in a second, on every visit to the GP. The only exclusion to that, I understand, would be pensioners and health care card holders. One would think that $3.50 was not an enormous price to pay. I am not a smoker myself, but if I remember rightly it is about the price of a cheap packet of cigarettes. It was not enough, one would think, to actually break the bank of an individual-certainly not enough to deter somebody who was sick from going to the doctor but enough to make sure that there was some price signal. We had some problems with the details of the implementation of the co-payment because the way in which it was done was to reduce the rebate to the doctor by a certain amount and for the doctor to be allowed to extract that amount from the patient; that is, the onus, the blame and the pressure was put upon the GP, not upon either the Government or the patient. The GP was cast in the role of being the evil, iniquitous one who would extract this money, when, of course, the truth was that the Government was about to extract the money. We thought that the method of extraction of the co-payment was entirely inappropriate but, nonetheless, we accepted the principle that the co-payment, a price signal, was an important way of reducing over-servicing and overusage of the system. I think there are very few people in this House now who would argue with the fact that over-servicing and overusage does occur. There might be some discussion about how much was over-servicing from a doctor point of view and how much was overusage from a patient point of view. Nonetheless, there was certainly a degree of overusage of the system and that meant wastage of Medicare funds. It meant that those funds were not available for things not such as replacing hips that need replacing, fixing up cataracts-so people were left blind-or a whole range of other necessary health concerns that would not be addressed because money was wasted in inappropriate servicing of patients. We supported the principle of the $3.50, but what happened to the Caucus was very interesting. There was the most amazing schism and, in the end, the Cabinet and the Minister got rolled-there is no other way of putting it-and some compromise deal was looked at. The result in front of us now is, indeed, that compromised deal. But, of course, as with many compromises, the compromise is worse than the original. The compromise was a $2.50 payment, by virtue of handing back a dollar to the physician by way of a transaction fee, but only when that physician indulged in bulkbilling. I have to say that there are very few sensible people around this country who do not believe that offering a free service allows it to be overused. Indeed, it encourages not only overuse but also overservicing. One of the main problepts with overuse and overservicing is the availability of free services under Medicare. It is very attractive politically, of course, and I think the Labor Caucus realised that. But in terms of what is offered to the patient, the reality is an encouragement to overuse the system. What is offered to the physician is an encouragement to overuse the system without any particular penalty or restrictions from the patient. One would think that the Government's approach would be to say, 'Okay, we will put a price signal in there and, by virtue of doing that, we will reduce the incentive to bulkbilling'. But the compromise that the Government finishes up with is a price signal, but it is one which is structured in such a crazy way that there is an incentive to carryon ing. It defies all sensible logic. I have lost track of the numbers of pieces of correspondence that I have had from people involved in the profession who cannot understand the convoluted logic of introducing a price signal on the one hand but, on the other hand, introducing a price signal which is structured in such a way that it actually encourages physicians to bulkbill. It is absolutely crazy. This is not to mention the craziness of the bottom line. The bottom line is that the Government has lost something like $70m worth of savings from its Budget estimates because of this naive political approach to the question of overusage and overservicing. We were very distressed by the method introduced. It did put the onus upon doctors and, in particular, upon GPs. It has done nothing to address the problems facing specialists or some of the other areas in medicine. .More importantly, in the bottom line, in end summary, we ask what these Budget announcements did. It is not so much what they did, even though they were bad enough; it is actually what they did not do. They did not do anything about attacking waiting lists; they did not do anything at all about improving the efficiency of the system; they did not do a single thing about improving the quality of care; they did not do anything at about improving the balance between the private system and the public system. In the end, they did nothing at all to address the crisis which is facing our health system now; the crisis which even the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Affairs, who has just entered the chamber, has agreed is there. In fact, he said to a number of authorities that the current system, as it stood, was unsustainable. Clearly, we would agree with that. It is unsustainable in its current form. A number of corrections need to be made. We do not believe that these are the right corrections. However, they are better than the current system. So for that reason, in spite of our reservations, we will support the changes to the Medicare rebates which will encourage a co-payment, even though we have major reservations about the end result of what has bulkbill- actually been done here. The other question which arises, of course, relates to the fact that now individuals will face a co-payment every time they go to see their local GP while at present they face no charge at all for going to the local hospital outpatients. A number of them will, of course, trot along to the local casualty department or outpatient department and get what is, at present, a free service in preference to paying $2.50 or $3.50, depending on the billing system of their local GP. One may say that that is fine but the problem is the pressure that that will put upon the public hospital system. It will be even greater than the pressure which is there already. The pressure which is there already is enough to choke the system. So unless we actually do something about that, there is going to be a major exodus from GP surgeries into outpatients and casualty departments. The Victorian Labor Government has the already announced that it will introduce a $5 fee. All the other States are considering their options in relation to what should be done to discourage people from using, what are at present, free services in hospitals. Unless something is done, there will be a major exodus. In the past, we have seen that changing the structure like this, without looking through the consequences, leads to changes all which are detrimental to the public system. For goodness' sake, everybody must realise that the public system at present is so overcrowded and so choked that it cannot cope with any more patients. The Government should be encouraging patients to get off the public system and get into the private system. As honourable members know, the private system, at present, is considerably underused and is, therefore, finding it difficult to run at efficient levels. Around Australia, the average occupancy rate of private hospitals is between 55 and 60 per cent. At that level, it is difficult to run efficiently. At the same time, we have something like 70,000 patients sitting on public hospital elective surgery waiting lists. It is crazy not to shift some of that load from the public system onto the private system. This proposal does nothing to address that problem. It actually worsens the problem. Clearly, the problems facing the State hospitals in regard to the overusage which is going to occur as a result of this co-payment for GP visits will need to be addressed. At the same time, nothing is being done to address the problem of, what are at present, free visits to accidents and emergency units and to outpatients in major hospitals. There are a number of other items that I wish to raise. The Government, for reasons which I must say that I find difficult to understand, has put a guillotine on this Bill. I think there are something like 14 honourable members listed to speak for the Bill. I think it is unlikely that more than two or three will be able to take the opportunity to do so because of the guillotine which finishes at 9.30 p.m. and as I speak it is 35 minutes away. It is really a crazy system for something as important as this. I am sure the Government itself could not disagree that this is an important matter. I think its own deliberations within the Caucus would indicate that that is the case. The fact that the Government had to set up a separate committee to evaluate what was going on with these co-payments is an indication of the difficulties involved, of the inequities which may be involved, and of how important this is to the health system of Australia. Regardless of that, it has put on a guillotine which effectively restricts the consideration of this Bill to something like a total of 45 minutes, that is less than two speakers. It is really somewhat disgraceful for the Government to try to put an important Bill like this through, particularly when the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), a few months ago, indicated that he would no longer use the guillotine if it were at all possible. It is clearly not necessary. It is clearly a manoeuvre which is used by the Government as a simple attempt to try to restrain debate upon some of these issues. It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that one of the constraints which the Government is trying to impose is not so much upon the question of the Government's proposals in terms of the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No.1) or the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No.2), but in terms of the mooted amendments to the Bills from the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) in regard to the funding of abortions in Australia. Let me say very clearly that I believe that the amendments which the honourable member for Macquarie proposes, which will restrict the Medicare funding of abortions in Australia, relate to one of the most important issues facing this country. I speak now entirely on a personal basis. I think it is very appropriate that there are no party positions on these matters. This is very much a matter for conscience voting but the situation is that the honourable member for Macquarie has indicated to all honourable members of this House that he will move amendments which will restrict the availability of Medicare funding for abortion in Australia. Whether it is agreed with or disagreed with, it surely is one of the most important issues facing this country at present and it should be given a hearing. It should be given a division. I am very sad that one of the effects of this guillotine-and those amongst us who are suspicious about the Government's motives would say that it is the main aim of this guillotine-will be to restrict debate upon this most vitally important motion. Let me indicate from a personal point of view that if this amendment from the honourable member for Macquarie is divided on, I will support him from the bottom of my heart. There are a number of other issues in these health insurance amendment Bills which need to be addr-ssed. Let me say, first of all, that amongst these are the question of medical service committees of inquiries. MSCIs are already in existence and, at present, its members have the power, in essence, to say to a physician, or indeed a surgeon, that his rebates were given inappropriately because the services which he billed for were not appropriate or were, in many cases, illegal or unjustifiable. There are a whole range of reasons. But they have the ability, at present, to require that the rebate be repaid. Under this legislation, the MSCIs will be able to actually find that an offence has been committed and that that offence is punishable with a significant penalty. Suddenly, we find that the members of MSCIs are no longer just saying, 'Okay, that rebate was inappropriate. You should not have actually seen that patient'. They are actually finding physicians guilty of an offence. The view of the coalition is, in fact, that if there is a court of this degree with these amounts of powers, able to find its peers guilty of an offence, then its peers-the people who are being judged by these committees-should have access to the normal judicial rights. These people should have available the normal protection mechanisms of the court. They should be able to be assessed by the judicial process, not by a committee of their peers whose experience in these matters, by and large, is very limited. We believe very strongly indeed that the MSCls are an inappropriate body in the first place but, in particular, they are inappropriate in terms of finding their peers guilty of an offence. This is something that we are opposed to and we believe that it should not be allowed to go through. However, because of the guillotine, these matters will be passed through the House tonight against our better judgment. There are a number of other items which we support; for example, the changes relating to disqualified doctors. We believe that it should not be appropriate for a doctor who is disqualified from practising in one State to move to another State and start practising there. We believe that the restrictions which are imposed on doctors in that situation are indeed very appropriate. We believe in a number of other items which have been imposed, including the restriction of Medicare benefits to those who should appropriately receive them. This is related to a particular group of physicians whom I will not delineate because of time constraints. There are other issues which relate to changes which mayor may not have been unintended consequences, such as X-ray facilities available to the patients of physiotherapists and podiatrists. We have major concerns about this. The changes which were introduced by the Government a few months ago had the effect of restricting patients referred by physiotherapists from obtaining an appropriate rebate. Similar restraints apply to patients of podiatrists. However, chiropractors who, to most people, in this regard at least, would be in the same category as physiotherapists and podiatrists, had the ability to obtain appropriate rebates for their patients for radiology referrals. It seems to us that in order for the patient to obtain a full rebate it would be necessary for him to go to a GP and to be referred by the GP to a radiologist for the appropriate Xray of the spine, the foot or whatever the case may be. Of course, the problem with that was that, although it was designed to save money, every time the patient went to see the GP that meant at least another $20 down the drain. In many cases the GP would have to see the patient again to get the X-ray report and to discuss the results of that X-ray, which would mean another $20. In that situation that would be at least $40 down the drain, paid for by the taxpayer-not the Government-via Medicare. Any attempt to save money by this process seemed to us to be inappropriate. I think it is fair to say that there was no suggestion that chiropractors, physiotherapists or podiatrists were in fact in any way rorting the system or that they were referring patients for unnecessary X-rays. That has never been suggested and, indeed, it would not be the case. It meant that physiotherapy and podiatry patients had an extra trip to make to the radiology unit, but that would have occurred anyway. But, on top of that, they had to see their GP, either once or twice, depending on the GP's practice. That was, firstly, inefficient and, secondly, it was in breach of the normal philosophy of allowing patients access to those services in the simplest way possible. In addition, it actually costs the Governmentthe taxpayer-more money. For that reason, after discussions with representatives of the physiotherapy and podiatrist professions, we decided that we would move amendments to the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No.2) to allow the same access to radiology procedures as had been extended to chiropractors. Our intention had been to move amendments and to divide on them, as had been discussed with the Government. We gave the Government appropriate notice of our intention. These amendments will allow the patients of physiotherapists and podiatrists to have appropriate access to radiology procedures. The Government has, apparently"" planned later this evening to introduce the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill which will allow this access to physiotherapists. The arrangement which we have come to with the Government-I am delighted that there is a bipartisan approach on this matteris that we will not move the amendments which we had planned to move to the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No.2) but that the Government will include changes in the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill to allow for the same service provision by physiotherapists. We will move an amendment in the same terms relating to podiatrists so that both of those groups and their patients will have appropriate access. I am delighted to see that bipartisanship has actually prevailed, at least in this case. However, I seek leave to incorporate our proposed amendments into Hansard, even though we will not be moving them. Leave granted. The amendments read as follows(1) Clause 3, pages 1-2, omit the clause, substitute the following clause: Interpretation ""3. Section 3 of the Principal Act is amended: (a) by inserting in subsection (1) the following definitions: '"" physiotherapist"" means a person registered or licensed to practice physiotherapy under a law of a State or Territory that provides for the registration or licensing of physiotherapists; ""podiatrist"" means a person registered or licensed to practice podiatry under a law of a State or Territory that provides for the registration or licensing of podiatrists;'; (b) by omitting from subsection (5) 'in Part I of the general medical services ta1;>le' and substituting 'in the general medlcal services table that is expressed to relate to a professional attendanc- by a medical practitioner (however descnbed), a dental practitioner or a participating optometrist'.

222,Dr BOB WOODS,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I think that these amendments in the physiotherapy and podiatry areas are very sensible indeed. I would like to mention a number of other items but, because of the constraints of time, if I speak for the time allotted I will restrict other honourable members from addressing the House on these matters. However, one item in particular relates to the restructuring of the schedule. This is in part the result of the recommendations of the Auditor-General. While we would not necessarily support the details of some of those restructurings they are, by and large, sensible. We would want to go further. Indeed, when we take over from the Government after the next election, we will institute a major review of the Medicare schedule to include members of the medical profession, the Private Hospitals Association, health funds and other associated professionals so that the Medicare structure is reorganised in such a way that it discourages the sausage machine approach which is so prevalent at present and encourages preventative medicine, long term consultations and looks towards a longer rather than a short term approach in general practice. The quality of general practice has suffered enormously since the introduction of Medicare. There has been an enormous encouragement of the sausage machine approach-quickly turning over as many patients as possible rather than spending time with them inquiring into the problems which they face. I believe that is inappropriate. The next Government will encourage long term, in depth consultations, preventative medicine and the practice of a range of issues in medicine which look to the longer term rather than the quick fix and the fast turnover. I have touched on a number of issues. However, because of time constraints I have not addressed some issues. We will not be moving amendments on the understanding that we will actually address those issues in the Health and Community Services Amendment Bill, which will be introduced later this evening and be debated next week. On that basis, I am - happy to support the thrust of many of the things which the Government is doing, but decry the inadequacy of some of the ways it has tried to achieve them.",144
223,Mrs JAKOBSEN,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I have the dubious honour of having been a member of the Caucus review committee on Medicare. It is in that context that I address the House this evening. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Health Insurance Amendment Bill and its sister Bill, the Health Iilsurance Amendment Bill (No.2), implement the first stages of reform in the Medicare benefits for GP services contained in the recent Budget, as amended by the Caucus and as recommended, in some instances, by the Caucus committee. I thank the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) for listening to members of the Caucus committee and for taking on board some of their recommendations, although obviously not all of them. The objectives of this Bill are to contain health expenditure so as to enable a more efficient use of health resources in this country, to encourage the more appropriate use of medical services through the introduction of a price signal-we may have a slight difference of opinion on that one-to provide improved protection for families and those heavy users of medical services through the family protection provisions, and to provide a clear signal that the Government supports the ongoing role of bulkbilling. . The date of commencement of the reduction in the benefit has had to be changed, because of the reconsideration of some of those aspects, from 1 November 1991 to 1 December 1991. The maximum co-payment has been changed from $3.50 to $2.50, with the level of that co-payment now to be indexed, whereas previously it would have been static at $3.50. There will also be a $1 additional fee paid to doctors who bulkbill a patient who is not a cardholder. I think that these changes are important. The Caucus review committee was trying to make the point to the Government and to the Minister, as were members of the Caucus, that it had a concern that the original proposal did not appear to be showing the Government's preference for and wish to assist and maintain bulkbilling in Australia. I believe-and I am sure the Minister does, too-that bulkbilling is a very efficient form of administration of medical payments. That is why I am very pleased to see some acknowledgment of bulkbilling in the Bill. Furthermore, the Bill assists in the restructuring of general practice in the longer term. That is also a most worthy pursuit by the Minister, and I congratulate him on attempting to do that in the context of the national health review. That is not something that has happened on its own; the Minister instigated the review, and the review has already come down with some excellent discussion papers which will benefit the Parliament and the community. One of the common factors in relation to general practice is that we have acknowledged that there are too many general practitioners in Australia, with a cost system which has no cap on it in terms of fee for service and the Medicare rebate. It is a cost which can continue to expand with no end in sight if we are not sensible about the way that we ration or change the health care system through GPs. It is fair to say that general practitioners also recognise this and that they themselves have no objection to some restructuring in their industry. Of course, there will be differences of opinion as to what types of restructuring should occur, but one of the issues that the Caucus committee raised-and about which the industry and the Minister have concernsis the number of migrant doctors, for instance, who are practising in Australia. That is not to say that they should not be practising but that there may be other ways of using their skills if not in general practice. Neither is it to say, of course, that they are not good doctors or that doctors who are educated in Australia are better trained. It is nothing to do with that; it is to do with the mere fact that anybody who gets a doctor's qualification is able to hang up a shingle and begin to practise in a way that enables him or her to enter the health system and take advantage of the fee for service provisions which enable a rebate to be paid, irrespective of the need for additional doctors. It is also important, although it was not one of the recommendations of the Caucus committee, that card holders continue to be protected by this Bill. There has been some concern in that area, because obviously in many instances card holders are people who are ill, sometimes chronically ill, and who would tend to be overserviced in the most common sense of the word-that is, not in a malicious sense, but simply because they happen to be the people who have the most ills and therefore the people who attend the doctor most often. Under this provision they will continue to be eligible for a rebate of 85 per cent, and that is quite a proper course to take. The last thing that we want to see would be those people being disadvantagedalthough there is the risk of their still receiving a little more solicitous service than they may have received had they been subjected to the same reduction in rebate as other patients. The safety net for a family, now being $246 a year, is a significant improvement on what previously was a similar amount per individual. Everybody in the House would be aware of instances in which a member of a family may have got close to the safety net of $246, or $250, but not quite over the edge, and another member of the same family may have had some chronic illness or health problem and got very close to $200, perhaps, but neither would have qualified for the safety net as the provisions previously stood. As the Minister has pointed out, a situation now prevails in which instead of it being $948 for a family of, say, two parents and two children, it will only be $246 that they have to reach before the safety ne""t applies. That is an important provision. It is one that many Australian families will now be able to benefit from-or, if not benefit from, at least they will have the security of knowing that, within a certain arena of criteria, they cannot be asked to expend more than $246 for their family. Of course, the only areas that qualify are those that fall within the scheduled fee, but that in itself is still a significant improvement on the previous situation. The co-payment of $2.50 is designed to allow for the reduction in rebate to occur, because the reduction in rebate can then be offset by a small charge to the patient, which enables the doctor to stay roughly in the same position in terms of the relative viability or otherwise of his practice, and it cannot be seen to be jeopardising the doctor's position. As I have realised, many doctors in this country partially bulkbill-they do not totally bulkbill and they do not totally not bulkbillso they already have within their surgeries and their office establishments some provision for staff to collect moneys. Whether the moneys are collected in coin or in cheques, or whether the patient pays by 'pay doctor cheque' through the Health Insurance Commission, is irrelevant to the process. Effectively, if a doctor already has some provision for collection within his or her surgery and practice, that doctor should, without too much difficulty, be able to collect additional moneys from patients who will now be subject to that small co-payment-assuming, of course, that the doctor chooses to pass it on to the patient. Another matter that the Minister has been raising for some time now is that there are a number of areas in Australia, and in the metropolitan areas in the main, where there is quite severe competition between GPs and some will choose not to pass on the copayment for fear of actually losing patients. I think that is a fairly justifiable claim, at least in the short term, if not in the long I suspect that in the long term most doctors will utilise the opportunity of actually charging the patient, because it will become accepted practice to do so. I hope, given the Minister's assurances, that we will be able to monitor the way that this provision impacts on the community and that we will be alerted to any areas of significant concern, which of course we trust will not occur. It has been indicated by a number of doctors who have a large bulkbilling patient workload that they have had a concern for some time that many members of their patient group would be prepared to pay something to attend and take advantage of their service but cannot possibly afford the scheduled fee, or above the scheduled fee, as charged by doctors who do not bulkbill frequently. Whilst not an ideal measure, this does provide a way for those doctors to recoup something from their patients, some of whom have actually indicated to doctors that they would not mind paying a small amount but that they are not able to pay, say, the $25 that they might have to pay if they attended a doctor who was not prepared to bulkbill for his or her services. I think the Bill is defensible. It is a Bill which has a lot going for it and it is a very important step in the reform process, albeit, as I say, one that is not totally perfect. We do not always put perfect Bills through, and everything in this life is compromise. I am very pleased to see that the Minister has changed some aspects of the Bill to suit what I believe is the greater purpose of the Bill, and I am particularly pleased to see the copayment being reduced slightly and also bulkbilling doctors being rewarded in what is effectively a recognition of the efficiencies that present themselves through the bulkbilling process. The health system in Australia does have problems, and the Minister has acknowledged that. They are not problems caused by Medicare, but they are problems which are caused, in the main, by the way we use the services and the way that we have structured many of the operations. It has grown like Topsy to a degree, rather than having been something that people would have planned term. had they had the opportunity to do so. This whole planning is now occurring. The national health review being carried out by Jenny Macklin will make a significant contribution to what is a very important debate in the community, irrespective of where people stand on questions concerning the health system. I think this Bill will assist with some of the changes that need to occur within our health system, particularly in the area of general practice. It seems also that the whole proposal for a co-payment has caused a lot of concern in the community, possibly because some people do not understand who it will impact upon. its head. Although there will be people at the margin who are not in receipt of a health card some other form of card, they will not people who are absolutely destitute. But will be a matter of some concern if people with a large family and a fairly low income are not in receipt of a card. Some illness strike their family which means that they have to go to the doctor. I am sure that under circumstances we can anticipate an element of compassion, in the first instance on the of the doctor and, secondly, on the part of system as a whole. Those are the areas that would be interested in hearing about from people who strike that difficulty. I ask the House to accept the Bill in the spirit in which it has been offered-that is, spirit of compromise on the part of the Minister. The legislation will have a lot to with providing a better health system for Australia, and the restructuring of general practice, which is a necessity if we are to continue to have a healthy nation and a healthy health system.",144
224,Mrs SULLIVAN,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT," there is not. Because of the guillotine, I have only eight minutes to speak to the Health Insurance Amendment Bill. This is a very important subject for me and for those whom I represent because the Bill demonstrates a significant change in the philosophy and direction of health funding. There are many things would like to sayan behalf of my constivety tuents, because I have a constituency with very particular health care needs. For examtheir ple, the census statistics show that my electorbecome ate has a greater than national average proportheir tion of its population in both the aged and young categories-and they are the two areas requiring very substantial health care. Both State and Federal Labor governments have addressed the health needs of my the world in such a way that we have very serious shortfalls in health care. I become very angry when I see the impact of both State and Federal government health policies on the people I strive to represent. I have said before in this place, and I am driven to say it again, that the figures do not lie. I wish the Government would get its stereotypes out of Sixty per cent of my electorate lies within or the Gold Coast. I think the biggest disadbe vantage that people who live on the Gold it Coast have is the name of the area. In one sense it conjures up fun and enjoyment-and the Gold Coast is all of those things-but it may also conjures up an image of richness. I would be the first to admit that there is an those amount of conspicuous consumption on the Gold Coast, particularly in riverbank housing. part However, those who come and only take the the river trip do not see the Gold Coast any more I than those who go to Sydney and take the harbour trip see Sydney-they do not see the western suburbs, for example. But the figures do not lie. They show that a the electorate I represent is very low on the scale of household income. For example, the do average household income in my electorate is lower than in the western suburbs of Sydney and some electorates represented by Labor members. Also, because this part of the world chooses, rather overwhelmingly, not to vote Labor, it is assumed that there is wealth-and I mention all of those things to preface what I am about to say. Assumptions are made about affordability without going into the reality. I want to put this fact on the table: all of us either have or have had elderly parents. Some of us have or have had quite I aged parents. We would know from our own personal experience that the older people get, the more concerned they become about health care, and the more defensive they about arrangements they make for health care. For example, it is nothing the short of traumatic for elderly persons with a fair dependence on their doctor to have to change their doctor. Having certainty in dealing with a doctor that they have dealt part of with for years is very important. Amongst the elderly 'in my electorate a number of people of very modest means who do not necessarily qualify for any concessional benefit have taken out, to my great surprise, private hospital insurance. I know the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) genuinely cares about the people he is meant to addresses himself to, and I want him to understand this the way I have understood it from what the members of my electorate have said to me, from the fears they reveal to me, as their member of parliament. They take out private health insurance because they are fearful of the need for hospital treatment-and there is a fairly high probability that they will need treatment in a hospital. They want to have their own doctor and they want to have good care. They make enormous sacrifices to insure themselves for private hospital care. After they put a roof over their head, pay for their food and maybe run a very modest motor vehicle to get to their local bowls club for their entertainment, an enormous amount of the disposable income that is left goes into the health care arena. They have a defensive attitude towards health care. They will not change their doctor because their doctor is forced to change the method of billing. According to the most recent information, from 1 November next year the gap will be $5. These things start to become very significant to people who are substantial users of health care, and who on top of that $5 are paying heavy health insurance. I want to tell the House what the effect locally would be. Our shadow Min-ster, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), pointed out that one of the implications of this change in health funding is that it is highly likely that there will be a in: shift of demand from the general practitioner to the local hospital. I want to give the House an inkling of what that means in my part of the world. The Gold Coast region has 13 per cent of Queensland's population. The last Goss State Budget gave it 4 per cent of total health funding-4 per cent for 13 per cent of the population. That might reveal the dependence that Gold Coast people are forced to have on the private sector. In an effort to keep elderly people out of institutions, a lot of emphasis has been put on domiciliary and home nursing care. The Gold Coast region has 12 per cent of the Australian population which is eligible for HACC assistance. From this Labor Government it receives 611z per cent of the available funding. These problems go on and on. My plea is to the Minister: when he is looking for savings to fund his new cities program or anything else, please, no more burdens according to the stereotypes that have obtained for too long. The Labor Government now after so long in office, too long in office, has convinced itself that there are certain stereotypes of people and of pattern of need, and it will not look to the facts and the realities, the human realities, that lie out there.",147

(15) Title, page 1, insert at the end "", and for related purposes"". The amendments to the Health Insurance Amendment Bill would enact a number of changes which would supplement and modify the package of reforms represented in the Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1991. These reforms are designed to ensure that Medicare remains a sustainable, equitable and efficient universal health insurance system and are the first stage of reforms in general practice funding to assist the medical profession to improve the quality of care it provides. The package of reforms presented in the Bill embodies the most significant changes since the introduction of Medicare, and consequently generated considerable debate within the community. In response to the concerns raised, the Government subjected the reforms to a process of review through a Caucus working party. Some refinements are now proposed to the Bill through these amendments to ensure the ongoing success of Medicare. I acknowledge the work of the committee. The changes came out of a process which, while not entirely to the agreement of every member of the committee, did achieve some significant reforms. The amendments would modify the Health Insurance Amendment Bill to provide that a reduction in the level of Medicare benefits prescribed out of hospital general practice attendances would commence from 1 December; enable doctors to charge non-cardholders up to a maximum of $2.50, not $3.50, for bulk-billed, out of hospital, general practice attendance items from 1 December and provide indexing arrangements for this charge; provide additional protection for concessional beneficiaries in circumstances where they cannot produce their card",148

(2) After clause 4, page 2, insert the following new clause: Medicare benefit not payable in respect services rendered by disqualified practitioners ""4A. Section 19B of the Principal Act is amended: (a) by inserting in subparagraph (2) (a) 124FAA(2)(e) after' 124F(2)(e)'; (b) by inserting in subparagraph (2)(b)(i) "" 124FAA(2)(d)' after', 124F(2)(d)'. Amendment No. 1 replaces the commencement date in subclause 2(2) of the Bill from time. 1 November 1991 to 1 December 1991. This delay is due to the fact that the replacement general medical services table will also include matters contained in the Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1991 which will now not come into effect until 1 December 1991. Amendment No.2 inserts clause 4A into the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991.

Under new arraninclude, gements proposed in clauses 7 and 8 of Bill, a medical practitioner is referred to Medicare Participation Review Committee after the second or subsequent penalty.

The effect of the clause 4A amendment to ensure that the professional service provided by such a practitioner who has been partially or totally disqualified will not attract Medicare benefits, partially or totally. amendment reflects similar provisions tained in the Health Insurance Act 1973 under which the MPRC considers whether a medical practitioner should have no action taken, counselled, be reprimanded or be partially totally disqualified from the Medicare arranbeing gements.

Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Howe) read a third NA (No.2) 1991 Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 October, on motion by Mr Hand: That the Bill be now read a second time.",157
263,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Dundas) (9.43 p.m.)The Migration Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991 introduces amendments aimed at strengthening the effectiveness of Australia's immiborder controls. According to the expby lanatory memorandum, the Bill's amendments first, a definition of the term 'of the fences against the Migration Act' which a includes offences against several sections of the Crimes Act 1914 as related to the MigraThis amendment will ensure that the entry and search powers contained in the Migration Act may be used in relation to offences of is attempting to commit, aiding and abetting, urging or inciting or being an accessory or conspiring to commit an offence against the Migration Act. Prosecutions for these offenThis ces, the commencement of which may be conlimited by the Crimes Act, may be commenced within a five-year time limit specified in the Migration Act. In effect, the purpose of be this is to enable the provisions relating to or aiding and abetting, urging or inciting or an accessory or conspiring to commit an offence against the Migration Act to be dealt with in the same way as they would be under the Crimes Act where they arise under the Migration Act. The second matter is a new division, part 1 to part 2 of the Act, which has been included to permit the obtaining of information and documents about the identity and location of illegal entrants. These provisions also provide for a person to be reimbursed expenses incurred in providing information, documents or copies of documents required. The person may also be provided with a certified copy of any documents which are retained. We are told these powers will enhance the compliance strategy by assisting in the increased location and the reduction in the number of people in Australia illegally. The third part of the Bill includes amendments to sections 23 and 33 which will allow regulations to authorise the Minister to fix a numerical limit on the number of visas or permits of a particular class which may be granted in a particular financial year. The Minister's power will be exercised by a notice published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. The power to set limits on the numbers of visas or permits which may be granted will enable greater control on the delivery of the migration program to ensure the published limits are not exceeded. I understand this is to deal primarily with the new class that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) announced some time ago and about which we have yet had no detailed information-the special assistance category. The special assistance category created places at the expense of refugees and those who formerly may have been able to come under the special humanitarian program, but we are told it is desirable that the number of places under that program in anyone year be able to be limited. The purpose of this provision is to enable the Minister to make such decisions and to publish them in the Gazette. The fourth part deals with the introduction of offences in relation to the arranging of marriages or de facto relationships for the purpose of obtaining a visa or entry permit to remain in Australia. There are also offences relating to a person making an application for an entry permit on the basis of a marital relationship when the applicant does not intend to live with the other party in a permanent marital relationship. In line with this, penalties for arranging such relationships are to be $100,00{) or 10 years imprisonment or both. There is to be a penalty of two years imprisonment for an Australian citizen or permanent resident to nominate another person on the basis of a contrived marital relationship. There are penalties of 12 months imprisonment and $12,000 for the provision to officers of false or misleading statements about marital relationships and the provision of such statements without the person making the statement taking the trouble to ascertain the truth or accuracy of that statement. Finally, the amendments will also ensure that the regulations may provide for certain matters to be specified by the Minister in a notice published in the Gazette. I have to say, in relation to the generality of these provisions and notwithstanding the comments that I understand have been made by members of the Senate in their role as members of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, that the Opposition has no principled objections to these amendments since they address concerns that we have frequently expressed in relation to the administration of the migration program. In fact, to highlight the concern I have expressed over time and continue to express about these matters, I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House deplores the Government's failure, in a timely fashion to: (1) maintain effective control over Australia's borders as evidenced by the existence of some 70,000 to 150,000 illegal entrants currently in Australia; (2) locate and remove illegal entrants from Australia expeditiously; (3) administer effectively areas of the immigration program to eliminate areas where fraud and abuse are evident; and (4) establish a fair and expeditious refugee determination process"". I have to say that the issue of immigration control is fundamental to the integrity of the whole immigration program. One of the fundamental principles of migration policy accepted by the Opposition and accepted by this Government, as I understand it, is that it must be the role of the elected government acting on behalf of and with the support of the whole community to make the final and absolute decisions on who will or will not be granted entry to Australia on a temporary or permanent basis. Regrettably, this principle has been clearly compromised over the past few years. That is still the case. A large number of people have entered Australia with the intention of obtaining permanent residence without going through proper channels. The lack of Government resolve to deal with this issue is the most significant factor in contributing to the growth of illegal entry. With a variety of mixed signals, poorly drafted legislation, the hope in some that may be another amnesty-notwithstanding the clarity of statements by both the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and the Opposition-and the lack of proper employer sanctions, it is little wonder that the flow of illegal entrants into the country still continues apace. All of this has had the effect of undermining public confidence in and acceptance of Australia's immigration program. I mention in passing, as an indication of what the possible outcomes might be, that only today the Government, in the papers published by the Bureau of Immigration Research, has indicated that the number of places granted in Australia-that is, to people who were in Australia as visitors or students or on some other temporary basis-has risen from over 14,000 to over 18,000. We have seen a 28 per cent increase in the number of people successfully applying under the old system for grant of resident status or under the new system, PEPAE. Mr Hand-Some of them are your cases. Some of them are the ones you came knocking on my door to get accepted. Some of them belong to you.",157
264,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It happens to be the case that it has gone from 14,000 to 18,000. Mr Hand-You promoted them. Is that correct?",159
265,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,The Minister is not assisting the debate.,159
266,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"If the Minister thinks I have traipsed to his door with 18,000 special cases, he has a much more active imagination than most. Mr Hand-They know they can come to you and you will come and see me.",159
267,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,I have to sayMr Hand-All legally admitted.,159
268,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Order! The Minister will restrain his enthusiasm. Mr Hand-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Why does the Chair not request the speaker to address the matter before the House, which the speaker has failed to do for about 98 per cent of the time there he has been speaking? I ask the Chair to remind the speaker that he is discussing a certain issue.",159
269,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I clearly moved a second reading amendment about the Government's failure to maintain effective control, to locate and remove illegals, to administer effectively the immigration program and· to establish a fair and expeditious refugee determination process.",159
270,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Order! The honourable member for Dundas might note that the Chair does not need his assistance in determining whether there was a point of order or not. There is no point of order. I again ask the Minister to restrain his enthusiasm, which will facilitate the progress of the debate.",159
271,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I continue in relation to this matter. All of .this has had the effect of undermining public confidence in and acceptance of Australia's immigration program. That is the more serious issue that arises when these difficulties occur. I intend to be positive in this debate, suggesting to the Minister further areas in which he might act. Mr Hand-You haven't been so far.",159
272,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I have been extraordinarily helpful as a member of the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations in prompting the Government as to areas in which it might move in relation to these matters. Some of the legislation arises directly from recommendations that have had that cooperative approach, one that I have always offered. The issue of immigration control has been raised by me, as I have said, on a number occasions. The Government has been less than diligent in addressing these concerns. The amendment brings out very clearly the period. Government's failure to address these questrebling tions in a timely fashion. Even now, when program has been clearly shown to be out control, the deterrent provisions introduced this Bill do not go far enough. There are several aspects to the problem. One is the number of illegal entrants currently in Australia who have not been given sufcarefully ficiently accurate information about the number of illegal entrants. When the Government does adduce information, it gives various estimates and fails to take into count the numbers of people who are already within various processing streams and have validated, in part, their illegality by providing applications for other bases upon which they may be able to stay on in Australia. people ought to be clearly understood to have been those who ought to be included amongst those numbers. When we seek information from the Government as to the numbers of people that it is able to remove from legally Australia, it is very difficult to get an accurate picture as to the numbers of people who added to that number and the numbers of people who have been deleted because they have been forced to leave Australia or they have left voluntarily. We are told that the Department has trebled the number of compliance officers nationally to implement a hardline policy in relation to illegal entrants. The result of all of this activity, according to the Department, is the deportation or voluntary departure of only some 3,500 illegal entrants during the last July to September quarter. Even though we are told that that involves a doubling of the figure for the same time last year, it has not been a trebling of the figure, as the number of additional officers might suggest would be appropriate. It does raise other important issues. When the Department put this information out, it did not make it clear that if we used last year's figures as to the numbers of people who became illegal-those who had been in Australia for 12 months or less; last year the of number was over 40,000-on a quarterly basis it would have been an additional 10,000 who became illegal in the same three month Instead of seeing a benefit from that of compliance officers, it would seem the to me that we are still going backwards in of terms of the numbers of people who are in becoming illegal in Australia. That is a matter of very serious concern to me and the Opposition. Migration selection criteria have been constructed over the years to best meet the social and economic needs of this country. Except for those who are admitted under family reunion or as refugees, the acgeneral principle has been that people are admitted for settlement on the basis that they will not represent an economic burden to Australia through inordinate claims on welfare, health or other resources or who would Such otherwise endanger the community by criminal activities. The tests that are normally carried out when people come from offshore cannot be carried out adequately if people come to Australia and seek to stay on either or otherwise. It constitutes an enormous problem for this country, one that needs are to be dealt with rigorously. When the Government addresses these questions in that either way, it has our support. The presence of such a large number of uninvited quasi-residents does enormous harm to the integrity of the immigration program because it circumvents the provisions of health criteria, criminal checking and the like. Australian people quite justifiably resent the diminution of their decision making power that does occur in such situations. These people have often been called queue jumpers. They are frequently people who would be unlikely to have been selected if they applied offshore. On that basis, one has to recognise that prima facie they are people who would be unacceptable as migrants in those circumstances. The Australian people justifiably resent the burden of cost' that the illegal population places upon them. In answer to a question in the Senate Estimates, the Department revealed that during 1991 compliance officers located 9,253 illegal entrants but it was only able to effect the departure from Australia of 4,862. The remainder exercised their entitlement to apply for grant of residence or refugee status. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), when he was Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, estimated that the cost of locating iIlegals was approximately $9,000 per person in 1988. I do not know whether that figure was accurate. Since the Minister gave it to us, I assume that it was. can only surmise that in 1991 it would be much higher than $9,000 per person. Thus, in the last financial year, it would appear to have cost the Australian taxpayers some $45m to find some illegals only to see them apply to remain in Australia on some other basis. These people are testimony to the way in which lack of control of this program has led to very considerable abuse. They represent a large contingent of uninvited queue jumpers who, under the current arrangements which allow them to claim refugee status in many cases, will soon be able to exercise their rights to sponsor other people here in certain circumstances. One can legitimately ask: has the Government really done as much as it can to reduce the number of illegal entrants to this country? For example, has it examined the possibility of employer sanctions? We know that most of these people ought to be ineligible for benefits under the welfare system. We know that most of them ought not to be eligible for tax file numbers, although we understand that many people who do not have an entitlement do obtain tax file numbers. No real effort seems to have been made to bring that abuse to an end. We know that in the main they have to obtain employment. There are provisions relating to the harbouring of illegals under section 80 of the Migration Act. A person to be found guilty of that has to conceal an illegal entrant or deportee to prevent discovery by an officer. It would appear to me that harbouring would constitute a much more difficult offence to prove if an employer was merely knowingly engaging an illegal entrant as an employee of a firm. The Government shou!d be prepared to take up the same sorts of provisions that have been encouraged in the United States, which we are told go to the very heart of any effort to control illegal immigration. There have been numerous studies there and I can show the Minister some of that research. It shows that, if one is to slow down illegal immigration, one must remove the magnet-the incentive of jobs-that draws most illegal entrants to the United States. Mr Hand-They have not had a roaring I success at stopping illegal immigrants in America.",160
273,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It does not have water borders, which is a significantMr Hand-You know it.",161
274,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"That is right. It does not have water borders, which is one of the reasons why we have been able to contain it much more so than others. It is not necessarily related to diligence of enforcement provisions. Employer sanctions would achieve this by penalising those who knowingly hire people who are illegal. I am surprised that, notwithstanding the Government's protestations, we have not seen any effort to provide sanctions of that sort. As I have said, provision could be made to strengthen the requirement for the Australian Taxation Office to sight proof of status before tax file numhers are issued to applicants. No effort has been made in relation to that. Certainly, some provision could be made for the issue of tax file numbers for banking purposes for visitors or temporary entrants, as I understand is the case in the United States, if it is argued that they are needed for some other purpose. This system would serve several purposes. Importantly, it would deter the flow of illegals. It would allow employers to have the confidence that their new employees are properly authorised to work. It would cut down on the number of illegal temporary entrants and visitors not authorised to work but who obtain employment. It would also ensure that employers do not discriminate against foreign looking or foreign sounding people only for fear of sanctions and penalties. These are some of the measures that the Government could usefully pursue and I offer them as positive, helpful and constructive suggestions. This Bill also introduces offences relating to sham marriages and de facto relationships for the purposes of obtaining a visa or entry permit to Australia. The number of people making applications for change of status on marriage or de facto grounds has increased rapidly in the past few years and abuse in this area of the immigration program has been unacceptably high. People applying under this category from overseas are admitted through the family reunion program. This category accounted for 44 per cent of migrants in 1989-90 and the same level is planned for 1990-91. The number of people entering Australia as spouses or de factos has increased dramatiCally in recent years, from 9,200 in 1983-84 to 13,300 in 1989-90. Allegations and evidence of fraudulent activities on the part of individuals and migration agents are widespread. In view of this, the maximum penalties attached to offences in this area, which are severe, in my view are not excessive. Of course, it was the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, when it presented its final report on spouse and de facto immigration, which drew attention to these matters. At that time. I expressed my concernMr Hand-You don't come up with every solution. Give a bit of credit to others.",161
275,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I expressed my concern regarding the implementation of proper provisions to allow for victims of domestic violence, and I am pleased to see that a provision has been included which will allow victims of domestic violence to remain in Australia. This was done recently in regulations by the Minister and I commend him for that. Finally, I would like to touch on the refugee determination process. This is a matter of crisis for this country-a matter of very significant proportion. The fact that the Government now admits that there are some 24,000 claimants in the system, and that that number is still growing at 1,000 per month, ought to be of alarm to every Australian. When it is understood that in the past we handled fewer than 500 applicants, the enormity of this problem can be understood. Even with increased funding and extra staff, 13,000 primary decisions will be made, but only 3,632 applications will have been through the review process this year. Since it would be unreasonable· to expect that people who have their applications refused in the first tier of review will not want to press their claims further and apply for a second tier review, I do not see how the backlog can be cleared for many years. Given that the figures from the Government disclose only 15 per cent of the program budget for funds for the final review stage, I cannot see how this will be adequate to deal with the anticipated case load. In my view, the developments in this area are intolerable. Legislation to limit the access to change of status claims by illegals was passed in 1989. The impact of these provisions restricted access to the humanitarian and compassionate classes and thus left claims for refugee status as the only alternative route to residency. That was Ii decision of this Government and it is one of the reasons why the refugee program is now so seriously under threat. The other aspect of it relates to the decisions. I do not blame the Minister for this, but I do blame his Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in relation to the decision on the Chinese students in Australia at the time of Tiananmen Square. The pipeline processingthe Minister will be familiar with the jargonwhereby 25,000 other students from the People's Republic of China were admitted without any bona fides testing after the Tiananmen Square massacre is testimony to the abject failure of his colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), who ought to be held personally accountable for the enormous problem that this country faces in relation to this issue. It is a well-known fact that the majorityabout 17,000-of the 24,000 people claiming refugee status are pe0ple from the People's Republic of China who came after Tiananmen Square through this pipeline processing arrangement. The fact is that this has compromised seriously our ability to provide for protection for the people who have genuine claims and need for protection. I find that an intolerable situation. We have seen the problems that the Department has faced through the impact of judicial law making in allowing quasi-permanent entry to so many people where claims are already suspect. It has served to limit further the potential that this nation has to assist the genuine refugees in some of the most hideous camps offshore. Over the past 18 months over 300 undocumented arrivals in Australia, claiming to be Vietnamese or Khmer, have made claims for protection. Yet in all the time since then we stiIl have no formal outcome in relation to their status. Their detention occurs at considerable expense to the Australian taxpayers. This is also a matter of very considerable concern. What is worrying, of course, is that with this situation in which there is no clear outcome it is hard to believe that others would not contemplate journeys to Australia to try to obtain the same sort of opportunity for themselves. Failure to act with courage and resolve to remove illegal entrants after proper and prompt consideration of claims for protection only serves to generate a further insurmountable backlog of claims and sends a clear signal to the international community that we cannot control our borders. Mr Hand-It is grossly unfair, and you know it.",162
276,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It is not unfair. It is the clear situation as a result of this problem. I do not blame the Minister personally for it but I do blame his colleagues who have forced decisions which have allowed this to occur. It is clearly a matter for which the Government is accountable. I do not know why the Government is not giving the Minister the sorts of resources necessary to ensure that this matter is put beyond doubt; I do not know why that does not happen. I do not know why the Minister has to make a number of decisions of a very unpalatable kind, I imagine, to him in relation to those who are seeking to come here as migrants, through cost recovery, through bond arrangements, and other charges that have to be made. But the fact is that the Government is not providing the resources to enable the task of dealing with this hideous backlog to be dealt with. The fact is that, until sufficient funds and resources are provided for that task to be undertaken or are otherwise found within the priorities of the Minister's Department, there is a distinct possibility that our ability to protect our own borders is at risk. One can only imagine that, with the messages going abroad, in a situation of some difficulty within the region, an onslaught of the sort that Italy recently faced with Albania is not beyond the realms of possibility. I do not want to highlight the sorts of problems within our own region which may occur within the next few years, but they are there. This is a matter which, if it is not handled properly now, has the potential to do this nation enormous harm. I understand the Minister has a number of amendments that he proposes to move at a later date. I have had the opportunity of examining them. As I probably will not have the opportunity of debating them at a later point, I simply say that, as they create offences of the same character for those who are engaged in sham marriages or sham de facto relationships and extend them to those who have been involved in a relationship of emotional interdependency-the category for homosexual relationships in the main, as I understand it-those who might engage in such sham relationships for the purpose of migration entry should be obviously dealt with in the same way. The fact that provisions are included in this legislation which depend upon regulations which create an entitlement to entry as an emotionally interdependent relative is a matter that should not-(Time expired)",163

279,Mrs CROSIO,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise tonight to support the Migration Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991. I completely disagree with what the Opposition is proposing to do in its amendments because this Bill, through its amendments, is aimed at strengthening the effectiveness of Australia's immigration controls and-if the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) would like to read it and understand it-is a part of the continuing examination of our migration legislation under the present Minister, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand). Essentially, this Bill deals with illegal entrants to Australia. The amendments contained in the Bill will provide a power to identify and to locate illegal entrants and create offences relating to arrangement and use of contrived marriages or de facto relationships to gain residential status in Australia. These offences will also extend to the interdependency category to safeguard against the potential of abuse of the system by those under that category. The term 'illegal entrant' is defined by the Migration Act as a non-citizen who has entered Australia illegally or who entered legally but no longer has authority to remain. It also includes those whose stay is irregular, those who have overstayed their immigration leave or those who have secured an extension of stay or residence by deception. This Government, I am very proud to say, is not prepared to allow illegal entrants to underBill, mine the integrity of the migration program or to allow them to have access to benefits and services to which they have no entitborder lement. The vigorous strategy of the Department of Immigration in locating, arresting and sending home those people who do not depart Australia when their permits expire has continued unabated as a result legislation introduced by this Government. Even the honourable member for Dundas would have to admit that the Government's hardline policy on illegal immigrants is obviously having a significant impact on numbers of people overstaying their visas, as overall numbers of illegal entrants in Australia are now decreasing. However, other measures, such as those contained in this Bill, are necessary as the Government will not tolerate the persistent presence of the many thousands of illegals still in Australia. The message must continue to be hammered home that Australia is not a happy-go-lucky haven for people who thumb their noses at our immigration laws, but is a country where those laws are rigorously applied. The estimated number of'overstayers' at 30 April this year was 78,000, a reduction, I am pleased to say, of some 13 per cent from the figure of 90,000 some 12 months earlier. This result has been achieved in the face of a 10 per cent increase in the number of people arriving for temporary stay. In the three years to 1990, four million visitors and 167,000 students arrived in Australia. In 1990,58,000 visitors to Australia overstayed, and 52,000 overstayed in 1991. There was a decrease in the number of students who overstayed illegally from 16,000 in 1990 to 12,000 in 1991, a figure which is particularly significant as, unfortunately, the nationals of some countries still view student visas as a back door to immigration. Clearly, illegal entrants are starting to take notice of this Minister and this Government's continued message to them to pack their bags and to go home. However, further legislation, such as that contained in the Bill before the House, is needed to address those illegals who are more determined to stay in Australia. This by allowing the Minister to obtain information and other relevant records regarding a suspected illegal who has evaded immigration controls, such as ship crew deserters or stowaways, will help the Department of Immigration locate those illegals and provide a more accurate count of their numbers. Legislation which confronts the of issue of illegal entrants is long overdue. The immigration debate is not helped in any way by the continued presence of illegals within the community. This is obvious from an article in the March 1991 issue of the the journal Urban Policy and Research. According to that article, the population of Australia is growing at a faster rate than that of any other country in the developed world. Some of this growth is due to natural increase, but immigration already accounts for more than half. Immigration will make an even larger relative contribution as natural increase slowly declines towards the year 2031. If we continue to add migrants at the present rate we will add an extra 10 million people over the next 40 years, two million from natural increase and eight million from immigration. Although I may not agree entirely with the figures presented in that article, the point is still there that immigration does contribute to our population growth, which is another reason why it is so important that we control the level of illegal immigrants coming to Australia as best we can. That particular journal article went on to say that Sydney was now the destination of some 35 per cent of immigrants into Australia and, combined with geographical constraints on Sydney's expansion, meant that the effects of immigration on the urban infrastructure were being felt acutely in that area. This is an issue which I feel this Government will very soon have to address. The Bill before the House, however, is a finetuning of the migration legislation and is partly in response to the first report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations on illegal entrants in Australia, which was brought down in September 1990. I have read that report. I have also read the alternative report brought down by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). I believe that even he will have to admit that the amendments in this Bill certainly not only cover a lot of that report but also have been led by the investigation of that Committee. The report itself made many recommendations in regard to illegal entrants and clearly stated the Committee's desire for the problem of illegals to be addressed. The report stated: There is a long waiting list of applicants seeking migrant entry to Australia. For each immigrant who secures a visa by fraud or each illegal entrant permitted to remain, other qualified applicants be left behind or left to wait longer for a visa. Illegal immigration severely taxes the resources immigration staff and may undermine the political resolve needed to maintain the integrity of and public support for the immigration program. I am also very pleased to say that the report also went on to sayMr Ruddock-That sounds like my speech.",164
280,Mrs CROSIO,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am sure the honourable member for Dundas is aware of it-that: The control of illegals has taken on a new urgency in recent years because the problem is coupled with, or compounded by, fears of an increased movement of asylum seekers... The presence of illegal entrants has come, whether correctly or not, to symbolise the inability of governments to control their borders and, in Australia's case, to protect the integrity of its immigration program. According to that report, the Department's illegal entrant figures are largely based on information derived from their movement records and details from passenger cards which are filled in by people arriving in and departing from Australia. According to the Committee's report, the estimates of overstaying illegals based on such data must be inaccurate. The report also stated that the estimated number of overstayers must be less than the actual number, because up till 1988, the Department did not count those who overstayed less than six months. It also excluded those people who have lodged applications to extend their stay or changed status whilst still lawfully here but whose permits have expired during processing. However, the Department told that Committee in evidence that the accuracy with which it can calculate the number of overstayers has improved from about 70 per cent accuracy in the mid-1970s to some 90 per cent accuracy now. Nevertheless, the number of illegal immigrants currently in Australia is unacceptable. This Bill carries on from other measures which this Government and this Minister have already introduced in the last few years to help deter illegal entrants. In August 1990, in a bid to reduce the number of illegal entrants in Australia, the number of compliance staff in the Immay migration Department's regional offices was more than trebled to 150. Since then the staff of has worked to a detailed compliance strategy and has been supported by enhanced computer systems. The cost of these additional resources and systems has been offset by a new fee structure for processing certain categories of visa applications. Enhancements to computer systems have provided more timely data to compliance staff. But, more importantly, they have enabled other government agencies, such as the Department of Social Security and Medicare, within the limits of the Privacy Act, to check the residence status of applicants before approving a benefit or service. Such action results in considerable savings to taxpayers through the exclusion of ineligible applicants from receiving benefits and services. It also makes it harder for illegal entrants to support themselves and removes some of the incentives to them to stay in Australia. The additional compliance staff has resulted in giving the Department much more strength to follow up temporary entrants who overstay their temporary entry permits, allows it to follow up people whose applications to remaifl. are rejected and to ensure that they actually leave. It also enables it to apprehend illegal entrants who are working, to deport criminal illegal entrants and to investigate organised immigration rackets, such as contrived marriages and the importation of foreign prostitutes, with a view to prosecuting the organisers and enforcing migration law. Australia has prided itself on its efforts to become a fully multicultural society. Over the past two years, the Hawke Government has introduced the most fundamental changes to immigration policy in 30 years through its commitment to the principle of nondiscrimination on grounds of ethnic background or race. Political commentator Paul Kelly wrote a special feature on immigration in the Australian, and while it was on 28 May 1990 it is still applicable today. He stated in that article: The two great ideas which have dominated Australia's approach to immigration have been the drive to expand the population and the determination to maintain the quality of the immigration intake. Paddy MCGuinness, also in that special feature, wrote: Few, if any other, countries in the world have a good record in the creation of an integrated multicultural society. This is something which should never be forgotten in the course of the debate on immigration policy. Clearly, the Goveniment has been heading in the right direction with its immigration policies, and this Bill is no exception. Our immigration laws are, by necessity, increasingly stringent, and this Bill ensures that tougher procedures are adhered to in order to benefit the Australian community at large. The offences which are created in this Bill largely deal with those entrants who have lied and entered into sham marriages or de facto relationships to obtain permanent residence in Australia, without being true to those relationships. There are many examples of contrived marriages currently occurring in Australia with a view to obtaining permanent residence in this couhtry. I am aware of four such examples which have now been dealt with by our Department, and particularly under our now legal system. The first example I want to mention is that of an Australian female who married an overseas national who was in Australia on a tourist visa. On obtaining permanent residence following the marriage, the male divorced the Australian female and sponsored his original wife for entry into Australia. The Australian female then sponsored another male from overseas. Another example that I have been made aware of is that of an Australian female who sponsored a male from overseas as a de facto spouse so that he could obtain permanent residence. At the same time, however, the female sponsored another male for migrant entrance as her spouse. This woman was prosecuted and fined $1,000 with three years good behaviour. I have also been informed of an agent who recruits females to undergo bogus marriages. The agent backdates marriage documents and conspires with the marriage celebrant to complete documents with false information. The last example I am aware of is that of an Australian male who married a female from the People's Republic of China for payment. This male also recruits others to do likewise such and has gone witness to 15 other marriages, seven of which to date have been confirmed bogus m-rriages. I am certain that there are many thousands more examples, some of which would be much more serious than those that I have just outlined. In evidence to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs indicated that deception after entry into Australia was rife, at least by those who, for immigration purposes, contracted sham marriages or marriages of convenience. According to the report, the Committee received a number of submissions which were concerned with the issue of bogus marriages, some from women who had been taken advantage of by unscrupulous men and whose primary objective was to gain entry to Australia. That report also commented on the fact when it stated: The Committee is adamant that in clear cases where such bogus or sham marriages are detected, the non-Australian partner, who has used the marriage to gain entry to or stay in Australia, should be removed from Australia. I quote again from that report: The Committee heard evidence that some migration agents operate marriage bureaux, which appear to encourage the practice of contracting a marriage for immigration purposes. Certain agents apparently confiscate and hold clients' passports until the owing are paid in full. It appears to the Committee that such unscrupulous migration agents almost certainly encourage applicants to lodge unmeritous applications for change of status and at times may themselves contrive or connive at fraud practised on the Immigration Department. This Bill addresses such problems and tackles them head on. It allows the Department to clamp down on and charge people who are conducting false marriages or de facto relationships to gain residency. All players in the arrangement of a non-genuine marriage or non-genuine de facto relationship for migration purposes will be punishable by 10 years imprisonment, a $100,000 fine or both. Offences have also been created within this Bill for purposely making a false statement in regard to a marriage to gain permanent residence in Australia. International law recognises the sovereign rights of nations to determine who may enter into and remain within their territory. This legislation is important in order to ensure that the effectiveness of Australia's immigration controls is maintained and enhanced so that only those people with a right' to enter and remain in this country may do so. There are many other important facets in this Bill before the House. I know that time will not permit me to go into those. I can only say that again it is part of an extension to the enhancement of our migration regulations and legislation. I support the Bill before the House and I commend it to all honourable members here.",166
281,Mr BRADFORD,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"In the relatively short time that I have been in this place I have come to realise how tenuous democracy is. Tonight, we see a further example of that as this Bill, the Migration Amendment Bill (No.2), is to be guillotined. Yet, for many people, the subject of immigration is a very important one. This particular Bill that we are dealing with tonight is also very important, yet the time allotted for the debate on these issues has been severely restricted by the Government. I regret that. I note that earlier tonight .there was also an example of how tenuous democracy is. It was fees in respect of the Government's blatant failure to accept or even recognise the right of a member of the Opposition to move an amendment. I believe that that is disgraceful and unprecedented. Mr Hand-What about getting on with the Bill?",168
282,Mr BRADFORD,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I will. I am just taking the opportunity to point out to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand)-and I hope that he, as well as his colleagues, get the messages-that he will shortly be on this side of the House and that some of the decisions that he has taken while he has been on the Government side will come back to haunt him. Mr Hand-Never. I will never be on that side. What are you talking about?",168
283,Mr BRADFORD,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Minister will not be because he is not coming back after the election. That is why he is smiling. He knows that if he were coming back after the election, he would be over on this side. Mr Hand-Madam Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. The honourable member for MCPherson has been on his feet for two minutes and he is yet to say one word about the legislation before the House. I think that he ought to be shown the courtesies of the Chair and that you should point out to him that he ought to get on with the business at hand. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-There really is no point of order.",168
284,Mr BRADFORD,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Firstly, I want to refer the Minister to some of the remarks that he made in his second reading speech. I remind him of what he said. He said: Australia must have effective immigration controls to ensure that only those persons who are entitled to enter and remain in Australia do so. We agree with that. He said: The Government will not tolerate the continued presence of illegal entrants in Australia. I think that contrasts rather markedly with the fact that there is, in fact, a very significant continued presence of illegal entrants to Australia. The Government has tolerated them. If one listens to what the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) said, one could almost be convinced because of the way in which she stands up here and makes her points. I think she could probably try to sell ice to Eskimos with a straight face. She has not convinced me by any means. I do not think that she has convinced anyone on this side of the House that the Government has, in fact, done very much at all to address this particular problem of the number of illegal entrants that there have been into Australia hence, of course, the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) and which I have had great pleasure in seconding. The Minister has pointed out in his speech that there are people who will go to extreme lengths to enter or remain in Australia. He has also said that the use of contrived marriages or de facto relationships for obtaining residence in Australia is unacceptable. He said: In conclusion, these amendments that is the amendments that he has moved to the Act and which we are debating tonightdemonstrate the Government's continued vigilance to ensure that the effectiveness of Australia's immigration controls is maintained and, where necessary, enhanced so that only those persons with a right to enter and remain in Australia may do so. I must say that the rhetoric, some of which we agree with, is not matched by the actions of the Minister or his government. If it were so, we would not even be having this debate. These sorts of statements are really motherhood. He is absolutely right in making those statements but,unfortunately, he has failed to deliver. We regret that. The issue of immigration control is certainly fundamental to the integrity of the entire immigration system. Unfortunately, as I said, despite the rhetoric that we hear, the action has been to the contrary. Mr Hand-You have just actually been a party to encouraging people to break the immigration law with the South Africans. You encourage people to by-pass the law. You did, outside this place.",169
285,Mr BRADFORD,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I want to tell the Minister about that. I am glad that he has given me the opportunity to raise that matter. That is one issue that I intend to raise with him during the course of this debate. So if he can settle down and relax for a moment, I will come to that shortly. I need to put in context what I have to say about that issue. Firstly, we need to recognise that there are as many as 150,000 illegal immigrants here-overstayers, illegal entrants or however one would like to describe them. The honourable member for Prospect is shaking her head. I do not know. She should tell me how many there are. She would like to pretend that there is a smaller number. She would like to say that there are 70,000 or something less. There could be 250,000 for all she knows or, in fact, I know. But the point is that there is a very significant number. We are wasting time talking about tens of thousands one way or the other and the fact that they are here. That is the problem. Let us talk about that particular problem. As I have said in debates on this issue on many occasions, these people are here taking jobs from Australians at a time when there is very significant unemployment, particularly unemployment amongst young people. Many of these people who are here illegally and staying illegally are taking jobs from young Australians. That should motivate us to catch these people and throw them out. The other thing, of course, is that these people are not paying taxes. That also is of great concern to me as I am sure it is to the Government. So we are dealing with legislation here which strengthens some of the regulations in respect of immigration border controls. As the honourable member for Dundas said, we have no problem with giving departmental officials greater powers to identify and locate illegal entrants. We support that particular action. I ought to say that I thInk employers have something of a moral obligation, if not a legal one, and a responsibility to ensure that they do not employ people who are not entitled to work. I have made that point here before. In effect, they may inadvertently be aiding and abetting illegal entrants by not doing so. Whilst they are not specifically required to check that people working for them are bona fide citizens or residents, I think that they have an obligation in the present cirumumstance, where we have this unemployment, to do so. As I understand, employers do have a responsibility within the broad context of section 80 of the Act because they would fall into the general category of those who may knowingly harbour an illegal entrant. In fact, there are significant penalties for that. Of course, the difficulty lies in proving that the employer actually knows that the person is an illegal entrant. Whether merely employing and paying an illegal entrant amounts to aiding and abetting under section 80 is probably a matter for conjecture. I want to refer specifically to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), which, as I mentioned, I had the pleasure of seconding. We do not propose to deny the Bill a second reading, but we do deplore the Government's failure in a timely fashion to maintain effective control over Australia's borders, to locate and remove illegal entrants from Australia expeditiously, to administer effectively areas of the immigration program to eliminate areas in which fraud and abuse are evident and, finally, to establish a fair and expeditious refugee determination process. Clearly, because of the extent of this problem, the Government has failed. We deplore its failure; hence the amendment we are moving tonight. I do not think that these amendments are moved lightly. We on this side of the House are condemning the Government and the Minister for their failure to act in a timely fashion to locate and remove illegal entrants from Australia, and to do so expeditiously. The number of illegal entrants who remain in Australia is glaring testimony to the Government's failure in this particular area. That brings me to the point the Minister asked me about a moment ago, and I thank him for doing so. There is an irony here that I must take the opportunity of referring to. I assume that the Minister was talking about the world wave ski titles which were held on the Gold Coast a couple of weeks ago. Let me put it in context. We have a serious problem in the country with illegal immigrants-number unknown, but certainly tens and tens of thousands-taking jobs from Australians and not paying taxes. We ought to be getting out there and catching them and throwing them out. However, what do we have? We have officials of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, in numbers, down at the beach at the Gold Coast disrupting a surfing contest. Mr Hand-Because people were breaking the law.",169
286,Mr BRADFORD,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,I have asked the Minister to demonstrate where they were breaking the law. Mr Hand-You were encouraging them to break the law.,170
287,Mr BRADFORD,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I did not encourage them to break the law. I defended their right to do what they came to Australia to do. The W(lrld wave ski championships on the Gold Coast was a tourist event. It was not the Indy race, which is an event of some magnitude, but a surfing contest that in the overall context of events that happen here was a minor contest. We had a couple of hundred competitors from all over the world. They were from England, Japan, the United States, France and South Africa. A lot of them came here on tourist visas because they came out here for a holiday. Incidental to that holiday, they took part in a surfing contest. Mr Hand-That is a lie. That is not true and you know it.",170
288,Mr BRADFORD,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Tourists come here honourable every day. Is the Minister saying that if tourist comes here, he cannot have a competitive golf? Mr Hand-No, I am referring to your previous sentence, and you know it not to be true.",171
289,Mr BRADFORD,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"No. I have given the titles Minister the opportunity to answer these questions for me. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs demonstrate Sullivan)-Order! There is a certain amount of give and take in this chamber, but I think that the Minister is really being a little over the odds. Mr Hand-But, Madam Deputy Speakersporting Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-I ask the recouped Minister to please not argue with the Chair. Mr Hand-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is very difficult when an honourable member gets up and accuses another member, namely, me, of doing something which is not correct. What he saying is not true. Now, whatMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER-I ask the upgrade their visas? Minister to please resume his seat. There. are other forms of the House to which he have recourse. The honourable member for MCPherson has the call, and he has the right to be heard uninterrupted. I reasonable, but I think the Minister is now behaving unreasonably. I remind the honourable member for MCPherson that I have just tried to quieten down the Minister and I suggest that he not immediately start provoke the Minister.",171
290,Mr BRADFORD,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I must say that you have given me quite a challenge there. I do feel strongly about this and a number of other matters mainly because, as I have said in this place on many occasions, this is a particular problem.",171
291,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,Why don't you go out and get some facts before you do?,171
292,Mr BRADFORD,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for Calwell wants to have a go now. The truth hurts. I have noticed in this place that whenever we get up and speak the truth, members opposite get upset and a annoyed. But let me return to what I see as game of bureaucracy gone mad-a heavy-handed overreaction of the Department. Departmental officers should have been out catching illegal immigrants and throwing them out, but they were down on the beach in numbers disrupting the world wave ski and claiming that the competitors should not be competing on tourist visas. That is specious. That is pedantic. Let the Minister when he answers my questions on notice. Not only were departmental officials doing that, but also they pulled competitors out of the water and copped them for $100 each to change their tourist visas into visas. I suppose that in terms of cost effectiveness they might have at least some of the cost of that little exercise. I await the Minister's answer to that as well. The South African competitors got special treatment. I have asked the Minister to explain why. Even assuming that the action is of the Department was right, why were the South Africans not able to pay $100 to Mr Hand-Because they are not allowed can to compete. Read the regulations.",171
293,Mr BRADFORD,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,They are allowed to compete. They were competing in this country have been quite as individuals. Mr Hand-Read the regulations.,171
294,Mr BRADFORD,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I suppose the Minister will try to tell me that they are not profesto sional sportsmen. Apparently, for some obscure teasons, there is a differentiation between professional and amateur sportsmen. Anyway, the point of this is that while we have a huge problem in the country of illegal entrants and people overstaying, for which we condemn the Government, instead of getting out and catching them the departmental officials are down on the beach in numbers causing Australia great embarrassment at the world wave ski championships. I move on and refer the Minister to another little problem referred to in today's Gold Coast Bulletin. It concerns another aspect of the diligence of the Minister and the Government. The headline reads, 'Yakuza men arrested in Gold Coast swoop'. The infiltration of organised crime into this country has occurred and is occurring. I do not know the extent of it. But there are people coming out here, and these people were caught after they got here. What I want to ask the Minister is how they got here in the first place. The point I am making to the Minister and the point that was made by the ABC's Four Corners program-about which I have asked the Minister questions-is: what is the Government doing to protect the credibility of the many Japanese companies which are operating here legally and in a bona fide manner? We have significant numbers of Japanese people working here and corporations who have invested here and who have no taint of corruption. They deserve to be protected. They have questioned me as to why we are allowing some of their compatriots who are known to have organised crime links to come to this country. I have asked the Minister whether the Australian Federal Police has sufficient resources to properly check these people out before they come here. This is a serious problem. Some people are pragmatic about it and say, 'Look, they have got money to spend. Who cares what they have done in Japan or somewhere else in the world?', but I do not think that is good enough. We should make sure that Australian society is relatively free of corruption. I have in mind the Yakuza and its activities. It is incumbent on the Government, in its policing of the issue of visas and, indeed, in other ways, to make sure that Australian business is not infiltrated by organised crime. While the Minister is being so attentive, I will draw his attention to another relevant case of an illegal immigrant in Australia who is making a meal of it while we sit by and watch. Mrs Bustamante de Brady, a Colombian national, arrived in Australia on a tourist visa in June 1990, almost 18 months ago. She extended her visa a number of times and when the visa finally expired-she did not have a tourist visa any more-it turned out that she applied for permanent residency. I wonder whether that application should ever have been accepted in the first place, but it was. This woman is here with a tourist visa that has been extended a number of times. When that lUns out she applies for permanent residency and the application is accepted. However, she was asked to leave the country by 27 July 1991, after her application had been turned down. What does she do now? She applies for Australian citizenship. This is terrific. She is still here. I do not know how she managed to apply for Australian citizenship because, as I understand it, she had to be here as a permanent resident for two years, but she was here as a tourist. However, she has applied for Australian citizenship. When the Australian citizenship is denied her-and it correctly was-what does she do next? She appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Not only is she still here, but now it is going to take 10 more weeks for this person, who has no status at all, to have her case heard before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. She has been aided and abetted in this case in a number of ways. She is here under false pretences, she has obtained welfare while she has been here in questionable circumstances, and she has even obtained legal aid under false pretences. I refer the Minister to that particular case. (TIme expired)",171
295,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"In relation to the last matter raised by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), it is highly inappropriate to raise individual cases in the Parliament in this way, especially when they are still under consideration. The honourable member's whole contribution was based on gross ignorance. I suggest that before he makes another speech on immigration he should go and study the reports of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations which refer to the issues we are addressing this evening. I am not overly surprised, but I am disappointed to see that the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), has moved an amendment in relation to a whole range of issues. He knows that they are extremely complex issues as he has been involved in the Joint Standing Committee which produces reports on these issues. He also knows that these are very difficult issues to come to grips with; nevertheless, he has attacked the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) and has said that the Minister has not done enough on these matters. Mr Bradford-He hasn't.",172
296,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,Come on! Mr Bradford-You don't want him to. You don't care.,173
297,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I do care. I am the Chairman of the Committee that made the recommendations. What a fool the honourable member is. The fact of the matter is that this Minister has done more than any other Minister to deal with the hard questions of immigration, such as illegal imriligrants, the problem of false marriages as a basis of immigration and refugee determination. If the honourable member for Dundas were a bit more generous he would recognise and acknowledge that. What other Minister has even bothered to try to come to grips with the problem? Mr Ruddock-If you had been here for my speech you would have heard me do so.",173
298,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,Then why has the honourable member moved this amendment? Mr Ruddock-Because it is true.,173
299,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member is attacking the Minister on the amendment. The fact of the matter is that the Minister and the Government have, for the first time, taken up these issues in a serious way. The shadow Minister, who is also the Deputy Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee, makes recommendations in the Committee which are then adopted by the Government as a means of dealing with the problem. Then what happens? After that process he comes in here and says, 'You are not doing enough'. Mr Ruddock-That is right.",173
300,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,What nonsense. The honourable member knows very well that a lot has been done in these areas in very difficult circumstances. Mr Ruddock-That is right. A lot has been done but not enough.,173
301,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The problems are difficult. For example, in the case of marriage and de facto relationships, as the honourable member for Dundas well knows, it is not just a question of getting tough; it is also a question of balancing that toughness with respect for people's fundamental human rights. In this country we respect the right of marriage for genuine marriages. We have to balance that against the cases where the marriages are not genuine, when they are used for fraudulent purposes in order to get around the Immigration Act. If anyone in this chamber thinks that it is a simple question to make that determination, he has not studied the issue. As the report makes clear, it is a very complex question; it involves a complex set of determinations which the immigration officer has to make and there is a procedure for appeal in certain instances. We have tried to balance-as we have throughout-these complex issues concerning illegal immigrants and their rights on the one hand and the rights of the Australian community on the other; people making claims on the basis of change of status for marriage; and the current and very difficult problem concerning the huge blowout in applications for in-country refugee and humanitarian determination. This is the problem we have to address as a Parliament. The report of the Committee on this matter will be presented in a few weeks time. I have appealed to people from all sides of the Parliament to come forward if they have any good ideas or if they know of ways and means of dealing with this very difficult issue, including the honourable member for Dundas, who is the Deputy Chairman. If he has good ideas he should come forward with them, rather than coming into the chamber and saying, amongst other things, that the Government has failed to establish a fair and expeditious refugee determination process. What nonsense. When the problems were identified the Committee moved quickly and made an interim recommendation to the Minister. As a consequence, the Minister made a set of determinations of the Committee's recommendations in relation to the Cambodian boat people and othersMr Ruddock-Is it a crisis or not?",173
302,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Of course there is a crisis; everyone recognises there is a crisis. In fact, the Minister said that there would be a crisis. If the honourable member remembers, some time ago the Minister said that there would be a crisis in this area as a result of what had happened in relation to the Chinese student problem. Mr Ruddock-The Government's decision in relation to that.",174
303,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member has had his go. Why does he not allow me to say a few words without interruption? The fact of the matter is""' Mr Ruddock-I like your contribution when it is interrupted.",174
304,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member may not like my comments, because they effectively deal with the truth of the matter. We will be bringing down further recommendations dealing with the problem of the blow-out in the refugee detennination process. The Department has been given significantly increased resources in order to deal with the problem but, as the honourable member for Dundas knows, we have certain international obligations which are insisted upon by the UNHCR. We are trying to clarify exactly the obligations under the UNHCR with respect to those matters. Do we have to treat even the most frivolous application in exactly the same way, through all of the processes, as we treat the genuine refugee cases? That is one problem. As I mentioned, the honourable member for Dundas has not come forward with any recommendations as to how we can deal with this problem; nor has he been very successful in working out ways in which, if he were the Minister, he would be able to deal with the matter. On the contrary, this is a difficult problem because, on the one hand, it is the requirement of intemationallaw with respect to the UNHCR; on the other hand, it is another matter trying to balance that",174

In the two minutes remaining to me I will try to respond to a number of the claims made earlier in this debate and I will speak to the amendments. The amendments seek to further strengthen the legislation. It is interesting to note when one is confronted by the Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), and his henchmen, in terms of their contributions to this policy area, that they steer a very wide course on the issues before the House. The honourable member's amendment was a clever sleight of hand trick to widen the parameters of the debate. He moved it knowing full well that under the Standing Orders there is a very limited time for me to respond to those claims. But his contribution to the debate was in his normal style of a gentle pat of support and a belt around the ears in the next breath. But most of his attempts at belts around the ears missed the mark, because he is wrong. He makes out that this is a simple area of policy delivery for the Government and the Department. He makes claims in his amendment of 150,000 illegal entrants-based on what, no-one knowswhen clearly the Government has said, from the official records, that 78,000 people are in Australia illegally and we are pursuing them with great vigour, in line with the recommendations of the committee which he is Deputy Chairman of. I repeat what the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) said: I am determined, in a way in which no other Minister has applied himself or herself, to eradicate illegal entrants from this country, and I will continue to be, but r am sometimes confronted with situations such as the one on the Gold Coast, where people, with the support of members of this House, flagrantly breach the regulations and have the gall to come here and say to me, 'You are not doing enough'. They encourage people to breach the regulations, so that is the grossest form of hypocrisy I have ever encountered. It is hypocrisy in the extreme to come in here and whinge, whine and grovel about illegals. My departmental officers pursued the law, and the law will be obeyed in terms of illegals. The officers of the Department defended the law of this Parliament. It is unfair and wrong of honourable members to come into this chamber and, for a cheap political shot, refer to those officers who are acting on the instructions of the Government. For honourable members to come into this place and name individuals and expect me to respond in individual cases is another example of an amazing performance. The honourable member for Dundas knows that under the Privacy Act r cannot respond on that case. I say to Opposition members, some of whom are members of the Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, that I set up the Committee to get a bipartisan approach, to try to get decisions made which we could all agree with.",174

311,Mr SPEAKER,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Minister now, on moving the third reading, can speak on the Bill as it has been amended. So the Minister is speaking to the Bill, as amended. MI' HAND-In the Migration Amendment Bill the Government has attempted to introduce provisions to further lessen the opportunities that people have to thumb their noses at the laws of this land. The shadow spokesman, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), correctly said that he is a member of a committee which has brought forward a series of recommendations to me as the Minister over a period of time. These amendments address some of those recommendations. On reflection the amendments in this case, as in a number of other cases, probably go further than what the Committee was able to achieve. So you will forgive me, Mr Speaker, if I sometimes get stirred up and am prone to interject on people when they suggest that we are not grappling with people trying to rort the system. Rorters are not wanted. I have said that before. People who try to lie to or mislead the Department-and, therefore, this country-about their relationships, as the amendments to the legislation provide for, are not wanted. We have introduced very stiff penalties. This problem of rorting is not unique to Australia. Recently I visited Europe, basically to look at the question of refugees but also at migration legislation as it applies in countries in Europe, given the problems in Europe at the moment. I went to people in England, Germany, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Greece and Italy. The interesting thing in those countries was that they have one thing in common: they admire the migration law of this country. In three examples they have sought a full briefing by our Government on Australia's entry arrangements. These countries do not really have any laws that can be applied, and people wander through that region at will. Mr Staples-They don't have migration.",176
312,Mr HAND,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"They do not have migration? Go over and try to convince those people that they are not having migration now.

314,Mr HOWE,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Batman-Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services) (1l.11 p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to make amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 in relation to pathology services, and stems from the Budget announcements on proposals to restructure the practice of pathology. The Bill amends existing pathology provisions in the Health Insurance Act 1973 to allow for the payment of fees after the Minister has accepted undertakings from approved pathology authorities and practitioners, and has approved premises in principle as accredited pathology laboratories. In order to be eligible to participate in Medicare benefit arrangements for pathology services, practitioners are required to sign an undertaking to the Minister that the practitioner will comply with the requirements of the legislation and certain administrative arrangements. The proprietor of a laboratory must sign an undertaking to become an approved pathology authority and a pathologist must sign an undertaking to become an approved pathology practitioner. This Bill is one of a package of four Bills which will put in place the Government's reforms for the restructuring of the practice of pathology. In addition to this Bill, the major components of the Government's initiatives are inherent in the Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991, and the companion Bills-the Health Insurance (Pathology) (Fees) Bill 1991 and the Health Insurance (Pathology)(Licence Fee) Bill, also to be now read a second time. I commend this Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.  journed. HEALTH INSURANCE (PATHOLOGy) AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1991 Bill presented by Mr Howe, and read a first time. Second Reading",177
315,Mr HOWE,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to make amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 in relation to pathology services. This is one of four Bills to put in place the Government's reforms for the restructuring of the pathology industry that were announced in the Budget. The other three Bills are the Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment Bil11991, the Health Insurance (Pathology) (Fees) Bill 1991 and the Health Insurance (Pathology) (Licence Fee) Bill 1991. The pathology initiatives which I announced in the Budget were in response to two things-first, the National Health Strategy Background Paper No 6 'Directions in Pathology' and second, longer term statistical evidence which has indicated that pathology services have been increasing at a disproportionate rate when compared with other medical services. The package of initiatives has been developed in consultation with representative bodies from the pathology profession. The package includes industry structural reforms, savings measures and schedule fee reforms, which will be the basis for further negotiated restructuring. I have also established the Pathology Advisory Committee to advise me about implementation of ongoing reforms. The Committee membership comprises my Department, the Health Insurance Commission and the pathology profession represented by the Australian Association of Pathology Practices and the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. The key components of the initiative are the introduction of a licensing scheme for pathology specimen collection centres and proposed regulatory amendments to the Pathology Services Table. A single level schedule fee will be introduced, as opposed to the current SP and OF levels. The schedule fee will be set at 70 per cent of the current SP rate for all services except for certain items of cytology and histopathology, and four highvolume tests. New transaction fees, which represent costs other than those directly involved in the test procedure, including the costs associated with transporting of specimens to the laboratory and collecting samples, will be introduced to offset the reduction in the schedule fee. In an attempt to increase their share of pathology service delivery, there are indications that some pathology practices compete with each other by providing significant inducements for treating practitioners to request pathology services from their practice. Some pathologists may place their trained staff within a doctor's surgery, and this action may not only reduce the doctor's ability to choose between pathologists on a service-by-service basis, but may have the undesirable effect of significantly increasing the amount of pathology ordered. From 1 February, in order to be licensed, a collection centre must be an independent facility, owned or leased by an approved pathology authority, which is set up with appropriate equipment and supplies for the collection of pathology specimens. The centre must be staffed by employees of that approved pathology authority and include staff trained in specimen collection procedures. It is generally recognised within the pathology profession that there are too many collection centres in this country, many of which are operating in very close proximity. Often this has the effect of being inefficient and adding unnecessary expense to the provision of pathology services. The number and location of collection centres will be reviewed in cooperation with representatives from the pathology profession, with a view to reducing the number significantly over a twoyear period. The formula for the allocation of licences for permanent collection centres is based on the volume of pathology services, the number of full time equivalent specialist pathologists associated with the practice and the number of treating practitioners who request pathology from that practice. The number of centres operated by some pathology practices will exceed the number which may be granted a licence under the new arrangements. Excess centres may receive temporary licensing and will be phased out over two years. From 1 February 1992, private approved pathology authorities will be required to hold a licence for each of their collection centres, to enable the payment of Medicare benefits in respect of pathology services rendered at those centres. The licence fee has been set at $1,000. Recently established pathology practices will be eligible to apply for up to three licences, and so new market entrants will be assisted during their first year of operation. In addition, on a proven needs basis, special consideration may be given to granting licences to centres which service rural areas currently. The new transaction fees are intended to cover costs other than the test procedure itself and include indirect operational costs, professional quality assurance, courier and collection costs. The new transaction fees will be applicable on an episodic basis-that is, a claim may be made for the provision of pathology services requested by a practitioner in respect of one individual on the same day. For example, if a practitioner orders four pathology tests for a person on one day, Medicare benefits will be payable for each of those tests but only one transaction fee may be applicable. Taken together with the reduction of the schedule fees for individual services, the introduction of an episodic transaction fee will remove a distortion in the present arrangements which reimburses pathology providers more than once, where multiple tests are ordered on the same specimen, for costs incurred only once in collecting the specimen. The transaction fees are two tiered. A higher transaction fee of $15.50 will be set for specimens collected it). licensed pennanent collection centres, private or recognised hospitals, the patient's residence or in licensed day hospital facilities. The specimen must be collected by an employee of the proprietor of the laboratory in which the pathology service will be rendered or an approved pathology practitioner associated with that laboratory. A lower transaction fee of $9.50 will be set for specimens collected in licensed temporary collection centres or the surgery of a treating doctor. Certain histology and cytology items will be subject to a different transaction fee structure. This will give recognition to the greater degree of complexity of specimens taken from hospital in-patients. Hospital in-patients generally require more specialised attention than outpatients, and this is reflected in the rendering of some pathology services as compared with those services perfonned in non-hospital settings. The Bill provides for specific circumstances under which a Medicare benefit for a pathology service will not be payable. A Medicare benefit for a pathology service will not be payable where the pathology specimen is collected in an unlicensed collection centre. Any person who operates an unlicensed centre will be required to take all reasonable steps to inform both the person from whom the specimen is to be taken and the pathologist who may perfonn the pathology service that Medicare benefits will not be payable for the service. A Medicare benefit for a pathology service will not be payable where inappropriate agreement, arrangement or incentive for ordering the service exists between the approved pathology practitioner rendering the service, the treating practitioner requesting the service or a medical entrepreneur. The reform of collection centre arrangements is being undertaken to negate the potential for this nexus. There must be no functional, direct or indirect, pecuniary or other beneficial contractual arrangement or understanding in relation to the ordering of pathology between the approved pathology authority, a pathologist, the treating practitioner, employer or employee of the practitioner, or any other party. The reforms I have outlined are supported by strengthening sections 129AA and 129AAA of the Health Insurance Act 1973. These sections relate to bribery and prohibited practices in relation to the rendering of pathology services. The categories of persons which can commit an offence against these sections has been broadened, and in particular it will include bodies corporate which in some instances have been used to avoid the restrictions placed on individuals. Penalties for breach of the conditions of these sections have also been increased significantly. The crucial role of general medical practitioners in primary health care will continue to be encouraged, as will the collection of patient samples in their s-geries, wherever possible. Bulkbilling arrangements will continue. Patients will not suffer loss of existing entitlements to pathology services. However, the significant reduction in the number of collection centres will encourage general practitioners to collect specimens themselves. The patients should, therefore, be inconvenienced only when their doctor insists on directing them to a collection centre which may be some distance from that referring doctor. I would like to assure honourable members that the importance of appropriate use of pathology in disease prevention and diagnosis is well recognised and supported by the Government. However, inefficiencies in the current arrangements, plus inappropriate use of pathology services, create an unacceptable burden on our health system and the Government's reforms are designed to reduce these inefficiencies and produce a more costeffective industry. The reforms sit squarely with the Medicare objectives of cost containment, equity and universality. The Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991 specifically allows for circumstances in which medicare benefits will not be payable. That is where the pathology specimens are collected in an unl icensed collection centre or where there is an inappropriate arrangement, or inducement offered for the rendering of that service. In addition, this Bill will put in place a licensing scheme for pathology specimen collection centres, and it will also strengthen the provisions for offences relating to bribery and prohibited practices in relation to pathology services. The Bill is complemented by the provisions contained in the Health Insurance (PathoIQgy) Amendment Bill 1991,the Health Insurance (Pathology) (Fees) Bill 1991 and the Health Insurance (Pathology) (Licence Fee) Bill, also to be read a second time tonight.

The Health Insurance (Pathology) (Fees) Bill provides for fees to be payable to the Commonwealth for approved pathology authorities undertakings and approved pathology practitioner undertakings. The Bill also provides for fee for accreditation of pathology laboratories. The fees set in the Bill represent significant increases on the existing fees set in the Health Insurance Act 1973. In order to be eligible to participate in Medicare benefit arrangements for pathology services, practitioners are required to sign an undertaking to the Minister that the practitioner will comply with the requirements of the legislation and certain administrative arrangements. The proprietor of a laboratory must sign an undertaking to become an approved pathology authority and a pathologist must sign an undertaking to become an approved pathology practitioner.

318,Mr HOWE,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Australian Institute of Health Amendment Bill seeks to amend the Australian Institute of Health Act 1987 to enable the Institute to undertake the collection, analysis and pUblication of statistics in the fields of welfare services and housing assistance. This is the first step in a process to develop and strengthen national welfare statistics. The need for national welfare statistics has been recognised for many years. Major reports calling for the development of national welfare statistics have included: in 1975, the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration and the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty; in 1976, the Bailey Task Force on Co-ordination in Welfare and Health; and the 1979 Baume report on evaluation in Australian health and welfare services from the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare. There have been previous attempts to address the concerns. In 1976 the Commonwealth and State governments attempted to improve the situation by establishing WELSTAT with a secretariat maintained by the Commonwealth. The aim was to establish national statistical standards for social welfare data. Intermittent national data was published on adoptions, children in care and emergency relief but data quality problems prevented regular publication. In 1987-88 the Commonwealth contribution to the WELSTAT secretariat ceased. Since then there have been Commonwealth-State discussions on data collections for individual programs and States have continued some development work in the general child welfare area. Considerable work remains to be done. This Government has decided to put in place definite steps to address the problem. The development of a national welfare data role by the Institute is regarded as an essential part of fulfilling the framework for determining roles and responsibilities agreed by the Special Premiers Conference in October 1990. Plans to enhance the Institute's role had their roots in the October 1990 Special Premiers Conference. At that time, heads of government agreed that the collation of nationally consistent data was essential for the framework for rationalising Commonwealth, State and local government roles in policy planning, service delivery and evaluation. Attachment 3 of the Special Premiers Conference communique set out a framework for determining roles and responsibilities in service delivery. It stated that, in determining the allocation of functions to the spheres of government, considerations should include the need for clear and direct accountability to the electorate and client group, and the achievement of effective evaluation and monitoring mechanisms at the least possible administrative cost to government and service providers. \ Following the October Special Premiers Conference, I established a working group chaired by Professor Bettina Cass to advise me on a proposed role for the Australian Institute of Health to encompass the collation of welfare statistics. The working group recommended that the Institute's role should be expanded to encompass data on programs which provide welfare, community services and housing. Health and welfare Ministers, at their meeting on 6 September 1991, agreed to the expanded role and that existing State based data collections of child maltreatment and substitute care be included as a priority area. Housing Ministers have indicated their support of this initiative. Ministers also agreed that a memorandum of understanding would be developed jointly between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories outlining the rights and responsibilities of all parties in relation to the Institute's expanded role. The Australian Institute of Health was set up by an Act of this Parliament in 1987. As a statutory body with its own charter, and with the States represented on its board, the Institute has been recognised as a genuinely national body, rather than an agent of the Commonwealth. It has been active in improving national health statistics, and successful in working constructively and cooperatively with Commonwealth, State and Territory authorities. Achievements of the Institute include the development of a national minimum data set for institutional health care; progress towards a national health labour force data collection covering a number of health professionals; progress towards a national cancer statistics clearing house; inventory of Australian health data collections, and initiating the development of a national health information agreement. With this track record it is a suitable body to undertake the development of national welfare and housing assistance statistics. An enhanced Institute will improve the availability and quality of statistics on welfare services. This information on welfare services and their impact on the Australian population will be available to governments, researchers and the community. Statistics will be gathered from programs whether they are administered solely by my Department, are jointly administered by the Commonwealth and the State and Territory governments, or are solely the responsibility of State and Territory governments. This will cover a wide range of services which are used by the vast majority of Australians at some time in their lives. Child care services, including services related to parental participation in education, training and the labour force, will be included. Services specific to the welfare of children, including child protection and substitute care from the State based welfare data collections, that is, the WELSTAT collections to which I referred earlier, will, subject to State funding, become the Institute's responsibility. Other major areas in which the Institute will produce data are aged care services, services for people with disabilities, and housing assistance. With the increasing ageing of the Australian population over the next three decades, it will be increasingly important for both governments and the community to have access to comprehensive data on aged care services. This will make it possible to monitor the quality and effectiveness of existing services and to plan for the future, to meet the needs of disadvantaged groups and to reduce variations in access to, and quality of, services across the country. The Commonwealth-State disability agreement has set the scene for a fundamental restructuring of the administration of disability services whereby the Commonwealth takes responsibility for employment services and the States take responsibility for accommodation services. The data on disability services which the Institute will collate will enable governments and nongovernment service providers to monitor the progress and effectiveness of that agreement. Improvements in data on housing assistance will be another important feature of this initiative. The term 'housing assistance' includes the Commonwealth-State housing agreement, the supported accommodation assistance program and the crisis accommodation program. In order to be able to respond to the needs of people in situations of housing stress, comprehensive information is required on what services are available and what they provide. As it did in the health field, the Institute will develop its welfare role through a process of active consultation to take place at all levels. Representatives of State and Territory welfare and housing departments will be added to the board of the Institute. States will therefore be integrated into the process of setting objectives and priorities for the collation of welfare data. To provide a framework for this consultative process I have agreed to the establishment of a National Health and Welfare Information Council. The Council's major tasks will be to advise the Institute's board on the development of national health, welfare and housing assistance data and priorities; and the development of the Institute's work program and priorities. This Council will have members from the Commonwealth, representatives of all State and Territory health, welfare and housing authorities, together with input from key organisations in the health, welfare and housing information fields. I expect to see the National Health and Welfare Information Council being pro-active in raising the level of community awareness and understanding of the need for and benefits of national information in the health and welfare areas. The Council will stimulate the development of a national approach to our health and welfare information systems, provide a valuable forum for exchanges of ideas and have a vital input to the Institute's decision making process. I now tum to the Institute's expanded role in relation to that of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The Bureau is responsible for the coordination of all national statistics in Australia. Subject to this overall coordination, the Institute will be responsible for the development, coordination and production of national statistics relating to welfare services and housing assistance. The ABS will retain responsibility for the coordination and production of statistics relating to the general well-being of the Australian population. The Institute will develop, in consultation with the Bureau, statistical standards and classifications relevant to welfare services and housing assistance. In the collection of welfare services and housing assistance data, privacy and confidentiality requirements will be met. The Institute's existing legislation has provisions which provide for the confidentiality of all such records. The amendments in this Bill make no change to these provisions. The legislation provides for the Institute to produce a report every two years providing statistics and related information concerning the provision of welfare services to the Australian people, and an outline of the development of welfare related information by the Institute. The task facing the Institute is challenging. This legislation provides the basis for the Institute's move into the welfare area. The short term aim of establishing national welfare data needs to be carried out in a practical and flexible manner, with an awareness of variations between States. A longer term objective is to develop uniform national data collections. This task will need to be undertaken in a number of stages to make it manageable, but is of major importance if the Institute is to produce data to meet those purposes I have outlined. I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Braithwaite) adjourned. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Staples, and read a first time. Second Reading",181
319,Mr STAPLES,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The major purpose of this Bill is to implement decisions in the area of aged care announced by the Government in the 1991-92 Budget. Accordingly, the Bill proposes a significant amendment to the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 to enable community care packages to be provided to frail older people continuing to reside in their own homes. Honourable members will appreciate that the fundamental objective of the Government's aged care policy is to extend the independence of older people in the community through the provision of care services. All surveys of older people have shown that they prefer to stay at home and receive care, rather than move to a residential facility. The introduction of community aged care services packages is an important step in this process. As was announced in the Budget, rather than having a long term target to provide 60 hostel places per 1,000 people over 70, we will now aim to provide 55 hostel places. As a substitution for the reduction in hostel places, we will introduce community aged care services packages. This means that the packages will replace some of the hostel places which would otherwise have been built. The aim of the community aged care services packages is to allow aged people to receive hostel personal care services in their homes. They will be targeted at people with higher dependency levels or complex care needs who are assessed as being at risk of admission to, or in need of, residential care. The program will provide complete packages of services which are designed to meet each individual's assessed needs and which build upon the recipient's potential for independent living in their own homes and the support they presently receive. The number of packages which will be approved is based on the number of hostel places forgone. The packages will be developed at the rate at which the hostel places would have come on stream. This means that in the initial years the numbers are relatively small but will grow to around a thousand places by year three of the phase-in period. Initial approvals for community aged care services packages will particularly concentrate on those areas of Australia in which it is difficult to build viable hostels due to factors such as the cost of building, the concentration of people in an area who require care or the lack of suitable land. This is true of many rural or remote areas but is also true for some inner city areas. The packages will be funded at a level similar to the care subsidy provided for hostel residents requiring support for personal care. Both community and residential care providers will be eligible to receive funding for providing community aged care services packages. The approved provider will be able to use the existing resources of each area by using its own service base, volunteer services, and through use of other service providers in the area. In this way full use will be made of existing service infrastructure while gaps that exist now will be filled. This should help develop links between residential and community providers. As a consequence of this change in emphasis, the name of the Act will be changed to 'Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act'. Further provisions of this Bill seek to amend this newly titled Act in order to restructure the existing hostel personal care subsidy. As foreshadowed in the Budget, following a review of hostel recurrent funding, the Government has decided to restructure hostel personal care funding. This was seen as necessary to target funding to those residents with high levels of physical frailty and to those suffering from dementia. The restructured personal care subsidy will provide clear incentives for hostels to provide care for more highly dependent and confused people, consistent with the objectives of the aged care strategy. An additional $14.6m will be available in a full year in support of the restructured subsidy arrangements. The existing arrangements provide for only"" one level of personal care subsidy for a wide range of care needs. This is a disincentive for hostels to admit more frail residents. It is essential that hostels be encouraged to expand their role in caring for more highly dependent residents because of the rapid growth of the aged population and because of the more specialised role of nursing homes in caring for those residents who require continuous nursing care and supervision. The new arrangements will provide for three levels of funding for residents requiring personal care: additional support will be available for the top 10 per cent of residents who are very physically frail, including people with dementia; additional funding will be directed to residents with a moderate degree of confusion or dementia; and residents with moderate personal care needs will continue to be supported; the threshold at which a resident can attract the subsidy will be effectively lowered in recognition of the requirement for personal care support services by a greater number of residents. The existing dementia grants program will be phased out over a two-year period and incorporated into recurrent funding. The two higher subsidy levels will be provided to all hostels which provide care to dementia sufferers, as compared with only about 37 per cent of hostels under the dementia grants program. All hostel residents assessed as needing support for dementia will now receive support, compared with the 50 per cent of such residents under current arrangements. Existing recipients of dementia grants will receive transitional assistance during the phase-out of the current funding. The situation facing any hostel at the end of the phase-out period will depend on the care need profile of their residents and the subsidy level they attract for those residents in July 1994. The Bill also contains provisions to amend the existing Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act to enable some control to be exerted over the quality of persons operating hostels approved under that Act. Until now, there has not been an effective measure available to address the problem of unsuitable persons becoming the operators of approved hostels. In 1989, in recognition of the need to create such a control in the nursing home sector, the National Health Act was amended to ensure the suitability of proprietors of nursing homes. The proposed amendments now before the House will create the same control over the quality of persons operating approved hostels. These amendments will make it a condition of a hostel's approval that the person operating, or proposing to operate, a hostel be approved as an approved operator. Where a hostel is in breach of this condition, the Commonwealth will be under no obligation to sustain financial assistance by way of recurrent subsidy. The decision to approve or refuse an applicant, or to revoke the approval of an existing approved operator, will be based on consideration of a person's ability to satisfy certain criteria. Broadly, these criteria will include relevant experience, honesty, efficiency, and history in the aged care industry. A further purpose of this Bill is to make amendments to the National Health Act 1953, the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974 and the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 to revoke approvals to the 17 remaining nursing homes for disabled people and three remaining hostels for disabled people at the time the existing Commonwealth-State disability agreements come into full operation in each State. These amendments are necessary to allow these remaining nursing homes and hostels for disabled people to be included in the transfer of administrative responsibility for all Commonwealth funded disability accommodation services to the States as the Commonwealth State disability agreements entered into between the Commonwealth and all States and Territories on 30 July 1991 come into full operation. The amendments proposed in the Bill relating to the payment of Medicare benefits for R-type or referred diagnostic imaging services are designed to enable the payment of benefits of certain imaging requested by physiotherapists. The services for which physiotherapists are to be formally recognised as requesters are X-rays of spine and pelvic area. This amendment gives physiotherapists the same recognition in the ordering of imaging services as chiropractors. The amendment acknowledges that spinal X-rays are important in determining whether spinal manipulation cari be performed safely. The Bill also contains minor consequential amendments to the Act to allow a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry to examine cases relating to the rendering of excessive pathology services. The National Food Authority Act 1991 was passed by the Parliament in 'June 1991 and was proclaimed to come into effect on 19 August 1991. The Act created the National Food Authority, with responsibility for the development and amendment of food standards. These standards will be adopted by the States and Territories under an agreement signed by heads of government in July 1991 at the Special Premiers Conference. Section 71 of the Act contains provisions aimed at ensuring as smooth a transition as possible from the system which operated under the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) before 19 August to the system now operated by the Authority. The purpose of the proposed amendment to section 71 of the Act is twofold. Firstly, it deals with a problem which has become apparent in the handling of a large group of recommendations made by the NHMRC to the National Food Standards Council on 14 August 1991, but not dealt with by the Council before the Act came into effect on 19 August 1991. The Authority has become aware since the Act commenced that this group of recommendations, representing over SO separate matters, is now disqualified from being included within the Food Standards Code as defined in the Act. Had the Council dealt with the recommendations before 19 August, they would have been eligible for inclusion in the Code. In the absence of this amendment, it would be necessary for the Authority now to consider each of those matters under the procedures laid down in the Act. This would represent a large increase in the Authority's workload, with consequent lengthy delays in finalising many matters which had been virtually completed by the NHMRC. Many of these matters involve changes to food standards requested by the food industry or by consumers. The amendment provides that, where the NHMRC had made a recommendation to the Council but the Council had not made a decision before the commencement of the Act, such recommendations are deemed to have been recommendations made under the Act. This will allow outstanding matters on which the NHMRC had made recommendations to be dealt with as quickly as possible, and will avoid the necessity for the National Food Authority to have to consider each of these matters again under the procedures laid down in the Act. The second purpose achieved by the amendment is to ensure that outstanding proposals can be dealt with in the same way as currently provided for outstanding applications. Applications are requests by outside parties for changes to the Food Standards Code, and are most often made by the food industry. The Act provides that applications which were in existence before the Act commenced are deemed to continue in existence, and imposes a time limit of two years within which the Authority must make a recommendation to the Council on these applications. Proposals, on the other hand, are matters which arise from within the food regulatory system. The intention behind proposals is frequently to rationalise or simplify or clarify provisions in food standards, to remove anomalies apparent to food authorities, or to provide increased protection of food consumers. The Act makes no provision for the continued existence of proposals which were in existence before the Act commenced, and this means that matters which had been almost finalised under the NHMRC system would have to be reintroduced from the beginning of the process laid down in the Act. The amendment not only provides for proposals which were in existence before the commencement of the Act to continue in existence but, more importantly, allows the Authority to deal with them in the same way as it can deal with applications. This means the Authority will be empowered to omit steps in the public process of dealing with a proposal, having regard to the stage which the proposal had reached under the NHMRC system. Thus proposals which had been almost finalised by the NHMRC can be considered by the Authority at an advanced stage rather than having to start from the beginning of the process. The amendment also introduces a time limit of two years within which the Authority must either make a recommendation to the Council on an outstanding proposal or must decide to abandon the proposal. This is the same time limit as currently applies to outstanding applications. The effect of this amendment will be to streamline the handling of matters which were outstanding when the Authority came into existence and to reduce delays in the Authority's consideration of such matters, to the advantage of both the food industry and food consumers. The Government is actively promoting the concept of day surgery. In December 1989 a four level differential benefit was introduced into the health insurance basic table to encourage the growth of day-only procedures. In an effort to ensure that the growth of day surgery did not emanate from treatment that was performed in doctors' rooms, or treatment that was traditionally provided in hospitals as outpatients, my Department produced a type C-exclusion list-professional attention list. This exclusion list-a list of Medicare benefits schedule procedures not normally done in hospital on a day-only basisprevents hospitals and day hospital facilities from receiving an accommodation benefit if a procedure on the list is undertaken on a day-only basis. However, I acknowledge that there will be occasions when an item on the exclusion list could be performed in hospital on a day-only basis. In these circumstances provision exists for certification by the treating medical practitioner stating that his her patient required day admission. This certification procedure currently only applies to public and private hospitals. The amendments I am proposing will enable day hospital facilities access to the same certification mechanism. The Bill proposes amendments to the National Health Act 1953 which will give effect to two of the changes to the nursing and personal care funding arrangements for non-government nursing homes announced in the Budget. One set of amendments will enable a nursing home to delay applying for a new classification for a patient whose previous classification expired during or shortly after return from hospital leave. A new application now will not need to be made until the resident's care needs have been carefully assessed following their return to the nursing home. The new classification will take effect from the date of return to the nursing home, or the date the previous classification expired, whichever is the later. These amendments will remove the present incentive for a nursing home to apply premat-rely and inaccurately for a new classification, in order to avoid funding being reduced to the lowest classification level between the date on which the previous classification expired and the date the new application is determined. Other amendments address nursing homes' concerns about delays in receiving funding for the nursing and personal care of new residents. The amendments provide for a nursing home to receive interim funding for a new patient at the lowest classification level from the date of admission, pending assessment of the resident's ongoing care needs and submission of an application for annual funding based on that assessment. When the application is approved, funding will be adjusted to the appropriate classification level from the date of admission. The Bill also contains a number of additional amendments to the National Health Act in relation to nursing home matters. Following upon the recently completed review of nursing home infrastructure funding, the Government has introduced provisions to or enable additional funding for isolated homes and for homes caring for residents who receive nasa gastric feeding or continuous oxygen. It has also introduced provisions to enable supplementary recurrent funding for proprietors who build new homes without receiving capital grants. The first of these provisions is for isolated nursing homes whose infrastructure costs are substantially higher than those of most other homes because of their isolated location, such as in Alice Springs or Cobar. The proposed principles will enable the Minister to compensate homes according to their remoteness. Subsequent provisions enable provision of additional funding for homes caring for residents who receive nasogastric feeding or continuous . oxygen. This will ensure that residents do not have to pay these costs. People needing these services sometimes stay in a hospital because it provides the services to them at no cost, when in fact hospital care is inappropriate to their needs. The new funding will help prevent this. The provisions will also enable the Minister to approve funding at different levels in accordance with the needs of different residents. The last of this series of provisions will enable supplementary recurrent funding to be provided for some proprietors who build new homes or new premises for existing homes but do not get capital funding. Charitable and benevolent organisations have for many years been eligible for capital grants to assist them to build new nursing homes or rebuild existing homes. These new provisions will assist some of those who have not received such grants. While the great majority of nursing home proprietors are ethical operators who provide good care to their clients, a small number have a record of unsatisfactory practices in the industry. I do not consider that it would be appropriate to encourage these people to remain in the industry by providing them with the additional recurrent funding for new nursing home buildings. The proposed legislation therefore allows me to take into account a proprietor's record in the industry when considering an application for this additional funding. The Bill introduces an offence in the National Health Act for providing false or misleading information in applications to become approved operators of nursing homes. Nursing home approval is conditional on the proprietor being an approved operator. Approval as an approved operator is only granted where a person is considered suitable to be the proprietor of an approved nursing home. It is important, therefore, to ensure the information supplied in support of an application for approved operator status is accurate and truthful. A further amendment increases the various penalties contained in the National Health Act relating to the administration of the Commonwealth's nursing home recurrent funding program. The reason for increasing the penalties is to ensure that they provide both tive deterrents and appropriate sanctions in respect of the matters to which they relate. In view of the time elapsed since they were introduced, they no longer do this. The proposed amendments will reinstate their effectiveness. This Bill also contains provision to correct an unintended effect on the rights of aggrieved applicants to seek review of Pharmacy Restructuring Authority (PRA) recommendations. The amendment will allow aggrieved applicants to seek an Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) review of PRA recommendations relating to the approval of pharmacies, the payment of essential pharmacy allowance and the provision of financial assistance with the amalgamation or closure of pharmacies. The amendment will have retrospective effect and allow all those applicants aggrieved by past recommendations of the PRA to seek review of those recommendations by the AAT.

The credit is offset against earnings which would otherwise reduce pension under the income test. Once the credit is used up, effec- normal income test provisions apply. The earnings limit is to be indexed from the first pension payday in July 1992 so as to maintain the limit in real terms as an incentive for pensioners to take up casual, full time or part time work. The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1991 provided for the implementation of two initiatives relating to rent assistance. When introducing the (No.3) Bill, it was indicated that a further initiative relating to rent assistance would be included in a Bill to be introduced later in the current sittings. Currently, if a beneficiary under 60 years without children is receiving rent assistance and ceases to be entitled to his or her benefit for more than four weeks, he or she has to serve a 26 week waiting period to requalify for rent assistance. The (No.3) Bill provided for this waiting period to be reduced to 18 weeks from 20 March 1992. This Bill provides that from 20 March 1992, for Job Search allowance recipients under 60 years without children, the allowable break in basic entitlement to income support before a person will have to serve another waiting period will be increased from four weeks to six weeks. Similarly, for Newstart allowance recipients under 60 years and without children, the allowable break in basic entitlement to income support will be increased from four weeks to 13 weeks. Where a person ceases to be entitled to benefit for no more than six weeks or 13 weeks as the case may be, he or she will be able to count the number of weeks already served whilst in receipt of benefit towards the 18 week waiting period. The Bill will also effect changes relating to the treatment of compensation payments from 20 March 1992. First, persons receiving certain social security pensions and benefits who are injured while doing part time or low income work and who subsequently receive periodic compensation payments, will have their compensation treated under the normal income test rules. Secondly, sale parent pensions will be included in the group of social security payments subject to direct deduction as a result of the receipt of periodic compensation and a period of non-payment for receipt of lump sum compensation. Where only one member of a couple receives income support, the maximum rate payable to him or her is the same as that for a single person. There is no clear justification for paying a higher basic rate of pension or benefit simply because the person's partner does not receive income support. Accordingly, for claims granted on or after 12 March 1992, the maximum pension or benefit entitlement of a member of a couple living with a partner who is not receiving a social security pension or benefit or similar payment will be the married rate of pension or half married rate of benefit. This limitation will also apply to the rate of pharmaceutical allowance payable to a member of a couple with a non-pensioner or beneficiary partner. These measures will not apply to existing pensioners or beneficiaries as at 11 March 1992. The payment of pharmaceutical allowance was introduced in November 1990 to offset the introduction of a charge for pharmaceutical benefits for persons who had previously received prescriptions free under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. As an interim measure, the Government decided that certain persons were to be eligible for payment of advances of that allowance until 31 December 1991. The Bill will extend the period in which advances of pharmaceutical allowance will be payable until 31 December 1993. The Bill will also remove the special assets test limit that previously operated for the payment of advances together with some modifications to simplify the advance payment scheme. The Social Security Act permits the Secretary to the Department of Social Security to prepay social security benefits if a client's normal payday would fall on a public holiday. A prepayment of social security benefit made to a client who is later found not to have been entitled to the payment will, from 1 December 1991, be a recoverable overpayment under the Act. The Bill will make two beneficial amendments relating to child disability allowance. A person will be able to receive child disability, allowance during periods when caring foi a disabled child who is home - on leave' from an institution, even if the institution continues to receive family allowance for the child. Further, it will now be possible for payment of child disability allowance to be apportioned between two persons in cases where the care of a child is shared. From the day of royal assent, penalties under the Social Security Act relating to fraud will be aligned with those applicable to similar offences under the Crimes Act. This emphasises the seriousness with which the Government views social security fraud. Also from the day of royal assent, any copy of a determination by the Minister approving a scholarship or class of scholarships for the purposes of the Act will be subject to tabling in Parliament. This measure is in response to a concern made by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills when it considered the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act (No.2) 1991. The Act provides for agreements between Australia and foreign countries relating to reciprocity in social security matters. Such agreements are incorporated into the Social Security Act as schedules to bring the agreements into force so that they may modify the Act as appropriate. Agreements were signed with Ireland and Portugal on 8 April 1991 and 30 April 1991 respectively and will be inserted as schedules to the Act. Amendments will also be made to the Act to revive the old reciprocal agreement between the Qnited Kingdom and Australia. The old reciprocal agreement was omitted from the Act on the basis that a new reciprocal agreement had been signed by both countries and was to have been implemented by the beginning of 1991. However, as the United Kingdom has been unable to undertake all steps necessary to enable the new reciprocal agreement to come into effect by that date, the old reciprocal agreement needs to be revived as an interim measure. The Bill provides for some minor technical amendments to be made to the Social Security Act to enhance the efficiency of social security administration. Amendments will be made to the Act to ensure that it accurately reflects-the policy as it stood on 30 June 1991 in its predecessor, the Social Security Act 1947, before the latter's repeal. Amendments will also be made so as to clearly indicate that money which is exempted by the Minister from the operation of the deeming rules will not use up the deemingfree amount, $2,000 per person. Further, the Minister will have a power to nominate the date of effect of his decision to exempt specified money from the deeming rules so that arrears can be paid from that date. The Act will be clarified so that the wind up of a managed investment fund through transfer of assets to another managed investment fund will constitute a realisation for the purposes of income assessment. This rule applies to market-linked investments and accruing return investments. An amendment will be made to the Act to allow a person holding a market linked investment, and the manager of that investment, to request the Secretary to determine the current rate of return on that investment with effect from the date on which the request was received, notwithstanding that the fund manager or investment product has not been specified in a notice in the Australian Government Gazette. Amendments relating to Job Search and N ewstart allowances, the Aboriginal employment incentive scheme, the rates of benefit payable where one member of a couple is in receipt of Abstudy, the indexation of pharmaceutical allowance, the reciprocal social security agreement between Australia and Malta and the rules relating to the portability of wives or widows pension for those women who have more than 10 years of Australian residence will also be made. Finally, a minor amendment will be made to the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 to include the date of birth of a living spouse as one of the details that can be used in - the data-matching process. This will further enhance the effectiveness of that process. The Privacy Commissioner has indicated that he has no objection to the inclusion of this detail. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Braitbwaite) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Staples) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Parliamentary Debate",188
321,Mr ANDREWS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this morning to protest at the shameful performance of the Government in the House today. Wfiat is more appalling about today is tftat it once again reflects the contempt which tflis Government treats the Parliament. In the last two weeks of the autumn sittings, no fewer than 33 Bills were guillotined through the House of Representatives. The guillotine was originally meant to prevent obstruction of legislation by fixing times at which parts of a Bill must be voted on, but wholesale abuse of the guillotine by the present Government has turned it into a surgical instrument for cutting off democratic debate at the neck. In some instances we have seen debate on important legislation limited to just minutes. This Labor Government has guillotined or rushed through more legislation without debate in the period of its eight years of government than was passed in the entire period from 1901 to 1983. What a great record on the part of the Governmentl This afternoon we witnessed another shabby performance by the Government when it was not prepared to debate the questionable performance of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) over his deal with the Solicitor General. One can only say that the performance suggested a lack of wisdom on the part of the Attorney-General and something approaching pure avarice on the part of the Solicitor-General. Tonight we have witnessed another gutless performance by the Government. 1\vo important health insurance Bills were given just 45 2) 1991; minutes debate, yet there were 13 speakers listed to speak on legislation which the Government itself was deeply divided about. I say nothing about the treatment of the amendments that the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) sought to move except that I thought the essence of democracy was that matters of national importance were entitled to be determined by the Parliament. In contrast to the two health Bills, the Government has been extremely generous in relation to the Migration Amendment Bill (No.2), allowing almost 11/2 hours debate. Eight members indicated a desire to speak on the Bill but, in all, only four were allowed to speak. I am tempted to say that today we saw a gutless performance by the Leader of the with House (Mr Beazley), but given his size I suppose that that would be an inappropriate description. It would also be inappropriate because that would be placing blame for this shabby performance, for this shabby treatment the of Parliament, solely in the hands of the Leader of the House when in fact the blame and the guilt lie collectively with all members of this Government. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 12.13 a.m. (Friday) NA The following notices were given:  That this House censures the Attorney-General for failing to account to the Parliament the true nature and the reasons for the Government's financial deal with the Solicitor-General and for the Attorney-General's failure to uphold the letter and spirit of the law. Mr Beazley to move That, in relation to the proceedings on the following Bills, so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the House making one declaration of urgency and moving one motion for the allotment of time in respect of all the Bills: States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991; Corporations (Unlisted Property Trusts) Amendment Bill 1991; Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1991; Australian Institute of Health Amendment Bill 1991; Repatriation Institutions (Staff) Bill 1991; Veterans' Entitlements (Provision of Treatment) Amendment Bi111991; Australian Capital Territory Self-Government Legislation Amendment Bill 1991; Bank Integration Bill 1991; Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1991; Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991; Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991; Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment Bill 1991; Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991; Health Insurance (Pathology)(Fees) Bill 1991; Health Insurance (Pathology)(Licence Fee) Bill 1991; Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1991; Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill 1991; Migration Amendment Bill (No.3) 1991; Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991; Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991; and Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Commonwealth Building Works Question No. 1056 Mr Mack asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 9 September 1991 (1) What was the Commonwealth's expenditure on building works each year between 1987-88 and 1990-91 inclusive and what proportion of those works were put to public tender. (2) Were building works put to tender in accordance with any established Commonwealth guidelines on public tenders; if so, (a) what are the guidelines and (b) when were they introduced. (3) Does the Commonwealth require public tendering processes for Commonwealth building works to be open to public scrutiny; if so, in what respects. (4) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to evidence brought before the NSW Royal Commission into the Building Industry of collusive tenderexpenditure ing by contractors, with the complicity of the Master Builders Association. (5) Has the Minister taken steps to investigate the extent of collusive tendering and consequent cheating of the Commonwealth by building contractors tendering for Commonwealth building works; if so, what steps. (6) If it is established that Commonwealth building contracts have been let under collusive arrangements, will the Minister proceed against those involved in the collusion to recover any sum wrongfully obtained from the Commonwealth. (7) Will the Minister review Commonwealth procedures for the letting of contracts for building works to provide for (a) mandatory public opening of all tenders and public scrutiny of the tendering process and (b) improved safeguards against collusive tendering and other abuses of the public tendering system. Mr BeddallThe Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answers to the honourable member's questions. (1) The term ""Commonwealth Expenditure on building works"" has a wide connotation and may NA have a broad definition which may range from current annual expenditure on Commonwealth Departmental Works projects ranging from thousands through to millions of dollars and to annual outgoings for all Commonwealth Entities including Corporations, eg Telecommunications Corporation, Commissions, eg Overseas Telecommunications Commission, Organisations, eg CSIRO or Agencies, eg Radio Film & Television School. As such, particularly if the wider range of organisations is envisaged, there is no comprehensive financial or statistical record maintainedexcept perhaps through National Accounts maintained by Department of Finance, which would enable the value of such expenditure to be appropriately or quickly gathered. In the financial years 1987 to 1989 the Department of Housing and Construction largely had control of Appropriated Funds for, and therefore had responsibility for, reporting to Parliament the on Capital Building Works for Commonwealth Departments. This organisation has now been amalgamated with other Agencies and reconstituted within the framework of Department of Administrative Services. These expenditures for the years 1987-89 are on record in the Annual Budget Paper No 2. Since 1.7.89 control of Capital Works expenditure under Appropriated Capital Building Works was devolved directly to individual Commonwealth Departments. The Department of Administrative Services operating through the Project Services Division of Australian Construction Services serviced those Commonwealth Departments under agency arrangements but in arranging contracts for such approved works did not have any direct responsibility for the recording of expenditure incurred. It is therefore unable to report on the expenditure involved in the particular periods mentioned. Such expenditures by Commonwealth Departments would be recorded in Parliamentary Papers under individual Departmental Appropriations. Since 1.7.91 Commonwealth Departments are no longer required to engage Project Services and consequently not all such Works would necessarily be actionM through that agency. Again the recording of overall expenditure under the Appropriation for such works for Commonwealth Departments would be under the control of individual Departments and collated by Department of Finance. Financial Year Total value of contracts arranged 1987-88 1988-89 1989-90 1990-91 Notes: includes engineering projects, fitout works and some maintenance works; includes works for GBE's who may have directed ACS as to procurement method to be used; figures are original contract amounts for contracts awarded during that year; only includes works >$20,000 (ie. Public Tender threshold under Finance Regulations). (2) Tenders for works were called in accordance with the following guidelines/procedures. (a) Prior to 1.11.89 (ie. Pre Purchasing Reforms) The Regulations and Guidelines applicable were: Finance Regulations 51, 52 and 52AA ACS Contracts Manual. Basically, under these regulations for all works over $20,000, public tenders were to be called, unless the delegate issued a Certificate of Exemption (to exempt the calling of Public Tenders) (FR52AA). (b) Post 1.11.89 The situation was changed as follows: New Finance Regulation 43 applied (FR51, 52 & 52AA were repealed). New Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines were issued. ACS Contracts Manual applied. The Authorised Officer (procuring supplies) must choose a method of procurement (eg. public or selected tendering) which promotes open and effective competition to the extent practicable. (3) No. Tender invitation and assessment follows the guidelines of Finance Regulations and Government Project Services Division of Australian Construction Services can report on the tendering methods used for works for which it has acted as agent. This gives a measure of the total value of such projects. NA Public Tender value %Public Tender $104,728,000 $ 58,185,000 55% $306,536,000 $112,582,000 36% $224,821,000 $ 42,911,000 20% $123,365,000 $ 4,995,000 5% Purchasing Policy. Australian Construction Services also uses the tendering code developed between the National Building Consultative Council and the National Public Works Conference. Scrutiny of tendering is by the Department of Administrative Services-Review and Audit Branch, and by Australian National Audit Office. (4) Yes. (5) Yes. (i) A senior Department of Administrative Services officer has been seconded to deal with matters arising from the Royal Commission which affect the Commonwealth and to be available as a link to State Governments. (ii) Counsel has been briefed and granted leave to appear and cross examine witnesses on matters affecting the Commonwealth. (iii) Transcripts and exhibits are obtained and examined by Counsel and the Australian Government Solicitor. (iv) Submissions will be made to the Royal Commission on the Collusive Tendering Reference in response to the Issues Paper and Written Submissions prepared by Counsel assisting the Royal Commission. (v) Initiated and promoted coordinated Commonwealth Investigatory procedures. (6) The matters are under investigation by the relevant Commonwealth agencies with the intention of protecting the Commonwealth's interests. (7) (a) The secrecy which has characterised the collusive practices is such that public scrutiny measures suggested in the question would not have prevented the occurrence of the practices nor enabled their detection. The new Commonwealth Purchasing Policy Guidelines require the Commonwealth to obtain best value. Public opening of tenders and posting of tender prices does not facilitate achievement of best value because matters other than lowest price must be taken into account. Consideration must be given to contractor performance, managerial and financial capability, merits of alternative offers etc. Disclosure of the price range seriously disadvantages the Commonwealth's position in negotiations. The current regulations require the posting of both name of the successful tenderer and the accepted price in the Commonwealth Government Gazette on the letting of the contract. The process applies to both open public tendering and select tendering. The tendering and evaluation processes and audit of the process provide the best safeguards. (b) Tenderers for Commonwealth works are now required to complete statutory declarations that they have not been involved in collusive practices. Further measures are under consideration in the light of the Royal Commission proceedings. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport: (Question No. 1077) Mr Mack asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 8 October 1991: (1) Did the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) commission a telephone opinion survey on the proposed third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport from Australian National Opinion Polls (ANOP). (2) Did the FAC issue a media release on 9 September 1991 claiming that 47 per cent of residents surveyed in noise affected areas were in favour of the construction of the third runway. (3) How many Sydney residents did ANOP survey. (4) How many persons were surveyed in each of the suburbs covered by the survey. (5) Which areas and suburbs did ANOP define as being noise affected areas. (6) What proportion of the total area from which responses were drawn by ANOP did the affected areas comprise. (7) What did the ANOP survey cost the FAC. (8) Has the FAC refused to make public the full details of the ANOP survey, including the questions which were asked; if so, will the Minister direct the FAC to make details and questions available to the public. (9) Did the media release referred to in part (2) claim that the survey indicated the major advantage of the runway was the reduction in delays to aircraft and passengers; if so, (a) how did the survey indicate this, (b) on what basis did the FAC make the claim, (c) did any of the respondents to the survey say that the advantage was the reduction in delays to aircraft and passengers; if so, how many, (d) did ANOP suggest this to the persons surveyed; if so, precisely what was said to them and (e) did ANOP obtain its information on this matter from the FAC.  Snelling, General Manager of the FAC, statements that (a) the two north-south runways would be used 98 per cent of the time and (b) there would be no takeoffs to the north of the new runway; if so, does this mean that (i) the proposed third runway would not increase runway capacity significantly bec;:tuse it will not be used as a third runway but as a Survey substitute second runway for the existing east-west runway and (ii) aircraft passenger safety would be seriously compromised because landings or takeoffs would be made on the north-south runways when dangerous cross-winds and other dangerous wind conditions reportedly occur more than two percent of the time.",191
322,Mr BEAZLEY,CONTRACTS AWARDED,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) In January 1990, ANOP Research Services Pty Ltd was commissioned by Kinhill Engineers Pty Ltd on behalf of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) to complete a survey of attitudes to the proposed third runway at Sydney Airport. ANOP was again commissioned by Kinhill on behalf of the FAC to undertake a further survey during March 1991 to assess whether any change had occurred in community attitudes since the first survey in January 1990. (2) Yes (3) The 1990 survey involved 1,000 Sydney residents while the 1991 survey involved 1,200. (4) The numbers of persons surveyed from the local government areas included in the 1991 survey are as follows: Ashfield-14; Auburn-I8; Bankstown-61; Baulkham Hills-43; Botany-IS; Blacktown-78; Burwood-l1; Canterbury-56; Concord-8; Drummoyne- 11; Fairfield-65; Holroyd31; Hornsby-48; Hunters Hill-4; Hurstville-31; Kogarah-24; Kuringai-40; Lane Cove-II; Leichardt-28; Liverpool-37; Manly-13; Marrickville-38; Mosman-1O; North Sydney-19; Parramatta-50; Penrith-56; Randwick-52; Rockdale-40; Ryde-36; South Sydney-34; Strathfield-lO; Sutherland-72; Sydney (inner)-3; Warringah-70; Waverley-23; Willoughby-20; Woollahra-20. (5) The definition of noise affected areas adopted for the 1991 survey covered areas of Sydney defined as at least partially noise affected at the time of the survey, or with a third runway in operation. The local government areas defined as noise affected areas were Botany, Canterbury, Hurstville, Kogarah, Leichardt, Marrickville, Randwick, Rockdale, and South Sydney. (6) The survey was conducted over a representative sample of the population of the greater Sydney metropolitan area. The noise affected areas comprised 9 of the 37 local government areas surveyed, and 26.5 per cent of the sample of 1,200 persons was drawn from these areas. (7) The costs for the surveys were included in the consultant costs for the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the proposed third runway. The 1990 survey cost $40,000 and the March 1991 survey $44,000. (8) No. All essential information concerning the 1991 survey was made public by the FAC in the Supplement to the Draft EIS for the Proposed Third Runway. This document also provided responses to queries raised in public submissions concerning the 1990 ANOP survey. The methodology and results of the 1991 survey are contained in a document titled ""The Attitudes of Sydney Residents to the  full details of the survey, including the questions asked, available to members of the public upon request. (9) Yes (a) All respondents were asked: ""What do you think are the advantages or benefits of a third runway at Sydney Airport?"" If respondents were unsure they were then asked: ""What are the good things about a third runway?"" All respondents were then asked: ""And what are other advantages or benefits of a third runway?"" (b) A summary included in the March 1991 survey indicates that 40 per cent of respondents nominated ""fewer delays"" (aircraft delays, delays generally, passenger delays) as an advantage. This was the most commonly cited advantage. (c) Yes. In \erms of spontaneously nominated advantages of the third runway, 23 per cent of respondents mentioned reduced aircraft delays, while 3 per cent mentioned reduced passenger delays. Overall, 40 per cent of respondents perceived that one of the benefits of the third runway would be fewer delays (aircraft delays, delays generally and passenger delays). (d) No (e) No (10) (a) Yes (b) Yes (i) No. Aircraft operations on a crossed runway layout are more interdependent than operations with a parallel runway configuration. Consequently, the addition of the proposed parallel north-south runway will increase the airport capacity by at least 30 per cent. (ii) No. Based on ten years of observations (1978-1987) of meteorological conditions at Sydney Airport, the EIS has estimated that use of the east-west runway would be required on average for 1.2 per cent of the time. Aircraft movement data for 1987-89 show that 1.6 per cent of movements required the use of the east-west runway when the north-south runway was unavailable due to a crosswind limit of 20 knots used by Air Traffic Control for runway selection. This limit was increased to 25 knots in 1990. Use of the east-west runway due to crosswinds exceeding 25 knots on the north-south runway was required in 1990 for 0.2 per cent of the time. The decision to operate on any particular runway at KSA is ultimately the responsibility of the pilot-in-command based on his or her assessment of operational and safety requirements. Pilots are certified competent to safely operate their aircraft and would be free to elect to operate from the east-west runway where this was a safety or operational requirement. Also, the air traffic management procedures which would be used with the parallel runways as opposed to the present crossing runways would promote more efficient and safer airborne and runway traffic flows, with fewer areas of possible conflict than can occur with traffic flows using intersecting runways. Intergovernmental Committee of the World Decade for Cultural Development (Question No. 1106) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice on 10 October 1991: Further to the answers to questions Nos. 166 (Hansard, 21 December 1990, page 4973), 851 (Hansard, 20 August 1991, page 120); and 979 (Hansard, 8 October 1991, page 1490), is Australia seeking election, at the 26th (1991), Session of General Conference of UNESCO, to the Intergovernmental Committee of the World Decade for Cultural Development; if not (a) did many states in UNESCO's Electoral Group IV (Asia and the Pacific) which are not members of the Committee send observers to the Committee's first and second regular sessions and its first extraordinary session in Paris in September 1988, February 1990 and February 1991, respectively, and (b) will Australia send observers to the third regular session in Paris in 1992.",195
323,Dr BLEWETT,CONTRACTS AWARDED,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Australia is not seeking election to the UNESCO Intergovernmental Committee of the World Decade for Cultural Development; (a), very few States from UNESCO's Electoral Group IV (Asia and the Pacific), which are not members of the Committee, sent observers to the session meetings of the Committee in 1988, 1990 and 1991 - the only exception was Thailand in 1988. (b), It is expected that the Australian National Commission delegthe ation, presently in Paris participating in the UNESCO General Conference (October 15 to November 7), will discuss details relating to the World Decade for Cultural Development projects with other interested delegates representing Electoral Group IV Member States, including the possibility of participating in the Third Session of the Intergovernmental Committee in Paris, in 1992.",197
