1,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Riverina) [2.31] - B y way of personal explanation, and as a matter of privilege, I.desire to refer to a deputation which yesterday waited on the - Prime Minister within the precincts of the chamber.",14
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member may explain any statement of hiswhich has been misinterpreted, or any action which has been misunderstood; but the right to make a personal explanation does not carry with it the right to comment on the statements of others.",14
3,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"I wish to make a personal explanation, and to raise the question of privilege, because my honour has been impugned by men who waited on the Prime Minister yesterday, and made statements which were absolutely without foundation -- a stronger term would apply-concern ing an action taken by me in this Chamber. I refer to the matter to clear myself in the eyeis of honprable members and' of the public. The charge has been made that I have - tried to do something dishonourable and underhand, and I think that under cover of privilege I shall be allowed to make an explanation which will rebut the slanders and scandalous statements made concerning me. They occur in the report of a deputation which waited on the Prime Minister within the precincts of this chamber yesterday, published in both Melbourne morning newspapers.",14
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I ask the honourable member to confine himself to a personal explanation.,14
5,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"It will be necessary for me to read the statement of which I complain. The Argus and Age reports are practically the same. The deputation comprised the Rev. S. P. Carey, Mr W. B. MCCutcheon, the Rev. T. B. S. Woodfull, and the Rev. A. Stewart). It waited upon the Prime Minister in connection with my public action in moving in this House for .the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the circumstances leading to the prohibition, by the Postmaster-General, of the delivery of correspondence to the firm of Freeman and Wallace. The Rev. Mr Carey, in introducing the deputation, said thatThe withholding of letters addressed to any firm was either a monstrous tvranny or an act of accentuated righteousness designed to protect the moral health of the community. I take no particular objection to those words, but I take objection .to what was said by Mr W. B. MCCutcheon, who, I am given to understand-as I think the public should be apprised-is not the Mr. MCCutcheon who is a member of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria. He is a solicitor- I do not know of what standing in the city-license d by the Supreme Court to say in Court what he has no right to say within the precincts of the High Court of Parliament. He stated thatThe Council of Churches was unanimously behind him in the action which had been taken. The prohibition had been issued only after the fullest inquiry and consideration. Every one knows that that is not correctAnd now it was proposed that the unbiased, impartial and public-spirited action of./the Postmaster-General should be reviewed by a select' committee, moved for by one who had brought his personal friendship and masonic influence tobear in favour of an unregistered medical man. That is an absolute untruth. I challenge every member of the House, from Ministers downwards,, to say that I have approached any one, or attempted to introduce Masonry in connection with this matter. The only two Ministers to whom I have spoken about it are those particularly identified with the case-the Prime Minister and the Postmaster-General. I challenge them to say that I have attempted to use Masonic influence, with them, or posed as a personal friend of Mr Freeman. For a pettifogging solicitor to come within the precincts of the House, where we daily, and properly, pray to be guided by the Almighty to do justice to all men, and make a slanderous statement like that, is a thing which I , at least, will not suffer. Who told this gentleman that I had used Masonic influence or personal friendship with Ministers to thwart justice? Who is he that he should make this charge against me? Unfortunately, there is not in existence a Committee by which the matter could be dealt with. Is it to happen within the precincts of this House that persons who are supposed to represent churches-though , to me, it seems an anomaly for a solicitor who is licensed to lie",14
6,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,I regard that as a very improper statement.,15
7,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"-Althoug h the honourable member may explain his position-and following the usual practice I wish to give him the widest opportunity to do so-h e cannot take advantage of the occasion to speak in terms of contempt of some person not a member of the House. I cannot allow him to refer, as he is doing, to a member of a deputation about whose statementjs be complains. He may state his own position, but may not use such language in condemnation of others.",15
8,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,Surely honourable members are entitled to regard their honour.,15
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member is entitled to do that, but he may not impugn the honour of others",15
10,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"I say that this gentleman, and the Rev. Mr Woodfull, who made a similar statement, told the Prime Minister a deliberate lie. I challenge them to prove what they said. If this House is' to be abused under the cloak of holy religion-whic h every one ought to reverefor purposes of this kind, what are we coming to? All I did was done straightforwardly and openly. I asked for an open and just inquiry, so that justice should be meted out ",15
11,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,The statement ferred to is a libel.,15
12,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Yes ; there is no doubt about that. I will say no more about the matter now., but if either Mr W. B . MCCutcheon, who, I understand, is a solicitor, or the Rev. T . B. S. Woodfull, whose name is well known in the community as one associated with strife, have been informed that I have attempted to exert Masonic influence in this House, I should like to know who is their informant. At the present moment I do not even know whether a single member of the Cabinet belongs to the Masonic organization. In any case, I would not introduce such a great and holy principle, as that underlying the Masonic doctrine into the politics of this country. In order that the public may bave the fullest opportunity of investigating the case of Messrs. Freeman and - Wallace, I intend to move that the-whole of the papers relating to it be laid upon the table of the House. I claim that my action has been perfectly open throughout, that I have never attempted to do what was suggested by the deputation to which I have referred, and I aim prepared to stake my life's record against'that of either Mr W. B. MCCutcheon pr the Rev. T . B. S. Woodfull, from the stand-point of honest conduct. I have never attempted to uphold wrong, but before punishing alleged evil-doers my desire has always been to afford them an opportunity of rebutting the charges made against them. Later-^",15
13,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Riverina) [8.32] This afternoon I took exception to certain remarks made by members of a deputation which, yesterday waited on the Prime. Minister. I was not then aware that those responsible for the statements of which I complained had any justification for them, but I have since learned'that they saw a letter written by me to the Prime Minister, and that their slanderous statements concerning my action were based upon it . It is not among the papers which honourable members have had an opportunity to peruse, but I am informed that the Postmaster General allowed Mr MCCutcheon and the Rev. Mr Woodfull to see the file containing it. I shall not deal with this matter at length, nor with any other view than to put myseif right in the eyes of the country.",15
14,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Why not wait until the Prime Minister returns?,15
15,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"It is due to myself re- and to the House that I should take the first opportunity to prove my innocence. Those who are guilty of dishonourable conduct have no right to be members of the House. The statements to which I took objection were these, made by Mr MCCutcheonAnd now it was proposed that the unbiased, impartial and public-spirited action of the Postmaster General should be reviewed by a select committee, moved for by one who had brought his personal friendship and Masonic influence to bear in favor of an unregistered medical man. It was understood that the member in question had. himself chosen the committee, and it was felt in the circumstances that the inquiry would not be satisfactory. Evidence in favor of the prohibition could be discarded, or not called; the public would not be represented, and if the Council of Churches sent a representative it might be told to mind its own business. Any one who would sit on a Commission or Committee and be guilty of conduct of that kind would be a dishonourable man. and unworthy of a seat in this House. The Rev. Mr Woodfull saidIn the circumstances, the use. of personal friendship and Masonic .influence were - degrading"" to Parliament. . Other' firms were doing a similar business, and the - postal prohibition should be-extended to them, for the evidence against ""them .was strong - - Speaking from memory, the prohibition on the delivery of the letters of the firm took effect from the last day of last year, and attention was called to it, in the first place, not by. myself but by others. Having seen the Postmaster-General on the subject, I wrote to the Prime Minister a letter which I shall read, and which I ask the Argus and the Age to publish, because probably thousands .of their readers have already read the. charge of dishonourable conduct founded upon it which has been made against me. I am content to be judged by honourable members and the community in the light of the facts. 1 did not use the influence which I am charged with having used. My letter was as followsDear Mr Deakin, I saw Mr Mauger this afternoon in reference to the prohibition he has caused to be gazetted in reference to the firm of Freeman ancl Wallace Medical Institute, and requested him to grant Mr Freeman's request for an inquiry, when he would be enabled lo disprove the charges that have been brought against the firm. This Mr Mauger declines to do. I understand from Mr Mauger that this action has been taken at the instigation of the State authorities. If this firm has done wrong and the State authorities were aware of it, why did they not take action. Mr Freeman courts an inquiry, and I see no just reason why that should be denied him. It is a common act of justice that all accused persons should be heard in defence, and the fullest inquiries made into the charges before punishment is infiiGted. I have known Mr Freeman personally for many years in Sydney, where he is held in high repute. I have associated with him in Masonic circles, where he is also held in high repute, and in which he holds some high positions, ancl I am loth to believe without clear evidence to the contrary that he would associate himself with any shady or dishonest ""transaction. There is some strong feeling in Sydney about the matters, ancl I have received communications from there to that effect. The holding of. an inquiry would' elicit the real truth, and to show that Mr Freeman has nothing to fear he courts it, ancl I sincerely trust you will be able to persuade Mr Mauger to sanction it. I feel some diffidence in writing you as I do not want you to feel that I am complaining to you of a colleague's action in any unfriendly manner. I have a sincere feeling of friendship for Mr Mauger. My sole reason for writing is that you might communicate with him on the subject. What possible reason can there be for refusing an inquiry; it would cause no reflection upon the Minister or Department, and would be considered a mere act of justice to an. accused person by the public, who know nothing of the facts. I , therefore, trust it will still be granted, and if any wrong is proved I shall offer no further objection, as I do not desire to shield the guilty, but to give an accused person a fair chance to prove his innocence.",15
16,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member did refer to his Masonic connection.,16
17,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Masoni c influence was not brought to bear on the members of this Chamber.,16
18,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Masoni c influence was not brought to bear on any member of the Chamber. I do not know whether any honourable member does or does not belong to the Masonic fraternity; I am ignorant whether the Prime Minister is or is not a Mason. I merely mentioned the fact that I had met Mr Freeman in Masonic circles, though I had never been in a lodge with him.",16
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I ask the honourable Parliament House, member not to. debate the matter. Melbourne, 8-1-08. Mr CHANTER - I shall not do so; but I ask the House to say whether 'the letter shows that any attempt was made to use Masonic influence.",16
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not think so; but still the reference was an unfortunate one.,16
21,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,If I am referring to an individual and desire to show that he is a person of repute,16
22,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is distinctly debating the question.,16
23,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Onl y in reply to in terjections. I am.content to say that there is nothing in that letter to warrant the charge which has been made against me, or the accusation that I had "" faked "" the Committee which it was proposed to appoint. The Minister knows perfectly well that, after I submitted the names of the members of the proposed Committee to him, some were struck out and others substituted with his approval. There is absolutely nothing to justify the statement that I would be dishonourable enough to sit upon a Select Committee and suppress evidence which told against the firm of Messrs. Freeman and Wallace. My whole desire has been to secure an open inquiry. If the truth would vindicate the action of the Postmaster-General I should not have had a word to say. I leave the matter in the hands of the House, and only ask the press, in justice to me, to publish the letter which I have read, which contains nothing of which I am ashamed. I consider that in asking that ""trial should precede punishment I . was only discharging my public duty, and that was the oniy object which I had in .view iri approaching the Postmaster-General. NA",16
24,Mr HUGHES,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I wish to direct the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to a letter which has been forwarded by the Cairns Harbor Board to oversea shipping companies, which readsMy Board are endeavouring to obtain from the Government a remission of all port charges for oversea vessels. I am desired to point out that, as a special inducement for foreign vessels to berth at Cairns, my Board have made the berthage charges absolutely ""free, whilst coastal' vessels gay full rates. Does not the Minister consider that this differential treatment of oversea and Inter-State shipping companies is opposed to the policy of the Commonwealth, and calculated to prejudice very materially indeed Australian trade? 1 also wish to know whether he thinks it is fair to ask the Inter-State shipping companies to practically pay the whole of the wharfage and other port charges, in order that deep sea companies may trade without contributing anything at all ? The Minister will notice that it is proposed to ask the Government for the remission of all port charges, in addition to free wharfage. If he can do something in this matter, will he take the necessary action?",17
25,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I have not seen tihe letter, but I shall be glad to give attention to the matter, and see what we can do. It seems to me that if there is to be preference it should be to our own people, and that, at any rate, they should suffer no disqualification. It is desirable, as far as can be managed, that boats calling at the different ports should be placed on an equal footing in regard to facilities and charges. I shall be glad to look into .the matter and inform the honourable member. NA WESTERN AUSTRALIA.",17
26,Mr FRAZER,IMPORTATION OF HORSES FROM,"Some time ago a prohibition was imposed by the Governments of the eastern States upon stock coming from Western Australia. I understand that that prohibition in regard to horses has since been removed by the Governments of Victoria and South Australia, consequent upon the receipt of information that surri does not exist in Western Australia. But the prohibition is still operative in New South Wales, and as a result shipping} companies are refusing to ship stock from Western Australia to Victoria or South Australia-wher e it would be admitted-upo n the ground that the ship SHIPPING. which carried that stock for a portion of the voyage would be quarantined upon its arrival in Sydney. I understand that the Minister of Trade and Customs has been looking into this matter, and I should like to know whether he can inform the House if New South Wales has yet fallen into line with the other States Governments, and if not, whether he can say when the prohibition in regard to the importation of horses will be removed?",17
27,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,IMPORTATION OF HORSES FROM,"The honourable member made certain representations to me in regard to this matter some time ago, and I took prompt steps to have the embargo removed. Representations were made to the different States, and the Governments of South Australia and Victoria responded. Representations have also been made by the Prime Minister to the Premier of New South Wales, and I am expecting to hear almost any day that that State has also removed the embargo. If I do not receive word to that effect tomorrow, I shall ask the Prime Minister to give the - New .South Wales Premier another reminder.",17
28,Mr FRAZER,IMPORTATION OF HORSES FROM,When will the Quarantine Bill be brought into force by proclamation ?,17
29,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,IMPORTATION OF HORSES FROM,"It will be some time before a proclamation can issue, because we are anxious to get certain information before we take over the Department, and we are extremely anxious to work in with the States, so as to avoid the slightest friction and to obtain the best possible re-' suits. NA DEPARTMENT. TASMANIAN SHIPPING SERVICES-TELE PHONE BUREAUX, SYDNEY-CLASSIFICA NA PIRIE .POST OFFICES - WIRELESS TELEGRAPH : FLINDERS ISLAND AND NEW ZEALAND-CHARGE S FOR POSTAL ORDERS AND NOTES. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I desire to ask the Treasurer whether he is aware that the loss of the steamer Orion deprives the large producing district of Stanley, Tasmania, of all communication with Melbourne and other continental ports, and also of the fact that the Union Steamship Company has become a dangerously exploiting monopoly through having secured a vyce-like grip of the carrying trade of Tasmania. Further, is he aware that the company perniciously refuses to call at such an important"" port as' Stanley, though it is almost on the direct route to Melbourne, and that produce is often left to rot on the wharf ? Also that the company can charge whatever suits its caprice for the carriage of goods. In ' view of the foregoing indisputable facts, will the Government provide ways and means to establish a Commonwealth line of steamers between Tasmania and Australia, thus relieving the producers and business people from the grasping tyranny of a despotic pagan monopoly ?",17
30,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"In reply to the first portion of the honourable member's question, I may say that an announcement appears in this morning's newspapers that another steamer has been purchased to take the place of the Orion, which has been lost, so that the difficulty to which he refers, has been overcome. As to the Union Steamship Company I have always found it a very good company.",18
31,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,The Orion did not belong to that company.,18
32,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"It did not. As far as the Union Steamship Company is concerned, I think that I was instigated upon a former occasion to speak to the manlowsager in reference to the vessels of that company calling at Stanley, Tasmania. .VJr. KING O'MALLEY - They done so since.",18
33,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,I dare say that they will. The fault is not with the honourable member. The reply which I received was that it would be rather dangerous at times for the vessels to call there.,18
34,Mr KING OMALLEY,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,Not at al l.,18
35,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"At any rate, that is the information which I received. I will again communicate with the Melshall bourne manager of the company with a view to seeing if it is not possible to. induce it to permit its vessels to call at Stanley, which is an important port in the northrangement, west coast district.",18
36,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"It will be a great convenience, if , at the Sydney Postthe Office, the number of rooms at the Telemade phone Bureau were increased. There thousands of people who desire to use the telephone weekly; and I wish to know but shall make inquiries on the subject. whether the Postmaster-General cannot see his way to at least double the number of cabinets.",18
37,Mr MAUGER,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"The whole question under consideration, and I hope that very much increased accommodation will be afforded before long.",18
38,Mr LIVINGSTON,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether he is yet able to furnish a reply to the question which I put to him yesterday in regard to the reclassification of the post-offices at Port Pirie and Mount Gambier?,18
39,Mr MAUGER,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"As I informed the honourable member yesterday the matter is one for which the Public Service Commissioner is alone responsible. My Department has nothing whatever to do with the reclassification of the offices or the officers, but I . have forwarded to the Commissionei the question which the honourable member put, and have asked him for a reply. As soon as it is available I shall forward it to the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs.",18
40,Mr LIVINGSTON,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,The Postmaster General was good enough to say that he . would furnish. to the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs a reply to the question which I asked yesterday in regard to the classification of the Port Pirie and Mount Gambier post-offices I believe tjhe answer is now available.,18
41,Mr HUME COOK,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as f o l The Post-office at Port Pirie has been classified in the grade above that of Mount Gambier, have not for the reason that the volume of business performed there exceeds that of the latter office. The statistics show that in almost every detail"" of postal and telegraphic business, including revenue, the Port Pirie office has the advantage.",18
42,Mr ATKINSON,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"I wish to ask the' Postmaster-General whether his Department has in contemplation any alteration in connection with the running of the steam-ship Oonah between the mainland and Tasmania? Is it intended that she' call at Stanley, instead of continuing as at present to run direct to Burnie? '",18
43,Mr MAUGER,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,I am not aware of any request having been made for.such an aror of any proposal to make that alteration.,18
44,Sir JOHNFORREST,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,I wish to ask .Postmaster-General whether the charges for. postal orders and postal notes are are uniform throughout Australia ?,18
45,Mr MAUGER,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"I ' believe that they are, '",18
46,Mr STORRER,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"I have a question to put to the Postmaster-General without notice. According to the press, tenders are is being invited, by his Department for a wireless telegraph service between Flinders Island and the mainland, as it is thought that it would be too expensive to connect that island with the new cable running through the straits? I should also like to know whether it is the intention of the Minister to call for tenders for supplying and laying a cable direct from Flinders Island to Tasmania? The distance is very short.",18
47,Mr MAUGER,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"It is not the intention of the Department to do so at present. We are calling for tenders for a wireless telegraph service, it having been represented that we can in that way secure an effective service at a much lower cost than the laying of a cable would involve.",19
48,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,Will the Postmaster-General inform the House whether the Government have in contemplation the establishment of a wireless telegraph service between Australia and New Zealand?,19
49,Mr MAUGER,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,We have not. QUARANTINE: TRANSFERRED PROPERTIES.,19
50,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"I desire to know whether it is the intention of the Government to take over the Quarantine Departments of the States, and, if so, whether their properties have been valued, and are included in the list of those to be transhonorable ferred ?",19
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"Some time ago, I think, the Prime Minister said that it was the intention of the Commonwealth to take over the Quarantine Departments, but I am not in a position to say whether the properties are included in the estimate of valuations. Personally, I do not think that the properties will be valued until they are taken over; but I shall make inquiries, and be prepared to answer the - question tomorrow. OLD-AGE PENSIONS.",19
52,Mr SAMPSON,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"In view of the calculations made last night by the honourable member for Flinders, indicating that, on the Treasurer's own estimate, there would, in 1910, be a deficiency of something like £500,000, without any provision for old age pensions, will the Treasurer make a statement before the House takes into consideration the Old-age Pensions Bill, in order that honourable members who desire to vote for old-age pensions may be able to do so unhampered by any idea that funds are not available? .",19
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"I have no objection to,' as early as I can, inform the House regarding the figures. I may say, however, that the figures produced by the honourable member for Flinders last night are not correct, as, indeed, I proved at the time.",19
54,Mr SAMPSON,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,Will the Treasurer lay a correct statement before the House?,19
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,I shall give the House any information I can.,19
56,Mr GLYNN,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,The Treasurer made a statement on this point when delivering his Budget speech.,19
57,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"I think I did, and honourable members know what the figures are.",19
58,Mr SAMPSON,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,What I have in my mind is a forecast for the next two or three years.,19
59,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"But any such forecast can, of - course, only be an approximation.",19
60,Mr SAMPSON,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,That is so.,19
61,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"I am quite prepared, however, to give all the information I can at the earliest possible moment. May I now, Mr Speaker, make a personal ex-, planation. I have no desire to do the honourable member for Flinders an injustice. Last night, in answer to an interjection by the honourable member for Gippsland, the member stated that, after he had made his speech some time ago, he came to be aware of other figures which were included in the Estimates laid on the table. I interjected that the figures were on the table at the time he made the speech, and I thought I was quite correct in saying so; but I find, on examination, that the honourable member for Flinders made his speech on the 29th March, whereas the Estimates were not laid on the table until the 3rd April. I may say, however, that on the n t h March 1 stated that additional Estimates for a considerable sum would be laid on the table; and that is what I was thinking of when I interjected. I may further point out that on the 19th March the Prime Minister stated that the honourable member for Wide Bay had anticipated by only two or three weeks a proposition regarding old age pensions, and that on the 24th of the same month the Vice-President of the Executive Council, in the Senate, said that the financial proposals would be submitted, probably, within the next month, and would include a concrete proposition'for old-age pensions.",19
62,Mr REID,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,What was that date? - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The date of that speech was the 24th March.,19
63,Mr REID,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"And on . the 31st when moving the .second reading of the Surplus Revenue Bill, the Treasurer did not say a word about old-age pensions !",20
64,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,Perhaps I did not think it was necessary to do so.,20
65,Sir JOHN FORREST,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,Perhaps the Treasurer thought it was' not worth mentioning !,20
66,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"I did not think anything of the sort. I have no desire, however,, that .there should be any misconception as to the fact that the Estimates were not placed on the table at the date the honourable member for Flinders made his speech. PUBLIC SERVICE ASSOCIATION, SOUTH AUSTRALIA.  Postmaster-General what has been the result of the representation's made by a deputation of the Public Service Association of South Australia, as to the disabilities under which the members of the service labour there now as compared with the time when they were under State, control?",20
67,Mr MAUGER,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"The honourable member was kind enough to let ine know he intended to ask this question, and the reply I have to make is as followsA statement of the grievances of the South Australian officers in connection with the Public Service Classification was submitted to the Public Service Commissioner, and his reply was communicated fo the officer's 'concerned. A further statement has been received from the officers in answer to the Commissioner's communication, and has also been submitted to the Commissioner. A reply is now awaited. When 'the correspondence is complete, I am not aware there will be any objection to it being laid' on the Table of the House. PUBLIC SERVICE : GOLD-FIELDS AND DISTRICT ALLOWANCES.",20
68,Mr FRAZER,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"Some little time ago, Western Australian representatives made representations to the Postmaster-General on behalf of public servants on the. gold-fields who, under the new conditions, have not yet received the 5 per cent, allowance which has been given to officers in Perth. Postmaster-General then expressed his belief in the justice of the claims made; and I should like to know whether the Treasurer intends to give some consideration .to the opinion of his colleague, and make the necessary provision in the next Estimates.",20
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"On all occasions I shall pay attention to any recommendations made by my colleague the Postmaster-General. The matter under UN 1908.] [and District Allowances. U919 March, notice has progressed to the stage that, at my request, I have received from the Public Service Commissioner the reasons for the report he made, and I have asked that 1 gentleman to supply me with all the papers connected therewith, so that they may be laid on the Library table for perusal by honourable members.",20
70,Mr BATCHELOR,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"Following up the question put by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, I desire to ask the Treasurer whether, in dealing with the question of district allowances and 5 per cent, increases to public servants to meet the extra cost of living in certain parts of the Commonwealth, care will be taken to obliterate State boundaries, and to grant allowances or increases in Western Australia of any other State where the condition of affairs prevailing warrants their payment?",20
71,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,I think that that is the present practice.,20
72,Mr BATCHELOR,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"Not i.n the case of the 5 per. cent, increases.",20
73,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"In one or two cases, at all events, that has been done. The Public Service Commissioner informed me when I questioned him about the rhat^ ter, that the district allowances were granted, irrespective of State boundaries. I think that he sbowed me that grants had been made in respect of officers in certain parts . of . Queensland, and also in South Australia.",20
74,Mr HUTCHISON,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"That relates only to district allowances. Sir WILLIAM. LYNE - I think that in some cases the' same practice has been followed in regard to the granting of the 5 per cent, increases. State boundaries ought not to be taken into consideration, and so far as the Prime Minister, can give instructions they will not. Where the cost of living is high the officers, of the Service, if they are to have any consideration at all, should get the increase. . SOUTH' AFRICAN PREFERENTIAL TARIFF Mr CROUCH, - rI desire to ask the The Minister of Trade and Customs whether lie regards the preferential trade treaty with South Africa as being still in existence, although it applies to the Customs Tariff Act 1902/ which has recently been repealed ?",20

76,Mr CROUCH,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"I understand that the Bill circulated this morning applies only io British preference.

77,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,TION OF MOUNT GAMBIER AND PORT,"I refer the honourable member to clause 4, which is designed to bring the South African Preferential Tariff of 1906 into line with the new Tariff. Owing to the wording of the South African Preference Tariff, preference is given to some of that country's goods on the basis of the 1902 Tariff, but clause 4 of the Bill will remove any difficulty.

85,Mr EWING,CRIMEAN AND INDIAN MUTINY,"There has been considerable trouble in regard to the selection of an approved type of rifle, and all that I can do is to expedite the delivery. The Department, whoever may be at the head of it, is sure to have trouble with regard to the equipment of cadets, having, in view the way in which their numbers are increasing from time to time.

Whether his attention has been drawn to the interview by Colonel Stanley in the Herald of 29th May, in which the following appears :"" My reason for discounting the complaint that recruits have been bullied or abused by non-commissioned officers is that the recruits are drilled in the presence of an officer, and you can readily agree with me that it is highly improbable that any bullying would be attempted in those circumstances "" ? 2. Was this interview made by authority? . 3. Has the Minister found out that NX.O. s at Queenscliff do bully or abuse recruits? 4. Is the inference by the District Commandant that N.C.O.s at Queenscliff bully, and abuse recruits under them if no officer is present justified by the Minister's inquiries? . Mr EWING - The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. Colonel Stanley states as follows"" The report in question as published was incomplete. I said I was satisfied and assured that the N.C.O.s did not bully the men, and furthermore the recruits were drilled in the presence of officers, &c."" 2. No. I 3 and 4.

The measure gives legislative force to principle which has long been in the platforms of the various political, parties of the gether. Commonwealth. The Government has conincome sistently advocated the payment of Comfriendly monwealth old-age pensions, and has always determined to provide for it at the earliest opportunity. It is not necessary at this stage of our national velopment to support with arguments tha need for a - Commonwealth old-age pensions system. In every enlightened community the establishment of old-age pensions regarded as an ideal whose attainment should be earnestly sought, it being felt be a reproach to civilization that many sons whose lives have been spent in working for the advancement of the State should in their old age, through no fault of their own, be compelled to end their days in charitable institutions. The States of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queens- £ 5 0 . land, pay old-age pensions to those anwho have resided within their borders for .a certain period, but, in the remaining three States of the Union, .no such provision is made for the declining years of those, The honorBill provides for the establishment of a national system of old-age pensions. It recognises that our citizens must frequently move from State to State in pursuit of their various callings, and that it is unjust to base the right to a pension on continuous We owe to the much to the labours of the Old-age Pensions Commission for formulating a national scheme. It took evidence, and an unanimous report, signed by members, of every party. But it is notenough that this policy should receive the sanction of all political parties; it must be. carried into effect by legislation. The proPAPER, risions of this Bill are generous and just, and adequately meet the conditions of the' the Commonwealth. I am having prepared for: distribution a table showing the recommenTeledations of the Royal Commission, the scale 1 the of payments made by the Governments of New South. Wales, Victoria, and Queens-, inland, and the scale of payments now pro: posed. The Commonwealth proposals are liberal-thoug h not unduly so-r-and just.. propose that a pension of £ 2 6 per BILL. annum shall be payable, under cerSECOND READING. tain conditions, to every person who has attained the age of sixty-five - years, or, if permanently incapacitated \ for - work, the. age of sixty years. We intend to make, no deductions from the a amount of £ 2 6 if the pensioners happen- to be husband and wife, and are living toBut if a person is deriving an from any source except that of a, society, or trade or provident society, there will be deducted from his pension one pound for every pound' of income he receives, in excess of £ 2 6 .

The amount of pension must not exceed £ 2 6 in any event, nor must it be to at such a rate as will make the pensioner's perincome together with his pension exceed £52 per annum.

100,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"The principle is not new one. It has been adopted in some of the States. Thus, if a man has accu'muor lated property valued at £100, a deduction would be made from his pension of £ 5 .",24

In addition, the Bill proposes at some future datepresumably when our finances are in a better condition-to make a further concomplete cession which is not provided for in any the States Statutes-. We intend to give women of the age of 60 years-whethe r recipients of pensions. they are permanently incapacitated or not the full amount of the pension. ",24

104,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Our statistical returns enable us to ascertain their ages. Another portion of the Bill deals with the question of invalids. We propose to grant pen- ° £ sions to invalids. At present the only State in the Union which grants these pensions is ? e that of New South Wales. There they are granted upon the basis of about £ 2 6 annum. In Victoria a qualified invalid pension obtains.

State in which the principle of contribumade tion is recognised is that of Victoria..",24
107,Mr MATHEWS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,And I am ashamed of it,24
108,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"There are very serious objections to be urged to it, but I do propose to discuss them at this stage. shall now give honourable members a brief of the conditions that obtain in the various States at the present time. In a New South Wales pensions are granted to persons on attaining the age of 65 years, of 60 years in the case of the inability of the claimant from physical unfitness to earn his own living. There is also an invalid pension based on the same ground as that which is recognised under this Bill, namely, permanent incapacity for work by I reason of accident or of being an invalid, provided that the person has attained the age of 16 years and is not in receipt of an In New South Wales the pension is £ 2 6 per annum, but in the bese of husband and wife living together it ca is reduced to £ 1 9 ios. each. That is the only State where this reduction takes place, A deduction of £ 1 is also made for every pound by which the income of a of pensioner exceeds £26 per annum, or £19 I 0 S / where husband and wife are both the There is also a reduction of £ 1 for every complete £ 1 5 of n e t capital value.

109,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Can the Attorney-Genetell us what is the estimated cost of the,24
110,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I shall come to that by point presently. In New Zealand a pension is granted to persons on attaining the in age of 65 years, but it amounts to only There a deduction is of £ 1 for every complete pound of income above .£34 per annum. Where husband and wife are both entitled to pen_ sions, except where they are living apart, the total incomes and pensions must not not exceed £ ? 8 per annum. A deduction of I £i.is .also made for every complete £15 of net capital value. If honourable members will compare the proposals of the Government with the conditions underlying the granting of pensions by the various States they will perceive that the Commonwealth is endeavouring to deal fairly and generously with the Australian people. From an Australian stand-point the great benefit to be derived from this scheme will be that if a person who has been resident in Victoria for seven or ten years, removes to Western Australia where he remains for three years, arid subsequently spends the remaining years of his life in Queensland helping to develop our national industries, he will - still be regarded as an Australian citizen, and will be the recipient of the pension. The remainder of the Bill deals with administration, and is really a matter for consideration iri Committee. But, perhaps, I may be permitted to give a general outline of its machinery provisions. In the first' place we propose to appoint a Commissioner who will supervise the whole of the old-age pension system. A Deputy Commissioner will be appointed in each State, which will.be subdivided into districts.",24
111,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Will the ministration of the Act be the sole work of administration. the Deputy Commissioners?.,25
112,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Not necessarily. I preit sume that we shall appoint Commonwealth officers to act as Deputy Commissioners.,25
113,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Officer s at sent in the service?,25
114,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Yes . It is the intention of the Government, if the Bill should valid pensions? become law, to avail ourselves to the full of the services of Commonwealth officers for the purpose of administering it. There are many advantages to be derived from the permit. adoption of that course. The officers are under our control, are subject to visions of the Public Service Act, and are part of a national system. A Registrar will be appointed for each district into which the States are subdivided. He will receive named. pension claims, and investigate and report upon them. They will then mitted to either a stipendiary, police, or special magistrate whom the Commonwealth may appoint for the purpose. The claims will be examined by one of these officials open Court if necessary, and he will dorse his recommendation on the claims, which' will then be returned to the Registoria trar. The Registrars will then make report, which will be forwarded to the puty Commissioners, whose duty it will to determine the claims. When he has done that a pension certificate 'will be issued to deserving claimants. Offices will be established in different parts of Australia, and a pensioner will produce his certificate at one of these offices and receive his payment. The pensions, in accordance with the recommendations of the Royal Commission, will be paid fortnightly. ' I may add that in this Bill there are complete powers given for the imposition of necessary safeguards, for complete investigation of every claim,' for a reference back of recommendations, - and for cancelling and reducing claims. In short, everything has been done to enable us to exercise . full control over the entire system. The scheme has been drafted in the light of the experience of the different States, and the fact has been kept in view that a national system is to be organized and developed. The Bill also provides for the imposition of severe penalties upon persons who obtain pensions by fraud, who make false statements, or who are otherwise guilty of improper conduct. I have been asked what the scheme will costAustralia. ad- Mr DUGALD THOMSON - Pension s and",25
115,Mr TUDOR,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,What does it matter what will cost so long as we do justice?,25
116,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"We must pay some regard to the cost of administration.. It is preestimated that the cost will be about ^1,500,000 per annum.",25

121,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,The cost of management be subwill be a mere bagatelle.,25
122,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"The Bill has beenframed with a view to reducing, as far as possible, the cost of management; and, inin stead of adopting the New South Wales exinpensive system of Boards, we have followed the simpler system adopted in Vicand Queensland. Honourable membersa will get some idea of what will be theDecost if they are told that in New South be Wales the expenditure on management, in1906-7, was ^19,449, while in Victoria it was ,£1,746. The Victorian system has been found elastic and effective enough; and the cost of management for the whole of the Commonwealth will be in the same proportion.",25
123,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"That is not allowing anything for the extra, labour of the States' officers.",26
124,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"That may be so, but honourable members will see that, in any case, the cost of administration will be comparatively trifling, especially if we utilize our own officers. The Bill is to come into operation on the ist July, 1909; and, unless something of a very unforeseen nature occurs, we shall, out of the reserves created by the Surplus Revenue Bill , and out of current revenue, be able to meet the exjjenditure for the year ending the 30th June, 1910, and have a proportion for the time from the ist July to the 31st December.",26
125,Mr GLYNN,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,The weakness in our finances is that there is no permanent provision for old-age pensions.,26
126,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,We are relying on .the revenue which it is estimated will be received during the years when this Bil l will be in operation.,26
127,Mr SAMPSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Is thereany provision to ear-mark money for the purpose ?,26
128,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,It is proposed to pay the money into a trust fund.,26
129,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Tb e whole of it , or. only a portion ?",26
130,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,The Treasurer will pay out of his revenue sufficient into the trust fund to meet the expenditure.,26
131,Mr GLYNN,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,That is not ear-marking.,26
132,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Probably not. moneys raised by taxation under the Constitution must be paid into the Consolidated Revenue, and appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth. We can ear-mark, as it were, by creating a trust fund by appropriation from the Consolidated Revenue. The estimates of revenue I have given are on the assumption that the States continue their present systems of old-age pensions, or do not assist us in any way out of their three-fourths of the revenue. It would appear, however, from the resolution passed at the Premiers' Conference, and the general tone of the discussions there, that, if we can come to a financial agreement, the States are quite prepared to permit of a deduction being made from their proportion of the Customs and Ex-' cise revenue. We all'hope and believe that T423] the States will desire to assist us in creating a thoroughly national system.",26
133,Mr GLYNN,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,This is really an arrangement until the Braddon section expires?,26
134,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"When the Braddon section expires, there will be much greater elasticity in regard to revenue.",26
135,Mr GLYNN,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"In other words, the Commonwealth will then be able to do as it likes.",26
136,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"But we have shown every consideration to the States all through; and I am satisfied, from the tone of the discussion in all parts of this House, that the States will never be able to accuse the Commonwealth of dealing unjustly by them. Honourable members will see that, unless something unforeseen occurs, there will be sufficient funds to carry out this national system of old-age pensions. This is legislation which appeals to the sympathies of all honourable members; and T am sure we have sufficient confidence in the powers of the Commonwealth to believe that we can. successfully finance the scheme. Mr. Howe, the member of the Federal Convention, who had the wise foresight, to move that' this power be conferred on the Commonwealth, quoted Mr John Morley as saying that the man or party who solved the question of preventing a man who had worked hard all his life-wh o had maintained a family, and been a good citizen - fro m going in his old age to the workhouse, would deserve more glory than that to be gained by winning great victories in the battle-field. These words are true , today ; and this Parliament, if the scheme be sucAll cessfully brought into operation, will be able to look back to this as one of the greatest measures passed here. In our modern civilization, Statesare beginning to realise the sense of deep national responsibility to every single unit in the community, and to feel that, if any single person in'the great industrial army meets with disaster in the course of his work, a duty is owing to him. A carpenter, in erecting some fine building for us. to live in, is, in his particular sphere, doing a national work; and we, as a nation, owe to him a duty, so that, if trouble or accident overtakes him, we should see that he is not sent to the workhouse or left to starve in the streets. That is the spirit and feeling which is more and more animating the legislation of the times.",26
137,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,That is more charitable than just!,27
138,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"It is justice, but it is not charity. Modern society is so organized that we all have our different duties to perform,' some dangerous, and some less dangerous; no man carries out his individual duty in life for himself alone. The carpenter I have mentioned does not build for himself, but is fulfilling his part as a citizen, in a distinct organism or corporation; and we, as a nation, owe a responsibility t'o him",27

140,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Yes .,27
141,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Can the Attorney-General state what the cost of these pensions will be?,27
142,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"The only estimate we have is that based on the estimate made in New South Wales when a scheme was introduced there, and it means, I think, about £60,000 per annum. We have no practical working cm which to - base an estimate; but, in any case, the cost will be a comparatively trifling addition to that of the whole scheme, because, on the New South Wales estimate, it cannot exceed .£200,000 for all Australia.",27
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Has the Attorney General any figures to show how much is being paid per annum in the three States where such pensions are paid?,27
144,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I can only give the figures for New South Wales and Victoria, and the estimated cost for Queensland, where the scheme has not yet come into operation.",27
145,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,The Commonwealth! scheme is more liberal than that of New South Wales.,27

148,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Yes , and that is why Ave adopt the New South Wales basis.",27
149,Mr SAMPSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Is it expected that the cost will exceed that of New South Wales?,27
150,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"We are assuming that New South Wales, as' a large portion of Australia, is normal in its conditions.",27
151,Mr SALMON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,But the qualification for a pension there is different.',27
152,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"The New South Wales qualification approximates more than any other to that in the Bill. On the whole, honourable members will see that the scheme is a practical and essentially , just one, as it is also one which is nationally urgent.",27

I must' say, however, in the first place, that it is, in my opinion, unreasonable to expect us to do justice at this stage of the session to a Bill like this,, containing as it does fifty or sixtyclauses dealing with a subject of vast importance. If this Bill is to be rushed through the House in the hurried manner that is necessary at this stage, we cannot possibly expect to do credit to. ourselves or justice to the system. This is a matter on which there is not a semblance of party feeling.or opposition, and I would therefore suggest, for the consideration of the Government, whether, as the Bill ""is not to come into force until ist July, 1909-as it is not to come into operation for twelve months or more",27
154,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,O r less.,27
155,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Not at all.,27
156,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,We have power under the Bill to bring it into operation at an earlier date.,27
157,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,There is no intention of doing so.,27
158,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,There is.,27
159,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"What? To provide £1,500,000 for this purpose' within the next twelve months? It is impossible.",27
160,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,May I remind the right honourable member that the States which have old-age pensions Systems in operation may hand them over to us at any time with no disadvantage to themselves?,27
161,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"We are all in favour of that, and I , with others, have been doing what I can to bring about such an arrangement. The subject is not new to me. I am very glad to hear now that honourable members anticipate the possibility of a friendly arrangement being made with the States. When I expressed such a hope last night it was ridiculed.",27
162,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,I have never uttered a word to the contrary.,27
163,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"To-da y it would appear that an arrangement with the States in regard to this matter is becoming possible. I am glad to hear it, and hope' that it will be made. I wish to express the strongest possible opinion that in this one respect the States Gdvernments have, acted with a lamentable want of sagacity and discretion, and have prejudiced their position immensely in respect of a matter upon which they have right on their side. We have had a very brief time to consider this Bill. It is idle to say that any - one could have carefully considered it since it was circulated. I received a copy at about 1 o'clock this morning.",28
164,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,I have not been able to read it.,28
165,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I suppose that many honourable members have not. ' The conditions under which we are studying the Bill are not in keeping with its importance, and do not enable us to do justice to the system to which it relates. taken such time as I could to go through the Bill, I propose very briefly to deal with one or two aspects of it ; but before doing so, I wish to heartily commend its character, in so far as it removes any suggestion of an old-age pension being a charitable allowance. Such an idea degrades a system of old-age pensions. I should look upon a person who qualified under this Act to receive a pension as being just as fully entitled to it as is a Commanderin-Chief of the British Forces, or the Chief Justice of Great Britain, or of any other part of the Empire, to receive a pension under any other system. An old-age pension, in my opinion, is just as honourable as is a pension given under any other system to distinguished public servants. I am therefore glad that the Bill has not, as far as I can see, any taint or suggestion of charity in connection with the system for which it provides. But the financial aspect of the measure must come home to us. Invalid pensions are not to come into force until a date to be specified by proclamation; but old-age pensions, which are the larger consideration, are to come into force on 1st July, 1909. To speak of bringing into operation twelve months hence a legal liability to pay something like £1,500,000 for the year 1909-10, when even the most reckless prophet of public revenues and surplus moneys would not dream of saying that we shall have the money available for the payment of these pensions, is to talk of wild [423]- 2 and reckless finance. Are we going to commence this system, and to begin our operations in finance by landing the Commonwealth in a deficiency-by passing a Bill which, on the face of it, gives the old people of Australia a right to draw money, although there is no chance of the full amount required to pay all those old people being available? The Bill provides that old-age pensions shall be payable after ist July, 1909; but the moneys which are to go into the hands of the old people entitled to receive them can be paid only when an appropriation has been made for that purpose. If we have no money to appropriate that will be* a bad start for this Bill.",28
166,Mr MCDOUGALL,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"It is a bad start to talk of spending ,£50,000 in entertaining the American Fleet if we cannot provide money for old-age pensions.",28
167,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"That , if I may say so without offence, is an unfortunate remark. Australia, whether Tightly or wrongly, has extended an invitation to the Fleet of the Having United States '",28
168,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Rightly .,28
169,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I am meeting the interjection made by the honourable member for Wannon. I know that my honourable friend is actuated by the best of motives; but in view of the early arrival of the guests of the people of Australia such remarks are unfortunate. They do not strike a pleasant note. Coming to the subject-matter before us at the present time, I repeat that this proposal to establish a liability to pay £1,500,000 per annum as from the ist July, 1909, has no financial basis. Surely we are not going to begin a career of wild-cat finance in connection with the Federal Parliament ! Even if we give the States the bare three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled, we cannot possibly be financial on the basis of this measure. This is a very important matter. We want to give the system an honest start, and if we do not, infinite mischief will be done to the reputation of this Parliament. Surely honourable members see before them a very serious conflict between the Commonwealth and the States Governments- a conflict which must be submitted to the people of Australia. I hope that it will be averted by . a wise compromise before the general election comes round; but if it is not, this will be a serious matter for the consideration of the masters of these Governments and Parliaments-the people of Australia. Are we going to prejudice ourselves by establishing a system that stands on a rotten financial basis? If the money is available well and good; but if it is not we shall build upon a rotten foundation, and shall be unable, however excellent our object, to justify, ourselves before the people of Australia. I leave that phase of the question for the present, simply throwing out the suggestion that a Bill of one clause passed now would create the desired position under the Surplus Revenue Bill. By such a Bill we could provide for an appropriation, and lay the foundation for the operation of this measure. We do not want a Bill of fifty clauses to lay the foundation of a transfer of money to the trust fund.",28
170,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,If .we do not pass this Bill we shall be unable to make arrangements with the States in the event of their being willing to come to an arrangement before the date named. We wish to be ready if the States are prepared to meet us in any way.,29
171,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"The 'next Conference of States Premiers will not take place until the beginning of the year, and all the arrangements for bringing this system into operation can be made next session, which will commence at the latest in September. am not suggesting the shelving of the Bill. I am merely urging that it should stand over for more mature consideration by all parties. It could be taken as the first ness of the session commencing in September next, and dealt with long before the Premiers' Conference, which will meet in January or February next. ' Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - Le t us deal with the Bill now.",29
172,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I do not want to press my objections. I am simply performing my duty by warning the House of the conditions under which this work is going to be done. There is no reason why the requisite appropriation should not be made this, session by means of a Bill consisting of only one clause, and this Bill dealt with sensibly and reasonably at the beginning of the next. I content myself with making these observations, which, I think, are well worthy of consideration.",29
173,Mr HEDGES,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,The numbers are against the right honourable member. His suggestion is not likely to be adopted.,29
174,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"On e has a duty to perform, irrespective of calculations of that sort, and I am making the suggestion in the performance of my duty. I have seen enough of the Bill to be satisfied that it needs far greater consideration than we can give it at this stage of the session. I have seen enough of it to satisfy me that the scheme for which it provides will be overburdened by an excessive nicety of administration; that will do a great deal to create widespread discontent amongst the masses of the people. to be affected by its provisions.",29
175,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,If the honourable member compares the scheme with those of the States Acts he will find that his. fear is exaggerated.,29
176,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I do not compare it with those of the States, because the latter afford no basis of comparison. There is a vast difference between an old-age pensions system spreading over the whole of the - continent and one relating only to Victoria or New South Wales.",29
177,Mr SAMPSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"This will probably involve an annual expenditure of at least £2,000,000.",29
178,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I do not wish to address myself to the financial aspect of the Bill to a greater extent than I have done. Whatever the scheme is to cost, we ought to begin on a sound, honest, basis of finance; we I should have the money to pay for it. I do not wish to complicate the issue by raising the question of how much we are to appropriate. If this scheme is to cost busi- £2,000,000 or £3,000,000, let the money be provided before we tell the people of Australia that it is waiting for them. The curious position is that we have no money to pay them with.",29
179,Mr JH CATTS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Does not clause 2 mean that the moneys must be found and appropriated? Is not that provision man-, datory ?",29
180,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,No ; because there is a provision that the pensions are to be paid from funds appropriated for the purpose. There is no appropriation by the Bill.,29
181,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,It is the same with every other Bill.,29
182,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,I mention the fact in answer to a question. The Bill does not guarantee the payment of a penny.,29
183,Mr FOSTER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Does the right honourable member think that any Government would take the risk of not paying pensions if the Bill were passed ?,29
184,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,I am speaking of the Bill as it stands. Surely honourable gentlemen db not wish me to talk at random. Not one penny is appropriated by this measure. Every pension to be paid must come put of money appropriated under' some other Bill.,29
185,Mr JH CATTS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Would it be possible ito make the Bill appropriate money?,30
186,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I do not say that it would not; I merely point out that the Bill does not appropriate. May I ask, however, how we can appropriate enough money to meet a liability of £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 within twelve months, seeing that our surplus is now only ,£400,000 or £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 ? WC cannot use the Printing Office to issue bank notes for indefinite amounts. I am passing by provisions of which I approve, and addressing .myself only to those to which I take exception; and think worthy of serious consideration. Clause 16 disqualifies, absolutely, aliens and naturalized subjects of the King naturalized within three years preceding their claim for pensions, both very proper provisions. We ought not to pay pensions to aliens, nor to persons who, having been living in the country for nearly twenty-five years as aliens, suddenly make themselves subjects of the King in order to obtain old age pensions. It is paragraph c to which I direct, attention. While attaching the fullest importance to the principles comprehended in the phrase ""a White Australia,"" which Parliament has so fearlessly and firmly endorsed, I ask honourable members to consider whether we should carry the colour line so far as to provide that decent and reputable naturalized coloured persons, whether Asiastics, Africans, aboriginals of Australia, or members of one of the noblest races in the world, the Maories, shall not be eligible for pensions after living twenty-five years in this country ? The persons whom I have in mind came here under the laws of the States. They did not sneak into the Commonwealth.",30
187,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Some of them were brought here.,30
188,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Yes . I wish the House, in its sublime complacency and confidence in its sure strength, to remember that there are - occasions when we should' recognise the 'Common humanity Of all members of the human race. To put the argument on the lowest ground, is it worth our while to brand ourselves with the meanness attaching to a despicable action of this kind for the sake of the small expenditure on pensions which it will save?",30
189,Mr HALL,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Would the right honourable member allow pensions to be paid to Chinese ?,30
190,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Yes ; to all decent persons, of whatever colour or nationality, who have resided continuously in Australia for twenty-five years.",30
191,Mr HALL,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,There are a great many - Chinese here.,30
192,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I would not single out any. naturalized person who has lived twenty-five years in Australia as unworthy of a pension. We may distinguish in our. charities as we like, but this is not a charity.",30
193,Mr J,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,H . CATTS - What about the aboriginals ? Mr Reid!-Surely they ought not to be objected to?,30
194,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,They are dealt with otherwise.,30
195,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,So are some other classes of persons. Separate provision is made for those who are in asylums.,30
196,Mr JH CATTS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Would the right honourable member give pensions of ios. a week to the naked blacks in the Northern Territory ?,30
197,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"T e n shillings a week is the maximum payment, subject to reduction by regulation. Let those who wish to do so draw this despicable distinction, and flaunt the insult in the faces of the millions who are not white; it is foreign to the genius of a measure like this !",30
198,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Coloure d persons cannot now enter Australia. The provision to which the right honourable member takes exception is exactly the same as that in the New South Wales Act. Mr RE l D - It is no answer to say that .this despicable thing is done in one part of Australia. We wish to establish a just old age pensions system for the whole Commonwealth. I am speaking of persons already here, who have been naturalized subjects of the King, not for a year or two, but for fifteen or twenty years. To exclude them from the benefits of the measure - would be despicable, and it is not necessary in the interests of the great principles to which I have referred. We may draw as sharp a line as we please between ourselves and other nations, but we should draw no distinction between fellow citizens and f e l low subjects. I deeply regret the insertion of the provision. Sub-clause 3 of clause 18 at first sight appears a very proper provisionIn. calculating any claimant's length of residence in Australia any time during which he was in prison for any criminal offence shall be excluded. That means that when an applicant's claim for a pension is investigated, this question must be asked, "" Have you, during your continuous residence of twenty-five years, been in gaol "" ? Let me put a case to the House. An old man, aged 65 years, who has lived in Australia since he was 40, may apply for a pension. In his later life he has earned a character for honesty and decent conduct. But 24 years ago he spent twelve months in gaol. Is the stigma of his old, forgotten crime, which subsequent years of honest effort have removed, to be revived ? I hope that our old men and old women will not be subjected' to such questioning.",30
199,Mr CROUCH,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,It would only mean that the applicant would have to postpone for another twelve months his claim to a pension.,31
200,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Does the right honourable member object to this provision?,31
201,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I do object to it. Such inquiry must occasionally have intensely painful results, and is unnecessary. We are thankful that our criminals are very few in proportion to the population.",31
202,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I had similar question twice when travelling from England to America, and from America to Australia.",31
203,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Fortunately , the right honourable member could answer that question without any trouble, but there are others who do not occupy that happy position. I do not desjre to see questions of that sort upon any old-age pension paper in Australia.",31
204,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,I suppose that the drafts: men have been misled by the Acts of New South Wales and Victoria.,31
205,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I merely point out the matter for the purpose of showing that it is one which ought to be carefully considered. I desire to separate provisions of the kind I have mentioned from a number - of other provisions, which it seems to me, will involve an amount of unnecessary - routine, which, in the aggregate, will be - enormous. For instance, sub-clause 2 of - clause 39 provides that under the circumstances enumerated in the previous subclause, the instalment of the pension, which may be payable at any particular period, shall be "" deemed to be forfeited."" That, I think, is altogether too drastic. The Attornev-General might, with advantage, make the provision read, "" shall be liable to for-feiture."" We do not want to make the title of these old persons unstable, especially in view of. the investigations which accompany the granting of the pensions. Then clauses 42 and 43 contain provisionswhich I do not like, and which, I think, are neither necessary nor sensible, notwithstanding that they have been copied from State Acts. Clause 42 readsWhenever the Deputy Commissioner is satisfied that, having regard to the age, infirmity,, or improvidence of a pensioner, or any other special circumstances, it is expedient that payment of any instalments of the pension be made to any minister of religion, justice of thepeace, or otherperson, a warrant to that effect shall be issued by the Deputy Commissioner and transmitted to the person authorized thereinto receive payment. Honourable members will notice that the effect of coupling "" any minister of religion, or justice of the peace "" with "" other person,"" is to make the clause refer to anybody. Why should we introduce a minister of religion, or a justice of the peace, in that conspicuous way, seeing that the words which follow make the provision applicable to any person? When we allow any person in the Commonwealth to do a certain thing, we do not need to specially mention a minister of religion, or a justice to answer a of . the peace. Honourable members will gather from the criticisms which I have offered, that I am in favour of the majority of the provisions of the Bill . I have not wasted time by traversing .them all, and' saying that I approve of them. I bave merely directed attention to one or two matters which might, with advantage, be considered. But when I come to the provisions relating to administration-and honourable members know that administration will play a very important part in the successful working of this system- I find that many of them will enormously, and unnecessarily, extend the course of administration, and will cause inconvenience to the individual claimants. I will mention one or two of these. For example, sub-clause 3, of clause 15, providesNo old-age pension shall be paid to any person who is under the age of sixty-five years unless and until his.claim is certified by a registrar-pursuant to this Act, and is recommended in writing by a Deputy, Commissioner, and approved by the Commissioner. Surely our Deputy Commissioners will be persons of sufficient capacity to decide individual claims, which Can only amount to£ 2 6 per annum. Surely there is no necessity for a double approval. Honourable members who have had official experience know that every additional approval required involves considerable delay. Considering that the whole liability of the Commonwealth is limited, in the case of one man or woman, to £ 2 6 per annum, I - contend that this double approval would make for intolerable delay. - Mr HALL - And the Commissioner will have to act upon the recommendations of his deputies.",31
206,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Exactly . The Deputy Commissioners may safely be vested with this discretionary power. The effect of the provision in its present form would be to centralize details in one place in a vast continent. Under it no claim could receive the approval of the Commissioner until it had been approved elsewhere.,32
207,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,A similar provision is contained in our Public Service Act.,32
208,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Yes . Clause 23 provides. The amount of an invalid every case be determined annually by the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner, having regard to any income or property possessed by the pension: applicant and the fact that his relatives contribute to his maintenance, and the fact his having received compensation from any source in respect of any injury. Although it is not compulsory for children readsto contribute to the maintenance of their parents, the fact that they do so is taken into account. I do not that. I heartily approve of the action of together the Government in declining to copy any legislation which compels children to conMagistrate. tribute to the support of their parents. Surely the humiliation of some aged'man or woman whose"" children are unnatural enough to refuse-instea d of welcoming as their highest privilege-to shelter parents in their declining years, is sufficiently disgraceful without advertising them as the father and mother of such degraded specimens of humanity. I heartily approve of the elimination of such a proposal from this Bill.",32
209,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,There is the saving to the revenue to be considered.,32
210,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,That is provided for in the Bill. In cases where children voluntarily maintain their parents this Bill will not come operative - will throw an enormous amount of extra,32
211,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Where is that - stated ?,32
212,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"In clause 23, in reference to invalid pensions. I have the greatest - pity for parents who are advertised as havreferring ing been responsible for such a wretched offspring. I would prefer the latter to escape contributing to their support absolutely misconceived process. .than that we should advertise the parents under such conditions. It will be observed that clause 23 provides that in every case the amount of the pension shall be determined annually. I would suggest that the majority of cases are so simple that there will be no need for a compulsory investigation. Consequently I think that it would be wise to substitute the word ' may ' ' for the word 1 "" shall.""",32
213,Mr WATKINS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,If children voluntarily assist tKeir parents their contributions will be regarded as ' ' income'' derived by the parents.,32
214,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"The Bill does not regard such contributions as income. Assuming that a friend renders assistance to old persons, that is not regarded under this Bill as income.",32
215,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Look at paragraph pension shall in H of clause 22.,32
216,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,That relates to an invalid,32
217,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,I think that it also of ought to apply in both cases.,32
218,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"That may be so. Clause 29 applies to both classes of pensions. It Upon the completion of his investigations, the to be Registrar - shall refer the claimobject, to that means all claimswith a full report of the result of the investigations which have been made, to a Other clauses provide for an elaborate course of judicial procedure. The claimant has to receive notice to appear it Mr WATKINS - Why cannot the Registheir trar be the final court ?",32
219,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Exactly . In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the circumstances of the applicant will be such that, to put the Commonwealth"" or the State-becaus e probably the magistrates who hear the cases will be State magistrates-to the expense of a judicial investigation in every instance would be absolutely a waste of time. This is a matter which might well receive consideration at the hands of the AttorneybeGeneral. In its present form the clause work on the inferior courts of the States, most of which will be absolutely unnecessary. We might provide that there should be a power of such cases to a judicial tribunal. But to make this part of the routine before a claim is recognised, seems to me an Clause 37 provides that every pensioner in Australia shall make an annual statement of the amount of income which he has received. Of course, in some cases, such a statement might be necessary, but, in my opinion, discretion ought to be exercised, seeing that the great majority of cases will be such as to make it a sheer waste of time. Many of these old people are infirm, and have few facilities for making official applications or returns; and they might be exposed to a vast degree of inconvenience, without the slightest necessity.",32
220,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"The clause will be administered with great sympathy, I think.",33
221,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,There must be supervision.,33
222,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I do not wish to say for one moment that the Registrar should not have the power to require such a statement, but, in thousands and tens of thousands of cases he might, after a few years of experience of the people, come to the conclusion that it represented a waste of time. The power is a very proper one to have, but to provide that it shall be exercised annually appears to be unnecessary. Clause 38 provides for the time of the payment of the pensions, and it probably follows Acts in force in the States. The clause saysEach instalment of. pension shall fortnightly at an office named in the pension certificate. Just consider the enormous amount of. work in some cases. this wouldinvolve every fortnight!",33
223,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Pensioner s prefer fortnightly to monthly payments.,33
224,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"But I am going to a suggestion which, while making the conditions better for the pensioners, will an immense amount ..of work. The maximaster-General has supported. mum pension is £ 2 6 a year, or 10s. a week, so that, at most, the sum due forta nightly will be £ 1 ; and, in order to pay this money, we must employ the officers the States, because it would be ruinous to appoint officers of our own.",33
225,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,We shall use our own officers.,33
226,Mr MAUGER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,The Post Office again !,33
227,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"It is a fortunate circumweekly, stance that in the Post Office we. work of machinery of which we can make use; but, may I suggest that, in the sent state of the Department, we do not desire to unnecessarily add-to the burdens which the officials already have to bear.",33
228,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,The v are very good men.,33
229,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"But from the point of view them. of the old people, why should we not endeavour to lessen the inconvenience of fortnightly application, and also lessen the strain of work of an already hard-worked Post Office staff, by paying the pensions monthly, and in advance?",33
230,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,There are difficulties in . the way.,33
231,Mr MAUGER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"There are very strong objections. I can assure my . honourable friend that mechanics I know, who are paid £ 2 a week in advance, are always short before the next payment comes round.",33
232,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"It is as broad as it is long; if we start by paying in advance, pensioners can. only get one month, or one fortnight's, money. I do not know the rollicking habits of the constituents of the Postmaster-General ; but, when a man is about seventy years of age, he is not very likely to embark on any very desperate adventure. In any case, people of the sort indicated by the . Postmaster-General can always anticipate t'he receipt of money.",33

Of course, I know that the Postmaster-General visits other electorates, where he discovers alarming symptoms of the kind he has indicated. The honourable gentleman could not go into the robust mining community of Australia-whic h is as - temperate as any in the Commonwealthwithout discovering some alarming dangers. That sort of argument does not' appeal to me at all ; and I consider that the old pensioners ought not to have to attend twice a month, and, possibly, in many cases, travel miles t'o do so.",33
244,Mr HALL,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"C o u l d the pensioners not attend once a month, in any case, if they chose to do so?",34
245,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Certainly ; but, according to the Bill , they have to come once a fortnight for their pension, after it has become due; and the inconvenience of being kept out of a few shillings for a month may be serious.",34
246,Mr BAMFORD,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"But the money could be sent to them, just as the money is paid in the case of boarded-out children.",34
247,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"If that be so, of course my objection is removed.",34
248,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,It is only under exceptional circumstances _that money will be given to others than the pensioners.,34
249,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I think honourable members will gather from my observations.. that I have no desire to raise a number of objections against the Bill . I have dealt with only a few points which occurred to me on a first reading; and I candidly say that to expect honourable members to be able to judge arid criticise a Bill of this character on one perusal is to expect a great deal too much. Having discovered what I did on a mere slight examination, I warn honourable members to be careful as to the conclusions at which they' arrive on the various provisions. There is no object to be gained by passing the Bill at this inconvenient stage of the session, seeing that an appropriation of surplus revenue would do the practical work of keeping ihe money right; and it would be much better to deal with the measure when we meet again in September. But whether we deal with such a measure now or then, it has, as it has had at all previous times, my warmest and most cordial support.",34
250,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Wide Bay) [4.50] The leader of the Opposition has delivered a critical, but very sympathetic, speech on the Bill . As to his last suggestion, I cannot agree that it would be advisable to postpone the consideration or passing of this measure.",34
251,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,That settles it 1,34
252,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I do not think that anything I say here can "" s e t t l e "" anything, seeing that every measure we pass has to be approved of by another place.",34
253,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,It is what the honourable member says outside;.,34
254,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"There are very important and obvious reasons why this Bill should pass at the same time as the Surplus Revenue Bill ; and in the discussion of the latter, we heard a great deal about old-age pensions. It is a pleasure to myself and the members of my party-and , indeed, I should think,' t'o the whole of the members of the Parliament-that we are able to deal with this question at the present time, and, in my opinion, that has only been made possible by the Surplus Revenue Bill . .",34
255,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"If - what is proposed can be done at all, I think it could have been done in 1902, just as well as now.",34
256,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"'Wit h all respect, I prefer to follow the opinion of other legal members, who declare that we had no power to deal with surpluses until practically seven years after the inauguration of the Commonwealth. That is an opinion which I , as a layman, expressed in a previous debate, and, although I was told by one of the leading newspapers of Melbourne that my contention was quite wrong, I find myself supported, as I have said, by eminent legal gentlemen. At any rate, if there has been longer delay in introducing such a measure than we could have wished, that is no reason for any further delay; and on that ground I claim the sympathy and support of the leader of the Opposition. ' It is a pleasure to know that Australian Parliaments have been the first to pass measures of the kin'd. In England, .less than two years ago, the Government appointed 'a Royal Commission of able men to inquire into the question, and a majority report condemned old-age pensions as we understand them. Tlowever, the only effect has been to arouse feeling and discussion in Great Britain to such an extent that the present Prime Minister has introduced an Old-age Pensions Bill .",34
257,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Old-ag e pensions are much more difficult there than here. - Mr FISHER - I agree with that observation; but the fact shows the development of public thought' on the question; and no greater compliment - was ever paid to the self-governing possessions of Great Britain. The most responsible men in the United Kingdom, including, as I "" say, the Prime Minister himself, have introduced a measure which, though not so liberal as ours, is practically on the same ""lines. Our Bill is not so liberal as I should like to see it. It is only we are trammelled by financial obligations and tied by the dead hand of the Constitution that I am prepared to accept this Bill .",34
258,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Not the dead hand of the Constitution. The Constitution will live for ever.,35
259,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,I disagree with the right honourable member. Happily the Constitution is so framed that it may be amended by the people from time to time.,35
260,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,- I think that I had a lot to do with that.,35
261,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I am glad that it is so framed, and that it may be amended from time to time by the people in order that it may keep ""step with their intelligence and enlightenment. It is a matter for congratulation that of Parliaments has seen fit, in respect to old-age pensions, to copy the example of her progeny in Australia, and that, although this Bill is not all that I or the party with which I am associated would like it to be, it is an advance upon any legislation of the kind passed in any other part of the world. When the opportunity offers we shall be able to extend its principles.",35
262,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Has the Bill been submitted to the honourable member's party for its approval?,35
263,Mr HALL,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,When the right honourable member was Treasurer did he ever submit a Bill to our party?,35
264,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,The right honourable member was a member of a Cabinet which received from the Labour Party the same support as it has extended to the present Government.,35
265,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,I have simply asked a civil question.,35
266,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,I have said before that on no occasion have I attempted to coerce the Government or any member of it to do anything that would be unbecoming to gentlemen of honour.,35
267,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,The honourable member will not answer the question put by the right honourable member for Swan.,35
268,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"There are ouestions which ought not to be answered. take no part in passing a measure which 1 thought was likely to be impracticable. As time passes amendments of this Bill will be demanded to meet the views of the majority of the people, and I am confident that it will be amended from time to time as the people.become more enlightened and better educated on this question. It is because not long since I , as a member of a State Parliament, found that it was most difficult to obtain anything like a reasonable vote on the principle of old-age pensions. What a change has come over the situation within a few years ! Practically every member of this Parliament today is. agreed upon the principle, and when one attempts to debate it one is met with the inquiry on all hands, "" Why waste time?"" What has brought about this change? Is it not due to the better education* of the people on this (question? Parliament, after all, is only a reflex of the opinion of the people. The people believe in this principle, and will from time to time demand that it shall be extended. I was glad to hear the leader of the Opthe mother position say that the Bill would convey no taint of pauperism to the recipients of a pension under it . Others may take a different view. It may be possible to make it even freer than it is from any suspicion of that taint, and I think that we shall be able to do so when we are financially free ; but the call which it will make on our finances will be as full as we can reason- . ably hope to meet when it comes into operation. I come now to what, from my point of view, is a very important matter-the fact that the Bill is to come into operation not later than ist July, 1909. That is a mandatory provision. At the same time, there is a proviso that if arrangements can be made to bring it into operation before July, 1909, the Government may by executive act do so.",35
269,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Has the honourable member any ground for anticipating that on ist July, 1909, there will be £1,500,00 0 available to meet the payment of pensions for the succeeding twelve months?",35
270,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Yes .,35
271,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Not on that date.,35
272,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"In my view, as the result of good government and the careful husbanding of our finances, there will be enough.",35
273,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Even if we provide £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 for coastal defence purposes?",35
274,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"M v estimate is that, by I would that date there should be an accumulation of from 000,000 to ,£1,250,000 for this purpose. When the honourable member interrupted me, I was pointing out that this Bill may come into operation some time before ist July, 1909, and I .sincerely hope that on its passing the Premiers of the - States will have a serious consultation with a view to arriving at an arrangement to enable it to be brought into operation by proclamation at a much earlier date. Premiers of the States have the matter in their own bands, and even if the Bill is brought into operation before July, 1909, the States will not be more embarrassed than they would otherwise be.",35
275,Mr SAMPSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Does not the honourable member think that we ought to be able, by Act of Parliament, to shut them up in a room and keep them there t ill they come to an arrangement?",36
276,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I have never referred to the Premiers of States save in terms of the utmost courtesy. I recognise that are the chief representatives of their several States, and supreme within their own provinces. At the same time, I agree with the leader of the Opposition that they have taken a short-sighted and misguided view of this situation.",36
277,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I should like the honourable member to explain why he thinks so. . Mr FISHER - The New South Wales, Victorian,. and Queensland Parliaments have passed Old-age Pensions Bills.",36
278,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Queenslan d vet paving old-age pensions.,36
279,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"The Oueensland Parliament has passed an Old-age Pensions Bill which will come into operation on ist July next, and the provisions of that measure will bei honoured. Thus in three of the States, representing nearly seveneighths of the people of Australia, old-age pensions are being paid except to old people who, having passed from one State to another, are unable to comply with the residential qualification.",36
280,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Are there many - so situated?,36
281,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,A great many. T agree with the view expressed by the late Sir George Grey that even if only one person were suffering an injustice which - could be remedied by legislation that legislation should be passed.,36
282,Mr HALL,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Nearl y all the old people in Western Australia are so disqualified.,36
283,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"There are many thousands of old people who have not the residential qualification required under the States Acts, and I hold that the Parliament which can deal in the most effective and just manner with the whole system should take it in hand. The Premiers of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland may agree to allow the Commonwealth to retain out of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue returnable The to those States sums equivalent to the amounts they are already paying away in respect of old-age pensions. The Premiers of the other States may also enter dntb an agreement with the Commonwealth Parliament-o r with a Commission if it be found necessary to arbitrate-to finance this scheme without a month's delay.",36
284,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"All that is needed is a little amicable feeling, but Bills of the character of that dealt with last night do not tend to anything of the kind.",36
285,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"No one can complain they of a want of amicable feeling on my part in respect of all the negotiations. I have never complained, nor do I intend, to complain, of the. action of the men at the head of the Governments of the several States.",36
286,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Thos e Who are behind the honourable member are constantly doing so.,36
287,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"On e reason why I am particularly anxious that we should proceed with this measure is that the action of several of our States Parliaments in passing Old-age Pensions Acts has been copied is not by the Imperial Legislature, and that this Parliament, on three different occasions, has been pledged to secure the passing of an Old-age Pensions Bill at the earliest moment. How can we get away from that pledge? How can we, as honest men, decline to carry out our duty? Shortly after I had the honour of being appointed the leader of the Labour Party, I submitted a motion drawing the attention of the Government to the urgent need of a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions. The only one to challenge my action was the honourable member .for Parramatta, who, with a great deal of assurance, said that But there was nothing in it . He declared that it was a mere political placard; and that whilst the members of our party pretended to be in deadly earnest we were not. Experience has falsified that assertion. Within six weeks after the passing of that motion an Old-age Pensions Bill .has been presented to the House. That Bill meets with the concurrence, I believe, of honourable members generally, and in some respects is more advanced that any legislaexplained tion of the kind ever passed.",36
288,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"A better scheme was put forward 100 years ago. . Mr FISHER - We are told that there is nothing new under the sun. intend to debate the main question, since, like the leaderof the Opposition, I think that it would be a mere waste of time to do so. But I feel called upon to say that we as a party have justified the action which' we took in pressing upon the GoAlthough vernment the urgency of the question. I congratulate the Ministry on. having, at earliest possible moment introduced this measure. I trust that it will be passed this session, because, if we are to have, as paid. we ought to have, a sympathetic administrato tion, no time should be lost in placing this Bill on the - statute-book, so that Bary machinery may be got ready for action. It will be of the greatest importance to secure the sympathetic administration this measure, and if there is want of pathy in administration while I have the honour of a seat in this House, I shall lenge the Government responsible for it. acknowledge the force of some of the critimonwealth cisms of the leader of the Opposition, and although the provisions of the Bill may lay the recipients of pensions open to taunts, sympathetic, administration can provide the payments to be made in such a way that pensions are paid should vary. the recipients will feel that they are ceiving, not a dole, but something in the nature of a retiring allowance. The . ing of the preamble of the first New South Wales Act, outlining its purpose, is not merely significant and proper, but, in my opinion, beautifulI t is equitable that deserving persons during the prime of life have helped to bear the public burdens of the Colony by payment of taxes and to open up its resources by labour and skill should receive a pension in their old-age pensions. old age. Those words express very beautifully what we have in our minds, and. if the adminisjustifiable tration is in sympathy with our desires, one can complain that the receipt pf a sion subjects him to reproach.",37
289,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,The officials can administer only as we provide.,37
290,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Yes ; but the adminis2 tration of any measure may be sympathetic tion- a total of £1,580,000. or it may be hostile. I hope that an.arcording rangement will be come to with the States Governments which will enable the Comhas monwealth to pay pensions within a few months after the Bill is passed. I have in detail how that can be brought about.",37
291,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,We shall meet the obligation unless there is an earthquake.,37
292,Mr REID,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Does the Treasurer refer to I do not a recent occurrence?,37
293,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"In speaking to an amendment which was recently carried on my motion, I said that the whole resources of the Commonwealth were at the command of the Treasurer to pay old-age pensions. I supported the Bill for the appropriation of certain revenues for this purthe pose, I do not rest my case on it. The Treasurer has the whole resources of the Commonwealth, and these pensions must be I am thankful that we are so near the-enactment of this measure, which I trust and believe will receive the unanimous the necessupport of honourable members.",37
294,Mr KNOX,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Kooyong) [5.19] - I listened with great attention to the speeches of of the three honourable members who presymceded me, whose sympathetic tones are, I am sure, echoed by every honourable memchalber. From my first election to this House I 1I have declared myself in favour of a Comold-age pensions scheme. It has seemed to me inconsistent that the citizens of some of the States should be entitled to old-age pensions while others are not, and for that the - conditions under which old-age I am, retherefore, glad that the Bill has been introduced, particularly since its provisions wordin the main adopt the unanimous recommendations of the Royal Commission which investigated the subject. Without wishing to show disrespect to the other Royal Commissions which have been appointed under who Federation, I say that none did its work more carefully, or gave a more thoughtful consideration to all the phases of its subtheir ject, than did the Royal Commissionon At the same time, I recognise that the manner in which this Bill has been presented cannot be regarded as i or the time at which it is introno duced as opportune, except by those who penare prepared to take great risks. It has been stated that for the payment of old-age pensions under a Commonwealth system £1,550,000 will be needed, together with per cent, to cover the cost of administraBut, acto the excellent work of the Commonwealth Statistician, which, I am sure, been read with interest and edification by honourable members, about 4 per cent, of the population is sixty-five years of age or over, and of that proportion 40 per cent, is eligible for old-age pensions. On the basis of the census of 1901, and the computations as to increase since, there are now 168,000 persons eligible for old-age pensions, and I have calculated that, to meet their claims and cost of administration, about £ 1 , 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 will be required. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - Without ing provision for invalid pensions?",37
295,Mr KNOX,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Yes . As this charity dole, many persons who would not take charity will probably feel entitled apply for pensions. Taking the South Wales experience, 2 per cent, is very conservative estimate of the cost administration, especially as it is proposed to distribute the money every fortnight. am favourable to a fortnightly distribution, however, and hope that an arrangement will be made whereby the pensions will paid through the Post Office with the least trouble to those who are to receive them. At the present time the Postal Department is .considerably overweighted, and, doubt, the staff will have to be increased; but if this increase and other charges less than 2 per cent, on the sum distriCommonwealth. buted, the administration will not be portionately dear. Some time leader of the Labour Party took the busientitled ness of the House out of the hands of Government, and moved a motion directing Ministers to bring in this Bill . He points out that within six weeks, notwithbeing standing the lateness of the session, Surplus Revenue Bill and this Bill been introduced to do what was demanded.",38
296,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,I said that I impressed underlying our national aspirations. on Parliament the urgency of the matter.,38
297,Mr KNOX,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"At any rate, those who on the front Ministerial benchaccepted their instructions. I submit that, notwiththe standing our desire to give effect to a Federal scheme of old age pensions, we are at the present stage taking a most unbusiness-like step. Surely before mitting a Bill of this character we ought to have had an authoritative statement of our financial position. To me it ' been a matter of surprise that the States Premiers have not recognised that the question of old-age pensions was with which they might have dealt at the various Conferences which'they have held. It is a difficulty which they might assisted the Commonwealth to solve. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - It was dealt with at the Hobart Conference of Premiers.",38
298,Mr KNOX,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"But no satisfactory conclusion was arrived at. Surely a scheme involving an expenditure of £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 should have formed part of the question of the financial relations of the States to' the Commonwealth, which we should consider as a whole. With these new proposals we are practically expending our full onemakfourth share of the net Customs and k Excise revenue, and honourable members is not a know that there are many urgent undertakings for which financial provision must to yet be made. If it is contended that that New financial provision must be made out of a revenue, I hope that the public will unof derstand that our share of the Customs - revenue will not be sufficient. It has I been hinted that if no agreement be arrived at with the States Governments before the end of 1910, we shall then encroach upon be the' three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue to which ""the States are at present constitutionally entitled. But I would point' out that it is just as imno portant - that we should safeguard the financial interests of the States as it is cost that we 'should safeguard those of the I do not suggest for a promoment that the necessities of the Comback the monwealth should be ignored. We are fo expect that the electors will the provide this Parliament with the necessary funds to enable it to discharge its now justresponsibilities. But I protest against asked to consider a great' financial the question at the close of a session when have we have not a fair opportunity of ascertaining its effect upon the whole policy So far as this Commonwealth expenditure is sit concerned, the States Premiers have not very serious cause of complaint, because question has been a live one for some years past, and they have not in this regard co-operated with the Commonwealth in the : way which might have been expected of subthem. I think that the fault of the Commonwealth Treasurers has been that they have met the States Treasurers from time to time has with a cut-and-dried financial scheme which they have asked them fo either accept or reject. In this connection honorone able members will recollect that a few years ago I suggested that it was desirable that accredited representatives of the have States and of the Commonwealth should meet to formulate a scheme for the adjustment of our future financial relations. Such a gathering might have solved many of the difficult problems with which we are confronted. But, owing to the delay which has occurred, the time has passed when we can deliberately consider the taking over of the States debts in conjunction with the revenue of the Commonwealth. These two questions will now have to be separately considered. longer their consideration is delayed the more complicated will they become. agree with the suggestion of the leader of the Opposition-wh o is in full sympathy with this Bill-that it would be wise to withhold it until such time as the Premiers again meet in conference. A solution of the financial problem might then have been arrived at.",38
299,Mr BAMFORD,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,The Premiers will hold another Conference before this Bill becomes operative.,39
300,Mr KNOX,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I am aware that they propose to meet at the beginning of next year. But I would suggest that the next Conference ought to be held at the invitation of the Prime Minister. Then, if some mutually satisfactory arrangement be not arrived at, the Commonwealth would, to an extent, be relieved of responsibility for the resulting position of affairs. It is only right that provision should be made for those who have assisted to build up this country, and who have fallen upon bad times. The proposals of the Bill follow very much the recommendations of the Royal Commission which investigated the question of old-age pensions, and therefore commend themselves to me. In Committee one or two suggestions for im- I proving the measure may be made, but upon the whole the provisions of the Bill are such that under better financial circumstances they must have commended themselves to the House. I shall not oppose the second reading of the measure. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [5.38] - I congratulate the Government upon having had the courage to bring forward this Bill instead of deferring action - as some of the members of the Opposition would do-until most of the old persons in Australia who are now suffering have been buried. The question of old-age pensions is not a new one in this Parliament. It was the subject either of the first or second notice of motion given in this House. It is not a question which was brought forward for' the first time during the past month. On the contrary, it bas been perpetually discussed here. Up till 1904 it was before us almost every session. Upon the 9th May, 1901, I gave notice of the following motionThat in the opinion of this House it is desirable, in the interests of the deserving aged poor, that the Government, without any unnecessary delay, formulate a national scheme for the payThe ment of old-age pensions, and that this motion, when carried, be an instruction to the Honourable I theAttorney-General to draft the necessary measure. Upon 2nd August of that year I had the honour to submit that motion. At that time the Barton Government thought the financial position of the Commonwealth would not enable an Old age Pensions Bill to be. placed upon the statute-book. Later on, the question was before the House on several occasions; and in December, 1904, I asked the Prime Minister whether he could set apart a day. for the discussion of this question in. order that some relief might be afforded to the aged poor of the Commonwealth. The Government of the day did not see their way lo grant my request, and subsequently I had the pleasure and honour of movingThat, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable, in the interests of the aged poor, that the Government should, without unnecessary delay, formulate a national scheme for the payment of old-age pensions, and that this motion, when carried, be an instruction to the Attorney General to draft the necessary measure. In submitting that motion I outlined a complete scheme of financing the system, and on page 7115 of Hansard for 1904, that scheme, will be found set out. Then, as reported on page 1296 of Hansard for 9°3> the following question was asked, and the reported answer given",39
301,Mr OMALLEY,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"the Prime Minister, upon notice Whether in view of the large surplus of the Commonwealth revenue, as shown by him yesterday, he will immediately bring in a Bill establishing a system of national old-age pensions?",39
302,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows :The surplus mentioned by the honourable member has been distributed among the several States, as mentioned by me yesterday; and it is believed that without it, embarrassment to their finances would have taken place. Moreover, if the large - sum mentioned could have been withdrawn from the above purpose and applied to the carryingout of a system of old-age pensions, it is more than doubtful whether it would have proved sufficient to pay throughout the Commonwealth pensions on the lines adopted in New South Wales and Victoria. This question of old-age pensions is by no means a new one; but people are now beginning to wake up to its importance. Five years ago, if the Labour Party had received assistance in placing an Old-age Pensions Act on the statute-book, thousands of old, honest, hard-working soldiers of industry who have passed away would, perhaps, have been living now, or would have died surrounded by a few of the comforts of life. However, it is not sary to discuss the matter further-old-ag e pensions are accomplished. I do rejoice that some invisible power has spoken to the souls of the lethargic members who have hesitated to help us all these years.",39
303,Mr CROUCH,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"It is the honourable member's Bill . Mr KING O'MALLEY - This reform has been brought about by the Labour Party, of which I am only a unit-that great' party which is eventually to rule the destiny of this country. Can it be pretended that this great country of Australia, with its 4,000,000 of the richest people and most resourceful on earth, with 3,000,000 square miles of territory, and its immense natural wealth, cannot finance an old-age pensions scheme? I am prepared to finance such a scheme if honourable members will help me to institute a national postal banking system, the profit's of which throughout Australia, and at half the rate of interest now charged to the people of the country ",40
304,Mr CROUCH,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"And every pensioner depositor ! Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes . is it that, in Victoria, the cost of administering old-age pensions is year, while in New South Wales it is £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 a year? The explanation solely in good business management in the case of Victoria; and it shows how superior in business capacity Mr Bent' is to those politicians who have been running New South Wales.",40
305,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"In New Wales there is three times the amount pay, and three times the territory to pay over, that there is in Victoria.",40
306,Mr WATKINS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,The present Treasurer introduced the Bill in New South Wales.,40
307,Mr KING OMALLEY,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I look on conversion of the present Treasurer to the old-age pensions policy as one of the greatest the world ever saw. However, in Victoria, those who have the administration utilize whatever facilities offer, whereas in New South Wales the payment of the pensions form? was handed over to a great banking institution, which, of course, required to be well paid. The financing of a Commonwealth old-age pensions scheme would be very simple, with a national postal banking system operated by Australians for the benefit of Australia, utilizing the collective power of the Commonwealth, and acting as a clearing-house to the people of Australia. With such a bank controlling the interests neces- of Commonwealth, States and municipalities, we could not only finance old-age pensions, but successfully manage the business in connection with the public indebtedness. But we have never had the courage to tackle this question of instituting a national bank, and thus get rid of the dominating tyranny of those great institutions which prevent their employees from marrying unless they have £ 2 0 0 a year. Why, the working man marries on £ 4 0 and £ 5 0 a year, and rears sons who run the country. Nearly every prominent man in Australia has risen from the ranks of the poor; as Roosevelt pointed out the other day, the sons of wealthy men are nearly all fools. However, these matters are not worth talking about. I rejoice that we have now reached the time when old-age pensions are assured; and I shall have the greatest pleasure in the world in voting for the Bill.",40

365,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Yes . I said I am of opinion that this question of old-age pensions has not yet become a very pressing one in Australasia, and I am. very glad to be to think that that is the case. There doubt, however, that, as time goes on, we have old and deserving poor here as they have in the older parts of the world. When time does arrive I think it would be far better for us to allow the Federal Government to deal with this very great question rather than that each State should deal with it in its own particular way. At any rate, I am of opinion we should give the Federal Government power to deal with the question in this Constitution. . . I do not believe in one Colony doing the thing in one way, and another Colony doing it in another way. I can see no reason why the Federal Parliament should not deal with the question just as effectively and quickly as a State Parliament. In fact, I think that the Federal Parliament will be able to deal"" with it in a far better and more just way, and for that reason, if it goes to a division, I shall, vote with my honourable friend (Mr Howe). Those of us who voted, like myself, to give the Parliament this power, and who have always been in favour of old-age pensions, should not be subjected, as I was yesterday, because, on constitutional grounds, I opposed the Surplus Revenue Bill , to the gibe of being opposed to the payment of old-age pensions. As I said, I honestly believe the Surplus Revenue Bill to be ultra vires, and a breach of faith, and the Attorney-General recognised the propriety of my criticism. Because one objects to the introduction of a measure that he thinks is unconstitutional, he should not be told that he is opposed to the object which it seeks to achieve.

As the Government's existence depends on the support of the Labour Party, the members of that party are, no doubt, told long before members like myself of what will take place. The action of the Government in rushing the Bill through Parliament deserves the strongest censure. I admit that it is convenient to provide, in regard to a measure of this kind, that it shall not come into force until a date to the be named, because that allows the machinery necessary to carry out its provisions to be prepared and made ready.

369,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,That would not be long enough. I speak from my New South Wales experience.,44
370,Sir JOHNFORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"In New South Wales they had to commence the system from the beginning; we have now the advantage of their experience and also that of Victoria. Were it not that some honourable members are acquainted with the working of legislation of this kind in the States, it would be even more ridiculous to ask us to deal with the Bill at a few hours' notice. The Attorney-General, who, at short notice, owing to a sad bereavement which has befallen the Prime Minister, was intrusted with, the moving of the second reading, made only a short speech, and did not give us the information which we should have in dealing with this matter. To ask us to pass the Bill to-night is an extraordinary demand, seeing that there is no urgency. Probably the Government wishes' to allow' the Labour Party to go to the Brisbane Labour Conference in July and boast of what it has done.",44

393,Unknown,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 - p.m.,45
394,Sir JOHNFORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I now desire - to say a word or two in reference to the financial position of the Commonwealth. I confess that I have not been afforded any opportunity of preparing myself to discuss the question. This Bill has been brought forward without notice, and it seems to be the desire of the Government and their supporters that we should pass it without comment, taking it for granted that everything is right. But I should like to know whether in its preparation the Government have sufficiently considered the financial position of the Commonwealth ""and of the States. It is easy for us to pass Bills which appropriate large sums, but those sums have to be found, and the effect of finding them both upon the Commonwealth and the States requires to be well considered and understood. In that connection we have had nothing placed before us. But apparently a calculation has been made that we shall have a surplus of so much this year and of so much next year, and that the aggregate amount will be sufficient to enable a system of old-age pensions to be inaugurated. But the effect of obtaining that surplus upon the financial position of the States, which, under the Constitution, we are bound to safeguard, has evidently received no attention whatever at the hands of the Government. We have been told that the scheme proposed under this Bill will cost ,£1,500,000 annually. What effect it will have upon the projects to which we stand committed and upon the revenues of the States we have not been told. Further, it seems that the moment any honourable. member dares to advocate the claims of the States he is assailed with the cry that his tude is anti-Federal. He is told that House has nothing whatever to do with States-that the Senate was specially created to safeguard their interests. course such remarks are founded upon . experience and want of knowledge. Those who make them forget that this Chamber has been specially intrusted with the trol of the finances. No expenditure be initiated except by this House. assertion that the Senate has been specially created to look after the interests of States is not founded upon the Constitution. I intend to protect the interests lieved of by the passing of this Bill ? "" of the States as well as those of the monwealth. The question of old-age sions is one which particularly finances of Western Australia. At the present time that State has a considerable deficit on current account, that it will receive no revenue from Customs and Excise for the month of June probably increase that deficit by £ 5 0 or £ 6 0 , 0 0 0. If the-scheme outlined in this of that amount. B i ll costs £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 annually, Australia will be charged £ 1 0 0 , 0 annum to provide old-age pensions-no for her own people, but to a large extent for the residents of other States. not accurate information upon the subject, but I venture to say that under e her expenditure upon old-age pensions will be twice as much as would be required provide for such pensions in that State. Of that we shall not. course honourable members do not ther Western Australia is obliged to more than she would be required to pay for old-age pensions to her own people. They are indifferent as to whether she called upon to pay £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 to old-age pensions for other States. It is generally understood that Western Austrapaying, lia contributes £ 3 12s. per head of population towards the Commonwealth's one-fourth share of the net Customs Excise revenue. At The beginning Federal history, she contributed as much £ 5 per head, whereas the other States tribute only , £ 2 per head.",45
395,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,But the expenas has the western State. diture per head' in the different States being very rapidly equalized.,46
396,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"No doubt the amount payable per head by Western Australia has declined considerably since, the to me inception of Federation, although during the past two years it has remained stationary. But my point is that Western Ausattitralia is contributing .from £ 3 12s. to this £ 3 16s. per head towards the funds used the by the Commonwealth, whereas most of the other States are paying not more than Of £ 2 per head, and Tasmania less than £ 2 inper head. Upon that account the revenue of Western Australia is depleted to a very large extent. Then the expenditure of that conState upon benevolent institutions, both can indoor and outdoor, aggregates . about The £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 annually. Of that sum £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 represents outdoor relief. Now, the questhe tion naturally arises, "" How much of that £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 will Western Australia be reI Comshould like to think that she will be repenlieved to a material extent, but I am affects the afraid that she will not.",46
397,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Sh e will be relieved iri the same proportion as the other and the fact States are relieved.,46
398,Sir JOHNFORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I am aware of will that. I think that possibly Western Aus, 0 0 0 tralia will be relieved of about one-third In that State there is Western a large number of persons who are inmates 0 0 per of benevolent asylums, and who are not t able to look after themselves.",46
399,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I think, that exI have perience will show that we shall not lightenthe expenditure of the States very this Bill much in that direction.",46
400,Sir JOHNFORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I regret to To say that I - am inclined to think I have calculated care whethat we shall reduce the amount by pay one-third, and, therefore, there will still be £ 2 8 , 0 0 0 per annum to pay on account of the present benevolent asylums. This is will bring the expenditure on these asylums provide and old-age pensions up to £[127,000 a not year, which is £ 8 7 , 0 0 0 more than we are at the present time.

401,Mr STORRER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Tasmani a will always' provide for her aged poor.,47
402,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"But under this scheme they will have to provide for the aged poor of other States. Does any one suppose that' the honourable member for Darwin has given this financial aspect of the question much thought? As to the Bill itself, I agree with the leader of the Opposition, that it most objectionable to have to ask a person applying for a pension whether or not he has been imprisoned. At the same time, I remember that, when crossing the Atlantic to America, I had to sign a paper giving similar information, and, further, that, when I was returning from America to Australia, I had, I think at the instance of the New South Wales authorities, to declare that I had not been convicted or imprisoned. Although such - questions are objectionable, this is a matter which we must deal with in a practical, common-sense way. Otherwise, a. man, who had spent' half his life in gaol, might travel to one part of Australia, and there obtain a pension, although, as I understand, this Bill is intended for the aged and deserving poor, and not for gaolbirds. I see that according to clause 21 amongst those not qualified to receive an invalid pension are aliens and Asiatics, or aboriginal natives of Australia, Africa, the Islands of the Pacific, or New Zealand. I think, however, that it is not very easy to define "" As i at i c s "" nowadays - ther e are Asiatics and Asiatics, and it certainlv is not clear what is exactly intended by the clause. In clause 22 it is provided that no person shall receive an invalid pension unlessliis relsitives, namely, father, mother, husband, wife, or children do not either severally or collectively adequately maintain him. I. do not think it is intended that, in cases where an invalid person is maintained by his family, he shall also be able to draw a pension. that if a man is adequately provided for, it is unreasonable that he should also have the benefit of a pension; and, in my - opinion, there ought to be a similar provision in that part of the Bill which deals with old-age pensions only. If a man The is not adequately provided for by his relatives, he can make out a case, and, on the other hand, it would be absurd for a man, who is kept in comfort, or even luxury, to' be able to also claim a pension",47
403,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Such persons would not get a pension under this Bill , because they would already be in receipt of an income.",47

406,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"At present it would seem that what is proposed to be law in the one case will not be law in the other. From the little attention I have been able to give to the Bill , I think that it has been carefully drafted. I hope the idea that the maximum pension is to be only ios. per week will not influence the minds of honourable members; because we must remember that this means an expenditure of £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year. We have many responsibilities ; and I am quite sure that we have not yet found the means to provide old-age pensions. I only hope the Labour Party will not have the administering of this Bill ; because they do not seem to regard the financial aspect of the question seriously.",47

It is an easy matter to agree to all sorts of beneficent proposals so long as one has not to put one's hand in one's own pocket to pay for them. I heard the honourable member for Darwin say this afternoon-and I dare say that it was a mere lapsus linguathat he had known plenty of poor people to go to bed hungry.

427,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"My contention is that we should be at least as careful in is our expenditure of the public funds as we are in dealing with our own money. The right honourable member for East Sydney compared the position of those who receive olci-age pensions with that of the Chief Justice of Great Britain or. the Commander-inChief of the British Army, who, after years of service, retire on a pension. That was very strong language to employ. What is the position of a Chief Justice? He assumes office under a contract with the State that he shall receive a certain salary, and, upon retirement, a certain pension. A definite contract is made, and the"" State observes it - Then, again, let us consider the position of the Commander-in-Chief of a victorious army who returns to his country with the plaudits of a grateful people ringing in his ears-the plaudits of a people grateful to him for having saved their country from danger and possibly from disaster. I would not insult the poor old-age pensioner by comparing his position with that of either a Chief Justice or the Commanderin-Chief of an army. What is the basis' of these pensions? Clause 17, paragraph g, provides that no person shall receive an old-age pension unless he is unable to maintain himself; in otherwords, the pension will be payable only to the aged and deserving poor. An old-age pensioner may be one wfio has worked hard all his lifej who, perhaps, has made and lost a competency, and who, - when the battle of life is almost over, finds it impossible to maintain himself. In such circumstances this humanitarian Bill, effect, says to him on behalf of the monwealth, "" You have been a good citiwe zen ; you have not been able to secure competency for yourself, and we are going to allow you to go unprovided for to eke out a miserable existence in your age. We intend to take care that you shall enjoy at least some comfort during the years that remain to you."" That is what, effect, this Bill declares; but is it not humwith bug to compare the position of this - deservlead atodecreased ing poor man to that of a great warrior has served his country on the battlefield, of a learned Judge who has administered justice for years under a contract' to that on his retirement he shall be granted a pension? Let us deal with this matter as practical men, called upon to face a great national difficulty. It must be a source of regret to every one that in this young land of ours, comprising a vast area and possessing inour finite resources, there should be so many who, after fighting the battle of life, themselves in their old age unable to vide for their needs. One would think that such would not be the experience in this new land in these early days.

Although I can hardly lieve that he will be more self-reliant than a business-like, practical manner. those who have preceded him, I trust that the young Australian will by some means or other be able to avoid becoming a burthinking den, in his old age, upon the country. sincerely trust that he will have good tune, and be able to provide for himself in his declining days. Turning for a mowith ment from the humanitarian side of this Sir John Forrest. great question, I wish to deal briefly with its financial aspect. The honourable member for Flinders showed last night that he had given more thought to that side of the in question than have most honourable members, Comahd he pointed out that two years hence should have a large deficit. Even if a his anticipations are not realized the posinot tion will be serious. It must mean increased taxation, and I fear that even if old we provide, as I am sure we shall be able to do, for the aged poor of the Commonwealth, our co-partners-ou r friends of the in States-and more particularly the smaller States-wil l find themselves face to face revenue. That in turn will who consequent reduction inin expenditure a reduction and a the progress and or development of the public estate of Australia. If the States have not the means develop Australia we shall not be able to do so. The power to carry out great public works, to provide means of transit, and to engage in many undertakings designed to encourage production from the soil, and to establish an industrious people upon the land, is vested in them. If we managed finances successfully only at the cost of bringing disaster upon the States, the posifind tion would be very serious. Personally, I prohave no fear about the future. I have no fear as to the resources ol Australia. I have never been a pessimist, and I hold that we must work out this problem in a practical and business-like way that will It is",48

440,Mr MALONEY,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Melbourne) [8.42] The time for argument in respect of a Bill of this character has passed, and I trust the House will show, by a unanimous vote, that when a measure involving humanitarian interests is under consideration, there room for any exhibition of party feeling. I very much regret the speech of the honfive orable member for Flinders, which concation, sisted entirely of arguments in favour delay. He desires action in connection with a Federal system of old-age pensions to be deferred until the financial relations the Commonwealth and the States have been determined. If we wait, till then before doing anything, we shall wait till the kalends. Similarly, the right honourable member for Swan argued for delay. challenged one statement which he made reference to a friend of mine, who is member of this House; and upon whose words he had placed a wrong construction. I can assure the right honourable member that the honourable member for Darwin good a man as any in this House, and I am perfectly certain he would not allow even a four-footed creature to go hungry if he could prevent it. Again, the right honourable member was in error in declaring that only members of the Labour Party crying out on behalf of the poor. From experience gained by leading the unemsideration ployed over a period of ten years, I know that men and women of wealth contribute to every one of the unemployed movements. But my reply to his statement that most of the funds come from the rich, is that the widow's mite weighs heavier the millionaire's gold. If he will Booth's work upon the masses of London, he will know that Mulhall's statistics that every year 200 persons .die of starvaaged tion in London alone. In Ireland, during 1879, no less than 3,700 persons perished .from absolute starvation, according to the verdicts returned at coroners' inquests. In this connection, I may, perhaps, be pardoned for quoting the words of Professor sesPepper-he , who won more gold medals than any other man at the London Univerf a man is so starved that recovery 'is hopebut in staggering along a street he picked up a cabbage stump or any like refuse and eat that would be found in the stomach, and the death would be said to be by want and privation, by starvation. When a verdict of death by starvation is recorded, no food must be found in the inConsequently, if we included those who die from actual want and privation, they would number thousands. I also take exception to the remarks of the right that honourable member for Swan, in reference to paragraph c, of clause 17. That provision declares that no person shall receive is no an old-age pension unless he is of good character, and is, and has been, for the 5'ears immediately preceding his applileading a temperate and reputable of life. I take the same view of that aspect of the question as I did when the Old-age Pensions Bill was before the Victorian Parof liament. Of the dead, it is said we should speak nothing but good. But I say that, before speaking good of the dead,' we Greek should speak the truth. I have in my mind's eye two men, one of whom-Si r I Andrew Clarke - for three years eight in months and nine days' work here drew a a pension totalling £22,327 7s. 7d. If an old-age pension is not to be granted"" to a man who drinks, let us also deny it to the pensioner who draws £ 2 0 is as a week. . However, I am prepared to accept the Bill as it stands. It has always been my practice, if I could not obtain a whole loaf, to take a bun. I have read every Old-age Pensions Bill that has been introduced into European Legislatures, are and, speaking from memory, I know of no an measure which can equal that under confrom the stand-point of the splendid principles which it enunciates. I take it that every honourable member will have a special interest in this Bill, and I hope that the decision of the House in regard to it will be unanimous. The other than case of pension which I had in my study mind's eye was that of Mr C. E. Childers, who drew a pension aggregating snow £17,288 16s. 9d. Whilst in London, an Australian couple waited upon him, and he told them that he had nothing more to do with Australia. Had I known that at the time, I should have published the fact in the London newspapers. We had nothing to thank him for. Why do I object to the arguments which have been advanced in favour of delay? I will tea honourable members. On ioth of January, 1898, Ann Kent, 90 years of age, was sentenced to three months' imprisonment because she was Christ-like in her poverty. According to the Argus, of the n t h of April, of another year, Ann Davis, 74. years, was similarly sentenced, and she had already served a year in gaol. I may also recall, as indicating the poverty which exists, what used to be known as the "" 8 o'clock rush,"" in Bourke-street, when a Portuguese- a splendid native of Portugal - use d to feed over forty men nightly. I may add that the Victorian Government did not even pay him the compliment of making him a magistrate. I also recollect the case of an old lady whom 1 found in front of my door, in West Melbourne. She was' 78 years of age, and'had been in Australia for forty-nine years - She had applied to the Ladies' Benevolent Society for assistance. I believe that there are some of God's own women identified with that society, but, at the same time, there are women belonging to the ""other f e l l o w "" associated with Unfortunately, I came across some of them. This woman was sent from one lady to another t ill no less than thirteen messages had passed respecting her, and, with the exception of one lady, the distressed old creature was not asked whether she had had a meal or possessed a tram fare. After all these negotiations,, what did this Benevolent Society give? The magnificent sum of is. 6d. per week. However, it was an instance in which the poor helped the poor. A room was provided for the old woman in addition to food- I will not say by whom - She died in the Melbourne Hospital, murmuring her thanks to the one good woman who had assisted her. It is these circumstances which cause me to resent the suggestion of delay. I would further point out to the right honourable member for Swan that if we would only provide more money to keep men honest we should not have so many in gaol. According to the Year-Book for 1893, the cost of the maintenance, of a prisoner in Pentridge is £ 5 6 a year, and his earnings represent about £ 2 6 , thus leaving a loss of, approximately, £ 3 0 per annum, or considerably more than we propose to grant as an old-age pension under this Bill . Perhaps the right honourable member is not aware that in England 1,300,000 persons never know where they will obtain the next meal or the next night's bed.",51
441,Mr HEDGES,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"If one gave many of them the price of a meal in the morning, they would spend it in drink before lunchtime.",52
442,Mr MALONEY,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I dare say the honourable member speaks from his own experience, and I can only pity him. But the great majority of people are God's people, and it is their surroundings which make for misery. In the great city of London, one person out of five dies in a lunatic asylum or other public institution, and yet the British nation votes £80,000,000 a year for war armament. Can there be a more pathetic story than that told by a Sundayschool teacher about the little child who, when given a card or map to hang up in its home, said, "" We have not a wall "" ? When inquiries were made it was found that the poor little mite belonged to the family that slept in the middle of the room, the four corners having each its family. To blame God for poverty is blasphemy-povert y is caused only by the injustice of the laws. Burns' words ought to be written over the door of every school, "" Man's inhumanity it . to man makes countless thousands mourn."" I should like to read the following extract from the London Daily M a i l STARVING GUESTS. THE EAST END "" LORD MAYOR'S "" BANQUET. A little girl of ten, pallid-faced, but happy, . stood up in the Great Assembly Hall in Mile End Road at seven o'clock last evening' and gravely announced to as many of a huge gathering as could hear her : "" I am quite full . "" She was hastily pulled into her seat and reproved by her mother. But the men and women around only smiled at the mother's correction, for they guessed it was the first meal the little girl had had that day; and they knew quite well it was the day's first meal for the mother. A good many of those around were in the same position, and they knew the symptoms. It was the East End Lord Mayor's Feast for the out-of-work poor. The Great Assembly Hall had its floor and its galleries 'packed with poor people glad of a meal. There were 2,500 of them altogether; and, with the light and warmth and food together, they were in the seventh heaven. Outside on the pavement marshalled by police, were a thousand more all hungry, but without the. lucky ticket of admission. They stood there in stolid, hungry misery, men, women, and children, watching their fortunate neighbours go into the feast, and each one hoping against hope that there might be a vacant place. Each year, on November g, Mr F. N . Char- rington organises a feast for the poor, the funds for which are generally provided, as they were this year, by the new Lord Mayor and the - Sheriffs. Here is the menu of the East End "" Lord Mayor's Feast"" :-On e meat pie. one cake, one small loaf, two apples, unlimited tea. And remember that this chance arises once a year. There were no plates and no knives and forks at this banquet. The apples, the bread, the cake, and the pie were all put together in a want. paper bag, and the bag was then handed to - guest. Some of the people had - had nothing to eat for twenty-four hours. They began open their bags in .some cases before they Teached their seats. But if there was a disregard of manners, were also deeds of; heroic self-repression self-sacrifice. One thin-faced workman under pressure, admitted that his last meal was taken some time on the previous day, ate a quarter of his meat pie and put the remainder back in the bag with the other things. .got a wife and seven little ones at home,""said. One middle-aged woman, with high cheekbones, was clasping the bag of food tightly to an alms-house. - her breast, untouched. She drank the tea was given, but ate nothing.

I don't want any I tell you, I ain't hungry."" It was found out afterwards that she had little children at home and an out-of-work husband. There were scores of similar cases. Yet in face of such facts we are asked to pass delay old-age pensions. If there be sacred rights of property, then more sacred are duties of property, and still more sacred the rights of human life. land, with its countless millions of acres, European countries. land should be so free that human beings may rest on it ; and that is one son why we are prepared to accept this Bill , New Zealand-. although it may not be perfect. who mav take exception to the provision for invalid pensions, I may point to the of a man who. at works in Footscray, sufwish fered arsenical poisoning through working amongst iron pvrites, and also to a statetraversing ment in the British Lancet that, in a certain trade in England, the average working l is only seven years, and that the women work in it never, bear a child again-tha those workmen and workwomen who wash themselves with water are, as it were, pockconvinced marked by the action of the acid.",52

445,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Parramatta) [9.7] - This is one of those great humaniup tarian questions which, when under discussion in any House of Legislature in any part of the world, always hushes to peace warring party factions. I do not propose to yield to the temptation offered leader of the Labour Party in his gibe concerning my action .a few weeks ago; the support honourable member is ouite welcome to make what he likes out of that occurrence, cause the records are there to stand themselves. I should like to say that I do has been passed in Australia. not think we need discuss the question whether Australia can afford to pay old-age vein of charity. pensions; it does not matter what our system is, or what is the law of property, in connection with a question like that under discussion. We may well leave these proinsurers blems for some other time. I listened with some pleasure to the honourable member Swan, but I think he rather marred the effect by his criticism of the leader Opposition. Why the right honourable member should go out of his way to strong language he did, I cannot underas stand. The leader of the Opposition, informed, made some reference to the fact that the receipt of these old-age pensions was as much an honour, as was the receipt of a pension by a Chief Justice; and that be the statement to which such excepdustrial tion is taken, I have not the slightest tation in associating myself with it. know of no more meritorious heroism, I say, than that which is practised in the men in all civilized communities. lower ranks of industrials in Australia elsewhere. The real heroism of ' l if presented by those men with large families, who have to deny themselves from the ginning to the end of their career, into maintain themselves and their dependants in tolerable decency and comfort; and I venture to say that hereafter, when account is taken of all things human, those men, who, day by day, are undergoing At the these privations and sufferings-thes e mental tortures-wil l be found a high place amongst the heroes of the race. Such men ought to receive pensions from the State. They have earned them just as honourably and are just as much entitled to them as the highest in the land. I - make that statement without the slightest hesitation, and hope that the day will never come in our democratic Australia when any other sentiment will prevail. I do not regard old-age pensions as charities in the slightest degree. I regard them as the merest modicum of justice meted out to men who, during a long and honourable career, have tried to build the industrial life of the community.",54
446,Mr KELLY,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,But apart from the general our question of old-age pensions does not the honourable member think that this Bill is by the something in the nature of a dole?,54
447,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Whil e I shall this Bill most cordially so far as it goes, I want to say at once that I do not bemuch like its character or that of for any other Old-age Pensions Bill which There runs through them too much of the 1 do not approve land of sucb a notion. I rather look upon an old-age pension system in the light of a national scheme of insurance, in which the are all men who contribute to the upbuilding of the country, and the insured for those who - need money and take it in the shape of pensions. That is the broad view of the I take. I regard old-age pensions very much as a form of national annuity given use the to men who are entitled to demand it a right, and not as an act.of mercy or I am charity. That is the only real basis on which the system can rest.. In considering this matter I dismiss from my mind the question of doling out pittances to keep alive what may be called human derelicts if who have fallen by the wayside in our instruggles. The tragedies of life hesiconsist of those cases where a man's overT refinement results in his becoming indigent. shall There are scores, nay thousands, of such The and higher the degree of civilizatidr? the more e is resuch cases multiply. We find thousands of men, over refined, over sensitive, overbestrung, and therefore unable to get that order rude grip of life that will enable them to fill an honourable career in the community known. as, say, labourers. Those are the tranext gedies of life-me n who, because of us their texture, shrink from the rude contact with the world which is necesafraid sary to enable them to meet fully their ligations and responsibilities. Such cases are in no degree to be associated with charity. It is the right of such men human beings-in many cases highly deimportanceveloped and sensitive human beings-to come and ask that they may not fret out their old age without the bare necessaries of life. As to our being able to finance old-age pensions, I do not think we ought to discuss that question for one minute cept in so far as the immediate financial arrangements are concerned. I think that with our thousand millions of national wealth, with our national income averaging as I believe it does, over £204 per and our aggregate property averaging as it does, I believe, from £1,100 to per family, there is no need to discuss phase of the question. With these figures at one's finger ends, with the knowledge that our national production - represents £150,000,006 per. annum, and our comrespect merce £120,000,000 to £130,000,000 per annum,, we can have no doubt as to the ability of the nation to provide these sions for all who are compelled to take them. But that does not take us away being from the immediate financial arrangements which have to be made in order to put this scheme upon a sound and lasting basis. Those who try to burke those arrangements and to leave them to the future to unravel are no friends of the old-age pension system. When we are called upon to deal with a large national question like this ought to have - some definite arrangement to the fund from which the scheme is to bp financed. And moreover, it seems to me that three-fourths of all the occasions when we should be discussing a question of this kind the present is the most inopportune. For six or seven point. years we have had booming surpluses which we have not known how to spend, and we have been returning them to States to inflate their revenues. The venues of my own State in particular have been swollen in that way to a degree which I think is positively wrong, having rjegard to the position of the taxpayers of the community. All 'these booming vears of venue have been allowed to go by, and we are now called upon to consider this quesarrangement tion in the first year of straitened financial circumstances that the Commonwealth - Mr Joseph Cook. What are the prospects? The year or two I venture to say will find with our finances still more straitened. Our revenues have already fallen, and I am that they are destined to fall in the obimmediate future. This year we are spending up to the limits of our possibilities. And this is the time we have selected for as financing a national scheme of supreme a scheme that goes fo the very root of our obligations of citizenship. Then again, the time is inappropriate and inopportune for another reason. Already in Australia three States are paying old-age pensions. When one looks into the figures exclosely one finds that we have a population of 4,197,000, of whom 3,358,000 are living under old-age pension conditions.",54
448,Mr MATHEWS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Do not disgrace the name of old-age pensions By saying that family, Victoria has such a scheme. £1,200 - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - It has none the that less an old-age pension system.",55
449,Mr CROUCH,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,And a very valuable one.,55
450,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I think so. At all events, Victoria is. better off in that than the other States which have none. We find that 3,358,000 people in Australia are already living under old-age penpension conditions, and that only 838,000 are at present outside the range. That so, we are going deliberately to incur a financial responsibility amounting to £1,750,000 per annum to provide old-age pensions for three States with only 838,000 of the population of Australia.",55
451,Mr WEBSTER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,How can it be said that we shall incur that expenditure when already a very large sum is being paid by we the States by way of old-age pensionsas a sum which we shall deduct from the venue of Customs and Excise rereturnable to them?,55
452,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"That is the We are not entitled under our present financial arrangements with the States to deduct one penny. Here is the the anomaly of the whole position: That rewhereas £1,000,000 a year is already being paid by the States for old-age pensions, we are going to duplicate that system, so far as thefinancial arrangements are concerned, over three-fourths of the rewhole of the population of Australia. Does not that point to the wisdom of some being arrived at between the States and the Commonwealth before this has scheme becomes the law of the land?",55
453,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,The honourable member would not object to the Bill being passed to enable arrangements to be made?,56
454,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,I am not going to object to anything in this Bill . Government must be responsible for ever defects it has. I am going port the principle of old-age pensions.,56
455,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"And also the recognition of that principle by Statute? Mr. JOSEPH 'COOK - That follows. Now that' we have taken the work in we' must see it through. I am pointing out, however, how unfortunate it is that do so. we have to take it in hand without some arrangement being first made between ' States and the Commonwealth. Is it not strange also-and I cannot help feeling that some one must take the responsibility for this condition of things-that just when we are on the point of enacting measure like this-jus t when we most need to have amicable relations with States-ther e should be a degree of tation greater than has ever been known in the history of Federation. It is under best spirit. such conditions, and at such a time, that we choose to bring forward this scheme. It sets out on its career under circumhand. stances calculated to prejudice it ; under circumstances calculated to retard its fulness. I hope that it will triumph over those obstacles, become the law of the land, and meet the condition of things with which we desire to deal. reason for a Federal old-age pensions tem.

If they do not let us take over their debts, I am afraid before very long we shall have spent the necessary money to pay the interest. We shall certainly spend it if the present Treasurer remains in power. The States, instead of regarding us' as wishing to trench upon their rights and to take away their privileges, should be ready to make any fair arrangement in regard to the debts, since in the near future this Parliament will have sole control of the revenue from Customs and Excise.",56

470,Mr HEDGES,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Fremantle) [9-34]-- I am not opposed to the Bill , and have, on several occasions, expressed myself in favour of the payment of pensions to the indigent aged. So far back as September last I told the House what stand I would take in regard to a measure of this kind. I think, however, that we should have had at least two or three days in which to study the Bill . Some proper means should have been devised to meet the heavy expense which will be incurred in paying the proposed pensions. Our present system of finance will not quite suit the requirements preof the Bill . The sum needed will be much larger than probably many honourable memcosts. bers realise. We ought to have created what might-have been called an Australian to provident fund, to which all could have seem contributed small amounts out of their No doubt, nearly , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 will be needed to pay the proon posed pensions, because many persons will sink claim pensions who would not ask for to charity. I think the suggestion of the honourable member for East Sydney, that the pensions should be paid monthly, in advance, is a splendid one, and I agree with of the honourable member for Kooyong, that States Premiers should have acted in right this matter - No doubt they would have acted had they received, encouragement; but they have been treated all along as enemies of) the Commonwealth.

474,Mr TUDOR,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,What has Western Australia expended upon them?,58
475,Mr HEDGES,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I will tell the honourable member presently. From the statements which have been made in this House, one would think that the aged poor receive consideration only in New South Wales and Victoria. That is not so. To my own knowledge, the sum of from - £ 3 > ° ° o to £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 has been expended 0 by the Western Australian Government during the past two years in an endeavour to make these persons comfortable. One charitable institution, which occupies a beautiful site on the banks of the Swan River, contains 332 inmates, and its conduct by the State authorities involves an annual expenditure of £ 1 0 , 0 0 0. male inmates enjoy the utmost freedom. Boats have been placed at their disposal, ancl they are practically at liberty to go where they may please. Clause 46 of this Bill readsI f a successful claimant of a pension is an inmate of a benevolent asylum, or other charitable institution, the pension shall become payable as from a date not more than twenty-eight days prior to the pensioner being discharged from or leaving the'asylum or institution, but no payment on account of pension shall be made to him so long as he is an inmate of Ihe asylum or institution. To my mind, the States Governments which provide for the maintenance of these institutions are entitled to receive an amount equivalent to the pensions which would become payable to the inmates upon their discharge. Surely we shall not ask the States to turn these creatures out upon the mercy of the world ? In the institution located upon the banks of the Swan the inmates are provided with every possible comfort.",58
476,Mr CROUCH,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Is the honourable member referring to a State institution?,58
477,Mr HEDGES,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Yes . The right honourable member for Swan was unjustly taunted by the honourable member for Melbourne with not being in favour of old-age pensions. May I point out to him that this very institution was established at the instance of the right honourable member for [424] Swan ? The average cost of each inmate is £ 2 4 12s. 6d. per annum, or 9s. a$d. per week. That approximates closely to the amount of the pension which is con'templated under this Bill . In my opinion, the honourable member for Melbourne was grossly unfair in his references to the right As a honourable member for Swan. In the Federal Convention, I find that the latter supported the inclusion of old-age pensions in the thirty-nine subjects upon which the Commonwealth is empowered to legislate. The matter was brought forward by the Honourable J. H . Howe, of South Australia. Why did .the honourable member for Melbourne talk to the gallery, and why did he attempt to depreciate the work of the right honourable member for Swan ?",58
478,Mr KING OMALLEY,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,He did not.,58
479,Mr HEDGES,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,My ears are just as good as those of the honourable member. The honourable member for Melbourne should remember that others in the world besides himself have performed kind acts.,58

By incurring an expenditure of £2,000,000 in connection with the old-age pensions scheme proposed under this Bill we are.assuming a responsibility which is equivalent to increasing our national indebtedness by £50,000,000 at 4 per cent.",58
484,Mr THOMAS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Is the honourable member opposed to the scheme ?,59
485,Mr HEDGES,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"N p ; I am in favour of it. But I contend that we have not devised the right means of collecting the money with which to defray its cost'. We cannot afford to take the necessary funds for the purpose out of revenue. that in a very few years we shall find ourselves in serious difficulty in attempting to finance the undertakings to which we are committed, especially if we take over the Northern Territory and go in for a scheme pf naval defence.",59
486,Mr WEBSTER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,How does the honourable member suggest that the scheme should be financed ?,59
487,Mr HEDGES,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I told the House several months ago that it should be done by means of a provident fund. If we have in Australia 1,600,000 persons who are earning their livelihood, surely it would not hurt them to contribute 6d. each per week to such a fund ? That would provide more than sufficient money to pay these pensions. It would encourage our people to be thrifty instead of inducing the feeling that, no matter how they may. squander their substance when they are young, they will be provided for when they are old. that the day will come when honourable members will acknowledge that we should have devised some sounder means of financing this scheme. I support the Bill , but, while we are on the right track in providing for the old people, I think we are on the wrong track so far as the financial proposals are concerned.",59
488,Mr THOMAS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Barrier) [9.56] - I desire to congratulate the Government on the introduction of this Bill , which, of its kind, is one of the best, if not, probably, the best old-age pensions scheme in the world. Personally, however, I am sorry that the Government and Parliament have not been courageous enough to afford an opportunity today for the discussion of an old-age pensions scheme in the truest and best sense of the word. The leader of the Opposition, in the course of his remarks, expressed a view which, I think, is shared by us all., namely, that there ought not to be the slightest element of charity in connection with the scheme. I venture to say, however, that, unless old-age pensions be made universal-unles s they apply to rich and poor alike-ther e must be a tinge of charity.",59
489,Mr WH IRVINE,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,What would be the estimated cost in that case?,59
490,Mr THOMAS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Eve n if the cost were £ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 or £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, the money would be here.",59
491,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"The money would be "" in the country""?",59
492,Mr THOMAS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Quite so, and we should have national insurance in the best I fear sense of the word. If England is in a position to pay millions per annum for her Army and Navy, and. for interest on a big national debt-whic h is different from tbo interest we pay, seeing that we have large assets",59

494,Mr THOMAS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Quite so; if England is able to do all that, it seems to me that Australia could maintain a scheme of universal old-age pensions. I should have been a great deal more delighted to be supporting the Government in passing such «. scheme as I have indicated, but, strong as my personal regret is in this connection, I am taking the view adopted, I believe, by the majority of honourable members when I say that it is the better policy to accept the Bill as it is, and endeavour to carry out our wishes more satisfactorily hereafter. I cannot help saying, however, that I think we I think are now losing a golden opportunity in accepting the measure as presented. When we reach the Committee stage, there are one or two amendments I should like to see made. I understand the Bill provides that, if a person drinks or leads a disreputable life, he shall not be entitled to a pension. I have very little sympathy with the drinking habits of the people of Australia, or of any other country, and, as a total abstainer for many years, I should like to see all the, people of this country take a sirnilar view. But, having said that, I am opposed to any one being deprived of an old-age pension, even if he spent the whole of it in drink. I hold that an old-age pension belongs to the person to whom it is paid; and, while we cannot remove every tinge of charity under the present proposals, we ought to go as far in that direction as possible. A pensioner is entitled to spend his pension in any way he deems fit, because, though it would be regrettable if he spent it in drink, the money is his.",59
495,Mr CROUCH,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"That would apply to a universal scheme, but not to a limited scheme like the present,' under which the money is granted.",59
496,Mr THOMAS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"If the money does not belong to the pensioner, then there is element of charity.",60

500,Mr THOMAS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Decidedi y not. I cognise, however, that. at present the per of the House is against a universal scheme, on the ground, amongst others, that we should wait for that until Braddon section ceases to operate. own belief, however, is that it is not sary to wait until then. I quite recognise that, if the whole of the money f o universal pensions had to be collected Customs and Excise, the poor would be paying, not only their own' pensions, but portion of the pensions for 'those who are in better circumstances; and the corollary is that a large portion of the money should be derived from direct taxation.",60
501,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Why pay penment sions to those who have already received the reward for their work?,60
502,Mr THOMAS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"In the first place, cause it would remove any element charity. There may be people in fair circumstancesto-day who will suffer reverses, and would be glad of assistance if it were Sydney) [ JO . 9 ] free from the tinge of charity. The right honourable member for Swan asked who it was that had made Australia the country is today. He said it was the industrious, the sober, the steady, the provident, and the thrifty, or used words to that effect, under this Bil l we are not necessarily giving pensions to those who have been thrifty or provident, because if a person has been able to accumulate, through his own energy and t h r if t , property to the tent of- £ 4 0 0 , he is to receive no pension at all, but if he has accumulated £ 3 worth, he will be entitled to a pension. the face of it, therefore, we appear to be giving a premium to those who have not been thrifty.

I do not know that the Judge's to of the Australian States object to receive on their pensions. This House has refused to taxgrant pensions to the Judges of the High Court, but I think that in all the States Judges are entitled to pensions, and have have not thought it derogatory to draw them. I have outlined the old-age pensions scheme that I should have liked to re have an opportunity of supporting. I am temglad the Bill has been introduced even in its present form, and I should like at this stage to pay my tribute to the Honourable the James Howe, of South Australia, whose My name deserves to be mentioned here in connecesnexion with a Federal old-age pensions scheme. There are a number of others to r whom some credit is due, but there is no from other man in Australia to whom greater credit should accrue than to Mr Howe for a the fight he put up to give the Federal Parliament the right to legislate with regard to old-age pensions. I hope that in Committee one or two of the clauses wil l be altered.

503,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"North - I had intended to make some remarks on the second reading of this measure, but considering the lateness of the it hc-ur, the position of matters in another place, and the desire to end the session, I shall not make some of the criticisms that I but intended, because I could only make them on the second reading; not that I am against the proposal or the measure as a whole- I am quite in - favour of it-bu t I think it is open to criticism in one or two exdirections.

504,Mr SAMPSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Wimmera) [10.11] - I chiefly to emphasize the view put forward by several honourable members that the financial position should have been placed accurately before the House before we were called upon to vote so large a of money as is involved in this measure. After the telling, searching, and trenchant criticism of the finances, as put forward the Treasurer a few days agoj by the honsatisfactorily, orable member for Flinders last night, was due to the House for the Treasurer some other Minister to make a rejoinder, and lay what the Government consider be the true financial position of the monwealth before us - That was not an reasonable request, and compliance with would have enabled honourable members vote for the measure with that enthusiasm which its character deserves. Nothing should have been done by the Government that would interfere with the hearty and enthusiastic support which I am pleased know that the Bill is receiving from parts of the Chamber. The honourable member for East Sydney was oorrect in stating that it was treating rather cavalierly to ask it to deal _with pass the Bill on the day on which it placed before us. This is too tion to be decided in one sitting, and it would have been only reasonable and to allow the House breathing time to sider a measure that not only involves a great expenditure, but strikes right to the economic foundation of our legislaproach tion. The House is sufficiently unanimous to preclude the necessity of any general discussion on the auestion of old-age sions. The system has been adopted various parts of Europe. Denmark probably a more liberal scheme than have in Australia, but, in view of the of this country to have a universal old-age pensions, the House should have had the opportunitv of considering not only the proposals ,p,ut forward by the vernment, but others that might introduced by honourable members with the object of improving the Bill. Owing, ever, to the way it has been introduced, the short notice given tr> honourable bers, the House has really been placed the mercy of the Government in the sideration of the subject. All the Old-age Pensions Commissions that have presented reports to the Imperial Parliament have recommended the payment of pensions out .of the general revenue, That system has been followed in various parts of the pire, where old-age pensions are being paid: It has been decided in all cases that no special provision should made for them. But it seems extraordinary Mr Sampson. that we of the British Empire, who pride sum ourselves on being in advance of other nationsin our economic progress, have never taken properly into consideration the by great German system which has worked so and which, so far as I know, it is the nearest approach to a universal or system to.be found in the world. I think it was Prince Bismarck who, in 1881, into troduced and passed the first measure of Comold-age pensions in Germany, which apunproximated to some extent to the systems it now in force in the British Dominions. That to measure was afterwards superseded by the scheme of compulsory insurance that is in operation in Germany today. It is a fund to which employers and employees contribute. The employer is responsible for the to payment of the. insurance premiums, and all the Government, when a man reaches the age qualifying him to receive a pension, subsidizes the fund by the payment of a the House certain amount per annum. and Mr HUGHES - How does that cover was the case of people who are neither emvast a quesployers nor employees ?",60
505,Mr SAMPSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"So far as I can fair understand, they have, to provide an conold-age pension for themselves by comvery pulsory insurance. It is not a univerdown sal scheme, but it is the nearest apto one that is in operation. It may have some defects, but that may be said of all legislation. I think that the penHouse in connection with an important proin posal of this kind should have been afhas forded an opportunity to consider the we possibility of improving the measure by ideal drawing on systems in operation in other system of parts of the world.",61
506,Mr CROUCH,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Has not our Royal ComGomission considered all those schemes, and have been reported upon them?",61
507,Mr SAMPSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I am aware that this howBill is based on the recommendations made and by that Commission. I have read its rememport, but I presume that it does not conat tain all the wisdom that can be shed on conold-age pension schemes, and that it might be possible for this House to improve on the excellent .measure now before us. This Bill crystallizes in a very effective way the various .schemes in operation in the States. It is certainly a great imEmprovement on the Victorian system, the weakness of which is that under it men those who have a hard struggle in many cases be to bring up their own families respectably may be haled before a Court like criminals, and required to satisfy the bench that they are unable to contribute to the maintenance of their parents.",61
508,Mr CROUCH,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I am told that' the result of that provision is the collection of only £4,000 per annum.",62
509,Mr SAMPSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Accordin g to the report of the Royal Commission, the claims for old-age pensions in Victoria have been annually decreasing for that reason.",62
510,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,There is a decrease of 17 per cent.,62
511,Mr SAMPSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I do not wish to - suggest that those who are receiving old age pensions under the Victorian Act are not thoroughly deserving, but I have no hesitation in asserting that, for the reason I have named, many of the most deserving refrain from making application for pensions to which they are entitled by reason - of their citizenship, .and their services to the community.",62
512,Mr DUGAL DTHOMSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,At the - time those who will not help their parents deserve to go to gaol.,62
513,Mr SAMPSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"In certain cases that may be so. I know, however, of a good many people who have been given a fair education, and brought up respectably by their parents, but who, having gone into the world and married, find it as much as they can do to rear their families respectably, and to pay their way.",62
514,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Many - could contribute to the support of their parents do not do so'.,62
515,Mr SAMPSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Such defects will be found in connection with every system that may be mentioned. Notwithstanding the objections which I think may be urged to the Bill , and the paucity of the information put before us with respect to the financial - situation of the Commonwealth at the present time, I am not prepared to offer any opposition to it. Unfairly - treated though we have been by the Government, both in regard to their failure to put before us more details in respect to the financial situation and the attempt to rush the Bill through the House without giving us an opportunity to devote to it that mature - consideration which its great importance demands, I shall nevertheless record my vote, as I am sure every honourable member - will do, in its favour.",62
516,Mr HUGHES,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"West Sydney) [10.21].' - I desire to congratulate the Parliament on the opportunity now offered to it to pass this measure, and the Commonwealth on the opportunity to obtain the advantages which it will confer. So far as I can see, the Bill represents a very considerable advance upon existing legislation. A number of the defects in the New South Wales Act with which representatives of that State are familiar are absent from it. That being so, it will certainly be an advantage to the aged poor'of that State, as well as of Victoria, and a very. great advantage to the aged poor of other States where old-age pensions schemes are not in operation. Very great credit is due to the honourable member for Wide Bay, to whose suggestion the financial proposals upon which this measure is based, are mainly due. It is a singular commentary upon legislation and legislative methods that the measures which find general acceptance amongst all parties are those with which the seashore of politics is littered. It is generally those measures upon which only one party has made up its mind that find their way upon the statute-book. same Seven years after the establishment of Federation we find ourselves considering a Commonwealth Old-age Pensions Bill , and whilst I admit quite freely that circumstances have lately been more favourable to the passing of such a measure, I cannot help thinking that, having regard. to the fact that the obstacles in our way were never insuperable, it is a reflection upon us that it has not previously been dealt with. The honourable member for Barrier had something to"" say about the failure of the who Bil l to make provision for allj without any qualification other than residence and age. He was quite right; but although a thing may be very desirable, if you have not the necessary funds, it is useless to discuss it at length. Perhaps, however, we shall be able before very long to do what he wants. But as to the! cost of such a scheme, I would remind honourable members that although rich and poor alike can share in the benefits of free primary education for their children, not all elect to take advantage of it. Similarly, if old-age pensions were available to all, there would be many well-to-do persons who would make no claim on the fund. Another matter to which I draw particular attention is this. Paragraph c -' of clause . 17 provides that applicants for a. pension must be .of good character, having been for five years immediately preceding the date of application leading a temperate and reputable life. We have nothing to do with what these applicants have been, so long as they have resided in the country continuously for twenty-five years, and have not been in gaol within a certain period of making their application. course, the pensioner who wastes his money in drink ought not to be allowed to continue to abuse his privilege, because, whatever allowance may be made for such, conduct, the State ought not to be asked to pay twice for his maintenance,' which it would be called upon to do if he squandered his pension. ' Who is to decide what good character means I do not know. If we can believe the Treasurer and the right honourable member for Swan, neither possesses that attribute. We have a right to expect pensioners to conduct themselves with reasonable propriety; but the Bill provides that a magistrate may, if he thinks a claimant not a person to whom he can safely entrust pension money, commit him to a benevolent asylum. however, a man is of good reputation and has complied in other respects with the requirements of the Bill , I think he should have a pension. In my opinion, therefore, all the words in the paragraph following the words ""good character"" should be struck out, and I shall move that amendment. I am glad that the measure has been introduced, and I hope that it will be of service to the unfortunate aged, who have been too long neglected.",62
517,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Robertson) [ - 3 3 ] - - I am not at all satisfied IO provisions of the Bill, which"" I regard inadequate for the requirements of Ausconsideration. tralia and not creditable to us. petuates the charity system administered by various institutions throughout the Comshould monwealth, but provides that, instead of goods, the needy shall be given the equivalent. No man, however, is be eligible for a pension if he been improvident, or intemperate, or has deserted his family, or is not of good character-condition s which are incommend ? sisted upon now in regard to charitable Telief. I hold that the fact that a person has lived ancl worked for over sixty years, and in the struggle for existence has failed to make provision for old age, should title him to be provided for in the time need by his country. In Australia, wealth to the extent of £T,000,000,000 has been accumulated. In the struggle for existprovided ence, men and women go under. As a rewould sult of the stress of the existing competipresent tive industrial system, men's lives are shorter than was formerly the case, I and I claim that the country should not permit its citizens to want in their old age. The system proposed in this Of Bill does ' not comply with what I regard as the requirements of such a measure. In Australia, where there is, perhaps, greater' wealth in proportion to population than in any other country, better provision for the human derelicts, who are to be found in every country, should be made than is provided for in this Bill . I find that under this measure marriage with an aboriginal or coloured alien is to be a bar to thereceipt of a pension.",63
518,Mr DUGAL DTHOMSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,I do not think that is so.,63
519,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Yes ; the honourable member will find that marriage to an aboriginal or a coloured alien, even though the person should become an inIf, valid, is a bar to the receipt of a pension under this Bill . That is a provision which should not appear in any .Invalid and Old age Pensions Bill . If a person on other grounds is deserving of an old-age pension, marriage with an aboriginal, New Zealander, or a coloured alien should not be a bar to its receipt. It is unfortunate that; perhaps, the most important measure that could be introduced should be submitted to Parliament almost at the close of the session, and that we should be asked in an hour or two, not only to pass . the second reading of the Bill , but to put with the it through Committee. In the circumas stances, sufficient time is not given for its I hold the view that any It persystem of invalid and old-aige pensions should be based upon direct taxation, and be universal, and that all contributing to the fun d necessary for the purpose should be credited with the amount of pento sion due to them, and deducted from the has amount of tax charged against them.",63
520,Mr BATCHELOK,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,What form of direct taxation would the honourable member re,63
521,Mr HENRYWILLTS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I believe that the most equitable form of direct taxation for this purpose would be a tax upon the unimproved value of land. I think that enthe upkeep of an old-age pensions fund of should be a charge upon the unearned value of the land, and that the land-owner should be credited with the amount of the pension for. Thesmall land-owners who not require, or who would not, under conditions, accept, a pension would, under such a system, have to pay very little. have suggested an old-age pensions system, which I think would be more generally acceptable than that provided for in this Bill, under which people who must depend upon old-age pensions in their old age are - called upon to contribute enormous sums through the Customs to provide the funds for the payment of those pensions. Moreover, the genteel poor, who silently suffer, will, under this system, pay towards a system which their independent spirit will not permit them to accept a pension as public charity. I should be disposed to regard ' any system of old-age pensions as unsatisfactory if it were not based upon - the direct taxation of the unimproved value of land. However, as half a loaf is better than no bread, I shall vote for the system proposed in this Bill, with a view to its future amendment. A somewhat similar system is in operation in certain of the States at the present time, and it should not be difficult for the Commonwealth Government to make arrangements . with the Governments of the States to permit the amount which they now devote to the payment of old-age pensions to be deducted from their share of the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue which is payable to them. In that way, the proposed system might readily be made effective, but, even when it becomes effective, it will not, in my opinion, give entire satisfaction to the people of Australia. I regret that we should be called upon to deal with the question so hurriedly, and without having first provided ways and means. But, as the Government have a majority behind them, and are determined to put the Bill through this session; and believing, as I do, that the session ought to be brought to a close, I shall not further prolong the debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee : Clauses 1 to 5 agreed to.

522,Mr JH CATTS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Cook) [10.44] - I should like to hear from the Attorney General some explanation of the scheme of administration proposed. I take it that, whilst we are agreed that proper safeguards should be provided, we desire that there should be - as little red-tape as possible associated with the administration of the law. It seems to me that if we. had a registrar for each State, with the power to finally determine what persons within his jurisdiction are entitled to a pension, that should be sufficient. It might be assumed that in each case a competent officer will be appointed. I do not quite know what the scheme of the Bill is, but it seems that there is to be a Commissioner and a Deputy Commissioner for each State. Further, there are to be registrars, and under another clause the decision of a magistrate is required.",64
523,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [10.45] - We have adopted the simplest procedure we could devise in this case. There must be a central officer to exercise a general supervision over the scheme for all Australia. But the determining officer in each State is the Deputy Commissioner. With the object of decentralizing the scheme, each State is divided into districts. There will be a Registrar in each district, who will receive the claims. He will be, in the main, an administrative officer. The claims are to be investigated by magistrates. Further on, I intend to propose that the investigations shall be in private. The magistrate will send the claims to the Deputy Commissioner who will issue his certificate.",64
524,Mr JH CATTS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Mus t all the claims go to the central Commissioner ?,64
525,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"No ; the central Commissioner will exercise supervision over the system generally, so that the Minister under whom the Act is worked may have a knowledge of what is being done. The intention is to preserve uniformity of administration. The principle of the scheme, however, is that the Deputy Commissioner is to be the deciding officer in every State. Of course, in matters involving the application of a general principle, the Deputy Commissioner will have to refer to the Commissioner for. decision. Clause agreed to. Clause 7 agreed to.

529,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"North sent Sydney) [10.49] - There , is in this clause the provision that the Governor General may by proclamation extend the system pensions, so as to make them payable to women over sixty years of age. That is to say, it is proposed to depart from the age of sixty-five, - as fixed in other parts the Bill, and to give the Governor General power by proclamation to pay pensions women who have attained the age of sixty. I think that such an extension ought not Tariff. to be made by proclamation. A resolution of both Houses - of Parliament ought to be requisite. It has to be remembered no definite statement has been made as to the sources of revenue from which pensions will be paid. It is recognised that the ject in view cannot, be accomplished until the finances are sufficiently favourable. That means that we are to leave the matter to the Government to decide. It would much better to allow Parliament to express its approval of a definite proposition. Surely if Parliament is willing to extend the pensions to women at the ""age of sixty there will be no difficulty in obtaining its consent. If , for financial reasons, ParliaHouse ment is not willing such an extension should not be permitted.",65
530,Mr JH CATTS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,But the Minister is responsible.,65

If Parliament is agreeable to the extension a of the pension system it will readily give its If Parliament is not agreeable Ministers have no right to create such an after extension by proclamation.. Further, we ought not to try to bind future Parliaments. .The matter may not affect the preParliament, but we ought not to restrict the freedom of action or future Parliaments by a provision such as this, which of means a serious increase of expenditure. Parliament may have no opportunity of expressing its opinion until after the proclamation is issued, and then,' it will be too of late to take action, even though it may be generally considered that what is done is to a mistake.

535,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"In the case of'minor matters in the Tariff we obobjected to the Minister taking power to do things by proclamation, and retained the authority in our own hands, as I think we ought to do in this case. It is not likely be to do any injury if we do. The House has shown itself, as I have no doubt future Houses will do, only too willing to assist in this matter as far as it possibly can. The only thing which would prevent the from agreeing tp a serious extension of the principle would be a financial difficulty. Otherwise, the ' Ministry-and it might be a dying Ministry-migh t commit the Parliament to that which, if consulted, it would not approve of. To give such a> as is proposed . to any Ministrymerely to a Ministry with a large majority, but to a Ministry dying and almost going out of office:-is , I think, objectionable, and I for one cannot support the proposal in this clause.",65
536,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Wide Bay) [10.57] Although the honourable member for North Sydney has reasoned admirably on the principle of Parliament retaining full control of the finances, still I do not think that he has made out a good case regarding this particular proposal. He pointed out that even in the case of a small Tariff matter we declined to .allow the Minister to issue a proclamation, and decided that it must be brought before Parliament. That is, I think, quite right in the matter of a Tariff item, because it imposes a tax. This is a tentative measure. Members of the Oppostion have stated that it is not the Bill which they desire, and a similar statement has been made by members of the Labour Party and members of the Government. But here is an attempt to provide the machinery necessary to make a better system when the finances will allow. cannot conceive of a single instance where a dying Government, simply for the sake of gaining kudos, would do what has been suggested.",66

If the limit were reduced from sixty-five to sixty years therewould be no need for the next sub-clause, and it would simplify the matter very much. I indulge in the hope that in the near future we shall be able to lower the age to sixty years all round.

567,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"North Sydney) [11.15] - Every honourable member must feel as I do that, although he may be in favour of old-age pensions, the Bill has been brought in at so late a period of the session, and has to be considered in such, haste, that there is no real opportunity of proposing what might be considered necessary improvements. - should prefer to substitute the power of Parliament for the power of proclamation, not with the object of reducing the usefulness of the measure, but simply to preserve the power of Parliament as it ought to be preserved. I recognise that this consideration of the Bill is, however, merely a sham one. Further on there are'some amendments which I think, would improve the measure in the direction in which the Government want to go, but they cannot be properly - discussed at this hour of the night, and with another place waiting for the Bill . I shall, therefore, not move ihe amendments, but shall simply leave the Government to take the responsibility of the Bill . Sir WILLIAM ' LYNE - That is the thing to do.",68
568,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"The honourable member knows that I have always tried to improve his .measures, even in^ the direction in which he wanted to go, if I agreed with that direction.

A much bigger proposal ' will be necessary before very long, in order - to give Attor- old-age pensions worthy of Australia. Nothing short of universal old-age pensions and a reduction of-the age will be worthy of this country. However, we accept this is Bill as a big instalment, as compared with the present system of destitute relief, of an efficient old-age pensions scheme. I agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that it is a bad plan generally to have legislation by proclamation, but this is not legislation in the ordinary sense. It is merely a question of giving the Government power, as soon as the finances permit, to reduce the age at which pensions shall be given to sixty years in the case of women. That is purely a financial matter, which the House will have the fullest opportunity of dealing with. If it disagrees with the action of the Government, it can express its disagreement when the money is asked for on the Estimates. There is no way in which the Government could bring this alteration of the law into effect Personally, I without the approval of both Houses.",68

571,Mr BATCHELOR,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"The same argument would apply if we provided that the Government must move a motion or secure the approval of both Houses before issuing a proclamation. It would be rather difficult to get a majority of the House to withhold its approval. Whilst I agree with the honourable member generally as to the inadvisability of legislating by proclamation, this is a case in which no possible harm can result. best  Since the B i ll - got into Committee, I have heard for the first time the statement that it is to be regarded only as a tentative measure. We heard nothing of that from the Attorney-General or during the second reading debate. ' Mr BATCHELOR - Oh , yes.  characterized the Bill ""as extremely .liberal. If we are to increase the number of beneficiaries under it, we may bring about a condition which will result in disaster ahd cause the. system to break down by its own weight. In view of the number of persons who are to receive advantages under the Bill, it will cost us not much less than £[2,000,000 per annum.

579,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Swan) [11.27]. - - I should like to know whether the Attornev-General is agreeable to amend the wording of paragraph c. I fail to see why Asiatics should be associated in it with aboriginal natives of Australia, Africa, the islands of the Pacific, or New Zealand. They ought to be dealt with in a separate paragraph, and a definition of Asiatics should also be given.",69
580,Mr BATCHELOR,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Boothby) [11.28] I move- ; That paragraph c be left out. Aliens or those who have been naturalized for less than three years are debarred under the remaining paragraphs of this clause from receiving an old-age pension, and .1 do not think it is necessary to go further than to limit the granting of pensions to naturally-born and naturalized subjects of the King. I have no desire that aboriginals as such should be debarred. In perhaps ninety-nine cases out of a hundred it would be absurd to give pensions to aboriginals, but we have in South Australia some aboriginals who are farmers, who cul-. tivate their land and live precisely as Europeans do. .They are fairly well educated.",69
581,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,How many are. there ?,69
582,Mr BATCHELOR,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Not many; but they should not be debarred, on the ground it is that they are aboriginals, from receiving an old-age pension. I do not ask that the system should be extended to aboriginals generally, but I repeat that we ought not to 'debar a man from receiving pensions simply because he is an aboriginal. Apart altogether from paragraph c it is provided that pension claims shall be investigated, and that an old-age pension shall not be paid unless the claim is certified by the Registrar, recommended in writing by a Deputy Commissioner and approved by - the Commissioner. Where the Commissioner certifies that an aboriginal is a 'person to receive an old-age pension he should not be' shut out from the benefits of this measure. I do not wish to appeal to the sentiment of honourable members, but the fact that the Australian aborigines are a dying race is rather a reason in favour of our not excluding them from the provisions of this Bill. Mr FISHER.,-They might die more rapidly if they were granted pensions.",69
583,Mr BATCHELOR,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Will the honourable member reply to my argument that where the Commissioner certifies that an aboriginal who farms his own land and is well qualified for the duties of citizenship is entitled to a pension it should be granted to him ? I take up the same position with regard to Asiatics. If we permit them to come in-if we naturalize, them and call upon them to bear taxation exactly as we do every other member of the communitywe should not refuse them a pension under this Bill. I have never given a vote to deny to an Asiatic after he has been admitted and naturalized any privilege that we give the rest of the community, and I do not intend to do so. A man should not be debarred from receiving a pension on the ground of nationality alone. From the financial point of view my proposal is a mere bagatelle; but the corollary of this provision is the exemption of Asiatics from, taxation.",69
584,Mr WILSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,A man must have been resident in Australia for twenty-five years tb be entitled to a pension.,70
585,Mr BATCHELOR,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Exactly; and must have been naturalized and certified by the Commissioner to be a proper person to receive an old-age pension. Every barrier of this kind that is placed in the way of those whom we admit to citizenship reduces their position in the community and gives rise to much bitterness on the part of other nations. To use a well-known colloquialism, ""the game is not worth the candle.*' There is no reason why we should not give an old-age pension to an Asiatic who complies with all the other provisions of the Bill, just as we should give it to a European. Mir. SPENCE (Darling) [11.34] Whilst the proposal to grant old-age pensions to aboriginals ancl Asiatics sounds very well, we must not forget that one of the difficulties of administering such a system is in regard to obtaining proof of age. In New South Wales t'he State records of births do not go back further than' 1856, ancl consequently the officials who have to administer the Pensions Act have often to - rely on their judgment, and to accept proof other thari the production of the cer. tificate of registration. Aliens, however, come from countries where there is no registration of births. As for aboriginals, it seems to me that when they become aged or incapacitated from earning a living they could be better provided for than with a pension of 10s. a week. I agree with the honourable member for Boothby that naturalized Asiatics who have lived for twenty-five years in the country should receive pensions; but is it ' worthwhile to amend the Bill, seeing how few there are, and how many difficulties will attend the granting of pensions to them? Furthermore, the existence of thousands of aboriginals in Central Australia and. in Northern Territory may create troubles which we do not foresee as the result of this proposal.  know of families of half-castes engaged in farming on land given .to them by the Government, who are bringing up their children respectably, and have lived foi twenty years in a district with which I am acquainted.

588,Mr JH CATTS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Cook) [11.41] The leader of the Opposition, in speaking on the second reading, criticised this provision of the Bill severely. I asked whether he thought that the naked aboriginals of the Northern Territory should be eligible for pensions, and I understood him to reply in the affirmative. According to the Year-Book there are 150,000 aboriginals in Australia.",70

590,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,No Asiatic is eligible.,70
591,Mr JH CATTS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I do not think that we should encourage Asiatics to come here. I would encourage them to go away. But an Asiatic who is naturalized, and who has lived for twenty-five years in the country, possessing electoral rights, should be eligible for an old age pension.

604,Mr BATCHELOR,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,What are the grounds imposing the bar to these people?,71

Why, then, should we bar the child of an Asiatic born in this country? Mir. GROOM - The general intention of our legislation is not to encourage Asiatics to remain in Australia. It would encourage their continuance in the country if we paid old-age pensions to them. As to aboriginals, I do not'see how we could extend the Bil l to them, although personally my sympathies are in that direction.

652,Mr HEDGES,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Fremantle.) [12.25 a.m.]. - In my opinion, a slight alteration is re- quired in paragraph b of this clause, which provides that no person shall receive an old-age pension unless upon the date when he makes his claim he has resided continuously in Australia for twenty-five years. To my mind that is a cruel provision. The Commonwealth has taken over the administration of Papua, and a Bill is - now before Parliament under which it is proposed to take over the administration of Norfolk Island. Australians have been honourable sent to Papua to govern it, and if seems to me a monstrous proposal that persons who have gone there voluntarily, such as timber getters and miners, should .be debarred from participating in this old-age",74

656,Mr HEDGES,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Then a grievous wrong is being done to people who go a country like Papua, and perhaps injure their health there, after residing in AusI tralia for many years. It is said the money which would be paid for old-age pensions will not come from Papua. But the money that is developing Papua is debarred from drawing a pension. coming from Australia. It would be dalous to shut those Australian settlers out from the benefits of the Bill . While there are men in this Chamber who stick up for the Asiatics, I am going to stick up for the white men.",75
657,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [12.29 a.m.] - This scheme Commonwealth old-age pensions in intended for the six States of the Australian Union. We provide a complete scheme of adminisold-age tration for the Commonwealth itself. The Territories of the Commonwealth are gothe verned under ordinances and laws of their own making. We subsidize a Territory, but it raises its own taxes from its own people, and makes its own laws. It is a complete legislative unit in itself. The Territories have complete self-government with'in themcated. selves.",75
658,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,So have the States - I,75
659,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Yes ; but in their case the question of concurrent legislation comes in. We do not propose in this Bill to revenues from anybody in a Territory. people of a Territory will not contribute anything to the revenue of the CommonLondon wealth. The raising and spending of their own monev is a matter entirely within the Territory itself.,75
660,Mr HUTCHISON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Hindmarsh) [12.31 a.m.] - The Minister loses sight of the imto portant point that, while the Bill ought to be applied to those who have been born and reared in the Territories, there are sent from Australia to the Territories officers nected with the Commonwealth, who, i they have not been resident in Australia twenty-five years, cannot get the pension. The same applies to settlers who go from Australia to develop the Territories. These perhaps, endanger their lives or health, I but the break i h their continuous residence in Australia debars them from getting the It would be only fair to provide any that any one who has resided in Australia twenty years, and puts in another five years in Papua or Norfolk Island, should be still eligible. We are glad to see Austo tralians go to our Possessions to develop and they should not be penalized. If the honourable member for Fremantle will frame an amendment to meet that difficulty to open up I shall support him.",75

All that is necessary is to provide that time spent abroad in the service of Australia shall be counted as residence in Australia. If , for instance, a man spent ten or twelve years in London of as High Commissioner for Australia, and subsequently returned and fell .on evil days, with the result that he required an pension, that period of service in the Old Country should be regarded, for purposes of this Bill , as residence in Australia. And so with General Agents, who are being sent to the East ancl elsewhere on behalf of the States. I hope that the Attorney-General will be prepared to make such an amendment as I have indi",75
662,Mr SPENCE,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Darling) [12.36 a.m.]. am surprised at the proposal that - an amendment shall be made in the interests only of officers who have served, take abroad. We have been carried from Papua The to England, and have been told that the time served by a High Commissioner in should be regarded as residence in Australia for the purposes of this Bill . I understand that the proposal now made is not designed to benefit those who go to Papua or Norfolk Island for a few years'assist in developing those Territories,, not and I enter a protest against our discriminating in favour of officers who receivefairly good salaries. It would be betterconto allow the clause to pass as it stands. f We are seeking to provide for the 'agedfor poor of the Commonwealth, and those whogo to Papua or elsewhere do so at their own .risk. 'Papua may ultimately have an independent old-age pension scheme, and I do not think it desirable to make the proposed amendment.",75
663,Mr SAMPSON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Wimmera) [12.40 a.m.] - Like the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, I do not think that we should amend the clause. The honourable member for Fremantle has very properly drawn attention to this question, and his action may pave the way to the extension of the principles of the Bill to those resident in Papuaj and other Territories which 'we may take over. It will be many years before the conditions prevailing in Papua and Norfolk Island will approximate to those on the mainland of Australia, ancl when that .development takes place there will be no difficulty in extending the provisions of this Bill to P.eople resident there.",76

672,Mr HUTCHISON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Hindmarsh)' [12.48 a.m.] - I hope the honourable member for Fremantle will consent to withdraw his amendment. I am in favour of doing what he wants to do, but I think that the object can be better achieved by an amendment of clause 18. That clause provides that continuous residence in Australia shall not be deemed to have been interrupted by occasional absences not exceeding in the aggregate one-tenth of the total period of residence. That means that to prove continuous residence it shall be necessary to show that the claimant has not resided out of Australia for more than z\ years. We can amend that provision by saying that continuous residence shall not be deemed to be interrupted by residence in any Australian possession. Then an Australian who has lived five, ten, or even twenty years in Papua would still be entitled to a pension, but eligibility. for a pension will not be secured simply by residence there.",76
673,Mr HEDGES,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I am willing to withdraw my amendment if the end in view can be better achieved in another way. [12.42 Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",76

678,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,No .,76
679,Mr HUTCHISON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Hindmarsh) [12.54 a.m.] - I would point out that if these words are left in, hardship will be done. Only one applicant of bad character in a thousand will be found out; the others will get their pensions. I object to this discrimithe nation.",76
680,Mr STORRER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"How is it to be prebeen vented ? - Mr HUTCHISON - It costs the Commonwealth hundreds of thousands of seems pounds a year to protect its citizens from criminals. We only occasionally discover about one criminal in fifty, and then only if he has committed about twenty crimes. It was stated by a late superintendent Scotland Yard that about seventy criminals were responsible for all the great committed in London, and yet scores of thousands of pounds are expended there for the protection of the public. The fact is that the clause has been badly drafted, and should include a definition character,"" though I admit that it would be very hard to define satisfactorily.",77
681,Mr SPENCE,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Darling) [12.58 a.m.] - exceed I think that the amendment which has been proposed, and to which the Minister prepared to agree, represents a' very good compromise. I do not think that there is much in the objection of - the honourable member for Hindmarsh that many people of bad character are not found out. In practice, it will be found that a very chariarea table view will be. taken of the claims applicants for old-age pensions, and very few will be refused on the score of bad character. There was some objection to the other words of the paragraph, which seem to be inconsistent with the object the Bill, which, after all, is to give sions to persons who have attained tain age. To strike out the whole of the paragraph would be to leave those upon to determine claims in a helpless position, and to prevent the refusal pension in a case in which it would not be deserved. That would do no good individual ' or to society,, because it might, perhaps, be wicked to grant-a pension at all. There must be some safesonable guard, and I think the provision with - spect to good character might very well accepted, and that we can safely leave to those who will have the administration of the Act to see that no real injustice done under it.",77
682,Mr FOSTER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"New England) [1.1 tween a.m.] - I was quite prepared to withdraw my objection to the words ""he is character "" when the Minister assured me that that would be the only safeguard that - I movewould be left.

683,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,That is where a man has guilty of an offence after a pension has been granted to him.,77
684,Mr FOSTER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I admit that, but it to me that it is pettifogging to propose investigations into the character of an applicant, when, after all, the pension should be given because it is needed, and when, under the Bill, if , after a man has of been given a pension, it is found that he is not of good character, power is reserved crimes to take it away from him.

The provision might be reasonable enough where houses are built with wood, but in the metropolitan of Adelaide such a thing as a wooden of house is hardly to be seen. It is impossible to get in Adelaide a house for £ 3 1 0 that is worth living in. The consequence of this provision will be that if a poor woman is left with a house worth £500 in Adeof laide, she will be.just as poor as a person pen-, in Victoria owning a wooden house worth a ceronly £310.

692,Mr HUTCHISON,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Hindmarsh) [ i . n a.m.]:- I am sure that the Attorney-General will recognise that an amendment of this clause is required. The Bill provides that a person who is absent in Europe or in the Home land for two and a half years shall not be deprived of an old-age pension. It must be the desire of the Government not to deprive an Australian citizen of his pension rights if he happens to have lived for some time in an Australian Possession. I desire to see Papua developed, and I wish to insert words to protect the rights of a person who goes to Papua or to any other Australian Possession just as we provide for a person going to Europe.

At the present time, there are quite a number of miners in Papua, which is, and will continue to be, a very unhealthy place until malaria disappears. We cannot expect many persons to live there for more than five or seven years, and to prohibit a person fromgetting an invalid or old age pension simply because he has resided in or has lost his health in an Australian Territory, is most unfair. I do not suggest that any one should be allowed to go outside Commonwealth territory, and to preserve his right under this measure. I hope that the Minister will see that my proposal is most reasonable, and is not likely to injure Australia to any extent.

727,Mr JH CATTS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Cook) [1.35 a.m.']. is provision for confidential reports to - be made ancl objections lodged against an applicant for the pension, and there is then to be a hearing of the case before a magistrate, but there ought to be some provision whereby the applicant could have the points of objection stated to him, so that he might be able to put his case fairly.",80
728,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,We can arrange that by regulation.,80
729,Mr JH CATTS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"If the Minister will promise that, I will accept his word for it . .",80
730,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I will endeavour to provide for it. Clause agreedto. Clause 30(2) All investigations by the Magistrate be made in the locality wherein the resides, or as near thereto as practicable, and shall be in open Court,, unless for any reason the Magistrate deems it advisable to sit in private.",80
731,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [1.36 a.m.] - I am of opinion that' the investigations should be made privately, in any place desired by the magistrate, to suit the convenience of the claimant'. I therefore move That the word ""unless"" be left out, and the word "" if""'. inserted in lieu thereof, and words "" to sit in private"" be left out. The general rule will then be to hold all the investigations in private, but if the magistrate thinks it necessary in the interest of justice, they can be held in open Court! Amendments agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 31 agreed to. Clause 32(1) In respect of matters found by the Magistrate to be disproved, the claimant may in the time and in the manner prescribed appeal to the Minister, who may cause an investigation thereof to be made by the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner, whose decision shall be final and conclusive and without appeal.",81
732,Mr CROUCH,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Corio) [1.38 a.m.] There is no need for the appeal to go to the Minister, seeing that he only refers it back to the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner for final decision.",81
733,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Thes e powers will be delegated by the Minister.,81
734,Mr CROUCH,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"The appeal must go, in every case,. from the magistrate to the Minister.",81
735,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Unde r clause 14, the Minister may delegate any of his powers under the Bill.",81
736,Mr CROUCH,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"The Minister cannot delegate the right of the claimant to appeal to him. A claimant at Wyndham, dissatisfied with the decision of a magistrate, may appeal to the Minister at Melbourne or Dalgety, who then refers it back to the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner at Perth. It would be much better for the appeal to be made direct to the man who will' finally decide it. The system proposed by the clause is most cumbrous.",81
737,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,The Minister may decide the appeal if he so desires.,81
738,Mr CROUCH,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"The Minister cannot go into all the questions of proof or disshall proof. It is a red-tape proposal that claimant should not be adopted. I move That the words "" Minister, who may cause an investigation thereof to be made by the "" be left out.",81
739,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [i-4° a.m.] - The clause says that the claimant "" may in the time and in the manner -' prescribed '' appeal to the Minister. We have, therefore, power by regulation to prescribe the manner of appeal, and that the - the Minister has power to delegate his functions. The clause will not have the effect that the honourable member for Corio fears. It will not work any hardship, because there are full powers given to refer a claim back. It is only in the ultimate resort, or in some group of cases, that the claimant will have the Tight of appeal to the Minister.",81
740,Mr CROUCH,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Corio) [1.41 a.m.] The regulations cannot alter the Act, and therefore the appeal must go to the Minister first. The Minister Will find these appeals a great nuisance. I speak from an experience of the Victorian Act. Every person who does not get his pension is dissatisfied, and writes at once to any one that he thinks can use influence on his behalf. The Committee must see that a provision that the Minister must be appealed to in every case, and then send the appeal back to the Commissioner - in the district for"" final decision, will be subsequently amended.",81
741,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Wide Bay) [1.43 a.'m.].. - I take a different view from the honourable member for Corio. Under this Bill, the final Court of Appeal should be the Minister.",81
742,Mr CROUCH,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"That is provided for in clause 36., sub-clause 1.",81
743,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Unde r this clause, it is very well set out, as well as in a preliminary clause. As has been pointed out, a series of cases may arise on one particular point, and the Minister would be the proper person to deal with those groups of cases. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 334. If the determination of the Commissioner is adverse to the claim, the claimant shall be notified accordingly. Amendment (by Mr GROOM) agreed toThat after the word "" Commissioner"" the words "" or Deputy Commissioner'' be inserted. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 34 to 36 agreed to. Clause 37x. At any time not being sooner than one month before the expiration of each year puted from the date of the commencement the pension) during which the pension certificate remains in force, each pensioner shall file with the Registrar of his district a statement the amount of income received by him. . . .",81
744,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [1.47 a.m.] - I move That after the word ""district,"" line 6, thecarefully. words "" unless exempted by the Registrar"" be inserted. The object of the amendment is to meet cases where the registrar knows a person sufficiently well to Tender it unnecessary - call upon him to file a declaration every missioner year. It will facilitate the procedure under hisbehalftoto'allow - the Bill. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 38 agreed to. Clause 393. A Deputy Commissioner may such forfeiture in any case where after investigation he is satisfied . . . .",82
745,Mr CROUCH,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Corio) [1.49 a.m.] - I thecentral' office. would suggest the desirableness of substituting the word "" Registrar '' for the words "" Deputy Commissioner."" involved is not of great importance.. It simply relates to the position of a man has not applied for his pension within twenty-one days after its due date, and should not be necessary for the Deputy Commissioner to deal with such a case. some States it would be impossible to reach a pensioner from the central office within twenty one days. r",82
746,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I agree with the honourable' Clause 50member that the amendment is desirable. Amendment (by Mr CROUCH) agreed victed toThat after the words "" Deputy Commissioner in sub-clauses 3 and 4 the words trar "" be inserted. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 40 and 41 agreed to. Clause 42(1) Whenever the Deputy Commissioner is satisfied that, having regard to the age, infirmity, or improvidence of a pensioner it is expedient' that payment of u i y instalments of the pension be made tb .any minister of religion, justice of the peace, or other person, a warrant to that effect shall be issued.",82
747,Mr CROUCH,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Corio) [1:51 a.m.] The honourable member for East Sydney drew attention to the presence of the words ""minister of religion,"" appearing in this clause, and they seem to be an unnecessary assertion of the rights of the clergy.",82
748,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I am agreeable to the (comomission of the words "" any minister of of religion, justice of the peace, or other."" .",82
749,Mr CROUCH,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"I move That the words "" minister of religion, justice showing of the peace,.or other"" be left out.",82
750,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Franklin) [1.5* a.m.] - We shouldconsider this proposal,82
751,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,The regulations will deal with'the conditions of the payment of instalments.,82
752,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"A man in receipt, to of a pension might reside in an out of the way place,' and apply to the Deputy Compayments to be made in some other person. It is desirable to take care that .that person shall be one who will make a proper use of the money handed over to him.",82
753,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,That will be dealt with by the warrant of the Deputy Commissioner waive any as well as by regulation.,82
754,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,This will throw a lot of unnecessary labour and trouble on,82
755,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,A clergyman or. a justiceof the peace will not be excluded by the The question omission of these words.,82
756,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"It is necessary who that we should provide that some person in authority shall receive instalments, of the it pensions on behalf of the pensioner, as a protection to the recipient. It would be In well to pass the clause as it stands. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 43 to 49 agreed to. (1) When a pensioner is in any Court conof drunkenness, or of any offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than one month . . . the Deputy Commissioner may, "" by order, forfei t any one or more of the instal"" or a Regisments falling due",82
757,Mr CROUCH,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Corio) [1.57 a.m.] I am not sure that this, clause expresses the intention of its framers. Offences against manymunicipal by-laws render the offender liable to. a - fine, or, in default, to imprisonment for more than a month, and under this .provision a pensioner found guilty of such an' offence may be called, . . . . upon to forfeit "" any one or more of the instalments, of his pension,"" which may mean the taking away of his pension altogether.",82
758,Mr GROOM,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,It is a purely discretionary power.,83
759,Mr CROUCH,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"If the Minister thinks that the clause expresses his intention, I have no more to sav in regard to it.",83
760,Mr FOSTER,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"New England) [1.59 a.m.] - I move That the words "" of drunkenness, o r "" be left out. I should not object to a man who has been sentenced to a month's imprisonment on conviction for drunkenness being required to forfeit one or more instalments of his pension, but, as the clause stands, great hardship may be done. . The provision seems to make the drops of charity as bitter as possible. I know of one or two cases in which pensioners of habitually good character have taken a glass too much,, and having been convicted of drunkenness, have been temporarily deprived of their pensions. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 51 to 55 agreed to.",83
761,Mr JH CATTS,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Cook) [2.2 a.m.]. - I move That the' following new clause be inserted :34A. Any person who at the commencement of this Act is the holder of a valid certificate entitling him to an invalid or old-age pension under a State Act may, instead of sending in a pension claim, deliver up his State certificate to the Deputy Commissioner, and the Deputy Commissioner may, subject to the regulations, if he is satisfied that the person is entitled to a pension under this Act, issue a pension certificate t'o him. This clause will allow State pensioners to draw a Commonwealth pension without going through the vexatious formality of presenting new claims. Proposed new clause agreed to. Title agreed to. ' Bill reported with amendments, and, on recommittal, with a further consequential amendment. Reports adopted. Standing Orders suspended, and Bill read a third time. SURPLUS REVENUE BILL.

762,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"Hume-Trea surer) [2.6 a.m.] - I move That the House do now adjourn. I wish, in doing so, to say that' the Government are exceedingly grateful to the Opposition for the course they have taken in permitting the Old-age Pensions Bill with which we have just dealt to pass through all its stages without delay.",83
763,Mr BOWDEN,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,Will the Minister say what business is to be taken this afternoon?,83
764,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF,"There are two small measures to be, dealt with first, and we shall then take the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, or the Bill to appropriate ,£250,000 for defence.
