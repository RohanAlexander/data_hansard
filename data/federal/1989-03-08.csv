0,NA,Unknown,"Wednesday, 8 March 1989 Madam SPEAKER (Hon. Joan Child) took the chair at 10 a.m., and read prayers. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1988",10
1,Madam SPEAKER,AND SAFETY COMMISSION,"I wish to inform the House that on Monday, 6 March, I waited upon His Excellency the Governor General at Government House and personally presented for the royal assent the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Amendment Bill 1988, being the first Bill ready for presentation following the swearing in of His Excellency. His Excellency, in the name of Her Majesty, was pleased to assent to the Bill, which is now Act No.4 of 1989. EXPORT INSPECTION (QUANTITY CHARGE) AMENDMENT BILL 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 7 March, on motion  That the Bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Lloyd had moved by way of amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government(l) for breaking its commitment to recover not more than 50% of the cost of export inspection charges for agricultural commodities; and (2) for its obvious policy to move to 100% recovery of the cost of export inspection charges for agricultural commodities, as evidenced by the dramatic increase in the maximum permissible levels of this Bill'.  night I said, in relation to the increases in inspection charges imposed by this Government, that the charges were creating real problems for a number of exporters, especially smaller horticultural exporters. In some instances the Government has imposed inspections, and inspection charges, where none is required by the importing country. In many instances the smaller horticultural exporters are meeting repeat orders. They know that, if they do not maintain a· high quality of product, they will not be able to maintain those sale orders. The concern of exporters in this country is not only about the high inspection charges imposed by the Government but also that export inspections are imposed by the Government where they are not required by the self-regulating exporter and where they are not required by the importing country. Exporters are concerned that whenever an industry gets its head above water, this Government imposes a new tax, charge or levy on that industry. In the case of this legislation the new tax or levy is in the form of higher export inspection charges on grain. The rural sector would not be concerned if the policy were adopted across the board, but that is clearly not the case, as exporters in particular are selected for special attention by this Government. Too many of our rural industries which have great export opportunities are being held back by this Government's rapacious appetite for tax. The wine industry, for example, could be one of our most significant exporters if it were given a reasonable opportunity to cellar wine so that we could add value in Australia and export the highest quality premium wines instead of bulk wine. To encourage value adding, the tax rules will have to be changed to allow wine makers to deduct the cost of making wine in the year that it is incurred. Nearly every other business in Australia has that right to deduct the cost of manufacture in the year that it is incurred. The wine industry is a unique industry because it needs to cellar the wine to add value, but the Australian Taxation Office requires it to carry forward the cost of that wine. Mr Kerin-I take a point of order, Madam Speaker. I have been listening to this debate, last night and again this morning. This debate is about a very simple machinery amendment, and I think it advisable that we get back to the Bill instead of talking about everything under the sun.",10
2,Madam SPEAKER,AND SAFETY COMMISSION,"It is reasonably difficult for the Chair because I was not present for some of the other part of the debate. I am not sure how far honourable members have wandered. I remind the honourable member for Barker that it is a narrow Bill.  Speaker. The concern I am expressing is that this Government, through this and related legislation, has been imposing on the rural sector a larger and larger tax burden that is inhibiting the rural sector's opportunity to export. It is no good this Government encouraging the rural sector to export to improve our balance of payments if every time an industry starts to get its head above water the Government imposes a new tax or charge. That has happened with the wine industry. The Government has put on a new sales tax; it is imposing a tax system that discourages the export of high quality premium product. I urge the Government to reconsider its current high taxing and charging regime. We cannot reasonably expect rural industries to carry a larger and larger tax burden while the Government maintains a monetary policy which puts upward pressure on the Australian dollar, an industrial relations policy which imposes some of the highest wharf costs in the world and a tariffs policy which provides benefits to exporters some five years down the track while expecting them to pay full tote odds today. Only with a more realistic taxing and charging approach will our rural exporters be able to expand and continue the great job they do for Australia in exporting fine rural Australian products.",10
3,Mr IAN CAMERON,AND SAFETY COMMISSION,"Maranoa) (1O.08)':'-'It is my pleasure to speak to the Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Amendment Bill and I do so as a primary producer and the representative of a large rural sector of Australia, in the electorate of Maranoa. Maranoa covers about 35 per cent of Queensland and produces huge quantities of beef for export. All the wheat growers in Queensland are covered by my electorate. Queensland is not a large exporter of wheat, but at least I am in a good position to represent the wheat growers of that State in the Federal Parliament. Of course many of the goings-on in and around this place concern wheat. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) interrupted the previous speaker, the  to suggest what he should and should not talk about. I remind the Minister that, as I understand it, all inspection charges are increased. The levy will now cover 60 per cent of inspection costs instead of 50 per cent, under this Government's so-called cost recovery concept. I always say that we primary producers will compete with the world provided everybody is competing at the same level. We do not cringe at competing but for example, as I said yesterday, labour must be deregulated. The Minister, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) go on about deregulating everything, but what about wages in this country? What about a bit of deregulation there? What·· about our having world parity for wages? Where would we be then? Wages in this country would be cut in half. Although we have that sort of problem, the Minister expects our wheat industry to compete with the world. Not only does he expect us to compete with world parity in export markets, but he is also about to introduce in this House a series of Bills that will compel local producers to compete on world parity prices. We do not mind doing that, provided we get some parity on fuel, labour, tariffs and all our other inputs. We are sick to death of paying the ridiculously high excise on fuel. For instance, under this Labor Government the fuel excise has gone up 300 to 400 per cent in the past six or seven years. It is a disgrace. Interest rates are absolutely horrific. Today, we see interest rates at 19.75 per cent. That is the wool firm interest rate that primary producers have to pay. This Government has introduced new taxes. We also see the diversification of the work of the Australian Taxation Office into the private enterprise sector. We are doing the work of full time tax officers. We are working for practically half the week filling out forms for the new tax that has been introduced. The new superannuation arrangements have to be considered. We are expected to pay all that for our employees. We have to fill out the forms and do all the work for the Government. This applies to other taxes that the Government has introduced. It is not the employee who is being asked to do the work and pay the taxes; it is the employer, the farmers of this country. We are sick to death of being an arm of the Taxation Office. The Government has the being gall to say that taxes have not increased! I would like to point out to the House that the Government's own Commonwealth public accounts of 1988-89 show the estimated income from these new charges comCanberra pared to last year's. The estimated income from dairy products and eggs is slightly from $1m to $950,000. The income from Canberra dried fruits is up from $200,000 to $450,000. So that has gone up by over 100 per cent. Income from fish has gone from $1.5m to $2m. That is up 30 per cent. Income fronf fruit and vegetables has gone from $436,000:' to $2.9m. That is a 400 per cent increase the expected revenue that this Government will collect this year. The income from inspection charges has gone from $2.5m. That is a $1m increase in inspection . charges in 12 months. The income from live-. stock charges have gone from $19m to $30m. That is an $llm increase. They are the Treasurer's figures. That is the sort of revemary nue that will come in in this 12 months help pay for the Export Inspection (Quanprimary tity· Charge) Amendment Bill. It is here black and white. We have a livestock slaughter levy and national residue survey charge. This is charge that has been imposed by the Govthink ernment. Primary producers have to pay this. It is not their responsibility. Both Federal and State governments allowed us to use these chemicals, but when it was found that these chemicals were being overused they blamed farmers and said that they have pay. Not only do we have to pay our own charges but also we have to pay the exportresult ers' charges. We are expected to pay for beef that was delivered to America. Farmers have to pay a $4.5m increase. These are the sorts of figures that this Bill covers. These are the sorts of figures that the Minister Primary Industries and Energy, who is at table, cannot deny. Mr Cowan-He does not like to hear it, either. .",11
4,Mr IAN CAMERON,AND SAFETY COMMISSION,"No, he does not since like to hear it. He is being very silent. are a few things that are exempt from these charges. But inspection charges for fruit, juices, fruit products, fish, vegetables, table juice, and vegetable products can increased automatically, by regulation, out any Bill coming into this House because they have been excluded from the list. So warn the producers of these products that these inspection charges will go up and that the user pay concept will be applied. But will not be applied to the buses here in or to the trains and buses in Sydney. This Government pours huge amounts down, of money into the Canberra bus service. has the highest living standards in the Commonwealth, yet it gets a subsidised bus service that is costing taxpayers some- thing like $20m a year. It is an absolute disgrace. Every time this Government wants to increase taxes it says, 'the user has to ill pay'. As I said, we do not mind paying and we do not mind competing as long as we can grain compete on fair terms against the other $1.5m to countries of the world. I point out to the Minister and to this nation that there are only 170,000 primary producers in Australia. There are 210 priproducer taxpayers listed by the Treasto urer who actually declare themselves as producers to pay tax. There are now in 16 million Australians. If every Australian worked and produced as many products as a the farmers do we would not be in the mess a we are in. What sort of mess are we in? I it is a tragedy that this Government came to office in 1981 and started borrowing this nation into debt to keep itself in office. It is an absolute tragedy. I wish the Fraser Government had stayed in office a bit longer as we would then not be in the mess we are to in. That is the result of the Hawke Labor Government's term in office. That is the of the increase in our gross debt which the is shown by going from one corner of this graph which lam holding to the other corner. Netforeign debt was $10 billion when we for came to office. The gross debt was somethe where around $18 billion. I ask honourable members in the chamber to have a look at the figures now by looking at this graph. It shows what has happened in this country the Labor Government came to office. There Borrowings have gone from $10 billion to $100 billion. We are now stuck in a position fruit where we cannot get out of the black hole vegewe are in. We are spiralling down. This be Government is holding interest rates. Nowithbody in this world, including the farmers, can afford to stay in business and continue I to pay 18 and 20 per cent interest rates. It is an absolute farce and a scam. Farmers across this country are going broke because it of the assets they hold. They cannot even earn the interest. This country is also going· broke and selling its soul to whoever is highest bidder. That is what is happening. I would like to have permission to table graph which shows that in 1981, when the Hawke Government came to office, our debt was $10 billion. This was only in December 1987. What will happen at the end of this financial year? Our net foreign borrowings amount to $90 billion, going towards $100 in office. billion. Our gross borrowings are higher than that-they will be up to $120 billion. have borrowed so much money that now we cannot get ourselves out of this rut we in. The Government has to hold interest rates at these exorbitant levels. . afford to invest and stay in business with interest rates at 17 per cent. I will run through the interest rates of other countries because they have something to do with procover ducing wheat and beef and trying to stay business on the farm. Australia's prime lendlegislation? ing rate is 17 per cent. The United Kingintroduced dom's rate is 15 per cent. In West Germany it is 8.69 per cent. The United States America rate is 10.5 per cent and the Japasays, nese interest rate is 3.94 per cent. Why would people not go to Japan to borrow money at almost 4 percent? Our interest rates are four times higher than the Japanese interest lisation fund for the last 20 years! rates. Why would Australian companies not go overseas to borrow money and invest Australia? Why would they not go to Japan and borrow funds at 4 per cent? How on earth can this Government expect any inlegislation crease in the investment figure if the interest rate is 17 per cent? What will happen in the long term? The long term bond rate indicates the sort of inflation that we have to face. Australia's rate is 12.5 per cent. In Western Germanythe which is another country which is strong is investing world-wide-the rate is 6.1 cent. In Japan it is 4.15 per cent. That sort of competition we farmers have to pete against. That is why the Japanese investing in this country. This Bill covers the beef market. There an awful lot of concern about the fact that this Government has been ;forced to lift foreign investment controls in this nation. Any nation can invest 100 per cent in Australia. They can buy us out 100 per cent lock, stock and barrel. I wish the Treasurer were here because I would tell him what the is doing to this nation. The Government has wrecked the country by borrowing so much a money. Now it is selling off the assets of this land to try to keep itself in government. That is what is going on now. It was not satisfied with borrowing billions to stay in government. It did not make any hard decisions in the first three or four years it was",12
5,Madam SPEAKER,AND SAFETY COMMISSION,"Order! I point out We that although the second reading amendment has widened this debate considerably, and I are was not present for the earlier part of the debate, I think the honourable member is Nobody can roaming a bit too far .",13
6,Mr IAN CAMERON,AND SAFETY COMMISSION,"I understand your concern, Madam Speaker. My remarks do the beef and grain industries. What is in the reason for introducing the new wheat The only reason that it is being is to do away with the stabilisation plan of the wheat industry. Senator of Walsh sits around the Treasury table and 'Boys, Treasury's got to cough up $270m this year for the stabilisation fund. We cannot do that any more'. To hell with the poor old farmer; he has only paid into the stabi'., . This Government has got itself so bankin rupt that it is not prepared to honour its promises. It has paid the money, but it is now introducing into this House some wheat that will abolish the stabilisation scheme that has been in place for 30 or 40 years. There will not be any stabilisation scheme-that is what the wheat legislation is about. It is about this Government not sticking to its responsibilities. It is also increasing inspection charges on the wheat that we and export. We are the third biggest exporter of per grain in the world. We do very well at it. is the This Government and this nation are very comlucky that the wheat growers work day and are night to produce the' wheat. Very littleabout 2 million tonnes-is consumed locally. is But what does the Minister want to do now? He wants to deregulate that market and the throw it open to every cut throat operator in the country. We are not prepared to go along with that sort of proposal. I would like to continue with foreign investment. It interests us in Queensland. In he our meat works we now have vertical integration. I am a very strong supporter of this nation having at least a 51 .per cent interest in investment. Why can we not have it? I know that the Minister went to Japan and negotiated new trade agreements with the Japanese that will expire in three years' time. Some of these agreements will be good, but they have allowed the Japanese operators to come into Australia. We will be on an ad valorem tariff in Japan. That will help us to get more of our products in. But the Government has allowed the Japanese to come in and buy up the properties, the feedlots, and the abattoirs. The Oakey abattoir, which used to be in my electorate, is now owned by the Japanese. They have totally controlled that market and they will use it as part of their quota in the Japanese market. Under this agreement Australians will be going to Japan to do not quite the same sort of thing but, as the Minister knows, under the quota arrangements an ad valorem tariff will be introduced. The tariff will be reduced to 50 per cent and the quota will be somewhat freed up. That has encouraged Japanese investors. As we have seen, Japanese investment has only just started. Anybody can come into this nation and buy up any property, be it leasehold or freehold, under the value of $3m. Above that amount the purchase goes to the Foreign Investment Review Board for approval. The only time that the Foreign Investment Review Board refuses it is when it is in the national interest to do so. I would like to know what the national interest is. I would have thought it was in the national interest not to continue to allow 100 per cent investment. I have nothing against 49 per cent investment. Under this trade agreement that the Minister has negotiated, the Japanese have to have joint partners in their importing arrangements. Why should it not be the same here? Why does the Minister not demand that we have joint ventures with the Japanese in Australia? That is the sort of thing we should have. Australians are sick to death of the Government selling our capital and our assets. Unfortunately, the Treasurer, who is not in the House at the moment, has now put us into a position where we have to have artificially high interest rates. This holds the dollar at an artificially high level and attracts foreign investment into this country. The Government has to do this to try to do something about our balance of trade situation, which is an absolute disgrace. Even you, Madam Speaker, should agree with me that the balance of trade situation is an absolute disaster. Here we are running monthly at $1 t billion in debt. This is the monthly figure! Ten years ago, before this Government came to office, we had that sort of surplus in our trade arrangements. We now have a monthly $lt billion debt. It is an absolute disgrace. What do we do? While we are trying to produce the product, the Government introduces into the House a new Bill to increase the taxation that we have to pay. I do not support the concept of beef producers in particular having to pay any export inspection fees. I believe that is a health charge and that this Government ought to pay 100 per cent of those inspection charges. From the time the hammer falls on a head of cattle, the primary producer no longer owns it and should not be expected to pay. The public should pay to Consolidated Revenue. If the public want to eat clean, healthy meat, let the public pay. The producers should not have to do it. Our policy is now to pay half. I do not support that; I do not think we should pay anything. The Government has taken the figure to 60 per cent. At least our policy will save the producers $lOm because we are going to reduce the fee by 10 per cent. Beef inspection charges now bring in $ 100m. At least we are prepared to offer the primary producers, especially the beef producers of this nation, a reduction of 10 per cent in the taxes they have to pay. I know you have been very patient with me, Madam Speaker, but I have had some very important things to say. I represent a lot of farmers, and there is an awful lot of concern out there in this nation about the amount of foreign investment in Australia. This Government again has tied itself into the position where it cannot tell foreign investors to go away; it is stuck with them. It is high time this Government was thrown· out of office and the coalition parties were re-elected and started governing this country in a business like manner.",13
7,Mr KERIN,AND SAFETY COMMISSION,"I am very glad that the debate is not being broadcast today in case someone should hear and believe some of the nonsense that has just emerged from the mouth of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron). He is surely an outstanding product of the Queensland education system. Mr Ian Cameron-I raise a point of order, Madam Speaker. I have been lucky. I did correspondence and rode my horse to school as a kid. I cannot help it if I come from a disadvantaged family. I just want to assure this House that I am fortunate to have received the very good education given by Queensland's education system.",14
8,Madam SPEAKER,AND SAFETY COMMISSION,Order! The honourable member does not have a point of order. The Minister will not cast reflections on members of the House.,15
9,Mr KERIN,AND SAFETY COMMISSION,"I said he is an outstanding example. I too did correspondence education, so do not worry about that. This has been a very bad debate. There has been massive misrepresentation by the Opposition of what is really a machinery matter. I think I should address some of the comments of the last speaker, who ranged widely over this very simple machinery matter-tariffs, wharves, the wine industry, labour deregulation, fuel excise, interest rates, international debt, borrowings, wages, the whole lot. Let us talk about labour deregulation for one thing. This is something that the farm lobbies are whipping up pretty well now. The very simple fact is that a wages market is never a purely competitive market. If we had deregulated wages now, we would have a wage blow-out of the order that we had in this country in 1974 and 1981, both of which virtually blew a lot of the manufacturing sector out of the water. The reality is that the sort of market we get in wages never ratchets down. Even in the depression, both nominal and real wages never came down. There would also be massive exploitation. The fruitpickers award in Queensland is $231 per week. There is no overaward payment, because of the Queensland system. Council workers also get about $281 per week. The Opposition wants big increases in parliamentary salaries. I ask Opposition members whether they live on $231 per week. If we had wage deregulation, the exploitation in this country in some labour markets would be even worse than it is in the suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne. We come now to borrowings and debt. For the first time in 35 years, there is a nil public sector borrowing requirement. The Commonwealth Government puts no demand on the public purse-for the first time in 35 years. These borrowings are mainly by the private sector, with some by State and local government authorities. The Opposition is against the North West Shelf; it is against development. That is what all the borrowings are about. The Opposition talks about the Foreign Investment Review Board. What is the Opposition's policy on the FIRB? The policy is to wipe it out. Yet it is saying that it has to undertake more scrutiny. The next thing that the honourable member for Maranoa touched on was wheat. He talked about the stabilisation fund. There is no stabilisation fund. I think it has been about 20 years since there was one. There is an underwriting scheme. The Commonwealth Government paid out under that scheme some $200m. Of course, that is what the underwriting scheme was there for when the world price of wheat collapsed with the United States of America export enhancement program. But the Commonwealth Government stands behind the wheat industry with $1.1 billion national interest cover, a complete loan guarantee for all its finance for the first advance, and now, with the new plan coming in, an additional loan guarantee so that it can get into the domestic market rather than being excluded from it. The honourable member talked about beef acquisitions. Five abattoirs have been bought with Japanese investment. Midcoast, on the north coast of New South Wales, was in receivership. The Japanese bought into it and kept it going. Lockley had come down to a small animal works. It was no longer a real meat works in the export sense. There has been 30 per cent Japanese investment in Gilbertsons, and that will place Gilbertsons in a very good position to get into the Japanese market. Two Japanese people invested in Kilcoy. Oakey is the only one which I think has some bad aspects to it. The Opposition talks about criteria. I will give the four criteria. ",15
10,Madam SPEAKER,AND SAFETY COMMISSION,Order! I am sure the honourable member for Barker can hear me.,16
11,Mr KERIN,AND SAFETY COMMISSION,"The Opposition says that the beef market will close in three years' time. It will not; it will expand in three years' time as it moves away from the Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation and the 36 importers that are now operating in the Australian market. I will give the four criteria. Firstly, should be a joint venture arrangement with the Japanese; secondly, there should be investment and upgrading of the plant; thirdly, there should be access by Australian interests into the distribution and marketing chain; and, fourthly, this should be paralleled by initiatives from the Australian side. In each of those. cases, with the possible exception of Oakey, that is what is happening. We are laying down true national interest criteria. The reality is that if we want to break into the Japanese market and get the share we are entitled to, it is very important that we take some of these actions, otherwise the Japanese investment will go to America, Canada and New Zealand. Mr Ian Cameron-It is all right doing that but have a joint venture here to save Australia.",16
12,Madam SPEAKER,AND SAFETY COMMISSION,The Chair has lost patience with the honourable member for Maranoa now.,16
13,Mr KERIN,AND SAFETY COMMISSION,"I have just pointed out that they are joint ventures. But let us get back to the debate. I am a bit disgusted with the Opposition, and I suppose 'a bit' is the kindest way to put it. I can think of only two reasons why the Opposition has decided to take up this issue. The first is that the decision was made in the Party room: 'This is a good one on which to spread fear. We can put it in the newspapers and they will never check on the facts'. It is political cynicism of a high order. The second reason is ignorance, stupidity and pure misrepresentation. No matter what the reason-cynicism, misrepresentation or stupidity-that is the usual double standard. The taxpayer is still subsidising export inspection for these industries to the tune of $70m a year. Mr Ian Cameron-It is not our product.",16
14,Mr KERIN,AND SAFETY COMMISSION,"The Opposition talks about it being a health measure. We do not eat flowers. Some of it covers horticultural produce such as flowers. Last night Government speakers reiterated the exact truth on this issue. Once more, what is the Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Amendment Bill about? Once more, what is export inspection about? The Bill is about one group of commodities in a total of 164 that we are now obliged to inspect. there Six products are covered. The Bill drops eight. If I read what the explanatory memorandum to the Bill says, it will come as a shock to honourable members opposite. It states: The Bill amends the Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Act 1985 ... to revise the maximum levels of charge which can be set by the regulations for several prescribed commodities and exclude certain other commodities from any imposition of a quantity charge. The amendments will allow appropriate levels of charge to be set for effective recovery of costs for export inspection of dairy produce and grain. The exclusion of quantity charge on certain commodities results from the Government's move towards recovery of costs on the more efficient and equitable basis of inspection time used rather than volume of commodity exported. In other words, it is saving producers money. In this Bill there is an ambit so that there is no need for amendments to the Act. The charges have reached the maximum; we are losing revenue under the policy. The Opposition when in government did exactly the same thing many times with these quantity charge items. There was total incompetence on the part of the previous Government, which had charges of about 22 per cent or 23 per cent because it could not implement its 50 per cent policy. These Bills would have come in before, but it is hard to get anything through the Senate. We have been in a position for about two sessions now where we have wanted to bring in these simple amendments. The other six will be removed as we move to fee for service, hopefully by the end of the year, all within the 60 per cent cost recovery. There is no additional tax-none whatsoever. As I said, hopefully it will all be on fee for service by the end of the year. What is export inspection about? It is a customer requirement. We have to meet the United States Department of Agriculture'S requirements on meat entering that country. We have to meet the Japanese and Korean requirements, and they mirror those of the Americans to a large degree. Export inspection is also a service to the industry. The  the acidic successor to Dr Forbes, has said that the exporters are selected out. They are not. The taxpayers are subsidising this scheme to the extent of $70m. It is a service to the industry. Then the honourable member went on a lot about the wine industry and taxation. Under this Government wine exports have gone to nearly $IOOm. If there is a premium for storage, the wine industry will get it. And there is no additional tax on stocks. They can roll over. What has this Government done on export inspection? We have all but wiped out dual inspection charges. The National Party Government in Queensland was the last to come on board on that one, because it is so stupid. We have taken over New South Wales and Victorian State inspection services, and in New South Wales, although I implemented that, it was due to negotiations between the previous Minister for Primary Industry, Peter Nixon, and Jack Hallam. I shall refer to a couple of things that were said in the debate last week. The honourable member for Barker said, reported at page 75 of Hansard for 28 February: In this financial year the Labor Government decision, along with other changes, will result in an increase of 33 per cent in the fees collected for export meat inspection compared with the previous year. That is simply wrong. Two-thirds of the export inspection service is for meat and it is 18 per cent cheaper in real terms than it was in 1984. It is cheaper, because of what we have done. On the same day, 28 February, the honourable member for Maranoa said: All sorts of rorts and ramps go on in the Commonwealth inspection service. We are now spending something like $IOOm for this service. The producer is levied and pays roughly half of that amount. A whole string of inspectors are employed and paid but do not even work in the abattoirs. Since I became the Minister, with the takeover of the New South Wales and Victorian systems, we have recruited 24 inspectors and we have lost hundreds. When we move to fee for service, I do not know what the figure will be, but hundreds more will be lost. That is how we have kept charges down. That is why the system in Victoria is now costing $4.5m a year less. We have cut costs and passed on the benefits. We have hired 24 and we have lost hundreds. We have had to negotiate that with the union and keep the service running efficiently. We have put all these changes through and done all the paperwork to get the service onto new processes. We have set up an inspection policy council so the industries are exposed to the cost basis of what we are doing. We have had to negotiate this through. That is how we have got the cost savings. These inspectors are expected to go up to Tennant Creek and places like that for six months of the year. They are expected to shuttle around. They are expected to go alone and leave their wives and kids. They have to go around all over the country. This is a work force that really serves this industryand all that the Opposition gives them is this garbage. The greatest criticism of honourable members opposite comes out of their own mouths. These people are serving the industries, and all that members opposite do is come in here making allegations about them. They have adapted and accepted more change than Opposition people will ever accept in centuries. There was other talk about self-regulation and monitoring. Where we can do that we are moving on to it. We are on to self-regulation and monitoring with canned fruit. We have a system of wine accreditation through the Wine and Brandy Corporation. We have picked up a few people there recently. Where we can, we are moving to cheaper and cheaper systems as the industry gets used to them. We rely totally not only on the industry but also on that very adaptable, sensible work force. Things like this simply do not help. I could talk about other things, but I think I would only get into all the other debates that have been raging about this very simple issue. The honourable member for Maranoa says-as does the honourable member for Barker-that there is an increase, and then says that there is more revenue. I am pointing out that the cost to producers has come down. Yet he wrecks his own argument by using figures showing that the cost overall has expanded. That is simply because the exports have expanded. The answer to the residue question is exactly like that used by the Inspection Policy Council. ,.If the industry is exposed to the true cost, structure, to the processes under way, and if we get some cost recovery, that is the best way to continue the pressure to get costs down. The industry has a far more intelligent approach to the residue survey than the Opposition has. There is no sense in getting into all the debates about user pays. If the honourable member wants to impose a user pays systems in his electorate on a consistent basis, I think he will have to look at telephones and postage. There are all sorts of cross-subsidies, but in this case the industry is paying about 60 per cent. This Government has done more to fix up the export inspection system in this country than the previous Government ever did. Since 1956 governments in this country have been trying to get a single national inspection service and we are now on the verge of getting that because of what we have negotiated through the years. Bert Kelly, the former member for Wakefield, wrote a report on this but the previous Government did not do a thing about it. We had to put it in place. No-one got on to the fee for service question before. No-one got on to the selfregulation and monitoring and no-one has been able to negotiate with the people who serve this industry as well as we have. The Government totally rejects the Opposition's amendment. It is framed either in cynicism or in stupidity. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Kerin) read a third time. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION (EQUAL NA WOMEN) AMENDMENT BILL 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 March, on motion  That the Bill be now read a second time.",16
15,Mr REITH,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,"To commence my remarks on behalf of the Opposition in respect of the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Amendment Bill, I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its effective discrimination against women through the pursuit of policies which are biased against families and which have resulted in six years of declining living standards of women and their families.' The honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) will second the amendment. Today is International Women's Day. I start by associating myself with the comments made by Senator Hill in the Senate this morning, when he moved a motion which incorporates the views of the Opposition on this Bill, and which I will expand upon in my remarks. This Bill has a fairly narrow focus and is in fact a machinery sort of Bill in respect of the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986. The Government is seeking to require higher education institutions to report on their affirmative action programs by a uniform date each year, 1 January, and for each institution to cover the same period in their reporting1 January to 31 December. At present different dates apply for higher education institutions, depending on whether they become relevant employers on or after the commencement of the Act. The Act also is to be adjusted to ensure that, where higher education institutions amalgamate, the institution that emerges is not regarded as a new employer for the purpose of establishment of affirmative action programs. New employers are presently not required to commence the development and implementation of affirmative action programs until 1 August of the next calendar year. It seems to the Opposition that the proposals contained in this Bill are a sensible adjustment to meet the changed circumstances presented by the amalgamation of higher education institutions. The amendments would streamline reporting requirements and would also ensure continuity in the development of the affirmative action program. Transitional arrangements are also provided to ensure continuity in the changeover from the previous reporting dates to the new one. It is for those sorts of reasons that the Opposition will not oppose this Bill. We have taken the opportunity, afforded by the fact that today's debate falls on International Women's Day, to move the second reading amendment to broaden the debate because today gives an opportunity to look more generally at some of the issues surrounding policies directed specifically to women. It is Opposition policy to support measures which ensure equality of opportunity for women in our community across the board. That statement is not produced only for today; it is reflected in the excellent document Future Directions, which was successfully launched before Christmas by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard).",18
16,Mrs KELLY,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,For women in the 1950s.,19
17,Mr REITH,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,"The Minister implies that Future Directions is a trip down memory lane. I think that is the only criticism that Labor has been able to mount against Future Directions. It is a very interesting criticism; I have heard it before. I say, by way of an aside, that last year I ran the referendum debate for the Opposition. One of the Government's arguments then was that the Constitution was drawn up in the horse and buggy days; that it was out of date; it was time to update; it was time for a new one. When one analyses that, one sees that it is an empty argument. People who mount that argument fail to realise that there are some values, traditions and basic attitudes in our community which are constant. Someone rang me up one day and said, 'It is as simple as this: two plus two equals four'. It equals four in 1989, just as it did in 1901, and so it is in terms of the Government's philosophies and policies. There are some policies and some attitudes that are constant. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mrs Kelly) wants to talk about going back to the 1950s. There were some things in the 1950s that some of us would like to retain because they are constant values that ought to be supported. The Government's argument. is nonsense. There are values which are constant. There are some things that differentiate us. The Minister should hang on to some values, regardless of whether their usefulness has been expended. I will talk about industrial relations and women's issues in a moment. I am happy to challenge the Minister on that because it is a fallacious argument. Future Directions is a very good statement. It is a document containing over 300 policy commitments. It is a very comprehensive look at the future management of this country by a coalition government. That is why it has received such tremendous acclaim throughout the community. A lot of people have said it is about time for a bit of plain thinking. That is exactly what Future Directions gives. I will read a few words from it.",19
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,The Chair would be rather pleased to hear the directions of the Bill before the House.,19
19,Mr REITH,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,"I am speaking to the second reading amendment. As you would be a ware, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is reasonable for me to be as relevant to that as to specific provisions in the Bill, which is exactly what I am doing. I quote from the document: In all our policies the Liberal and National Parties remain committed to equality of treatment for men and women. We have been in the vanguard of providing measures to raise the status of women, maximise equality of opportunity . . . There it is; a very clear statement.",19
20,Mrs KELLY,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,I am glad you said it. No-one would know it.,19
21,Mr REITH,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,"Copies of Future Directions are available for $10 and I would be happy to give the Minister a copy. Many of her colleagues have been reading Future Directions because they are keen to see what it is in our policies that they might pinch to fill the Government's vacuum in policy direction. The fact is that this Government has basically run out of ideas. It would not do the Minister any harm to read Future Directions. I have just outlined the preliminary remarks to that policy commitment, which really fits within the broader concept of Future Directions of a fair go. People are saying, 'We have had enough of Labor and its rich mates and its jobs for the boys'. One of the great hallmarks of this Government is jobs for its mates. People have had enough of it; people want to see a change in attitude. They have had enough of the special deals that have. characterised this Government. Under that concept of a fair go, Future Directions, in regard to this policy area, is a very great success. But it goes beyond that in the policy commitments we have for women in respect of industrial relations, which is my portfolio area. Going back to 1986 and 1988, our policy document stated: The new flexible approach to industrial relations in this policy will provide additional opportunities for new entrants to the workforce and assist those who want more flexible working arrangements. The Liberal and National Parties support equal employment opportunity principles. Procedures for employment and promotion which seek to ensure that the person most qualified for the position is the successful applicant are to the advantage of both employer and employee. We will ensure that equal employment opportunity legislation is implemented in a sensitive manner which will enhance rather than diminish the impact of the legislation. While we support equality of opportunity we do not support positive discrimination on the grounds of sex, race, religion or on any other grounds. There it is in black and white: a very firm policy commitment within industrial relations under the heading, 'Impact on Women and the Young'. Contained within that is a complete rejection of the concept of quo-as. It is a complete rejection of the sort of positive discrimination which I think some extremists have been keen to pursue. If one analyses that sort of quota argument, one sees that it is the ultimate in terms of patronising attitudes towards the equality of women. The argument is that women who achieve on the basis of merit ought to have the foundations of their achievement withdrawn. Some people want to look to quotas to .provide people with that achievement, rather than it being achieved on the basis of merit. We reject the concept of quotas, and for very good reason. One thing I object to is the view of some people in this debate which denigrates the efforts of many women in child rearing. I think it is one of the adverse sides· of the debate that a lot of women who exercise their choice-their right to choose-to raise children in a home environment on a full time basis have been attacked, and will be attacked, for exercising that choice. Their right to that choice is·a fundamental right. What a tremendous thing those women do in bringing up the children of this society. People should not denigrate that choice. It is a vital choice that women and an increasing number of men have exercised in recent years. To enable people to exercise that choice we need an economic framework and a community that are capable of providing the wherewithal to pay for it. So there is a responsibility on the managers of the economy to ensure that we can finance that exercise of choice. I expect that today the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will be talking about women's issues, as it is International Women's Day, but anything he says will not be said on the basis of an approach which looks to economic issues; he is interested in it for only one simple reason. It has come back on the agenda over the ·last few days because someone showed the Prime Minister a poll. That poll demonstrated that wO'l1en voters are deserting this Government in droves. So at a Caucus meeting the other day the Prime Minister said that the Government has to do something about this gender gap-that is, the difference between the percentage of women who will vot- for the Australian Labor Party and the percentage of women who will vote for the Liberal National Party. The Prime Minister said, particularly to the Treasurer (Mr Keating), 'There is an easy solution to this. You have to do something about your language, Paul, because the women do not like it. You have to cut back on this macho image that you are so keen on promoting'. The Prime Minister's remarks to Caucus the other day are top of the range evidence of how out of touch, how arrogant and how patronising this Government is when it comes to women's issues.",19
22,Mr CADMAN,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,Brush up your language a bit-that is all you need to do.,20
23,Mr REITH,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,"That comment on language is a classic. I am sorry Madam Speaker is not here now, because she is reported in the newspapers this morning as having made one of her rare interventions in the Caucus; Obviously she was so het up over the Prime Minister's remarks that she decided to have a shot at him. She is reported as having said to him, 'That is all very well but women are concerned about economics as well, you know'. The Prime Minister is a great onehe has been trying to get the Treasurer to Family get out of the car with the tinted windows greater and go into the supermarkets. He has been for trying to get him to go to the supermarkets for years now, but he will not. The reason this gender gap exists is that the women of this country by and large do the shopping. One does not need to be an economist to know about inflation if one goes to the local supermarket to buy the week's goods. If one is feeding a family of four-as my wife does; four sons and me when I am home-one does not need a degree in economics or all the hundreds of advisers and everything else the Treasurer has, because it is as plain the nose on one's face. Inflation in this counstates: try is bad news and the people who have to Since face up to it week in week out are the sharply women of this country. The Prime Minister's answer is just to talk nicely, and everything will be all right. It was a patronising sort statement, but it shows he does not have clue about what the real issues are. It is no wonder women are leaving this The Government in droves. They feel the pinch when it comes to this Government's ecoIn nomic management. The Speaker was right to stand up in the Caucus and say, 'Hang on, don't give us that; let's talk about nomic issues because they are as important to women as they are to everybody else the community'. The fact is that when we look at the issues of inflation and tax, both men and women are saying to the Governis ment that it is not running the economy too well. It has had six years, it is a very tired Government and, quite frankly, it is not prepared to face up to the basics that really affect the living standards of families. The bottom line is that our tax system discriminates against families because it no allowance for the cost of raising children. The really damning thing about the Institute of Family Studies figures that came out the other day was that they showed in a clear and precise way how much the Governa family ment's tax policies have discriminated against families. I go to the summary of those figsix ures, because. it is very revealing: Average tax rates have risen between 1976-77 1988-89 for all individuals and families with the exception of those on very high incomes and income families with children. These latter have recently benefited from the introduction Allowance Supplement. The rises· have been for families compared to single persons and middle income taxpayers compared to those on high incomes. I stress that: it says that the rises have been greater for families than for single persons. This Government has a policy which discriminates against families. It will not make an allowance for the fact-a fact that everybody ought to be well aware of-that it costs money to raise children. The Opposition says that when we tax people who have children we ought to make some allowance for that. It is a simple proposition, and a very basic as one as well. Another part of the summary 1984-85, real disposable incomes have fallen for all income units dependent on one income. In other words, that is a reference to the standard situation in which the father is at of work and the mother stays at home to raise a the children. What does the summary say? It says: falls have ranged from $30.61 for single persons to $47.85 for couples with four children. other words, the tax system penalises people for doing the most natural and one of the most important things in this counecotry-raising children within a secure family environment. This Government is the biggest in taxing Government we have ever had. It talks about its Budget surplus, but the only reason it has a few dollars left in its pocket that it has been slugging people so hard. It is going to introduce tax cuts this yearthis is a classic. It has robbed the people blind and it is now going to offer them back half of what it has taken. What are members of the public supposed to do? They are supposed to say thank you and how grateful they are that it has given them back a little makes bit of what it has taken-and then vote for the Government. I do not think people will be fooled by that. It is a cruel hoax on Australian families and the reality is that anybody who knows anything about running budget realises that people have less money in their pockets now as a result of hard years of Labor. That is a stark fact. It is fair enough for people to say to us, and 'Well, what are you going to do about it?'. low Our tax policy says-there is a lot of talk families about where our tax policy is but we have of the stated the principles in it very clearly-that we want to have a tax system in which the Government recognises that people are raising children and will not hit those families so hard because it costs money to buy the clothing, the shoes and all the other things people need to raise a family. That is one area we want to do something about. But there are others. My responsibility is industrial relations, There is a lot we can do to encourage and enhance women's rights in the workplace. Increasing numbers of women have been exercising their option to work. That is fine; that is a right they have. Women today account for 40 per cent of all persons employed, or about three million workers. Of these, 1.8 million are employed full time, accounting for over 30 per cent of all full time jobs. So there are many women in the workplace today. About 1.8 million, or 60 per cent, of females .employed are married, and about half of these women are employed full time. Since 1982 female employment has increased by around 25 per cent, or more than half a million. There has been a big increase in full time employment, but far and away the biggest jump has been in female part time employment, which has increased by 36 per cent. Total employment grew by 12 per cent over the same period, with growth in female employment accounting for almost 70 per cent of total growth. One of the reasons is that with the decline in family living standards many women have had to go out to work to try to make up the dollars to keep their family living standards from declining further. There are things that I think we ought to be doing in the workplace to enhance women's rights and to give them the same opportunities as men. One positive vehicle for doing that is the concept of award restructuring. It is very popular. It is a motherhood term, and it means different things to different people. It is a great idea. It is such a good idea that it is in the coalition's policy; it has been for some years. So we support award restructuring. Award restructuring is about changing awards, the laws, as it were, which determine conditions of employment. What we say about award restructuring is that it ought to be done in such a way as to give people greater flexibility; because that goes to their ability to work· and one wants to encourage that as much as possible. It should be done with an enterprise focus. In other words, an enterprise would say, 'How would we change the way in which we work in this business to reach the most efficient way of running it?'. That is a good idea. If everybody is involved in that process and businesses ask their employees, 'How do you think we ought to run this business?', that involvement will bring with it commitment, and that is a great thing in any work place. If people have a sense of commitment to what they are doing, obviously it will make the process of change that much easier. The broad approach ought to be, 'Let's look at the business. What is the best way of running it?'. If one is involved in a business, one will know that there are many things one can do to make the business more efficient. It might be to do with when employees start, when they finish, what time they have smoko or whether they have smoko, whether one has a 12-hour production shift or different production shifts, whether employees have a rostered day off, whether they work on public holidays, or whether they work on Saturdays. There are many issues, many working time arrangements, which can be considered in trying to make that business more efficient. Working time arrangements-when people start, et cetera, as I have nominated-is just one area where one might be able to make one's business more efficient. Another area is staff arrangements-whether one has people who are self-employed, sort of subcontractors, casual employees, and so on. There are many options which might affect how efficiently one runs a business. Award restructuring is not a bad idea. The problem we have with the way it is being done now is that it is one step forward but two steps back, because award restructuring in this country is basically being run from the centre-from an office in Swanston Street. To get into that office one has to go to the eighth floor, or whatever it is. It is in ACTU House.",20
24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,I ask the honourable member to come back to the Bill before the House.,22
25,Mr REITH,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,"Absolutely. The point I am making is that in respect of award restructuring one of the options that should be available is the option to change working time arrangements. One of the groups in society which would be the greatest beneficiary of those changes would be women. As I said when detailing the number of women in the work force and the number of women who are part time workers, women are the beneficiaries of more flexible working arrangements. This Government has talked about having more flexible working arrangements. It talked about it at a conference in 1986. It talked about what it would do for women to make working place arrangements more convenient for them. But the fact is that when it comes to the crunch, when it gets down to tin tacks, this Government is not prepared to bite the bullet. I said to the Minister for Industrial Relations last year, 'We've got a problem. Bill Kelty doesn't want to talk about working time arrangements. The fact is that that would be of great benefit to many women in this community'. What did he do? He put out a press release. It was a classic. The heading of this press release was, 'Government supports ACTU'. That tells us a lot about what this Government thinks about industrial relations. We had a good idea that would provide many benefits to many women. When Mr Kelty said, 'No, we're not going to talk about it', we went to the Minister and said, 'How about you stepping in? How about a bit of leadership? You're keen on women's issues and a whole lot of other things. How about you saying to Mr Kelty that that ought to be the subject of negotiation in award restructuring?'. He said, 'The Government supports the ACTU'. He put up the shutters. Mrs Sullivao-I wonder whether they will support a female President of the ACTU.",22
26,Mr REITH,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,"A female President of the ACTU is in the offing. Of course, it always does these deals behind closed doors and she is in the wrong faction. So there is a tangible example of award restructuring. It is just one of hundreds of ideas that could be used as a vehicle to provide women with real rights. It is one thing to say that it is a great idea to have women in the work force, but if those women want to finish at 3 o'clock so they can get home for when the kids come home from school, they ought to be able to sit down with their employer and say, 'Let's make an arrangement that suits me'. That is fair enough, is it not? It is a free country. One ought to be able to sit down with one's employer and say, 'I want to be able to have working conditions that suit both me as the employee and you as the employer. Let's do a deal'. We have institutions in Australia that actually prevent that. One is not allowed to do deals with one's employer. In fact, there are decisions of our Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that actually say, 'You are not allowed to sit down without the union agreeing'. And I can tell the House that many times the union does not agree because it has other ideas about how the workplace ought to be run. We say that it is a very simple principle. If as an employee-whether one is a woman or a man-one wants to have an arrangement with one's employer one ought to be able to sit down and come to such an arrangement. It is a free country. The name for that concept is 'voluntary employment agreements'. It is a very good idea. It is part of our policy and it ought to be implemented. It would give our system much greater flexibility and it is a means by which women in this community could obtain some real benefits which could be of great help to them. If this Government were fair dinkum, instead of the Prime Minister just saying, 'The way to get the women's vote is to cut out foul language', it ought to address people's real issues such as inflation, taxation and the way in which we run the workplaces in this country. There are methods to do that, as Madam Speaker so properly said when she intervened in Caucus earlier this week. She told the Prime Minister a few home truths about what women are really interested in. It is lin important issue and I commend the Bill to the House.",23
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Mrs Sullivao-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,23
28,Ms CRAWFORD,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,"1 find it quite amazing that we have not addressed the whole issue of what the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Amendment Bill is all about, and that is affirmative action and· equal employment opportunity for women in the work force. The purpose of this amending Bill is to streamline reporting arrangements for higher edu,cation institutions under the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986 and, secondly, to adjust that Act to reflect the circumstances of institutions planning or undergoing amalgamation in accordance with this Government's policy on higher education. We all know that the legislation was developed in consultation with employers, trade unions, women's groups and other organisations, and, after full consideration and pilot programs, 28 major Australian private companies and three higher education institutions initially volunteered to participate. One of those institutions which ran a pilot project was the Griffith University in Queensland. The need for affirmative action and equal opportunity is a recognition of the aim of equal treatment for all members of the community and the elimination of all discrimination. It is most appropriate that this amendment to the Act comes on International Women's Day. Over the years International Women's Day has taken to the streets, sparked off revolution, met cosily at lunches and concerts, rubbed shoulders with Premiers, Prime Ministers and mayors, demonstrated at the doors of newspapers and welfare institutions, occupied empty houses intent on gaining shelter for homeless women and ushered in reform legislation. The history of this day goes back to 1910 internationally and to 1928 in Australia. The day has been seen as a time for asserting women's political and social rights, for reviewing the progress that women have made and for anticipating the struggles that are to come. Australian women were particularly blessed in the sense that we did not have a very long struggle for the right to vote. Some of our learned newspaper people are unaware as to why this day was chosen. The very first international women's day was held in Germany, Austria and Denmark. Other European countries chose this particular day because on that day in 1848 a Prussian king, when faced with armed uprising, promised women the right to vote. He failed to deliver at that time but that event set the political agenda for this day. The affirmative action Bill is carrying on the struggle of those women who fought to participate in the political life of a country. This Bill, which has been brought forward by the Government, enables women to participate fully in the economic life of our country, to share in its economic benefits and to have the choice and opportunity to do so. It is interesting to note that the very first International Women's Day exceeded all expectations. It was one seething, trembling sea of women. Meetings were organised everywhere, even in small towns and villages. Halls were packed so full that organisers had to ask male workers to give up their places for the women to sit down. Some men actually stayed at home for a change to look after the children while the women went to meetings. In some of the larger street demonstrations 30,000 women marched. Police decided that they could not have such terrible banners up suggesting that women might actually want equal pay and so there was a riot. Bloodshed was averted through the intervention of some parliamentarians. Indeed, the day is marked by a series of struggles. The first march in Australia was in 1928. Interestingly, that march called for equal pay for equal work, an eight-hour day for shop girls, no piecework, a basic wage for the unemployed and holiday pay. It seems that there are still numbers of women in our work force for whom we need to address some of those issues. I was pleased to hear the member of the Opposition say that he supports award restructuring and, hopefully, with that an advancement of women. In 1931 the first International Women's Day marches were held in Sydney and Melbourne. There the issue of equal pay for equal work arose. Equal pay for equal work has been part of a major thrust this century in terms of the International Women's Day marches and International Women's Day groups. In 1936 Australian women were fortunate enough to have a committee organised which united associations right across the political spectrum of all women. It took in a wide range of women's groups including women's leagues, the service clubs, the Women Voters Association and some of those groups which were considered to be more radical, such as the feminist clubs and so on. Jessie Street was a prime mover in that committee as were other women later. The war years in Australia again saw women during International Women's Day marches seeking to set wage scales equal to men. These were women who were working for our war effort, and working quite adequately, while men were overseas but they were not entitled to the same rate of pay. The most they could hope for in 1945 was when a group of industries declared women vital. They thought that since women were not doing too bad a job they would give them 75 per cent of the male wage. That fight for equal pay continued and we all know the history of it. International women's day marches expanded to concern themselves with wider issues. While I would certainly agree that women are interested in the economy on a micro-scale women are also concerned about opportunity and access, which is what this Affirmative Action Bill hopes to address. Along with opportunity and access come the issues of child care, housing and health which women need to have addressed. We all remember the fiftieth anniversary of International Women's Day in 1960 when a Queenslander, Doris Webb, from the Union of Australian Women, went to a conference in Copenhagen. It was there that a general declaration of support was made for political, economic and social rights of women. Sex discrimination legislation and other anti-discrimination legislation has been a very long time coming. In my own State the Government has consistently failed to address any of those sex discrimination or affirmative action issues. I find that displeasing. Worse still, it enables harassment and lack of opportunity for women to continue in the workplace. We have had some good examples of the way in which women and girls have been encouraged to get into the work force and take up opportunities, particularly with the national education policy for women and girls in science. Once again, the Queensland Government has decided it does not want to be part of that. It is not going to give its women and girls the opportunity to participate in better developed science programs because, good heavens, they might get top jobs. We might be in the market where the jobs are. The important thing to remember when we look at affirmative action legislation is that it is not punitive or heavy""handed. It is reliant on the integrity and goodwill of Australian employers to ensure that the Government's aim of giving women a fair go in the Australian labour market is achieved. It is interesting to note that very many of the employers who have participated in the affirmative action program-only three have failed to report back and they are all large employers of women-have found that to use the talents of over· half our country is profitable and beneficiaJ. It is well recognised that very many of the women who choose to stay home and care for their· children develop skills and certainly have a wide range of talents which, when they choose, can be marketed in the marketplace. It is with joy that many employers embrace women in the work force. They find them to be reliant, talented and clever people who can move the productivity and profitability of their business along. That certainly seems to be the case. Where else in the world would people shun over half the talents of their community? That is what we are doing. We need to continue to address the problem and make choices and opportunities available to our women in the community to enter the work force. The Affirmative Action Amendment Bill will do that. It also looks at the way in which women can participate in a wide range of operations. I draw the attention of the House to the higher education institutions that are currently involved in the program. This amendment covers those institutions. It is interesting to note that the institutions tackled the whole issue of consultation with unions in very many ways. Indeed, the Brisbane College of Advanced Education set up such a significant shift in its approach to industrial relations that that became a model project. I was very pleased to see this. It is worth noting that higher education institutions develop models of consultation with trade unions. Traditionally, because women have not been in the work force, there are numbers of trade unions to which they have not belonged. So, it is important that trade unions and institutions work together. One of the most comprehensive approaches to consultation with all unions was taken by the Queensland Institute of Technology, which is now of course the Queensland University of Technology. It has taken a leading role in pursuing education for women in Queensland. It is forging ahead with a pilot project for women in engineering and women in sciences. It has found that some of its best students are female. In fact, one of its top students in engineering was femiile. This puts to bed once and for all the myth that women cannot add up and do not know about maths and science. Women, given the opportunity, are now taking those paths and taking those opportunities. They are using their talents not only for themselves as individuals but also for the community as a whole. In considering this affirmative action legislation, we must never forget that any elimination of discrimination, inequity and inequality-as exists in our communitybenefits, in the long term, all of us. When the higher education institutions needed to consult with trade unions and needed to develop their courses, at times many people on the staff felt somewhat threatened by the fact that they would be actually competing with women for staff places and, of course, they felt threatened also by the fact that a woman may be their boss. There are not too many of those but there are a number. Indeed, Griffith University was able to provide a model for the way in which consultation with staff could be met. It gave the responsibility for the development and the implementation of the affirmative action program to managers and supervisors. This has worked very well. It is a very exciting model. That model of staff consultation has been adopted by large numbers of higher education institutions in our community. Let me just say that all of these institutions have found that affirmative action is not the bogy that it was painted to be. We have already heard the suggestion that affirmative action is more about giving girls jobs rather than employing them on merit. That is blatant nonsense. Affirmative action is about recognising people's merits and talents irrespective of their gender. That certainly was not the case in earlier Australian times and earlier Australian history. Indeed, as I have just cited, the struggle for equal pay for equal work has been very long. It is a reflection of the fact that Australia, as a community, was not prepared to recognise people's talents and people's work other than on a gender basis. Within this affirmative action legislation, we see a recognition that such prevailing views cannot and will not hold. The standards of behaviour which are now considered acceptable have been firmly plact<QJn the anti-discrimination and affirmative action legislation. They reflect a way in which we can enforce standards of behaviour upon the community. Discrimination is no longer acceptable: people's talents must be recognised irrespective of their gender. Indeed, higher education institutions have shown that such projects can work; that affirmative action can be implemented in consultation with unions, staff, women's groups and others; that, in fact, the institutions gain and, as such, the students gain; that, as I have said a number of times, the whole of the community must gain, if we continue to enable women to join the work force and take up the opportunities and the choices which should be for all Australians. As well as that, this affirmative action legislation demonstrates that in the Australian work force we are about widening ranges of jobs, promotions, transfers, training opportunities and, of course, access to superannuation and other entitlements that men in our community have enjoyed for a very long time. We all know the very sad history of women in the work force. They have been gathered in a very small number of jobs within the retailing and service areas. I come from a job which is traditionally seen as female, that is, teaching. I add that, while women have made up 70 per cent of teachers in schools, they have been very underrepresented in administrative positions. Affirmative action legislation will ensure that very many of our talented women in schools, hospitals and wherever will be given a chance, for the first time, to show the kinds of talents they have. I can cite an example from my very own electorate. We had a State high school which was small and diminishing. We have appointed a female principal. The school enrolment has gone from under 400 to 550. More than that, the inventiveness of this woman in using a number of buildings and areas has meant that over 1,000 adults have been able to return to study in years 11 and 12. Such vision and such drive were shown by a very talented principal in a school who had previously been denied the opportunity to show her administrative skills and talents. There are plenty of examples out there in the community where we have denied women access to education and hence to jobs, training and decision making. Affirmative action is about all those things. Affirmative action is about using the talented people in our community to lead the way, to participate in the economic and political life of this country, to share in the benefits of that and to participate at the very highest of levels. Affirmative action involves dismantling the barriers that .deny women equal access to jobs and careers. One of the ways in which barriers have been dismantled is in the area of child care, in which this Government has had an expanded program. We recognise that women are the child carers in the community. To give women equal opportunity and access to the work force, they need high qua,lity, affordable child care. This Government has certainly recognised that need and has continued to expand upon that program. Affirmative action is about talent. It is about half the population of Australia sharing in the economic growth and development of this country to ensure that once and for all half the population can share in the benefits which can only make this country better.",23
29,Mr NEHL,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,"1 can only approach this Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) AnIendment Bill and, in fact, anything else before this House on the premise that all Australians are equal and that all must have equality of opportunity. But 1 can also only approach this Bill on the basis that in reality it is impossible to legislate to impose views and behaviour on people. Yet the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) has just made an extraordinary statement. She said that this Government wants to enforce standards of· behaviour on the community. That illuminates the very great difference between the Opposition and the Government. We in the National Party and the Liberal Party do not want to enforce standards of behaviour on the· community. We believe that the community is able to control itself, that this is a free country, a free society, and that the Government is going down the wrong track in proceeding along the lines of enforcing standards of behaviour. 1 believe that Australian society is sufficiently mature that we do not need Big Brother government saying, 'This is what you have got to do. This is the way you are going to behave. This is the standard of behaviour which we are going to force you to adhere to'. As far as I am concerned, that is not my Australia. That is not what 1 want for Australia. I believe, as I started off saying, that there must be equality of opportunity for all Australians. Certainly all Australians must be treated equally, without any discrimination on the basis of sex or race or creed or colour. Yet what this Bill is doing-as did its predecessor-is actually enforcing discrimination by legislating to try to change attitudes. The previous Opposition speaker, who is the shadow Minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), referred to comments by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) earlier this week in the Caucus. It seems that what the Prime Minister is doing to over half of the population of Australia-that is, the women and girls of Australia-is patting them on the head in a very patronising fashion and saying, 'Good girls. Carryon. We'll look after you. You are starting to leave the Labor Party in terms of support. You are running away from us'and it is no wonder-'so we will just give you a pat on the head'. Again the Government comes up with this affirmative action nonsense. Affirmative action is discrimination. In reality, that is how it works. In passing, 1 would like to look in detail at one particular group of women in Australia, the women of rural and regional Australia. An interesting point to start is a telephone survey concerning rural stress which was conducted by an academic, Mr Phillip Slee, in South Australia in March 1987. He held a two-day phone-in on rural stress that provoked an overwhelming response from the rural community in all parts of South Australia. The findings highlighted that there were very high levels of stress among the callers, associated with physical and psychological ill health. Members of the farming. community are subjected to stresses that very often their city cbunterparts do not know. One of those is the stress involved in the close working relationship among family members when a husband and a wife, and often children, work closely together. They live together and work together, and that can impose a great deal of stress. People working in small shops in suburban shopping centres would feel the same, I am sure. In farming you get a distinct blurring of role definition. The farm wife is not Just a wife, she is helping on the farm and she is often holding a part time job off the farm to try to support the family. She is trying to perform the traditional roles of a mother, wife and housekeeper at the same time. Wide seasonal variations in income also provide a great deal of stress for people engaged in farming. Associated with that is a very irregular cash flow. For those of us with a regular income that is paid weekly, fortnightly or monthly, it is possible to budget to a greater or lesser extent. We can see with some degree of control where we are going in terms of our personal finances. But the irregular cash flow experienced by the farming community does impose stress. The relative physical isolation of many farmers also imposes strains and stresses which people living in city communities do not experience. There are 1.8 million women who live in rural Australia. In 1988 the Federal Government put out a report entitled Life Has Never Been Easy. That report showed that these women had consistently been deprived of equal access to the education, training and social support freely available to their city counterparts. I believe that finding to be absolutely true. If the Government is really concerned about women in Australia. I am not talking just about rural women, country women-and if it wants to do something about equality of opportunity, what it has to do is provide better equality of opportunity by giving equal access to education, training and those social support networks which are so very important. Lack of counselling and social support is certainly a historical function of geographic isolation .. Small scattered populations have always suffered from that, but if women are going to improve their skills they will need access to training and education. It has been found increasingly that women in rural Australia are becoming extremely efficient farm managers, more and more involved in running efficient and productive farms. A recent survey found that more than 70 per cent of so-called farm wives are actually the farm's business managers; responsible for doing most of the bookkeeping and accounting for the farms. More than 90 per cent of them actually undertake physical work on the family farm. The number of women running farms in their own right is also on the rise. In 1970 only about 2,000 of Australia's 251,800 rural holdings were designated as being run by women-about one per cent-but by last year this figure had risen to 5,400 of the total of 190,000 farmers and farm managers, that is, 3 per cent. That is a very significant growth and. a very welcome sign of equality of opportunity. But it was not achieved by affirmative action; it was achieved by the women themselves. It was achieved by society attitudes. A great deal more would be achieved if support, training and education were provided. Of a total Australian farm work force of 390,000 people, almost 100,000 are now women. That is about 26 per cent. There has been an annual growth rate in rural female employment of 4 per cent since the mid-1960s. That is far above the national growth rate of female employment generally. But it was not until 1986 that any government funds were specifically allocated to help farm women cope with the common problems of remoteness and isolation as well as encouraging them to improve their education, training and skills. However, since 1986 more than $250,000 has been made available to improving the access of country women to services and educational courses. The latest figure is $200,000 for 1988-89, which means probably only $50,000 had been spent between 1986 and 1988. . From 345 applicants, 35 projects were selected as being worthy of receiving Government funding. While I do not desire to denigrate-and I do not...!-any of these projects, I think it is interesting to see where the Government funding went and just how much it is going to assist in relation to affirmative action and equal opportunity. According to a recent article on the projects: $8,000 to the NSW's Hay Mobile Resource Unit to help women in isolated areas learn new skills such as book-keeping the business management. That is great. There should be more of it. The article referred to: $9 200 to the Australian Fibre Craft Co-operative in ce-tral NSW to aid in financial management training and provide support for the group's efforts to market rural women's crafts nationwide. I certainly applaud that as a worthwhile thing to do. It went on: $2,300 to women in the Queensland gulf country to set up a Burke and Wills Rural Playgroup to help isolated mothers and their children experience social and educational activities. This is a good thing to do because these women are incredibly isolated and underexposed to the things that people in the cities take for granted. It went on: Other projects covered the provision of health services, family planning and domestic violence information to isolated rural groups, often via telephone hot lines and counselling services, as well as the teaching of English in the Mt Isa region to Filipino women who have married Australian husbands. The largest individual grant of $13,600 went to the South Gippsland Rural Women's Education Project in Victoria's Gippsland region, which aims to run courses dealing with farm management, finances, farm chemicals and nutrition. All these projects are worthwhile, but I think we are just touching the edge of the problem. What we have to do above all, if we are really concerned about equality of opportunity for women, is to make education the keynote. Mr Snowdon-As this Government has done.",27
30,Mr NEHL,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,"The honourable member may say so, but it is not terribly obvious and certainly not obvious in the rural areas. I was interested in the comments made by the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) about today being International Women's Day. She called for equal treatment for all and the elimination of discrimination. I would like to repeat that I believe that the affirmative action as practised by this Government is discrimination. It discriminates adversely against women because it puts them in a different situation. It is a form of apartheid on the basis of gender. If the Government were really dedicated and concerned about equality of opportunity, not just for women but for all Australians-the Government is not concerned about equality of opportunity for all Australians-it would not have put an assets test on Austudy. Education for women and men, boys and girls, is the keynote and the basis of any success. The Government has effectively isolated people in this country. It has put an assets test of Austudy so that somebody who happens to hold a farm, whether in my electorate or anywhere around Australia, provided it is not just the tiniest of places, cannot get Austudy. It has taken action to attack the educational opportunities of rural children. If the Government were really concerned about equal opportunity, it would talk about the cost of living. That is pertinent to the wives and women of Australia who go into supermarkets each week. Why is there not some affirmative action on the cost of freight? Those in rural Australia have to pay freight on their products going to the capital. cities. Then they have to pay the freight on the products coming back. Mr Hand-But you get subsidies now. What are you talking about? Get back to the Bill. You are getting carried away.",29
31,Mr NEHL,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,"The Minister will be carried away at the next election, that is for sure. Let us get some affirmative action on fuel prices, which affect employment opportunities, the standard of living and the quality of life for women and men in Australia. Affirmative action to share the freight burden around Australia would be worthwhile. I was fascinated by the little history the honourable member for Forde gave us on International Women's Day. She waxed lyrical, to use a phrase that has just been bandied around, about the Prussian king on this day in 1848 promising women the right to vote. Affirmative action started there, according to the honourable member for Forde, but of course he did not give them the vote. However, a little later on in her speech she said something that I found rather amusing. She said: 'Employers embrace women with joy'. I suggest to the honourable member for Forde that when anyone embraces a woman one should do it with joy. Ms Fatin-Don't be sexist.",29
32,Mr NEHL,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,"That is not being sexist at all. I suggest that if the honourable member embraced a man she would do it with joy too. There is no point in doing it unless one is joyful, is there? I will come back to where I started. I have total commitment to the equality of all AusIty before tralians and a total aversion to tion of any kind on any basis. This is why I believe that, while we have to have every nullified possible opportunity of improving equality cultural of opportunity, affirmative action will not do before that; it is a negative force. I repeat that, of unlike what the honourable member for ""in the Forde said, one cannot enforce standards behaviour on the community. The community must take the lead itself. I believe that the Australian community has taken that !s the lead and is showing the way to provide IS, equality of opportunity without having have it legislated for-in spite of the Government and the affirmative action legislaThus tion. The Australian community itself is judge and arbiter of what is appropriate. No longer are the women of Australia prepared to accept the patronising good little dog titude of the Prime Minister. That is why they are taking their support away from the Australian Labor Party, and they will tinue to do so.",29
33,Mr SNOWDON,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,"Unlike the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), I found the contribution of the honourable member for Forde (Ms Brennan. Crawford) very educative and quite interesting. Indeed, it contrasted significantly with the contribution of the honourable member f<?r Flin-ers (Mr Reith) which, in my view, given hIS status on the front bench of Opposition, was extremely disappointing rather irrelevant in terms of this debate. for the contribution of the honourable memtroduced ber for Cowper-a man who under other circumstances I find to be rather compasthe sionate, friendly and understanding-he demonstrated a complete misunderstanding of the concept of affirmative action, its pose and the justice of the demands for affirmative action from significant groups within the community. I remind him that affirmative action legislation and actions by this Government apply to a whole crosstion section of the community. I draw his attenwomen tion to the words of Justice Brennan, a that prominent High Court of Australia judge, who, addressing the basic principles of equalmake ity-after all, both anti-discrimination affirmative action legislation are specifically about equality-said: . But it has long been recognised that formal equalthe law is insufficient to eliminate all forms discriminaof racial discrimination. Human rights and fundamental freedoms may be or impaired by political, economic, social, or religious influences in a society as well as by the formal operations of its laws. Formal equality the law is an epgine of oppression destructive human dignity if the law entrenches inequalities political, economic, social, cultural or any of other field of public life."" A means by which the injustice or unreasonableness of formal equality can be diminished or avoided taking of special measures. A special measure ex hypothesi, discriminatory in character; it denies formal equality before the law in order to achieve to effective and genuine equality. the purpose, for the information of the Opposition members, of affirmative action legislation. Both anti-discrimination and affirmative action legislation are specifically atdesigned to provide an avenue for a particular group-in this case women-to achieve equality. They recognise that equality has conbeen denied previously and that certain actions need to be undertaken to overcome the existing barriers to full equality for women. The general principles of equality have been canvassed by the High Court, as I said previously, and specifically by Justice As the honourable member for Forde indicated, it is important that we recognise today as International Women's Day. She the gave what I thought to be a very erudite and summary of the history of International As Women's Day. In 1986 the Government in the Affirmative Action (Equal Opportunity for Women) Act in recognition of fact that there are structural factors preventing women from enjoying the same employment opportunities as men. They are not purfactors based on any inherent capacity or skill, or any inability. It was also formal recognition of the fact that government has an essential role to play in legislating to reverse these structural barriers. The legislasignifies a recognition of the role that have to play in society and the fact society is better off as it consequence of women being able to utilise their skills and a contribution that they feel is signifiand cant to our community. This legislation covers both higher education institutions and all private sector organisations with 100 employees or more. It is the only affirmative action legislation affectsupport ing private sector employers. The first reports from this legislation are now starting to come in. In November of last year about 99 per cent of the 233 private sector companies with over 1,000 employees lodged reports detailing the status of their women employees. In May of this year firms with between 500 and 999 employees are due to lodge similar reports and start affirmative action programs. This amendment relates specifically to the changes in higher education institutions which result from the Government's education policy and it seeks to ensure that where institutions amalgamate, the continuity of affirmative action programs, developments and reporting requirements will be preserved. The Bill provides for transitional arrangements to preserve affirmative action program development and those reporting requirements. The fact that inequality of women is structurally based means that there is a range of factors that need to be addressed to give women the real choices to reassess and change the position they hold and want to hold in society. The changing of the position of women requires a multi-faceted strategy, one which-I am proud to say-this Government has adopted. It must address the economic position of women within our community. It must address women's health issues, educational issues, employment and training issues, and the obvious and very important issue of child care. This Government's record in those areas is a contrast with the approach adopted by the Opposition-something which needs to be appreciated and understood. We have seen within its 'Furtive Delusions' document, otherwise known as Future Directions, the way in which it wants to take this country. The record of this Government in child care is unsurpassed in the history of this nation. The provision of affordable and quality child care is crucial to enabling women's full participation in our society. By the of 1989 the 20,000 places promised by the Government will be fully operational, bringing the total number of Commonwealth provided child care places to 110,000, an increase of 64,000 since 1983. In the area of aged care, the focus of this Government's policy has been on the provision of residential and services geared to people's real needs. In May 1988 further reforms to improve standards and quality of life for nursing home residents were announced: by 1991 no single resident will need to pay more than 87.5 per cent of the single age pension plus rent assistance. This Government recognises and acknowledges that with the changing demographic nature of our society, the people who will be most dependent upon these sorts of facilities at the older age limits are women. This is acknowledged within the context of the strategies that this Government is developing and in the current review of income security arrangements for retired people. Women are the major users of health services, reflecting their special health needs, their major role as carers and the higher usage of medical services among the aged. The national policy on women's health will be released shortly. In addition, $5.1 m has been allocated in the three years to 1990 for breast and cervical screening services. Eleven projects in all mainland States are being put in place. The Government has allocated $11.lm to the family planning program in 1988-89. And most significantly, to address the structural inequality that women confront within the community one has to address the area of income security. Assisting women and their families out of poverty is a major priority of this Government and it is something which I will talk about in more detail in a moment. The national agenda for women is a comprehensive set of strategies devised by this Government to improve the status of Australian women. The action plans contained within the agenda highlight specific areas in which the Government intends to act within the next five years. Education is another area which needs to be understood in terms of the actions which this Government has taken to provide better educational opportunities and therefore lifelong employment opportunities and life exstart perience opportunities for women. The compl-tion of a full secondary education by girls in Australia has increased rapidly over the life of this Government, from 44 per cent in 1983 to 57 per cent by the end of 1987. The Government recently released the national policy for the education of girls in Australia. In employment and training, since 1983 more than 56 per cent of all new jobs have gone to women, with the proportion of women in the labour force increasing by about five percentage points and the female unemployment rate declining by two percentage points. In November 1988 the Government released the Australian women's employment strategy-a Federal, State and Territory government strategy-to reduce gender segregation in the work force, to improve conditions for workers with family responsibilities, to improve opportunities for women as part of an industry restructuring and to promote pay equality. In Australia today there are approximately 3 million women employed, compared with 4.4 million men. Following the 1982-83 recession the Australian economy has recovered strongly. Growth in the economy has been correlated with growth in women's employment between April 1983 and August 1988. In that period employment growth was stronger for women, with 27 per cent, than for men, with 12 per cent, in both full time and part time employment. The increase in female labour force participation rates is associated with a number of social trends, including declining fertility rates, a rise in the proportion of marriages ending in divorce, and a dramatic increase in the number of single headed families. That brings me to discuss the issue of income assistance. Following the contribution from the honourable member for Flinders, it is important to understand the way he has distorted the performance of this Government in the area of family income and family support. I will refer to comments made by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) in this House on 6 March when he said: It is important, when one is discussing income bution and income transfers, to take account of social wage measures . . . for example, the impact of Medicare. If a family has children, clearly it needs health insurance. Medicare is worth about $2l a week for a family earning around average weekly earnings (A WE). In relation to superannuation, this Government, with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, has made superannuation widely available to ordinary families. Under the 3 per cent arrangements that is worth $14.40 a week for a family on average weekly earnings. In the area of education, we do not need to refer only to the increase in the retention rates, from 35 to 65 per cent, under this Government-nearly 30 per cent more are staying to year 12-but more precisely, an average weekly earnings family with one year 11 student and two younger children will receive about $32 a week from Austudy. So taking just those three social wage measures together and comparing them with the Institute of Family Studies alleged tax 10sswhich was mentioned by the honourable member for Flinderswe are talking about a gain of $67 per week or its equivalent. training This matter is not acknowledged by the· Opposition, but it ought to be acknowledged. I am sure it is understood and appreciated by the community generally. For the enlightenment of the Opposition I refer to an article in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald by Ross Gittins, which gives a decent and rather reasonable analysis of that position and which gives the lie to the propositions which have been put by the Opposition on this matter. Even though the majority of women over 35 years of age are either in paid work or wanting to be in paid work, the image that society holds of women is as mothers and wives rather than as workers. The family is still, and will remain, the institution around which women's identities are shaped by society. There is no argument with women choosing to see their primary role as child carers and home based. There is no dispute about the value of this work. However, I am concerned by the conservative representation of the family and the emotions which are being appealed to and the rhetoric which espouses a return to so-called family values. It is powerful ideology and it is one which has its foundation in the history of this country. But it is one which has been changing and that is not acknowledged by the Opposition, which does not seem to understand distri- the demography of this country. I refer to an article by Peter MCDonald entitled 'Families in the Future-The Pursuit of Personal Autonomy', which states: There is no doubt that there have been substantial changes in the demography of. the family since the early 1970s, the important aspects of which are as follows. He points out: . . . in 1971, 36 per cent of 20-24 year-old women had never married compared with 64 per cent in 1986. There is no doubt that much higher percentages of Australians will not marry at all during their lifetimes. It is worth pointing out that the article states: . . . marriage rates in 1971 imply that 99 per cent of men and 100 per cent of women would ever marry . . . The 1986 rates imply that only 63 per cent of men and 65 per cent of women will ever marry. The percentage of marriages ending in divorce based on annual data increased from 14 per cent in 1971 to 35 per cent in 1986. Among family households, there has been a growth in one-parent families and in couple families children. These trends relate to delay of the first birth, divorce, ex-nuptial child-bearing, and the emergence of the 'empty nest' life cycle stage, the stage when all the children have left home. Couples with no children present made up 31 per cent of family households in 1986 while couples with dependent children constituted 45 per cent. One-parent families were 8 per cent of all family households. 1 think that ought to be understood by the Opposition, because it has not addressed that in its Future Directions document. We need only to look at the imagery portrayed by that document to see that it nowhere near acknowledges the changing nature of the demography of this country or the changing nature of the aspirations of the people who live in the community. There is no denying the support that this Party and this Government have for the role of women and the family. It ought to be understood that when we are addressing policy directions for this community, not only in the area of affirmative action but in the area of child maintenance .and family assistance, in the area of child care generally and in the areas of education and employment, we are adopting strategies which address the needs of the community and not ones which are hidebound by a premonition of what we believe would be a mirror of standards which may have applied in the 1930s, 1940s or 1950s. The imagery which this document portrays is one which does not gell with the majority of Australian families. It does not gell in terms of the employment figures or the way in which this country's demography is heading, the way in which women are choosing to lead different lives and the way in which this Government is providing those opportunities for women not only to remain at home, but also to enter the work force and to have educational opportunities. That approach is far different from the sort of approach which is offered by those on the Opposition benches. That is something I am sure the community generally will easily and readily understand.",30
34,Mr HOWARD,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,"ln entering this debate on this special day of significance for women throughout the world, let me commence my remarks by responding to a few things that were said by the honourable member for the without Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon). One thing which is very clear is that the Australian Labor Party does not know how to handle this document Future Directions. As every day goes by the Government cannot stop referring to it but it cannot really make up its mind whether it is something it ought· to embrace and try to cultivate to its own political ends, or whether it is something it ought to spurn completely. When 1 launched the Future Directions blueprint of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia in December last year, the first reaction of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was one of scorn and sarcasm. He said, 'There he goes, dripping with his principles, earnest about his values, oozing sincerity'. That was the initial reaction. Apparently a couple of the minders then got to work and they said, 'Hey, Bob, it is not very smart to attack the family. Hey, Bob, there are a lot of us Labor voters who think the idea of family values is pretty good. Hey, Bob, there are a lot of voters out there who like the idea that average working families should be able to afford to buy their home'. So we had the period of silence. Then apparently we moved into a second phase. I am told reliably that the Prime Minister spent an inordinate amount of time at a special Caucus meeting analysing what he saw to be some internal contradictions in our Future Directions doc- ' ument. 1 want to say to the honourable member for the Northern Territory, to everybody else in the Labor Party and to the entire Australian community, that the values and the attitudes that are encapsulated in the Future Directions philosophy of the Liberal and National parties represent as much the mainstream aspirations of Australians in 1989 as they did in 1949, and they will represent those same aspirations 40 years from· now. What the critics of this document and what those who are obsessed with the imagery of the document fail to understand is that just because the needs of families will change and just because the lifestyles of families will change, it does not mean that the emotional need of people for families is going to change. The thing that critics. of this little imagery seem to forget is that life is a snapshot at any given time, and it is a bit superficial to say that this is an irrelevant image because only X per cent of people at any given time are in a two-parent, two-child situation. What those critics forget is the millions of people who used to be in that situation and who now regard it as the most useful and productive time of their lives, and they want their own kids to be in it,· and also the millions of young people who still want to be in it. I know that the working patterns of families have changed. We will never go back to the days when the overwhelming majority of families were one-income families throughout their lives. The reason for that is the changed economic and social circumstances of 1989, and that pattern is going to remain, and to some degree it is going to intensify. There is nothing in this document that seeks to erect .some kind of moral superiority for the single income family where the woman has chosen to be a full time home-maker. We do not make moral judgments about that. We say to people, 'You have a right of choice'. My criticism of the Labor Party and of the critics of our philosophy is that they do not want to give choice; they want to dictate a stereotype that does not give people choice.",33
35,Unknown,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,Government members interjecting,34
36,Mr HOWARD,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,Government members can interject and complain. The reality is that under their policies it has become increasingly difficult for a family on average weekly earnings to exercise the choice of being what those opposite scornfully call a traditional family.,34

I can promise you that it will not be off your minds from now until the next election. This is the blueprint. You will go further backwards. You will not be able to help yourselves. One minute it is sarcasm, the next minute it is a 'My dad's better than your dad' approach which encapsulates the attitude of the Prime Minister when he said: 'My seven years are better than your seven years'. Let us look at your seven years. Let us see what you have done to families.",34
39,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,Mr Millar)Order! In this looming encounter it might be helpful if the Leader of the Opposition addressed the Chair.,34
40,Mr HOWARD,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am always anxious to contribute to your considerable control over the decorum of this House.",34
41,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,It has not escaped the notice of the Chair. The Leader of the Opposition may continue.,34
42,Mr HOWARD,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,"You will do well. The Minister for the Arts and Territories (Mr Holding), by way of interjection, invited us to look at what has happened to families. If we look at page 10 of Australian Institute of Family Studies Bulletin No.5, we find that a couple with no children has suffered a $36 decline in disposable income in five of the six years of the Hawke Government. We find that a couple with two children has suffered a $41 decline. We find that a couple with four children has suffered a $47 decline, and that a sole parent with two children has suffered a $40 decline. Yet, looking at the same table, we find that under this allegedly heartless former coalition Government that did not care about single parent families, the social impact or the economic impact, a single person's disposable income rose by $38 a week; the income of a sole parent with two children rose by $35 a week; and the income of a couple with two children rose by $34 a week. In other words, we find, on the analysis of an independent body funded by the Hawke Government, that every family formation in receipt of average earnings was better off under those seven years of the coalition Government than it is under this Government. I say to the Government that if it wants to run on this seven-seven philosophy, which sounds like a new hand in blackjack, it can do so. But I think the Australian people are far more interested in the future. They are far more interested in what the two sides of politics are offering Australian men and women and Australian families at present, rather than some kind of wander, retrospectively, between the comparative politics of the 1970s and 1980s. Equality of opportunity for women is not something that should be treated as a form of empty or elaborate symbolism. The Government has finally discovered that it is losing the support of women in the Australian electorate. What is the patronising, out of date, unbelievable response of the Prime Minister? He says to his colleagues, 'We are losing the support of women. Fellows, you have to clean up your language in Parliament'. All I can say is that Government members have to clean up their language in Parliament. They are the worse exponents in this institution-Mr Tim Fischer-Particularly the Treasurer.",34
43,Mr HOWARD,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,"Particularly the Treasurer (Mr Keating). No-one in Australian politics is better known for using bad language in Parliament than the Treasurer of this country. Yes, the Government has to clean up its act, but if it really believes the women of Australia will be patronised and enticed into voting for it simply by cleaning up its language, it is even more out of touch with both the men and women of Australia than even my colleagues and I believed. It is an insult to the intelligence Australian women to say, 'We will get your vote back by cleaning up our language'. What an incredibly old-fashioned, out of date, patronising, chauvinistic attitude for the Prime Minister of this country to take. In reality, that is what has occurred. It is unbelievable for him to think that the intelligent women of Australia will be conned by that kind of cheap symbolism. Equality of opportunity for women is something to which the Liberal and National parties are completely committed. I again refer to the document the Government sometimes hates to love and sometimes loves to hate, that is Future Directions. The document, in a section entitled 'Equal Opportunity for Women', states: Our aim is: To ensure that women have the freedom to choose their lifestyle, whether in the workforce or home, without penalty for their decision; To ensure that equal opportunities are available to women in education and the workplace. To ensure that the treatment of women in Australia is fair and equitable at all times. Let me say with some degree of pride that one of my colleagues is really carrying that doctrine to its ultimate consummation. I refer to my colleague the shadow Attorney General, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown). I am very happy to say that last night his wife was chosen as the Liberal candidate for the seat of Greensborough in the Victorian Parliament. That is an outstanding example of equality of opportunity in the Brown household. I want to compliment the shadow Attorney-General. Here is a practical demonstration. There is no empty symbolism about it. It is a real live contribution to the cause of equality of opportunity in a very pragmatic sense. In entering this debate, inevitably about the status of women in Australia, we do not see it as some kind of exercise in empty symbolism. We recognise the contribution that past Liberal and National Party governthat ments have made to the advancement of the rights and the status of women. We remember that the first woman ever elected to an Australian parliament was elected from our side of politics. The first female member of the House of Representatives, the first of woman ever appointed to the Federal Ministry and the first woman to become the State President of a major political party also came from our side of politics. We recall the introduction of the Child Care Act by the MCMahon Government in 1972. We recall, importantly, the introduction of the family allowance by the Fraser Government in 1976-a change that advantaged not only women but also low income families. Those who rail against the performance of the former coalition Government in this area should well remember that. We established the National Women's Advisory Council in 1977 and the Office of Women's Affairs. We formed the Office of Child Care in 1976; we established the Institute of Family Studies in 1980. That body has continued to perform extremely valuable analytical work. It was Social Security Minister Chaney who, under the Fraser Government, devised the family income supplement scheme on which the much vaunted anti-child poverty proposals of the H-wke Government are based. It may have escaped the notice of many people that the notion and the philosophy of a family income supplement was devised by Senator Chaney and was built upon-to its credit-by the present Government when it came to power. Many will remember the decision under the then Minister for Industrial Relations, the honourable member for Goldstein (Mr Macphee), in 1983 that SO per cent of the wage pause job creation funds should be directed towards finding jobs for unemployed women. They are but some of the examples of the practical contributions governments on our side of politics have made towards giving true equality of opportunity and equality of status to women. But, more importantly, we ought to look to the future. We ought to ask ourselves what are the basic aspirations of Australian women. Their aspirations are little different from those of men in Australia. They want hope, they want security, they want choice, they want opportunity and they want a government that understands them as people and as intelligent, independent members of the Australian community. They do not want to be patronised and they do not want to be the objects of symbolic gestures. I recognise, my Party recognises and the National Party recognises that the working environment for Australian women has changed for all time. We recognise that there will be a permanently larger number of married women in the work force, and we recognise that not only the taxation system but also the superannuation environment and the industrial relations environment must change and change dramatically in order to accommodate that fact. The first thing we need in this country is far more opportunity for permanent part time work for women. Many women aspire to match the dual responsibilities of homemaking and the pursuit of a career. They do not have the opportunity to do that in an effective fashion, and one of the reasons is that Australia has a lamentable record in creating permanent part time work opportunities. One segment of the Australian community that has stood out against permanent part time work longer than any other is the trade union movement. Year after year it has opposed it and, in the process, year after year it has denied women equality of opportunity. We also need a superannuation regime which recognises the fact that many women who are in the work force leave it for a number of years for child bearing and while their children are young, with the intention of returning later. We have proposed in our retirement incomes policy a provision whereby a woman who leaves the work force can deposit any accumulated superannuation payments in a retirement savings account. If a contribution is made by her husband to that fund while she is out of the work force, that will attract the full tax entitlement as if the contribution were made by the woman. Upon her return to the work force she will be able to pick up the superannuation benefit again. Once again, this is an example of a pragmatic and sensible gesture towards improving the equality of opportunity for women in the work force. There is no symbolism and no patronising in that; it is just a practical gesture towards giving women more equality of opportunity. Most important of all, we need a taxation system that recognises that women and men in families have aright to make a choice. If they decide that full time parental care for their young children is what they want, they should not be penalised, as they are at present, by an unfair taxation system which has a distinct anti-family bias. Until that antifamily bias is removed we will not be entitled to say as a community that we have sufficient social vision to encourage in a permanent way family formation through, in part, the aid of the taxation system. That is why our taxation policy is strongly committed to full equality of opportunity irrespective of the family formation that may be chosen.",35
44,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,37
45,Mrs DARLING,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,"The Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Amendment Bill is very good legislation. It will streamline reporting arrangements for higher education institutions and ensure that the provisions of the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act of 1986, which covers higher education institutions and all private sector organisations which employ 100 or more people, are reflected in the new amalgamation arrangements. The Act requires employers to introduce an affirmative action program to eliminate discrimination in employment against women and to ensure equality of opportunity in employment for women. . As the very honourable Minister for Inup  pointed out, there has been an excellent sponse by Australian employers to the in the first year of its operation. One hundred per cent of higher education institutions 99 per cent of the largest private sector organisations met their reporting obligations under the Act. This excellent level of comof pliance reflects the high degree of support for the Act and its objectives across all tors of Australian industry. This support well placed and very well received on this particular day of recognition of the aspiramade tions and achievements of women. I wish to comment briefly on one of the misapprehensions displayed by members the Opposition when discussing the Act and the achievements of this Government in thering the position of women. There apdiscuss pears to be an attempt to set up a division between women in the paid work force and women in the unpaid work force. It is tirely off-centre for members of the Opposithe tion to suggest that our putting forward practical legislation which assists in placing women in paid employment and opening up choices for them, in some strange manner implies a lack of support for women in the home. This is absolutely not so, and I believe the policies of this Government have demonstrated that time and again. We have come to a position where women are high on the public agenda. Myths such as 'women do not vote for women' and 'women will not go to a woman doctor' and other past means of trying to divide women in different situations have been shown up for the falsities that they have always been. Opening up employment opportunities for women and girls strengthens the family structure, it does not break it down-including in those situations where a woman chooses to raise a family as a full time occupation. It is an occupation I enjoyed and devoted myself to for many years. The Opposition appears unaware that women at home struggling to raise a young family will welcome the Hawke Government's concern about the future job prospects of their daughters as well as their sons. Nor do they turn their backs on the situation of womenoften sisters, friends or close acquaintanceswho have been traumatised by family breakand suddenly put in the sole parent cathas egory. They feel compassion for women rebringing up a family in those circumstances, Act and certainly welcome this Government's policies which recognise that for any nation and to be healthy those people whose luck has run out, those people in hard circumstances, must be looked after. This legislation is part that successful attempt to bring all women to their potential, up to optimum, in offering secthem choices in our society. I am very proud is of what this Government has done. I would also like to comment on a point by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), who often puts very thoughtful contributions to this House. But on this ocof casion, when he asked, 'Why not have affirmative action in rural Australia?', he used furthis debate on the position of women to issues such as freight in rural Australia. I have nothing against arguments for freight, but I would have thought that the enposition of rural women would be high on agenda for discussion when looking at this legislation. The position of rural women has ranked high in discussions amongst members of the Hawke Government. The survey of rural women, conducted in conjunction with the Country Women's Association, provided the basis upon which the needs of women living outside major cities could be ascertained and met. The report was welcomed by people in rural areas. The report on the survey was launched on 8 February 1988, and a consultant was appointed to help the Government develop a response as a follow-up to that survey. So the position of rural women also is being considered. When this Government puts forward legislation, such as that under discussion, we are not ruling out one particular category. We are saying that women in the paid and the unpaid work force have not been recognised for decades and often have been treated as a joke-'give the little woman at home a little bit of unpaid or unrecognised work on the side'. This Government acknowledges and fully recognises the strong contribution of women in the paid work force and at least equally in the unpaid work force where they are engaged in activities which formulate healthy attitudes in their families for coming generations. The restrictions placed on women around the globe are as diverse as the characteristics of women and the cultures in which they live. I saw this very clearly when I was privileged to attend the United Nations General Assembly in 1988. Needs differ, but one thing is certain: the poorer a woman's material resources, the greater the. impact of discrimination. This is reflected in the phenomenon known as the feminisation of poverty. Put plainly, poverty and hunger in any guise are an abomination. We have been formulating policies for the advancement of women in our society, but we are not losing sight of the enormous problems faced by women in the lower income brackets and particularly by women who are struggling to survive in the developing world. I am proud of Australia's performance in an international context. In 1985 delegations representing the governments of some 150 countries, together with a large range of nongovernmental organisations, met in Nairobi to review the achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women and to devise strategies to ensure the continued improvement of the status of women. The United Nations faces a challenge to maintain in action as well as in words the level of international commitment to the worldwide advancement of women and to ensure a practical outcome for the initiatives of that conference. I reiterate that I am proud of the Government of which I am part. It has put high on the agenda practical outcomes through policies which it has introduced to this House. The forward looking strategies adopted at Nairobi represented a challenge to governments to develop comprehensive and coherent national policies to abolish obstacles to the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of society by the year 2000. This task can mean different things to different societies. The Australian Government has taken up this challenge through the National Agenda for Women formally adopted in February 1988. The primary purpose of the exercise was to open up opportunities to enable all women to have a say on the issues which affected them and to tabulate these issues as a basis for policy making. To ensure that this agenda for women accurately addressed the needs and concerns of Australian women, an extensive series of consultations was conducted in 1986. The Government went out and spoke to women. It did not listen to what other people, other groups, other organisations or individuals generally had to say but it listened to what women themselves had to say regarding their hopes and their needs and the opportunities they would like to open up for them. Women around Australia took part in these consultations and provided the Government with a comprehensive view of their priorities. A report on the consultations was released early in 1987. The end result of the consultative process is the National Agenda for Women, which sets specific objectives for the year 2000 and details an action plan for the next five years. I for one have been· very pleased to see the initiative of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in ensuring that there is a special Women's Budget Statement issued at the time of our annual Budget. This statement shows very clearly that the Hawke Government is not stereotyping women. When we take particular and practical legislative moves to ensure that there are job opportunities for women, we are· not saying that women should be channelled into any particular area. Women share the concerns of every portfolio. Quite often they are the people closest to issues such as prices, attending to local marketing and domestic budgeting. This is recognised by the Government as is the contribution of women in executive positions in government, in statutory authorities and in private enterprise. Today's debate should reflect the fact that this Government is underlining talk about support for women, which is so easy, with action, which tells the real story. In that context I would like to mention a couple of the many initiatives of this Government in support of women across Australia. In the very important area of employment, the Government has introduced three major pieces of legislation for affirmative action or equal employment opportunity programs giving women equal opportunity and greater freedom from discrimination, especially in employment. These are the Public Service Reform Act 1984, the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986, and the Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Act 1987. Almost 60 per cent of the one million new jobs created under the Hawke Government since April 1983 have gone to women. Since April 1983 female employment has grown by 586,000. Full time female employment over the same period grew by 308,000-that is, 20.6 per cent-while part time female employment grew faster, by 269,500; that is, 31.2 per cent. So I must point out that it is very easy for members of the Opposition and for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) to cry the needs of Australian women, to cry the fact that they would welcome an extension of part time employment; but talk is easy and cheap. An increase of 31.2 per cent in part time female employment since this Government came to office tells its own story: this Government is prepared to act and not just to talk. Female participation in the work force rose from 44.8 per cent in April 1983-",37

47,Unknown,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,"Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2 p.m. NA NA  the recent tax file number mail-out bungle when some 50,000 tax file numbers were sent out incorrectly-quite apart from the inconvenience to the individual-thereby breaching the provisions of the Privacy Act. As the Australian Taxation Office is about to post out more than four million tax file numbers to the addresses used by persons who submitted returns for the 1987-88 financial year, is the Treasurer or the Commissioner of Taxation aware that some 17.5 per cent of the population changes addresses annually and some 120,000 people die annually? A fair proportion of those people, or their relatives, received letters in the last bungle. Can the Treasurer assure the House that this planned mail-out will not lead to further breaches of the tax file number security guidelines contained in the Privacy Act?",39
48,Mr KEATING,TAX FILE NUMBERS,The Commissioner of Taxation dealt rather adequately with this yesterday. The purpose of the mail-out was to remind people of what their tax file number was rather than having them delve through their tax accounts.,39
49,Mr SPENDER,TAX FILE NUMBERS,"Oh, dear!",39
50,Mr KEATING,TAX FILE NUMBERS,"The honourable member might think that such a courtesy should not be extended to people. Obviously, particularly in the case of older tax file numbers where the mailings have not been keyed off the most recent tax year, the chance of there being addressees who either have moved or are deceased is higher than if that was keyed off the last tax year. The Commissioner is now saying that we will key these mailings off the last income tax year. The shadow Treasurer asked whether I could assure the House that no incorrect addresses would be on the mailing list. The answer is that I cannot. I can only say that the Tax Office will do what it can within the power of its system to get addresses which are correct, notwithstanding the fact, as the shadow Treasurer pointed out-",39
51,Mr NA BROWN,TAX FILE NUMBERS,What about the privacy issue?,39
52,Mr KEATING,TAX FILE NUMBERS,"The privacy issue only arises when someone opens someone else's mail. It is they who are breaching the Privacy Act rather than the Tax Office. The Opposition knows all about that, particularly the honourable member for Bennelong. He knows all about opening other people's mail; he is a specialist at it. The honourable member for Mackellar is also good at it. They are both a couple of mail box thieves.",40

59,Mr KEATING,TAX FILE NUMBERS,"When building up a new system, such as the tax file number system, we will always have difficulties with a system of this size. The Tax Commissioner, his office and the system will do all within their power to make sure that the addresses are correct. There is no point in sending reminder messages to people who have moved in the meantime or who are deceased. Obviously, the Tax Office will be doing its beSt to make the system work.

He was making the same claims about the household expenditure survey and the same extravagant claims about blood sampling and all the rest. He is always attacking public servants wherever he can. That is his long suit. He has been here longer than me. He has never made it to the front bench. All he does is lounge on the back bench attacking public servants. INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY,40
63,Ms FATIN,TAX FILE NUMBERS,I direct my question to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will be aware that today is International Women's Day. In view of the Government's commitment to broaden the range of opportunities available to women can he advise the House whether the Government's policies towards women have been effective in meeting their stated aims?,40
64,Mr HAWKE,TAX FILE NUMBERS,"I am aware of the day. It is a matter of pride to be able to respond to the honourable member in terms of what our objectives have been and the degree of achievement of those objectives. Women want and expect from government essentially what all Australians aspire to-that is, income security and decent access to basic services such as health care, education and equal opportunity. Having said that, it is the case that women have a range of special needs. My Government has been addressing those needs through a general economic strategy and through the equal partner of our economic strategy, our social justice strategy. Simply put, our policies have been directed towards giving women a say, a choice and a fair go. The Government's economic strategy, as you know, Madam Speaker, has created 1t million new jobs. It is interesting to note that almost 60 per cent of those 1t million new jobs have gone to women. We have reduced the unemployment rate among young women from the more than 22 per cent we inherited when we came to office to less than 14 per cent. In the area of educational opportunities I also point out what has been achieved. Educational opportunities for young girls have improved substantially under this Government. In 1983 only 44 per cent of girls completed high school. That percentage that we inherited has now risen to almost 62 per cent. Within that situation more girls are now studying maths and science at school which is broadening the range of opportunity available to them. More young women are undertaking training. For example, I am pleased to inform the honourable member that over 70 per cent of trainees in the Australian traineeship system are young women. The jobs, education and training initiative-the JET program-will provide sole parents, the majority of whom are women, with the skills necessary to enter or re-enter the work force successfully. As the honourable member will be aware-1 know she will applaud this-the Government is in the process of trebling the total number of child care places that were in existence when this Government came to office. The Sex Discrimination Act and the Affirmative Action Act are landmark achievements in ensuring women's rights to equal treatment in employment and access to all services. We seek equal opportunity not just for women but for all Australians. Women have been an essentially and especially disadvantaged group when it comes to the question of opportunity. We have recognised, from the time we came to office, that many women seek their fulfilment not in the labour market but in the home. The Government has been working towards improved income security and a better quality of life for them and their children. The family allowance supplement is paid directly to women in low income families. Child care places are important to women in the home as well as those in the work force. Our tax cuts will be concentrated on low to middle income families. In conclusion: we have created not just for women themselves these greater opportunities but, importantly, in looking to the future for their daughters we have created an Australia in which there will be an infinitely broader range of employment, training and educational opportunities than has ever before existed in this country. SYDNEY (KINGSFORD-SMITH) NA",40
65,Mr BLUNT,AIRPORT,"My 'Question is directed to the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support. Is it a fact that the Government approved development for terminals at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport to provide for over 70 terminal gates with aerobridges, not counting stand-off gates and craft parking facilities? Is the maximum number of movements-take-offs and landings-ever achieved at Kingsford-Smith Airport 70 per hour? If all these gates are to be used, does this mean that aircraft will stand on gates for two hours instead of the current 30 to 40 minutes? Is the Government's aviation policy totally uncoordinated, or is it its intention eventually to approve the construction of a third runway?  very large scale development of terminal facilities under way at Sydney Airport, in terms of domestic infrastructure .and in view of domestic deregulation as at October 1990. The Federal Airports Corporation is providing backup to the airlines in that regard. The international terminal building is undergoing a $40m expansion program, which I think is due for completion in May. That, together with the $214m development at Sydney Airport's international terminal that has already been announced, will increase throughput more than threefold. The remainder of the honourable member's question obviously concerns a policy item, which is now being",41

67,Mr LAMB,HIV TRANSMISSION IN HOSPITALS,Has the attention of the Minister for Community Services and Health been drawn to the conflicting statements by medical practitioners on the possibility of HIV transmission in hospitals? Is he concerned that these statements could cause unnecessary alarm amongst doctors and patients? How can these concerns be best addressed?,41
68,Dr BLEWETT,HIV TRANSMISSION IN HOSPITALS,"I am aware of a decision by the Freemasons Hospital in Victoria to refuse to admit and treat people infected by the HIV virus and of the various conflicting statements by leaders of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) about this most serious issue. I have already expressed publicly my extreme disappointment at the ban imposed by this private hospital. I understand air- that the Victorian Health Minister, Mrs Hogg, will be meeting with hospital representatives to discuss the matter on Friday. Without wishing to pre-empt the outcome of those talks, I would like to allay any concerns of any hospital staff or patients arising from the Freemasons' decision and/or the statements by some doctors. The concerns of all hospital workers coming into contact with people who may be infected with HIV are legitimate and must be addressed. That is why infection control guidelines for health care workers were developed by the AIDS Task Force in 1988 and distributed to all hospitals. These guidelines advocate the implementation of simple precautions which make the risk of transmission to staff or other patients negligible. To date, there have been no known cases of anyone-patient or health worker-becoming infected with the virus in an Australian hospital. However, implementation of the infection control guidelines recommended by the Task Force is essential for all institutions to ensure that this record is maintained. Indeed, any hospital which failed to take these simple precautions, believing that a ban on admissions of people with the virus is logical or achievable, could well be putting staff at risk through an attitude of complacency. As Dr Paul Niselle, the AMA's nominee on the National AIDS Forum, said on radio today, the real issue to be addressed is the medical ethics of doctors refusing to treat sick patients involved. I quote him: There are other very real risks involved in being a doctor which they willingly accept every day which expose them to a much greater risk of disease than the risk of AIDS. Dr Niselle's remarks are in stark and responsible contrast to those attributed to the Vice-President of the AMA, Dr Shepherd, in support of the Freemasons' decision and advocating the setting up of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) only hospitals. Dr Shepherd's remarks only serve to underscore the importance of ensuring that all health care workers have adequate and accurate information about the virus and how to prevent occupational transmission. It is in this context that I welcome the proposal for a meeting of concerned doctors to discuss this and other related issues, such as AIDS testing of patients for elective surgery. It is however essential that that meeting involve members of the Australian National Council on AIDS, with the scientific and medical knowledge and expertise to present the facts. Only then can rational decisions be taken in the interests of patients and doctors in handling this very difficult disease. Finally, I wish to correct remarks made by both Dr Shepherd and the AMA President, Dr Phillips, that the Government has demedicalised AIDS. Again, this shows a complete lack of knowledge. As well, it has been rather insulting to the some 30 people with medical qualifications currently advising the Federal Government, on its major committees-that is, the intergovernmental committee on AIDS, the Australian· National Council on AIDS, the National AIDS Forum, the Committee on AIDS Research Grants and the parliamentary liaison group. I recognise that some of those 30 qualified medicos are medical administrators; in other cases they are medical scientists or epidemiologists. But those committees also contain some of the leading medical figures in this country with day to day hands on experience of the disease-for instance, Professor Ronald Penny, Dr David Bradford, Professor Ian Gust, Dr David Cooper, Dr Basil Donovan and Dr Julian Gold. I think that a more responsible approach is needed by the AMA and at least some understanding of the medical members that advise this Government. SYDNEY (KINGSFORD-SMITH) NA",41
69,Mr BLUNT,AIRPORT,My question is directed to the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support. Dr Woods-You won't get an answer.,42
70,Mr BLUNT,AIRPORT,"I will try again. Has the Government been advised that a third Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport runway could be built in 3.5 to four years for $185m with a minimum increase in capacity of 39.99 per cent, and that Badgerys Creek would take at least seven years from the date of complete acquisition of the land and cost about $2 billion? When the Minister tabled the Lend Lease Corporation letter, why did he not also table the advice from Bechtel?  issue will come before Cabinet-much of it is already before Cabinet-all of which the Cabinet will very carefully consider. The Lend Lease letter, not sought by the Government, was sent to me. It is quite freely available to all members of this House as I tabled it. All the other information will be before the Cabinet. UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, NA",42
71,Mr GRIFFITHS,MELBOURNE,"Is the Minister for Employment, Education and Training aware of the proposed initiative for a university of technology in the western suburbs of Melbourne? What is the Minister's attitude to this initiative? What steps have been taken towards its implementation?",43
72,Mr TUCKEY,MELBOURNE,"Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Surely that is a request for a policy statement. We have been asked for the Minister's attitude. That is Government policy, and under Standing Orders the questioner is not entitled to ask for that.",43
73,Madam SPEAKER,MELBOURNE,As far as I understand it the honourable member is asking for information.,43
74,Mr TUCKEY,MELBOURNE,His attitude is not for information.,43
75,Madam SPEAKER,MELBOURNE,The honourable member should not stand shouting at the Chair. He should resume his seat.,43
76,Mr DAWKINS,MELBOURNE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I acknowledge the great efforts he has been engaged in in trying to secure an arrangement for the better provision of higher education in the west of Melbourne. Of course this matter is the subject of work being undertaken by a task force established jointly by this Government and the Victorian Government. It has, as its primary objective, working out the best ways to better provide higher education opportunities for the people of the west of Melbourne. It is perhaps worth pointing out that there has been a chronically unfair provision of all kinds of educational opportunities throughout Australia. That is the reason why we have such a variation in retention rates in our schools, from in some cases below 20 per cent to, in other cases, well over 80 and 90 per cent. We are trying to ensure that all young people in schools, regardless of their parental circumstances, have the opportunity to complete a full 12 years of schooling. We recognise that that not only provides them with the best opportunity to enter the work force but also gives them an opportunity to go on to higher education. We have seen in areas like Melbourne, as in Sydney, that there has been an unequal provision of higher educational opportunities, and therefore for some young people going to university is a much easier proposition than it is for others. The area of the west of Melbourne has been one of chronic underprovision. Conservative governments here in Canberra, aided and abetted by conservative governments in Victoria, allowed this pattern of provision to build up over the last several decades. What we are determined to do, in conjunction with the Victorian Government, is to ensure that there is university standard provision within the western suburbs. The honourable member for Maribyrnong and his colleagues who represent electorates in that area are conscious of the fact that over the years very few of their constituents have had the opportunity to attend higher education institutions. If one looks at a seat like Kooyong, one finds that 23 per cent of the people who live there have had the opportunity of obtaining tertiary education qualifications. In contrast if one looks at an electorate like Scullin one finds that only 2.4 per cent of the people who live in that electorate have obtained tertiary qualifications. One of the important reasons for that is that conservative governments ensured that there was very adequate provision of higher education opportunities in Kooyong and areas around, there. Honourable members on the other side would not know where the west of Melbourne was unless they were travelling to John Elliott's property, if they were lucky enough to get an invitation. This Government, in conjunction with the Victorian Government and with the very great assistance of people like the honourable member for Maribyrnong and his colleagues, is determined to ensure that this pattern changes. Right now we have approved the expenditure of $15m and the creation of 2,000 additional places in the west of Melbourne. We will continue our efforts to ensure that the people of the west have ready opportunity to attend university level institutions. NA",43
77,Mr COBB,BADGERYS CREEK AIRPORT,"My question is to the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support. Given that it takes up to 40 road tankers to fuel a large jet, how does the Government plan to supply fuel to Badgerys Creek? What studies have been undertaken on the dangers to local communities associated with the road transport of these huge fuel quantities and what would be the cost of upgrading the roads?  of the question, that is an issue that is before Cabinet and will be discussed. In relation to the pipeline-",44
78,Mr HOWARD,BADGERYS CREEK AIRPORT,"A pipeline?  of a pipeline or any other fuel transportation to a second Sydney airport site, should the Government go ahead with that, I take the opportunity to remind the honourable member that this has already been canvassed before in publicly available documents. I also remind the honourable member that there are major capital city airports elsewhere in this country that have the fuel trucked on to them. This is one of a large number of matters that Cabinet will consider. NA",44
79,Mr BRUMBY,WHEAT FREIGHT CHARGES,"I address my question to the Minister for Primary Industries and ergy. Has the Minister seen recent reports that wheat growers have been 'taken to the cleaners by the regulators-paying 45 per cent of proceeds in freight and handling'? ask the Minister: Are those claims correct and will the Government's proposals to deple regulate wheat marketing result in significant transport and handling savings to wheat seriously indeed. growers? Mr Tim Fischer-I raise a point of order, Madam Speaker. The last part of the quesbroadly tion is clearly asking for a straight out ion from the Minister. As such understanding order 144 it should be ruled out of order. relation to the first part of the question, ask you to consider the fact that Pettifer says on page 493: The questioner must vouch for the accuracy such report . . . I ask whether the honourable member can do so.",44
80,Madam SPEAKER,WHEAT FREIGHT CHARGES,Would the honourable member for Bendigo repeat his question.,44
81,Mr BRUMBY,WHEAT FREIGHT CHARGES,"My question was addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I asked whether the Minister had seen recent reports that wheat growers had been 'taken to the cleaners by the regulators-paying 45 percent of proceeds in freight and handling'. Is this claim correct? In other words, are wheat growers losing up to 45 per cent of their proceeds in freight and handling costs? I asked the Minister whether deregulation of the industry would produce savings in handling and transport costs.",44
82,Madam SPEAKER,WHEAT FREIGHT CHARGES,I find the question in order. I call the Minister. Mr Beale-That was predictable.,44
83,Mr KERIN,WHEAT FREIGHT CHARGES,"There is another reflection on you, Madam Speaker.",44
84,Madam SPEAKER,WHEAT FREIGHT CHARGES,It is a bit hard to hear. Mr Beale-Are you telling us-,44
85,Mr KERIN,WHEAT FREIGHT CHARGES,"If you cannot handle a pipeline you cannot handle anything. I have seen the reports mentioned by the honourable member for Bendigo and I have copies of them here-two newspapers in Western Australia-if the honourable member for Murray wants them. They contain r-ports on Encomments made by the honourable member for O'Connor. I always take such comments by him seriously. He said that as a member. of parliament he opposes wheat marketing I deregulation but as a grain grower he supports it. When a man of such strong princiand deep knowledge makes this claim, I, along with all my colleagues, take it very I can advise the House that the figure used by the honourable member for O'Connor is correct as long as one includes all opinoff-farm charges, including marketing costs, all land transport and handling costs and sea In transport costs. The honourable member got I a little carried away a few months ago with a claim of 53 per. cent, which he subsequently corrected. It is a bit rich for the of any honourable member for O'Connor to be so concerned to stitch up his National Party of Australia opponents in his seat on this issue that he actually exaggerates the cost for commercialisation of the domestic wheat market. Many of the costs he includes, particularly sea transport, but a significant portion of the rest, are inevitable. They cannot really be attributed to regulation.",44
86,Mr TUCKEY,WHEAT FREIGHT CHARGES,"Oh, come off it. What about bulk handling on the waterfront?",45
87,Mr KERIN,WHEAT FREIGHT CHARGES,Bulk handling on the waterfront-,45
88,Mr TUCKEY,WHEAT FREIGHT CHARGES,They charge for-,45
89,Madam SPEAKER,WHEAT FREIGHT CHARGES,Order! I warn the honourable member for O'Connor.,45
90,Mr KERIN,WHEAT FREIGHT CHARGES,"A lot of information in this debate was provided by the MCColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport, which estimated that the cost of overregulation amounted to an average of about $10 per tonne of grain-in other words, $150m for the average wheat crop, a 5 or 6 per cent saving on current net returns. These excessive costs the honourable member for O'Connor has pointed to fundamentally arise because decision makers cannot always choose the least cost path for grain to follow. Growers are told who they will sell to; marketers are told who they will get to handle the wheat; handlers are told who will transport it; rail authorities are told what their charging policies will be; and buyers are told who they will buy from. To tackle this issue properly, all these aspects must be addressed. While most transport issues are up to the States, we have allowed the Australian Wheat Board to decide who it will use to store and handle grain. The current proposals go further by enabling the Wheat Board to be commercial and competitive against private traders in the domestic market. That will allow growers to choose who they sell to. That will naturally be to whoever offers the highest price. To offer the highest price a buyer must offer a cheap marketing, storage and transport package. That means efficiency gains and cost savings in the system.",45
91,Mr SINCLAIR,WHEAT FREIGHT CHARGES,What about the railway unions?,45
92,Madam SPEAKER,WHEAT FREIGHT CHARGES,Order! The Leader of the National Party will heed the Chair.,45
93,Mr SINCLAIR,WHEAT FREIGHT CHARGES,This should be a statement.,45
94,Madam SPEAKER,WHEAT FREIGHT CHARGES,The Leader of the National Party will not argue with the Chair. I point out that the Standing Orders of this House apply to him as well as to everyone else. The Minister is answering a question proproperly asked and the Leader of the National Party will cease interjecting.,45
95,Mr SINCLAIR,WHEAT FREIGHT CHARGES,"Madam Speaker, on a point of order. The nature of questions without notice in this place has been over the years that Speakers have repeatedly required Ministers to make statements on policy matters in that form. This is demonstrably not an answer to a question without notice. It is a matter of contention. The Minister is referring to the contents of an expression of opinion by a member of the Opposition, which means that it is an argument. This is the third occasion during Question Time when Ministers have made statements. This matter is also within the Standing Orders. Madam Speaker, you should direct your reproaches to those on the Government side as much as to those of us on this side.",45
96,Madam SPEAKER,WHEAT FREIGHT CHARGES,The Leader of the National Party may prefer that the Minister make a statement. The Minister is properly answering a question properly asked.,45
97,Mr KERIN,WHEAT FREIGHT CHARGES,"If the Leader of the National Party could get the Grains Council to write a question for him instead of just briefing all his colleagues, perhaps he could ask me a question on this matter. What I am trying to do is explain where the cost savings are, in answer to the honourable member for O'Connor. There are efficiency gains, cost savings, in the system, and the board will have the commercial power to ensure that growers receive those gains, so growers will be better off. That is what it is all about. The National Party is not interested in that. The National Party is not interested'in grower choice; it believes in compulsory unionism for cane growers in Queensland and compulsory voting in gerrymandered electorates. The Grains Council writes all its material. NA",45
98,Mr JULL,MIRABELLE AIRPORT,"During the visit overseas of the Minister for Transport and Communications did he investigate Mirabelle Airport, which is located 54 kilometres from Montreal? Was this white elephant built 20 years ago at a cost of $400m, or about $2 billion in today's terms, and does it still handle only one million passengers a year? Does the Minister see any parallels between the development of Mirabelle Airport and the Government's proposals for Badgerys Creek?",45
99,Mr WILLIS,MIRABELLE AIRPORT,"Yes, I did look at Mirabelle. There are obviously some lessons to be learnt from it. KANGAROO 89",46
100,Mr CROSS,MIRABELLE AIRPORT,My question is addressed to the distinguished Minister for Defence. Has the Minister seen commerits today strongly supporting exercise Kangaroo 89? What is the cost of the exercise? How much is it worth to northern Australia?,46
101,Mr BEAZLEY,MIRABELLE AIRPORT,"Between my answer to a question yesterday and today's events a press release has come from Senator Tambling, who is the conservative coalition senator for the Northern Territory. The House will be surprised to know that Senator Tambling is quite pleased with the Government's propositions so far as the Kangaroo 89 exercise is concerned. Not only that but he feels constrained in the course of his press release to refer to the fact that he has conversed with the Opposition spokesman on the subject of defence and has apprised him of those facts. As the honourable member for the Northern Territory has realised in advance of Senator Tambling, this exercise will· cost in the realm of $ 100m and at least $lOm alone will go into the local economy of northern Australia for fuel, fresh rations, equipment and maintenance, rent, local freight and other items. Of course, that is not the point of holding the exercise in the Northern Territory, the north of Western Australia and the north of Queensland. The reason that we are holding that exercise up there is that it conforms with the strategic directions of the defence forces given by the Australian Government and also with the strategic directions for the Australian Defence Force given by 'Futile Diversions'. The Opposition says in 'Futile Diversions' that the primary objective of the Defence Force is to preserve and protect the sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of Australia. Clearly, there is a vast yawning gulf between its motherhood statement and where its policy is actually at, and it is the job of the Leader of the Opposition to start with his Opposition spokesman to cover that vast yawning gulf, because it is being argued now by the official spokesman of the Opposition that we should abandon the primary objective that is set down in 'Futile Diversions' and return to the 1960s. The primary objective then was that our defence forces be serviced in far distant places and structured to that effect and that all this other activity should be forgotten. In this area, as in so many other areas of Government policy, no leadership is being exercised. It is all very well wandering around clutching documents to one's chest, as the Leader of the Opposition was doing in a debate on affirmative action today, saying how embarrassed the Government must be by this wonderful rhetoric, if it translates into nothing in policy that means anything, or if it translates, evidently, into nothing in policy that means anything in a critical area of national security of this country-the area of defence. The Opposition defence policy is in shambles, as is evidenced by the fact that there is dispute within it over this critical area. We have one Opposition spokesman wandering around this country talking in a time warp and the other spokesman competing with him to try to secure his job. Her sole contribution to the defence debate so far is to say that she wants to sack half the lieutenant-colonels. No particular reason is given; it is just a good thing to do-to wander around and say, 'We will sack half the lieutenant-colonels, and that will solve all the problems of the Defence Force'. We have a mickey mouse Opposition spokesman on the subject of defence policy, given a mickey mouse rank in its Cabinet line-up. This must be the first time ever in the history of this country that we are now into two years of an Opposition spokesman in the defence area who has not been given shadow Cabinet status in the shadow portfolio. I am not surprised that that is the case, given the sorts of utterances that have been made by him and, ostensibly, his deputy. The fact of the matter is that the Opposition Leader is responsible for the articulation in this policy area, as in all other areas. We are not getting it from him. We are not getting a disciplining of his front bench to produce policy. It is about time that he was brought to book by his colleagues in this critical area of national security. NA",46
102,Mr FIFE,BADGERYS CREEK AIRPORT,"I direct my question to the Minister for Administrative Services. Will the Minister confirm the closure of the following facilities if an airport is built at Badgerys Creek: FIuers radio observatory run by Sydney University; FIuers airstrip, owned by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation but leased by Sydney University, the site of the School of Electrical Engineering; the coast radio receiving station operated by the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, which is an essential part of Safety of Life at Sea, a facility also used by the New South Wales police; Bringelly remote receiver station, which forms part of the Royal Australian Air Force and Army communications network for the Sydney region; the CSIRO field station which houses the animal production and animal health divisions of CSIRO; the MCGarvie Smith animal husbandry farm operated by Sydney University in teaching and research activities; the munitions factory at St Marys; and the Kingswood ammunition storage and maintenance facilities? Will the Minister also confirm that the Commonwealth will pay compensation to these institutions; that it will provide for their relocation; and that it will ensure their operations are not interrupted?",47
103,Mr WEST,BADGERYS CREEK AIRPORT,"Obviously the extent to which that extremely long list of facilities might affected depends on the ultimate decision that the Cabinet takes. At any rate, I understand that most of these issues have already been addressed in the environmental impact statement. NA",47
104,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY,My question is directed to the Treasurer and it concerns fiscal and monetary policy. Is the Treasurer aware of calls for both fiscal and monetary policy to be tightened beyond the levels already foreshadowed by the Government? What would be the impact on economic activity if this advice were accepted?,47
105,Mr KEATING,FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY,"If there were to be a dramatic tightening of fiscal and monetary policy, what we would see is Australia go into a recession and the scorched earth policy that both the Prime Minister and I have spoken of would be very much in place. Yet that very prescription was advocated again yesterday by the shadow finance spokesman for the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth, in saying: Even though interest rates are now quite high by historical standards, credit is still very easy. There is plenty of money around. This suggests that interest rates may still need to go quite a lot higher before they begin to bite on economic activity. So again we have the Liberal Party leading the charge in this country for higher interest rates, the Liberal Party continuing to argue for higher interest rates. The honourable member went on to say: At the macro level there is an important need to rebalance the mix of macro policies by attempting to take the weight off monetary policy, principally by tightening fiscal policy. This will call for genuine cuts in government expenditure, not just the Treasurer's cosmetics. I should have thought that somebody who suggests that he understands some data would believe that a five to six percentage point fall in Commonwealth outlays to gross domestic product was a substantial correction in government spending, but apparently he does not. What he is arguing for is a tightening of fiscal policy, while the shadow Treasurer argues for the same policy as the Government. The shadow Treasurer argues for a zero public sector borrowing requirement and the shadow finance spokesman argues for an even tighter policy. In other be words, the honourable member for Wentworth is arguing for the scorched earth policy, the kind of advice he would have tendered to the then Treasurer, the now Leader of the Opposition, which gave us the 198283 recession. And he has the temerity to speak about booms and busts in this speech, when the biggest bust we ever had, where gross domestic product actually declined in 1982-83-",47
106,Mr TUCKEY,FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY,"I raise a point of order, Madam Speaker. My point of order relates to the question and the matter of relevance and your previous rulings. The Treasurer was asked-and I quote, because I wrote it down-'What would be the impact of this policy on the Australian economy?', and he gave us that in the first three words. He has then proceeded to a series of comments upon Opposition policy, which you have ruled previously is not within the Standing Orders. I will not read to you again-",47
107,Madam SPEAKER,FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY,I do not think I ruled on it. I think the ruling was given by the then Speaker.,48
108,Mr TUCKEY,FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY,"Yesterday, by way of precedent, you did ask the Prime Minister to draw his answer to a conclusion when he was practising the same activity as the Treasurer is now attempting. I request that you ask the Treasurer either to conclude and give us the benefit of his great economic knowledge-",48
109,Madam SPEAKER,FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY,Order! The honourable member has made his point. The Treasurer will answer the question as it was asked.,48
110,Mr KEATING,FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY,"On the point of order, though, Madam Speaker, that is, attempts by the Opposition to draw a tighter definition of relevance than has been drawn in the last 30 years of parliamentary practice, that should be regarded by the Chair as disorderly conduct; that is, attempts by the Opposition to interrupt the proceedings of Question Time to draw a narrower definition of relevance than has ever been drawn here are themselves disorderly. I ask you to rule upon that point of order.",48
111,Madam SPEAKER,FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY,"The Chair has made a ruling. The Chair now calls the Treasurer, who will continue with his answer to the question as given to him.",48
112,Mr KEATING,FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY,"I submit, Madam Speaker, it is disorderly. Opposition members-Ah!",48
113,Mr KEATING,FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY,On the substantive question-,48
114,Mr SINCLAIR,FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY,"Normally, Madam Speaker, a reflection on the Chair is treated in the manner that it should be. I suggest that that comment to you is disorderly and that you should take some action upon it.",48
115,Madam SPEAKER,FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY,"Order! The Chair is going to disregard the comments by the Treasurer, as it is going to disregard the .comments that have sprung from the table today from the Leader of the Opposition, and I will say to the members of the House that they should have a bit of a look at their behaviour-",48

118,Madam SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The right honourable member for New England is therefore suspended from the service of the House for 24 hours. The right honourable member for New England thereupon withdrew from the chamber. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Motion (by Mr Howard) agreed to: That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith the following motion of censure: That this House censures the Speaker for her failure to act impartially in the exercise of her office.,49
119,Mr HOWARD,MADAM SPEAKER,"I move: That this House censures the Speaker for her failure to act impartially in the exercise of her office. The performance that today this House has seen from you, Madam Speaker, aided and abetted by the members of the Government, is the last straw as far as the Opposition is concerned. What you did by your naming of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) was the culmination of a deliberate failure on your part to treat fairly both sides of this Parliament. We witnessed the situation today where you were prepared to leave unrebuked a clear defiance of your ruling by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), as you had left unrebuked yesterday a clear defiance of your admonition to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to conclude his answer. You were prepared to stand in your place inviting everybody in this Parliament to sit down because a tiny bit of noise had come when the dear besieged Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support  us on this side of the House that was nothing more than a deliberate attempt by you to give political protection from the chair to NA the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support. This has been going on month after month, but today it reached its dizzy and, for us, unacceptable crescendo. It is simply not workable in a Westminster system to have a Speaker who is prepared to be so deliberately partisan, who is prepared to show her political colours and who is prepared to name, to cajole and to warn members of the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia. But when it comes to a clear defiance, she is not even prepared to tell the Treasurer to withdraw a reflection on the Chair, and when somebody from this side of the Parliament gets on his feet and gives voice to his Orders displeasure about that, he is not only without warning named but he is in fact by implication blamed for the transgression of the Treasurer. Madam Speaker, you came to your office with the support and goodwill of members on this side of the House. We have respect for that office. Be it remembered by those few Labor members who were here in 1975 Motion of Censure that it was the Liberal and National parties which upheld the dignity and the integrity of the office of Speaker, when in defiance of every Westminster and parliamentary tradition their former Prime Minister, aided and abetted by people who sit with them, was prepared to assassinate, in the most savage manner and in a most personally undignified manner, the former Speaker James Cope. It was that lot which stood by and shared the blood that flowed from the political assassination of Jim Cope on that occasion. So none of that lot opposite, nor any members of the Labor Party including the Speaker, come to this Parliament with clean hands so far as the impartiality of the Chair is concerned. Year after year under your speakership, Madam Speaker, you have allowed from the Government side a blatant abuse of Question Time. Time and time again we have made attempts to draw your attention to this and we have pointed out to you that, consistent with the natural rough and tumble of the parliamentary arena, there has to be a bit of give and take on both sides, but time and time again you have found it possible within the Standing Orders-according to your interpretation of the Standing Orders-to excuse the Government but to penalise the Opposition. On other occasions we have been prepared to put up with it. We have complained about it, but before today we have not moved a censure motion, and we have not moved it for two reasons: First, because we have liked and respected you as a person and, secondly, because we have respected the office that you occupy. But those two considerations cannot excuse your blatantly biased and partial conduct today. It is nothing short of blatant bias and blatant partiality to have a situation where you can allow the Treasurer to come into this Parliament and quite out of order to comment on somebody else's point of order on which you have given a ruling, and then when you tell him to go on with his answer, he blatantly and openly defies the ruling that you have given by offering a further gratuitous and unparliamentary comment that he regards the behaviour of the Opposition, despite your ruling, as being disorderly. What was your response to that? It was not to the effect that the Treasurer would not argue with the Chair. If that had been anyone of us, if that had been the right honourable member for New England, if it had been me or the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), you would have warned us, named us, or told us not to be disorderly. But what did you do? You not only ignored the impudence of the Treasurer but, worse than that, you sought to excuse his impudence on account of the alleged disorder from this side of the Parliament. That goes beyond all bounds of reasonableness. It cannot be regarded as a mistake. It cannot be regarded as a lapse on your part in giving some latitude to the Government. It can only and properly be seen by those who sit on this side of the House as consistent with a pattern of conduct by you which has sought to protect and advance the political cause of the Labor Party and to retard and restrict the political cause of the Liberal and National parties. That is acceptable to me as conduct from any member of the Labor Party who does not occupy the chair, but it is utterly and completely unacceptable to members of the Opposition from somebody who occupies that position. This is not an isolated incident, Madam Speaker. It follows years during which this Government has turned Question Time not into three-quarters of an hour of legitimate inquiry and seeking of information but into nothing more than a.,blatant and undisguised exercise in political point-scoring and propaganda. If Government members want to do that by choice, as a government, that is their political choice; but you, Madam Speakerand this is why we censure you today-have a responsibility, by reason of the office you hold, to prevent that occurring. You cannot escape that responsibility by reason of your membership of the Australian Labor Party, because the position you occupy is more important than your membership of the Australian Labor Party. There was no need, Madam Speaker, for you to have created the circumstances that led to today's censure motion. I remind you that, in the almost six years in which this Government has been in office, numerous people on our side of the House have been named but not one person on the Government side has been named. No doubt those of 'scumbag' fame will say that that is because Labor members are models of decorum and good behaviour. They will parade around the country, saying how rowdy, disruptive, unruly and uncouth are members of the Liberal and National parties. Yet, in reality, anybody who sits in this chamber, who reports the proceedings of this chamber or who visits this chamber knows that the crown princes of the gutter insult sit opposite us, on the Labor front bench. They are the people who gave us that scurrilous list. They are the people who have now gone so far that even the Prime Minister-who is no shrinking violet when it comes to gutter abuse-has warned them that there isa political cost in being seen by the community as being too insulting; and there is. The political cost, Madam Speaker, I am sad to say, is not limited to those who engage in the abuse, the guttersnipe personal attack for which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in particular are infamously renowned. The price is paid by the entire institution. I put it to you, Madam Speaker, that you have contributed to that price being paid by your failure to show leadership. You have displayed the worse example today because, as a Speaker, you must have not only the majority of Government members behind you, but also the tacit respect and support of the minority who sit on the Opposition benches. We do not seek other than a fair deal from you. We do not expect any favours. We know we will not ever get favours from a Labor Speaker, but we at least expect the appearance and semblance of a fair deal. I put it to you, to those who sit opposite and to those listening to this debate, that it is simply not a fair deal to have something like 22 suspensions of Liberal and National Party members in six years but no suspensions of Labor Party members. I put it to you that it is not a fair deal to have a situation, as occurred today, when clearly the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Sup the Speaker rises in her place, not because there was a crescendo of interjection but because there were a few interjections from Opposition front bench members who rarely interject. You, Madam Speaker, immediately rose and that, of course, is a signal. We know that the Minister is under siege; we know that he was ratted on, in relation to the third runway proposal; by his senior Minister, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis), at Question Time today. We know that he cannot stand the pressure. We know that he was sent out of the House yesterday and prevented from participating in the debate. We know that the Prime Minister almost has a heart seizure every time the Minister gets up to answer a question; we know that he has been put on the mat; and we know that he is in trouble in his electorate of Barton. But that is no excuse for you, Madam Speaker, to give him the protection of the Speaker's chair. That is the thing that, as much as anything, has disturbed us. When we look at these paragons of virtue opposite, by whose lips ugly words have never been uttered in this chamber, we find that these people have produced such words during Question Time as 'harlots', 'sleazebags', 'frauds', 'cheats', 'pigs', 'mugs', 'boxheads', 'criminal intellects', 'corporate crooks', 'loopy crims', 'stupidfout-mouthed grubs' and 'piece of criminal garbage'. This is the sort of stuff that has come from Labor members. What do they get for that? They get no suspensions and we get 22. The Treasurer and Prime Minister can thumb their noses at you, say, 'Forget about the Speaker' and ignore you. The Prime Minister went on for a full minute yesterday after you had asked him to terminate his answer. He went on and on and you sat there and copped it. Yet you expect us to continue to respect the job you are doing. My mate the Leader of the National Party of Australia has been in a few political battles. I do not suppose he would ask quarter from anybody. I have to say of him-and once more this is to the shame of Labor Speakers-that Labor Speakers of this Parliament have allowed the reputation and the family of the right honourable member for New England to be abused and traduced in a manner that I have not witnessed in relation to anybody else in the 14 years that I have been in the Parliament. Year after year, the Labor Party and Labor Speakers have allowed that to go on, yet if there is so much as a murmur from this side of the Parliament, without even a; warning, the right honourable member for New England is thrown out. Madam Speaker, you know better than most, and certainly as well as anybody who sits in this Parliament, that this place simply cannot operate in such a fashion. You should put aside the natural hurly-burly of political debate. Nobody enjoys that hurly-burly better than I do; nobody enjoys it better than some people who sit on the Labor Party front bench. There is no reason on earth why that hurly-burly should not be allowed to go on in a completely unrestrained fashion. But it has to go on in that fashion on a fair and proper basis. It is not reasonable to ask an opposition to fight in the parliamentary arena with one arm tied behind its back. It is not fair, it is not reasonable and it is unworkable for you as Speaker to expect an Opposition to cop a situation where the Labor Party can, in good Australian vernacular, get away with blue murder, but if anybody on this side of the House makes a bit of undue noise he gets thrown out. That is the situation we have reached, Madam Speaker. We have complained before; we have taken points of order before. When you sat in this Parliament as an Opposition member you quite rightly reminded Speaker Snedden· of the implications of certain standing orders. As the honourable member for O'Connor has said on numerous occasions, it is only right that, as you now occupy that exalted position, you should heed the advice you gave to the Speaker in 1981 and which the Speaker was pleased to impose at that time on Ministers of the former Liberal-National Party Government. Your memory, Madam, goes back to the fact that a former Liberal Speaker in this Parliament, the late Sir Billy Snedden, was so concerned about what he assessed to be the fair perceived balance of this place that he did not even require the now Prime Minister to withdraw the notorious allegation he made about Malcolm Fraser, during a debate in 1982, when he called Malcolm Fraser a liar. People on our side then may not have liked that. I can tell you that they did not. Malcolm Fraser certainly did not, and quite a number of people did not. But Snedden had the guts and the courage to defend the office. He had the guts and the courage to say, 'In my view the consensus of the Parliament, the balance of respect between Opposition and Government, requires that I do not require Hawke to withdraw'. He had the courage to do that. I am saying that you, Madam Speaker, ought to have the courage to apply the same standard and show the same leadership from your position as Speaker. It has been your failure to do thisI dare say, aided and abetted by the pressure of your parliamentary colleagues-which has brought this censure motion about. We do not complain about abuse from the Government. We complain about, but we cannot change, the fact that the Government has turned Question Time into an exercise of point scoring political propaganda. It has the numbers and it operates on the simple principle that, if you have the numbers, use them. It is like members of the New South Wales Right. They ran off with the ballot box when the Treasurer rorted his preselection. Of course, the right wing is now running off with the ballot box as it tries to rort the preselection. I say to you, Madam Speaker, that we are not prepared to sit here in silence and allow the ethics of the New South Wales Right, as evidenced in the Liverpool preselection, to apply in this Parliament. Minorities in the Parliament have certain rights, as minorities in the Australian community have certain rights. I remind you that at the last election more Australians individually voted for our parties than voted for that miserable mob opposite. I remind you that in any parliamentary system the minority has rights. The majority has the numbers. The majority can make decisions. The majority can elect the Speaker. But the minority has certain rights; one of those rights is a parliamentary fair go. We have been denied that repeatedly. Today is the grossest example of it. That is why we censure you.",49
120,Madam SPEAKER,NOES,Is the motion seconded?,52
121,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,52
122,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,"1 will begin as I have begun everyone of these censure debates against the Chair-this is about the third or fourth that has been moved by the Opposition in about the last 18 months, which probably represents about half the motions of censure moved against occupants of the chair virtually since Federation, which may well say something about the way in which members of the Opposition have chosen to conduct themselves in this House-by pointing out that you, Madam Speaker, are not able to defend yourself. It is the obligation of members to defend the Chair in a censure motion, as it is the obligation of members of this House to defend the Chair when the Chair is trying to maintain order in this House. Therefore, you had to sit defenceless on this occasion through the insults that have been heaped upon you by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), which followed the insults that have been regularly heaped upon you by the Opposition front bench to which you finally took umbrage in one particular case. It needs to be clearly understood by everybody here that in this censure motion members of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia are defending a statement by the Leader of the National Party (Mr Sinclair) which was blatantly disorderly and offensive to the Chair. There can be no question about.that. The Chair was on her feet calling for order and making an admonition to both sides of the House, to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition in this instance-to the Treasurer for being mildly critical of a ruling directed towards him, to the Leader of the Opposition, who, in comparison, had been yapping across the chamber in a totally disorderly fashion, like the occupants of a henhouse, for the entirety of Question Time. The Chair, when admonishing members on both this side of the House and other side of the House, is entitled to heard in silence and with respect. In this instance, as on many unnoted occasions, the Leader of the National Party chose to intervene yet again and suggest that, for some reason or other, you were disorderly-that was the gravamen of his remarks-in admonishing the Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition. For that reason, you named him. Your forbearance, which has been absolutely amazing to members of this side of the House over the last couple of years, finally broke. The Leader of the Opposition wishes now to defend his mate. He does not have much going for him in that coalition. The Leader of the Opposition chooses now to defend his mate by taking his defiance of the Chair a point further. He comes into this place asking for respect for his position. He comes into this place asking for respect for his Opposition. He requests that respect in an environment in which he turns loose his front bench to create mayhem here. Let us look at some of the statistics of that mayhem. We get a constant stream of criticism from the Opposition that this Government abuses Question Time. Opposition members claim that they are not able to get information, that they cannot get questions asked and that they are unable to convey to the House and the rest of the country via Question Time a legitimate criticism of the Government's activities. I will just produce a few statistics on how many questions were asked in the previous Government's last three years in office and how many questions have been asked in our last three years in office. I would not have raised these matters, but the Leader of the Opposition took his censure motion into the broad areas of the conduct of Question Time, the role of this House at Question Time and whether the chamber is conforming to its functions as a result of the way in which it is chaired. In 1980 a total of 762 questions were asked. In 1981, 942 questions were and asked; in 1982, 708; in 1986, 934; in 1987, 898, and in 1988, 715. So, in terms of the number of questions asked in this place, in terms of a fair crack of the whip for the Opposition in being able to criticise or quiz the Government via Question Time, in each one of our last three years more questions be were asked of this Government and, therefore, more opportunities were available to the Opposition than was the case in the last three years of the previous Government. The Leader of the Opposition, in his unctuous way, suggests to you, Madam Speaker, that you have failed to hold order in this House. There are plenty of observers in the press gallery and people on both sides of the House who have served in this House longer than the period of office of this Government. There has never been an opposition which has chosen to express itself in a way in which it seeks not to debate but to create disorder in order to shut down the processes. That has never occurred before. I can remember back to 1982 because it was during my first term in Parliament. I ask honourable members to contemplate what was happening in 1982 and to compare it with the pathetic display that we get from the Opposition now, which falters in every effort it makes to mount an attack on· the Government. It is faltering here today in trying to mount an attack on the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis). In 1982, day after day, we were standing this on its head with censure motions that were having a major impact on public respect for the way in which the Opposition, then in government, was governing this place. In that period 62 points of order were raised in Question Time. Let us face it: the Opposition raises points of order in Question Time in order to be disruptive. Members of the Opposition can come in this place, with all the unction and mealy-mouthed nonsense that they like, clasping their hands to their chests, pointing out how good they are and wrapping themselves in the cloth of propriety. But they know darned well what the process is of taking points of order at Question Time. About 5 per cent of them are legitimate points of order. And the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) is one of the principal offenders. He has not been in this place long, but he has managed to start a reputation not for any position on policy, not for any position of advancing the interests of the people of this country, but for creating disruption in this place. He, along with the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), managed to produce in the course of last year something like 144 points of order-almost treble the number of the points of order that were produced during the time we were in Opposition. He has scarcely concealed the fact that the Opposition front bench has a policy of disruption. The Opposition has a few people to do it: one is a fairly clever person in the form of the honourable member for O'Connor; and it has a couple of dullards, and I include the honourable member for Farrer, who will not make a reputation in this place by any other means. He will seek to make his reputation in this place by dissolving its good order. The Leader of the Opposition comes into this category of people who will leave this place only with a reputation for dissolving its good order.",52
123,Mr GEAR,NOES,A dullard.,54
124,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,"No, the Leader of the Opposition is not a dullard. In many ways he is a man with some political competence. But he will not leave this place with any reputation for having advanced it as a parliamentary institution. The Leader of the Opposition is responsible personally-because the position is within his gift-for appointing the honourable member for O'Connor as Deputy Manager of Opposition Business in this place. Did he appoint the honourable member for O'Connor Deputy Manager of Opposition Business in order to advance the orderly process of the conduct of business in thisUouse of Parliament? Was this his intention when he appointed the honourable member for O'Connor to the position of Deputy Manager of Opposition Business in this place? Does he have any real respect for the honourable member for O'Connor? No, because at the same time as he appointed the honourable member for O'Connor as deputy, he removed him from a sensitive portfolio position which had serious policy content. Clever though the honourable member for O'Connor may be, when it comes to the formulation of any form of policy, the formulation of anything that means anything as far as the governing process is concerned, he has no capacity at all. This may be a mystery to many people; nevertheless, it is a fact. So what the honourable member for O'Connor does-so far as his cleverness can be devoted to anything political-is stoop into the gutter in order to serve the purposes of dissolving order in this place. The Leader of the Opposition appointed him to do that; not to establish order in Parliament but to establish disorder. It is no accident that the Chair has been used to a modicum of respect over the years from both sides of the chamber. Madam Speaker, you have found yourself confronted with a situation in which you are continually challenged by the Opposition front bench as to the dignity of your office. There has not been an occasion when the honourable member for O'Connor has come to the dispatch box to raise a point of order, and having done so and having had a ruling on it, and has not chiacked you on the way back to his seat. He does not wait until he gets back to his seat. He chiacks you on the way back. Madam Speaker, you have shown forbearance for the honourable member for O'Connor for the last couple of years with his Opposition Leader approved behaviour. At least, I suppose, that is some form of manifestation of his cleverness. He knows that on the whole you feel obliged, Madam Speaker, to permit a free flow of debate in this House and to permit a certain amount of respect for members who raise points of orders on the ground that there is some vague possibility that they might be serious about them. I think in this situation that you have found yourself to have been sorely mistaken, because rather than simply get a response that acknowledges that Opposition members'have got away with something they have decided on this occasion to censure you. There is another reason why the Opposition censures you, Madam Speaker, and why there have been so many censures. It is not because you are a bad Speaker. It is not because your Deputy is a bad ,Speaker. The simple fact-I am afraid to say it but it happens to be true, and it is one of the reasons why we see only one female face on the very far back benches of the Opposition-is that the Opposition hates to see women in positions of authority. Opposition members have not been able to stand your presence in this place since you have been here. 1I have noticed this with my deputy, the honourable member for Canberra, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mrs Kelly). The hatred and the venom that has been directed towards her by Opposition spokesmen since she has had that position goes beyond the normal bounds of political discourse. They are unused to seeing women in positions of authority and they cannot cop it when they see it. Opposition members come in here with their Future Directions document. They adverted to it here. The Leader of the Opposition is going to run from this place. The jingle associated with it was devised by the creator of Louis the Fly. He made Louis the Fly a household name and he hopes that, like Louis the Fly, the Leader of the Opposition will become a household name. He has become a household name throughout Australia. He has become a household name as a man who is an ineffective politician, as a person who is not fit to hold a leadership position in this country. He is not fit to hold that leadership position for the way in which he seeks to exploit political issues which are best left unsaid. There is scarcely a consensus position established in this chamber on policy matters or on behaviour in the chamber which the Leader of the Opposition has not sought to abuse in defence of his own position. His own position is secure. Nobody on his front bench has the guts to challenge him. He does not act as a secure man. He acts as a totally insecure man. He acts on that in policy terms. His Future Directions, which has been flung about the place, ,has more to do with his leadership than it has to do with any serious policy issues. Part of that insecurity is reflected by his incapacity to sit in that seat without yapping. He sits there through Question Time-yap, yap, yap. A man who does that and who can get up subsequently and make an unctuous speech in criticism of you, abusing you, Madam Speaker-having been tolerated day after day in this chamber by yourself because you believe that you ought to extend some respect to the position of Leader of the Opposition-is intolerable. Mr Hayden never behaved like that in this place. Not ever did Mr Hayden behave as the Leader of the Opposition behaves in this place. The Leader of the Opposition comes in here and expects us to take seriously the way in which he wraps himself in a cloak of propriety. He is the person deserving of censure. He has appointed the personnel and approved the strategies to create disruption in this House. The statistics prove it. There is no quest jon about that. The behaviour on the front bench proves that. The Opposition has created an unusual problem that no other chairman or set of chairpersons has had to confront before. It is no wonder on occasions that the Chair finds it particularly difficult to handle. But when finally the Chair or chairmen decide to defend themselves, that is precisely the cowardly moment that the honourable member chooses to attack them. The Leader of the Opposition is establishing a reputation for cowardly behaviour and he deserves no credit.",54
125,Madam SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The Minister's time has expired.,55
126,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,"1 second the motion. We have just heard from the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) all of the reasons why this has happened. He tends, of course, to ignore the real reasons that it has happened. Madam' Speaker, no doubt you read the editorial in the Canberra Times on Tuesday, 25 October 1988, which was headed 'Referees should lift their game'. The referees being referred to, of course, were you and the Chairman of Committees, the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo MCLeay). The editorial states: The Treasurer, Mr Keating was reported in 1986 to have verbally 'bounced' the Deputy Speaker, Mr Leo MCLeay, 'around the walls' for not affording Mr Keating enough protection during a debate in the House of Representatives. Mr Keating's actions would have been justified had they not been for his own benefit. The performance of Mr MCLeay-and the Speaker, Mrs Child-is not good enough for Australia's Federal Parliament. It has been that way for more than two years. The Labor caucus should give them until the end of this parliamentary session to prove they can handle their jobs. If they have not improved, replacements should be sought. This is not my opinion I am quoting to you, Madam Speaker; it is the opinion of the then editor of the Canberra Times on Tuesday, 25 October. That is not what he concluded with. He goes on to say: There is no question that the job of the Speaker is difficult. However, there is no excuse for the occupant of the chair not knowing the standing and sessional orders of the House and the names of the electorates and which members represent them. Mrs Child and Mr MCLeay have consistently shown that they do not have this knowledge. It goes on further to say: The late Sir Billy Snedden would be a good example for Mr MCLeay and Mrs Child. I draw to your attention, Madam Speaker, the precedents of that great Speaker. The editorial continues: Leading the tributes to Sir Billy in Parliament on September 14, 1987, Mr Hawke said, 'It was perhaps as Speaker that Sir Billy achieved most and made his greatest contribution to this Parliament. He strongly believed in the Westminster system and actively sought to lift the position of Speaker above party politics.' Further on the editorial states: Favouritism is divisive and unproductive in the classroom. And so it is in the House. Mrs Child and Mr MCLeay should expel transgressors from either side-ministers included-swiftly and firmly after fair warning. The reason for today's censure upon you, Madam Speaker, is that, as with successive Labor Party Speakers, you have failed or ignored that advice. The Minister gave us some statistics which I would like to refer to in a minute. But the significant statistic in this particular censure is the fact that since 1967 and up until the beginning of this session there were 58 suspensions of members. Under Liberal and National Party Speakers there were 25. Twenty-two were Australian Labor Party members and three were Liberal-National Party members. Under Australian Labor Party Speakers there were 23 suspensions, 22 Liberal-National Party members and, as you would remember, one naming of a Labor Minister that was negatived. It is worth looking at the Hansard of that particular day to get to the bottom of this for the Minister himself. I do not see you, Madam Speaker, as being a Speaker who is being attacked. I see you as a Speaker who is entitled to be very frightened when ope recognises the past record of the Labor Party and the way it treated the office of Speaker. I therefore refer you to the House of Representatives Hansard of 27 February 1975 when a Minister said to the Speaker:",55
127,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,NOES,"Look, I don't give a damn what you say. I-Opposition members-Name him! Name him!",56
128,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! I ask the Minister for Labor and Immigration to apologise to the Chair. It was a fairly simple request, just an apology. He went on: I ask the Minister for Labor and Immigration to apologise to the Chair. I ask the Minister for Labor and Immigration to apologise to the Chair. Order! Is the Minister going to apologise?",56
129,Mr WHITLAM,NOES,"No. That was the Prime Minister. As I understand the theatrics of that moment the Minister was rising to apologise and the Prime Minister, showing the contempt that the Labor Party has for the Speaker's office, stopped him and refused him the opportunity to speak. The Speaker then did what only he could do. The Hansard reports the Speaker as saying: I name the Minister for Labor and Immigration. Then the Leader of the House, Mr Daly, attempted to move the appropriate motion and was removed to his seat. Then it was incumbent on the man that you, Madam Speaker, have just ejected from this House the Leader of the National Party-to move the motion to support the Speaker. The Opposition had to move the motion and in due course a vote was taken. It was lost by 55 ayes to 59 noes. It is interesting to read the names of some of those. who were present, like yourself Madam Speaker, Child, G. J. L., voting down your own Speaker; your predecessor, Jenkins, H. A.; Cohen, B., a great upholder of freedom and all those things; Dawkins, J. S., well known in this place; Hayden, W. G., who has now got an umpire's job; Keating, P. J, the ultimate whinger who likes giving it but squeals his head off every time somebody gives him a flick; Kerin, J. C., no J. C. on this occasion; Klugman, R. E.; Lamb, A. H., a short term member; Uren, T., a man who marched for freedom; Whitlam, E. G.; and Willis, R. Of course, the fact is that there is an interesting name missing, that of the father of the Leader of the House, who chose not to vote on that division but was clearly available in the House because he voted in every other division that was assoCiated with that matter. That is how the Labor Party has treated its Speakers. That was when the Labor Party destroyed any confidence that any Labor Speaker might have. We know why you, Madam Speaker, cannot throw someone out. It is because you would create a record and because you would lose your job. You would lose the confidence of the Parliament because the precedent has been established. That is the tragedy of what goes on in this place. That is the reason why this matter will never be forgotten. That is the reason why the Minister's own father could not tolerate it and found something else to do while the vote was on. We see the Minister giving us a situation where he tries to defend the Speaker when he should be defending his own colleagues both in the present and in the past. We can look further into this at the hypocrisy which comes out in the whingeing that goes on. It was rather interesting to hear that same Speaker Cope explaining to the Parliament what one of his duties was when he said on 20 February 1975: It is my duty to see that the backbenchers on both sides of the House are able to ask as many as possible. He actually believed in that. It cost him his job in due course. One might be interested in the comments of the Governor General, Mr Hayden, when he was a member of this place. On 30 April 1981 he said: Question Time and much of the parliamentary procedure becomes a low farce if questions are not answered by Ministers. Then there is today's complainant, the honourable member for Blaxland, the Treasurer. He said today that it has never been a practice of this place to demand relevance of Ministers. That was the reason for him to insult you, Madam Speaker, when you ruled against his particular claim. But on 30 April 1981 and, I might add, on numerous occasions he said: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The standing orders-He discovered 'them at that time. Only once in this place economically has he ever discovered a drought when he wanted to defend the allegations of Mr Risstrom on the percentage growth of taxation. At other times that was the fault of the Fraser Government. He discovered the standing orders on this day and said: The standing orders provide that an answer should be relevant to the question. He went on, as reported on the next page, to say: Mr Speaker, I raise a further point of order. We have complainants about multiple points of order. I raise a further point of order. There is a standing order which says that the answer will be relevant to the question. The response he got from Speaker Snedden was: Order! The Treasurernow the Leader of the Oppositionwill draw his answer to a conclusion. After he had said that, because I heard him do it time and time again, had the then Treasurer abused that request, as we saw the Prime Minister do yesterday, he would have just told him to resume his seat. Madam Speaker, you have constantly told us in this place that you have no power, when you have the power in this place to tell any member to resume his seat and from that questions position he cannot make speeches. The Treasurer has demonstrated his hypocrisy today, both in complaining of what people do to him when he did it himself, but more importantly, in claiming that it never happened. It is amazing that we were told by the Leader of the House of the brilliance of their attacks during the last days of the Fraser Government. Did they have an issue? It was called the bottom of the harbour scheme. One of the leaders in that push was none other than the honourable member for Fremantle, who between those speeches was rushing off to his own accountant to fiddle his own tax accounts.",56
130,Madam SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The honourable member, even under a substantive motion, will not cast aspersions on other members of this House.",57
131,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,"If that is a problem, Madam Speaker, I will just refer you to previous debates in this House and the questioning of the Minister and his admissions and, of course, items tabled in the House.",57
132,Madam SPEAKER,NOES,The Chair is just giving you a warning not to impugn other members of the House.,58
133,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,"Fine. The remarks have been made. The point is that you personally, Madam Speaker, have been unfair in this place. I am claiming that one of the reasons is that never has the Australian Labor Party given you, or any of your predecessors, the support necessary. Consequently, it is the fault of this Government. The Minister spoke about Question Time. He selectively quoted statistics. In 1976, under Billy Snedden, 1,447 questions were answered by the Government of the day. In fact, in 1979 the figure was still 1,033. The Minister referred to 1987, when the figure was 898. In 1988 we were down to 715. The reality is that the figure of 708 for 1982 is also correct, but then under Dr Jenkins it dropped to 594. So those opposite may want to be selective, but how do we compare those figures? The other point I constantly make in this place concerns the abuse of Question Time, as we saw today, by the putting down of statements. Suddenly, the Government has rediscovered statements-showing its embarrassment-but we know that in 1983 we had 106 statements while in 1984 we were down to 39. That trend continued until this rush occurred the other day. The Government should play the game. When the Government attempts to answer a question properly there is no noise from this side of the House. Madam Speaker, you can check the record. When a Minister is really and truly trying to answer the question there are no points of order from me. The problem is that honourable members opposite generally cannot answer questions. The Treasurer is the classic example. Check the record. Every time we give him a technical question on the economy he is unable to answer. Of course if Madam Speaker interrupts his chain of rhetoric, he has to sit down. He does not know his subject. He proved that again the other night on television when all he gave was smart alec answers. He was asked a question about some particular economic statistic. He said, 'I've written to you about that. You don't need an answer to that. Your figures were wrong'. It would not have been a bad idea if the interviewer had said, 'Well, let us into the secret, Paul. Tell us what, in fact, those figures were'. Had he been obliged to do so he could not have. He would have signed the letter and not understood a word in it. I thought I heard someone mention our health policy. I have a health policy together; honourable members opposite know it and, what is more, the figures add up.",58
134,Madam SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,58
135,Mr KEATING,NOES,"I rise to oppose the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and to support you, Madam Speaker, in your conduct of this Parliament. This motion has been brought on today as part of a specific policy of disruption which has been employed by the Opposition right throughout calendar year 1988 and now the beginning of 1989. On the first day in this session, just over a week ago, not a single point of order was raised. The Opposition thought it could attack and beat the Government in the Parliament on the circumstances of the Government's economic policy and economic outcomes. At the end of day one, honourable members opposite found that they could not. On day two I was being questioned, whereas I was not on day one. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) was up to his old antics of 1988 and which have been evident again this week. In other words, at the end of day one honourable members opposite found that they could not be a legitimate Opposition and raise questions of substance and argue the issues of substance; they could not cut the mustard and they were better to go back to the kind of antics they employed in 1988. Opposition members want Question Time to be a one-way street in which there are questions on Government policy but no reference by the Government to Opposition policies. In other words, they want a condition to obtain in the Parliament that has never obtained at any time in the last 50 to 60 years. Through bullying, cajoling, threatening and causing disruption they seek to have a situation in which the only expose of policy in the Parliament shall be that of the Government's, not of the Opposition's. When the Government then dares to question Opposition policy all of this umbrage, this tuous humbug, takes place about the Standing Orders. The problem is that for 18 months or so the Opposition has been trying to draw a narrower definition of the word 'relevance' in the Standing Orders than has ever obtained here-certainly in the 20 years I have been here. I remember coalition Government Ministers, year in and year out, using not five minutes in Question Time but 20 and 30 minutes. Reg Swartz would sometimes speak for 30 or 40 minutes on an answer. Opposition members-Oh, come on!",58
136,Mr KEATING,NOES,"That is true. On the question of relevance, the Opposition is now. arguing that the Government should not referto an issue in the public debate. the Opposition's behaviour today on two issues. Wheat marketing is an issue of contention in the public debate. The Government has a clear position. There has been a debate in the Senate but there is a division within the coalition parties. My colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) was up expatiating on that issue. A point of order was then taken about relevance. It was a point of order simply about disruption; it had nothing to do with relevance. The Minister was questioned about wheat marketing; he answered about wheat marketing. The answer may not have suited the Opposition ,but it was relevant to the question. But we had disruption-that is, the tactic of a 30-second recital, or a minute's recital of inane references, particularly by the honourable member for O'Connor-designed simply to interrupt the pattern of answer so that people listening attentively would lose the thread. That is the whole point of the tactic. My point of order today was simply to make the point again that the Opposition is seeking to encourage you, Madam Speaker, to draw a distinction in the application of the word 'relevance' as it has never been drawn by any other Speaker. This is simply a policy of disruption. The second issue is economic policy. I have pointed out that the Opposition has adopted the Government's fiscal policy. I have also pointed out that the shadow finance spokesperson, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), yesterday adopted unca position more rigorous than that of the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member  portant political and economic point in the debate. But the Opposition's attitude was how dare I raise this point. The honourable member for O'Connor then has the temerity to get up and talk about relevance because honourable members opposite do not want to hear about Opposition policy. They do not want to hear about the contortions and contrary nature of Opposition policy in. the Parliament. Mr Donald Cameron-You're not responsible for Opposition policies.",59
137,Madam SPEAKER,NOES,Order! Mr Donald Cameron-You're responsible Look at for your own portfolio.,59
138,Madam SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable member for Moreton will not take that attitude to the Chair.,59
139,Mr KEATING,NOES,"That is what this is about. Whenever the Government responds to an issue that hurts the Opposition, as wheat marketing is hurting it, as economic policy is hurting it, what is the reply? It is not a sane or substantial reply but a flimsy, hollow sham of a point of order about relevance by Ministers. Opposition members know that the taking of such a point of order is entirely disruptive. Is this what the Opposition will subject the Parliament to all through 1989, as it did through 1988? Will it, in lieu of substantial policy or position, simply adopt a tactic of disruption or put pressure on the Speaker? Of course the Speaker is under the pressure in these circumstances. 'Ministers know they are not irrelevant and the question of relevance is not an issue but, out of courtesy, Madam Speaker must hear the point of order which disrupts the question. The Leader of the Opposition was affronted by Sallyanne Atkinson's public remarks about his leadership. He resents women in positions of authority and does not have the maturity of the conservative parties in Britain to regard women as equals in any society. In the WASPish world he comes from there is no place for women and that is why he is affronted by Speaker Child each day, each week. That attitude is right at the bottom of the Opposition's objections. What was worse was the appallingly unctuous, oily speech by the Leader of the Opposition-His Oiliness. He was talking about how he is correct and how he is a decent person. He said today in the debate that there is three-quarters of an hour of legitimate inquiry at Question Time. In the economic debate, the Budget debate of the last half of last year, in the Budget sittings of Parliament I got not one question on economic policy from the Leader of the Opposition. Indeed, I got none all year. He does not .regard it as a period of legitimate inquiry; he regards it as a period of political thuggery and abuse. The Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) is right in saying that the Leader of the Opposition has lowered the whole standard of the parliamentary Question Time to the point where everyone is short-changed by it. The interests of members of parliament, the public, the press gallery, everyone, are short-changed by the sham procedure of supposedly eliciting information when in fact it is just about the opposite. Any information is either resented or rejected or responded to with the tactic of disruption. That is what we have from this Opposition. It does not have to be a one-way street. A properly organised Opposition can make the whole debate a two-way street. We made it a two-way street when we were in opposition. Because the Opposition is poorly led, is disorganised and has no strategy, it resents the strength of the Government's policy position, that is, the continuity and cohesion of the Government policy position, which is espoused by a number of Ministers. The Opposition responds with a tactic which it has learned to use, and that is disruptionphoney questions, phoney points of order about relevance, a reading of a passage from the Standing Orders and the reading from May's Parliamentary Practice and all the rest. It is designed simply to take 30 seconds or a minute to disrupt a legitimate answer . to a legitimate question. That is the tactic. . We are supposed to say, 'This is the Opposition being clever; this is political'. This is rubbish! This is just simply the tactics of desperate people who do not have anything better to do or say. The cause of this censure motion was the dismissal by the Parliament of the Leader of the National Party (Mr Sinclair). He offended you all day, Madam Speaker, as did the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition interjects directly at you. Often you choose not to hear him in order to keep proceedings running. He interjects under his breath all the time with statements which are an attack upon your position. He does this perpetually-not just some days but every day. Then we have these appallingly unctuous speeches from him, these Bible-bashing speeches. This upstanding little person who would not dare do anything is out there all the time, making remarks under his breath, remarks across the table to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), remarks to you, Madam Speaker. Twice today I heard remarks of that variety addressed to you, remarks which you choose not to hear in order to keep the place running. If you pulled him up he would then say, 'Are you not going to observe the traditional courtesies extended to the Opposition Leader?' This is now a line he has developed and refined, a line of cowardice which he employs after first having attacked you, Madam Speaker. Worse than that: he is so unctuous that he recites the words which Ministers have used in this Parliament, which I have referred to in the past as sort of corporate slurs. Those remarks are not personalised matters at all. Today in this debate we saw the Opposition true to form. The Leader of the Opposition said, 'The Treasurer rorted his preselection ballot'. That is a specific charge. The honourable member for O'Connor said that the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) fiddled his tax accounts. It is always the vicious personal charge. But if somebody comes back and calls them mugs or humbugs, that is shockingly unparliamentary; the Opposition is changing the whole parliamentary instrument, the whole procedure. Yet these vicious unprincipled people, from the Leader of the Opposition down, employ the most personalised remarks, the most specific personal charges against Ministers in this Parliament, as no Opposition has ever done before. Were I to get a group of young Labor supporters to go back over 20 years of the Leader of the Opposition's personal remarks in this Parliament, they would dredge up a list even more colourful than the one he referred to today. The one thing he will not find is Ministers on this side of the House referring to the Leader of the Opposition's personal life or tax returns, which he specialises in. The Leader of the Opposition has brought public life in this country to a low ebb, an ebb never reached under any previous Opposition Leader. For his trouble, in 1987 he was forced to spend another three years as Leader of the Opposition. At the margin, the willingness on the part of the Government to see the Opposition back on the other side has always been encouraged by these parliamentary tactics. And it will happen again. We reject absolutely the motion against you, Madam Speaker. You have tried to . chair what has become an unruly House promoted by unruly and desperate political parties, the Liberal and National parties, as a coalition in this Parliament. We reject the constant provocation to which you are subjected by the leaders of the Opposition parties through personal remarks towards you. The tactic of seeking to draw relevance where no relevance is in issue will continue to put pressure on the parliamentary proceedings until the tactic is seen for what it is, naked disruption which is employed in the absence of substantive policy. That is the issue today. It is the view of the Government that you acted entirely properly in naming the Leader of the National Party and that the Parliament acted entirely properly in dismissing him. I regard this motion by the Leader of the Opposition as simply evidence of the kind of humbug and lack of principle that he. employs, a phoney attempt to cloak himself in some sort of cloth of righteousness and propriety when in fact he will employ the lowest tactics he can, and do it every time.",59
140,Mr LLOYD,NOES,"I wish to support strongly the censure of you, Madam Speaker, and, through you, the whole attitude and behaviour of this Government in relation not only to this disgraceful ance today but in general terms to this Parliament. Today was a premeditated plan. It was not just something that happened because of things occurring in this House; it was a completely premeditated plan to protect a failed and bungled Minister, the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, the junior Minister for aviation,  There were two stages to it. The first was the filibuster of questions-dorothy dix questions-to Government Ministers, which in turn gave them a chance to make statements that should have been curtailed by the Speaker requiring answers to be relevant but enabled them to bottle up Question Time as much as they possibly could. The first question was to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). He may well have wanted to make a statement on behalf of this Government in relation to women in this country on today, International Women's Day, when more and more polls are showing the gender gap, the failure of the Labor Government to attract the women's vote in this country. The correct time for him to do that was not in a filibustering type answer but in a statement. This was typical of all these statement-type answers to questions. The reasons for it are, first of all, to bottle up Question Time-and that is obvious because of the dramatically reduced number of questions we now have in this Parliament compared to earlier daysand, more particularly, so that we in the Opposition do not have any right of reply, do not have any ability to put our side of that same case, as we would if a statement were made. We are not talking about matters of public importance; we are talking about using Question Time for statements when statements should be made separately. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) should be ashamed of himself for allowing that sort of performance to continue. Let us look at some of the other filibusters that went on today. There was the pathetic question from the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), supposedly about wheat marketing and the Royal Commission into Grain Handling and Transport. That was very interesting because performthe recommendations of MCColl, which if brought into place will bring some efficiency into the disastrous state of our railways and wharves which the people on the other side have done absolutely nothing about, have nothing to do with marketing. In fact, Mr Kerin is on record as privately telling the railway unions that he will not do anything the to force competition or efficiency amongst them. Whilst this was going on, the Government Whip, the honourable· member for MCMillan (Mr Cunningham), was hawking more filibuster type questions around to body who was silly enough to take one, and he had some trouble finding enough fools even on that side of the Parliament to take them. Mr MCGauran-But he did.",61
141,Mr LLOYD,NOES,"He obviously found enough. On these occasions, Madam Speaker, you failed to exercise your duty to make replies relevant and ensure that statements are made at the appropriate time. The second part of the premeditated plan was for the Opposition to be hammered into a subjective obeisance from which it could not in any fair way make a contribution and respond to the unfair tactics of the Government. The first example of this was what happened to the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore). Question Time had hardly begun, the honourable member for Ryan had made just one interjection, and he was warned. There was no reprimand; there had been no earlier interjections; he was warned immediately. That disgraceful double standard of behaviour reached its nadir with the expulsion of my leader, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), without any warning, without any reprimand or without any request to withdraw. As anybody who has been in this place for a number of years would know, the tradition over the years has never been to have an immediate and automatic expulsion.",62
142,Mr HOLDING,NOES,That's not true.,62
143,Mr LLOYD,NOES,"It certainly was not true when we had Speakers. Unfortunately, the other side has a different standard. There was not even a warning. We should compare that with the treatment that was given to .the Treasurer (Mr Keating) here today in the same Question Time. There was only one real challenge to the authority of the Speaker in this Parliament today, and that was the challenge by the Treasurer to you, Madam Speaker. On. two occasions he disputed your rulings. What happened? There was no reprimand, no request to withdraw and no action. They were completely ignored. Today is not unique in this double standard of behaviour in this Parliament. There are plenty of examples, and I will give just one that affected me. The honourable member for Charlton, the Minister for Land anyTransport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown), was some time ago giving an answer on road finance. I challenged him on the accuracy of his figures. He needs plenty of that. He called me an imbecile. You asked him to withdraw, Madam Speaker, and he did. He then increased the level of his language on six occasions. There was no reprimand, no warning and no naming. What if the case had been the opposite?",62
144,Madam SPEAKER,NOES,Order! I was not in the chair.,62
145,Mr LLOYD,NOES,I am referring here to the double standards employed by the Government in this regard.,62
146,Mr HOLDING,NOES,It is not the Government that is under censure; it is the Speaker.,62
147,Mr LLOYD,NOES,"The Government appoints the Speaker and the Speaker is completely responsive to you. It is the Government's contempt for the standards of this place that there was not even a reprimand. Madam Speaker, there are two reasons for this double standard. One is that there is a lack of fairness and equity from the Chair. You are not unique.",62
148,Mr HOLDING,NOES,That's. not true; you know it's not true.,62
149,Madam SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The Minister will not interject.,62
150,Mr LLOYD,NOES,"The historical record supports it. How many honourable members on the other side have ever been expelled from this House when the House has had a Labor Speaker? The answer is absolutely none. I was here on that disgraceful day during the Whitlam years when Speaker Cope, after naming the former honourable member for Hindmarsh, received no support from the Government when it should have been automatic, after his naming, for him to have been expelled.  Speaker.",62
151,Mr LLOYD,NOES,"That is right. Instead of the Speaker having the authority to remove an unruly member of the Government, the Speaker himself was removed because he had no support. That was a disgraceful situation. Since then no Labor Speaker has been game to exercise any discipline or restraint against breaches of the orders of this House. Every Speaker on the Labor side, as his first lesson, notes the Speaker Cope incident. I have some sympathy for you, Madam Speaker, in this situation. I sit here close enough to watch the scowls, the body language, the basic instructions and the way the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, when they are not happy with the way that Question Time is going, try to pressure you. It happens day after day. It is an unfortunate and unacceptable part of the relationship between the other side of the House when it is in government and the Speaker and the Chair. The .second part of this premeditated plan, as I said earlier, was to protect incompetent !'Ainisters. Today was a very good example m the case of the junior Minister for Telewith communications and Aviation Support. He has been well and truly caught out in politiextreme cal expediency. He has based his whole litical career on no parallel runway at Kingsford-Smith, irrespective of whether it needed for the future of tourism in this country, for interstate connections and for regional connections in New South Wales. When I was the shadow Minister for aviation and I drew attention to the problems of - onges-ion and safety that were becoming mcreasmgly apparent at Kingsford-Smith, he would come up to me and congratulate me him. b-cause that would help him, he believed, in hiS electorate. I was drawing attention to the need for something to be done to make Kingsford-Smith relevant and safe and also incidentally, to allow noise reduction-number of measures that would actually his own constituents. He has now allowed the whole Government to be caught out in a terrible mess in relation to the future aviation in the Sydney area and, for that matter, the whole of Australia, because it is the key airport for this country. The Government is caught out not only with Kingsford-Smith but also with Badgerys Creek. Let us look at how far behind with its land acquisition and at the terrible situation in which it has put many landholdple, ers .in the Badgerys Creek area by putting notIces up that their land will be acquired without providing money, allowing them tdo anything or giving them any future. Where is the Government with its road and rail links for Badgerys Creek, as the shadow Minister for administrative services, the - o-ourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), mdlcated here today? What about the impact on all the other facilities that will be affected? Mr Martin-Madam Speaker, I understood that one of the points being raised by the Opposition in respect of this censure motion of you was the question of the relevance of answers by Ministers. I was just wondering when the Deputy Leader of the National Party was going to get to the relevance of the matter before the Chair.",62
152,Madam SPEAKER,NOES,I do not take your point of order.,63
153,Mr LLOYD,NOES,"Is the honourable member saying that the mess the Government is in Kingsford-Smith and Badgerys Creek is not relevant today? Is he saying that the lengths that the Government will go poto in order to prevent adequate questioning about the farce that it is creating is not is relevant? I could go on with other examples. Whenever the other side is put under any pressure, there is protection from the Chair so that our proper questioning of these important matters of state is not allowed to proceed. If the honourable member for Macarthur does not think that is relevant, I cannot think of anything more irrelevant than Mr Martin-I can.",63
154,Mr LLOYD,NOES,"If the honourable member can think of something relevant he should go and do it, because his relevance is not here. Does he oppose the position of the help honourable member for Barton? Does the honourable member really think that something should be done to overcome that farcof ical situation? Come on, tell me.",63
155,Madam SPEAKER,NOES,The honourable member will ignore the interjection.,63
156,Mr LLOYD,NOES,"Again today, we saw part of thiS plan to protect this failed Minister it is when he was asked a question which he could not answer. He was asked, for examby the shadow Minister for aviation about the absurd position of approving twice t-e number of slots or parking spaces for alrcra-t that the runway capacity allows for. That IS the sort of farcical situation that you have with that Minister with that policy at present. Once again, you have been caught out. Once again, you have tried by these tactics to prevent the fair debate of these matters in the Parliament. I sadly but strongly support this censure motion today. I believe, Madam Speaker, that you are a party to a desperate program by this Government to destroy the accountability of Question Time and to destroy the accountability of the Government in Question Time, by reducing the number of questions asked, by allowing statements to proceed with no response possible by the Opposition, and by protecting at any cost incompetent Ministers and an incompetent Government. In spite of all that, the Opposition will not be silenced. We certainly will not be silenced on the debacle of Kingsford-Smith Airport. It is a major election issue, even if you will not allow it to be debated properly in this place. If you think today is any sort of punch-up in relation to the coming election, I assure you it is nothing to the punch-up that there will be against the honourable member for Barton in that forthcoming election, and the Government's policy. I sincerely hope, Madam Speaker, that in the future, as distinct from the past and the present, we will have more equitable treatment of this side of the House, and demonstrably so, in relation to treatment of the other side of the House.",63
157,Mr HOLDING,NOES,"1 join this debate in order not merely to express my own personal confidence and the confidence of the Government in your speakership, Madam Speaker, but also to say that, irrespective of any vote that is taken in this House, you have clearly already won this debate. The issue before this Parliament is a very simple one. It has nothing to do with previous decisions of previous Speakers or previous votes by previous governments.",64
158,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,You are a lawyer.,64
159,Mr HOLDING,NOES,"Yes, and as a lawyer let me say this to the honourable gentleman. There is a simple issue here, and that is: was the Speaker correct when she named the Leader of the National Party (Mr Sinclair) for what was clearly a reprehensible, unparliamentary reflection upon the Chair? That is the issue. As I say, Madam Speaker, you have already won the vote of this House, because not one member of the Opposition who has addressed the House on this issue has been prepared to defend the Leader of the National Party. Not one of them was prepared to say 'I associate myself with what he said'. Not one of them was prepared to say, 'Well, he was right'. Not one of them was prepared to say, 'He acted a little harshly'. Let us get down to the issue. That is the issue. It has been utterly confused by the Opposition because they are utterly confused on a whole range of matters, not the least which is appropriate to the proper conduct of an Opposition in this Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party have positions of privilege as in all parliaments under the Westminster system, and because they have privilege, they also have responsibilities. One of these responsibilities is to see that their members so conduct themselves within the spirit of the rules and within the application of the rules that the Government and the Parliament can proceed with its business. That is their obligation. Sir Billy Snedden has been quoted. I would like to quote him on a number of issues. The first is that in a whole range of articles he pointed out that part of the nature, part of the history and part of the tradition of this Parliament is that it is a place of political ambush. We all know that. Sir Billy Snedden also pointed out that the period which is always most difficult, where the ambush is most likely to occur, is in or arising out of Question Time. No-one understands that better than you, Madam Speaker. Of course, Question Time is there for members of the Opposition to push, to probe, to seek information, and to make assertions, but essentially it is for them to condUl;:t themselves so as to advance their position politically in the eyes of the general public. We all understand that. We also understand that this is a House of give and take. One is judged in this House not on the number of occasions on which one is thrown out but on the number of occasions when one should have been thrown out but was smart enough to stay in. That is one of the tests. Nobody knows more about the rough and tumble and nobody knows more about political processes in this House than the Leader of the National Party. What occurred today? How many times have I said something which I seriously meant, which I understood was a calculated insult and was against the rules of parliamentary debate, and you, Madam Speaker, have made me withdraw? I must say that sometimes I have been reluctant to withdraw, but I knew what would happen if I did not and I must say that, while I recanted publicly, I kept those thoughts in my mind. But I had to defer to the ruling of the Chair. That is the rule of the game. We all know that. But there is another rule, and without that rule this Parliament and our Westminster system, in spite of all the platitudes spoken by the Leader of the Opposition, cannot survive and exist. That rule is that one gives it, one takes it, and if one has to withdraw, one withdraws-but one does not make reflections on the Chair. That is the rule. And one of the things we have seen in this Parliament is the way in which the Opposition has not only diminished itself but also diminished this Parliament by the very nature and the crudity of its conduct. What we have seen over the last few weeks is a pack of loutish bully boys. I am not going to be lectured by the Leader of the Opposition about how the Leader of the National Party feels about women. He is on the record. Honourable members can find it in a girlie magazine, if they want to look it up. But let me say that he is accountable for his attitude towards women. We are proud that, despite the statements made by the Leader of the Opposition, Madam Speaker, you are there present today on International Women's Day. The women of Australia, like the members of this Parliament who are fair dinkum and who have some regard for the traditions and practices of this House, know that you have brought not merely great credit to this Parliament but great credit to the women of Australia in the way you have conducted yourself in the chair. Is there a single member opposite who in conscience could get up in this House and say, 'I heard what the Leader of the National Party said and it did not constitute a reflection on the Chair'? Of course, not one of them can; and at least I can say to their credit that none of them tried .. What they said was, 'Well, it was really all your fault, Madam Speaker, because there was a Minister under attack and you did not .let us get the answers that we wanted'. It happens to be true that, whether one is a Minister or a back bench member of this Parliament, once one stands up in one's place one is on one's own. No Speaker can protect an incompetent Minister. No Speaker can protect an incompetent Leader of the Opposition or a Leader of the National Party who believes he can treat the Chair, because she is a woman, the way he perhaps might treat women in his personal life.",64
160,Mr COBB,NOES,Come on!,65
161,Mr HOLDING,NOES,"The honourable member can have it any way he likes. What members of the National Party have done today is to allow their Leader to cast a personal reflection on the Chair. He has been at it long enough to know that he could have got up and said, 'Madam Speaker, it was a moment of anguish. I withdraw and I apologise', and that would have been the end of it. But no, that did not happen. The Leader of the National Party has been here long enough to know that that is what he could have done and I have no doubt that the Chair would have accepted that. But this is a bunch of political incompetents. This so-called Leader of the Opposition-and everybody knows it has former Ministers, former Premiers, men of distinction, sitting on his back benches and they will continue to. languish on the back benches because the Leader of the Opposition needs to promote the bully boy from O'Connor and others who will give him a vote. The morality of the Carnarvon bar is good enough for the standards of this House. It might be accepted by a desperate Leader of the Opposition, but it will not be accepted by Ministers of this Government, and it will certainly not be accepted by the people of Australia. Let me repeat: does anybody believe that, because of the intellectual depth, the knowledge and the sophistication of the honourable member for O'Connor and his understanding of the political process, he was personally selected by the Leader of the Opposition to be responsible for the activities of the Liberal Party in this House? Does anybody believe it? None of the gentlemen opposite believe it. None of the members of the Liberal Party believe it. They know why he was chosen. It was because he believes he can bash, bully and thump his way through any situation. Well,he ought to remember that in this Parliament he does not have his brothers to help him. He should also remember that those of us who have been in opposition understand the tactics of the Opposition. If honourable members opposite think that they can come up to this table, take a point of order, lose it and then go back and stand in front of the team and say, 'Come on, let us disrupt the place and agitate and call for that level of disorder', and that that can go on forever and a day, I am afraid they are making a mistake. It does not matter who the Speaker is. No Speaker and no Deputy Speaker can allow the Parliament to disintegrate to the point where the Opposition will say, 'We not only reserve the right to ask questions'-that is not a matter of argument-'but we are determined to use tactics which are not within the framework of parliamentary rules and we are determined to determine the nature and quality of the answers and anything that we do not like. If we are getting explanations we find unacceptable, then we will adopt the policy of disruption'. That is what has occurred. Those opposite know it; we know it. Do they think they can have those sorts of discussions in the party room without our knowing about it? Do they think they can have discussions about a policy of disruption and, when it is not working, do the next best thing, attack the umpire, then come in here with a set of statistics and say, 'Madam Speaker, you have not been fair because 40 or 30 of our people have been thrown out and none of them have'? It is like an old lag saying, 'Look at the convictions, but I tell you that I am an honest man and the judges were crook'. That is what it is like. It is the plea of the guilty, it is the plea of the football mug who, when his team is losing, says, 'Go the bash', and when somebody goes the bash and the referee says, 'You are up before the tribunal', he says, 'Gee, the referee is crook'. That is the morality of this Opposition, because the Leader of the Opposition has been prepared to promote to his front bench not only people who lack talent, but people who lack credibility and distinction. They have one distinction in his eyes-they will put up their hand for him in the party room. Talent can be wasted on the back bench, we all know it. The problem is that the problems of the coalition and the divisions in the party room have' been brought into this Parliament. It is with great regret that, having failed with this political tactic, those opposite have now gone to the bottom of the barrel and you, Madam Speaker, are now the object of their spleen. This is a sad day for this Parliament. It is a sad day for the Westminster system. I do not believe it is a sad day for you, Madam Speaker, because you have brought great grace and tradition to this Parliament which I think causes you to be-quite legitimately-the object of admiration of not only the women of Australia but the people of Australia who believe in the traditions of this Parliament and who believe in the traditions of the Westminster system. This motion is a putrid motion that stinks in the nostrils of anybody who hallows the parliamentary tradition of Westminster. It will be rejected by this House because it is unworthy, it is unprincipled and it reflects not upon you, Madam Speaker, but upon what must surely be one of the most incompetent and lamentable oppositions in the history of this Parliament. I move: That the question be now put. Question put. The House divided. (Madam Speaker-Hon. Joan Child) Ayes . . . . 79 Noes . . . . 55 Majority . 24 NA Baldwin. P. J. Jenkins, H. A. Beazley. K. C.

162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FACILITIES FOR SYDNEY,"Madam Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The need for the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support to explain the Government's policy on the development of airport facilities for Sydney. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",68
163,Mr BLUNT,FACILITIES FOR SYDNEY,-:-I am very pleased that the Government is prepared to allow some debate on this issue. I am very pleased that the Government has realised that the Minister-,68
164,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FACILITIES FOR SYDNEY,The honourable member for Bass will resume his seat. The honourable member for Dobell will also resume his seat.,68
165,Mr BLUNT,FACILITIES FOR SYDNEY,"Are you going to give me extra time, Mr Deputy Speaker?",68
166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FACILITIES FOR SYDNEY,The honourable member for Richmond might address the matter before the House rather than make facetious remarks.,68
167,Mr BLUNT,FACILITIES FOR SYDNEY,"I am very pleased that the Government has realised that the junior Minister who is at the table, the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support  cannot hide. At some stage he must come to grips with the statements he has made with respect to Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and his appalling approach to aviation policy. This man obviously does not understand the significance of aviation to this country and the significance of Kingsford-Smith Airport. He is prepared to put his narrow personal political interests ahead of the interests of aviation in this country. A massive disinformationcampaign has been run by this Government and orchestrated by this Minister. Some of the information that has been put about is nothing short of disgraceful. A campaign has been run which said that a third runway at Kingsford-Smith would destroy houses and schools. That is rubbish, and the Minister knows it is rubbish. There was another campaign which said that there would be an increase in noise. The Minister knows that fewer people would be affected by noise, and he knows what advice has been given to him, but he will not table that advice. He is also suggesting, as part of this campaign, that a third runway would ruin Botany Bay. He knows that is not factual, and that is why this Government will not accept an environmental impact study, as offered by the New South Wales Government. Of course, an option available to the Government is to accept that offer by the New South Wales Government. It would take six or nine months, which would take the Government past its election hang-up. I am sure that has not escaped the notice of certain advisers around this place. Another part of the campaign is that the east-west runway will not close. Why would it be kept open when there are two north-south runways? If it were left open, those two runways would effectively be closed. Another part of the campaign is that there is an ongoing need for a cross-runway. First of all, there are hundreds of airports around Australia and around the world that do not have cross-runways. Aircraft are such that they do not need them. Air traffic control procedures are such that they are not needed. I wonder whether the Government will build a cross-runway at Badgerys Creek. If it will, has it done an environmental impact study on that? The Minister is prone to run on at the mouth a little bit about Badgerys Creek. He has said on a number of occasions that most of the land is flat. Let me tell the Minister than he will need about 70,000 cubic metres of fill for this flat land. The earth moving project requires 16 million cubic metres of earth to be moved. To do that, a massive amount of earth moving equipment will be needed. Part of the Government's strategy may be not to build roads and to use the equipment that is idle because of its appalling road construction program to build this airport. But the reality is that it is not capable of being built with the equipment that we have at present. I wonder whether the Minister has discussed with the Treasurer (Mr Keating) the impact on our balance of payments of bringing in the equipment necessary to do that. Of course, last year, when things were getting a bit hot about this, the Minister took it upon himself to start briefing around the place about what Cabinet would .do about this second airport. The junior Minister's staff started to tell the Press Gallery. When the Gallery asked a couple of questions, what were they told? They were told, 'Ring Ralph'. Of course, he did not know anything about it. The first proposal that came from the junior Minister's office was that we would have a fully operational airport in five years. He got a bit emboldened when the success of that statement started to go around the media. He got a few front pages. I think the Telegraph ran a delightful front page story. Then the length of time went from five years to three years. Not even the Lend Lease report that he tabled the other day mentioned three years. Not even the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) has said three years. But this Minister said three years. When the success of that started to bolster him up, he got carried away with freeways and said it would take 30 to 40 minutes to drive by car to Badgerys Creek. No-one told him that the taxi fare is about $60. No-one told him that it costs about $60 in a cab. No-one has told anyone else in this Government what the cost of a freeway is. The Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) said the other day at his press conference that, if there were any need to build a freeway-that is, the freeway that the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support will drive on in 30 minutes-he could get the money out of the Treasurer's $5.5 billion Budget surplus. Where does this Government stand on this airport? It does not know where it is going. The Minister· said on radio in Sydney that rail links are under consideration. I invite him to read the environmental impact statement on rail links to Badgerys Creek. In case he does not know what the figures are, in today's dollars it would cost a minimum of about $137m, and probably a total maximum of $294m. I really do not know how the Minister can reconcile that with his statements that he could build an airport for $200m. The great problem with the Government is that not everybody believes the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support. The Prime Minister does not believe in him; in fact the Prime Minister does not have a lot of confidence in him. He has suggested to members of the Caucus that the issue could have been handled a bit better. That is a very nice euphemism. As I have said, there is not much communication between the senior and junior Ministers. We can understand why because there is perhaps a difference of opinion about priorities and about how this whole issue should be handled. Not even the Minister's councils have faith in him. Recently, the Badgerys Creek airport committee has been seeking financial support from those councils to mount its campaign. It has been looking for $3,000. The only council that has contributed is Hurstville; there is a bit of a family link there. Kogarah,Rockdale and Sutherland have all said, 'No way; we are not going to put any money into this Badgerys Creek campaign'. That is a ringing endorsement of their local Federal member, is it not? That is marvellous. He is in real trouble. The other people who do not believe in the Minister are those at Qal1tas Airways Ltd. Of course, they were gagged. Australian Airlines does not believe in the Minister. It does not believe that his solutions for Sydney are a good idea, so it was gagged. Ansett Airlines of Australia does not support the Minister. Sir Peter tells me that he has been campaigning for over 20 years for a third runway and a second airport. The Government cannot gag Ansett, so the Prime Minister probably spoke to Sir Peter. Finally, this Government, having gagged everybody else, yesterday gagged the Minister in this place. The Government was not game to let him talk because it was terrified that the hole he has dug for the Government already would be dug a couple of feet deeper. Every time he goes near the dispatch boxhe did it again today in relation to the pipeline-he is told to shut up. He was quickly told today to shut up about the pipeline because he might have told us something we do not already know. He would be surprised at exactly what we know, and he might be surprised at who is briefing us also. What we want to hear from the Minister today is solutions. We want to know what are his solutions to the Kingsford-Smith problem. What it really comes down to this is the sharp point of this problem, the hard edge that he has not addressed-is that Kingsford-Smith hits capacity in 1991. Not even the Minister's most optimistic proposals for Badgerys Creek would have it operating by the time Kingsford-Smith is over capacity. What will he do? Where will he put the commuter aircraft? What sorts of restrictions will he impose? What sort of industrial relations climate will he operate there? What sorts of safety standards will operate at Kingsford-Smith? He does not have a solution to the crisis which will be right on his doorstep in 1991. The reason he does not have a solution is that, for his own political reasons, he cancelled our program to build that third runway. He knows it; everybody knows it. ",68
168,Mr BLUNT,FACILITIES FOR SYDNEY,"The Minister interjects. He may have been sitting on the back bench at that time, but he has aided and abetted the stalling of aviation in Australia. It is no wonder that he is referred to as the Minister against aviation. The problem at Kingsford-Smith will not go away. The Minister was on a plane the other day when the captain took special note of his presence and pointed out at great length the problems that he encounters every day when he goes to work. That is the sort of support the Minister has in the aviation industry. When he got on the plane, the captain said, 'I would like to explain to you in great detail what our problems are here'. When there was a delay taking off, the crew had told the captain who was sitting up the front of the plane. Those are the sorts of problems. The Minister should not think that he can get away with this. Every year two million passengers are delayed through Kingsford Smith and they are all told the reason for it. Petitions are circulating around the country calling for the Minister to build this third runway. The people who sit on the 14 and 15 aircraft queued up waiting to take off know it is the Minister's fault They know exactly what the problems are. We want to know what answers the Minister has-not some vague statements about how the Government will build Badgerys Creek. 1 know that the senior Minister, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis), has been to Mirabelle, near Montreal, and he knows exactly the sorts of problems that exist. We want to know what will be done about Qantas. Does the Government seriously propose that Qantas move its jet base out to Badgerys Creek? If it does, will that cost be part of the $6 billion worth of expenditure that Qantas has planned anyway, or is it in addition to that? How will the Government finance that sort of proposal? Does it seriously think that Qantas will move? Qantas is telling the Government that it has to do something about Kingsford-Smith. If it does not do something in a hurry, it will have a monumental problem because the Federal Airports Corporation has told it that it has to build that third runway. The Corporation has also projected that by the end of the century there will be 340,000 movements through Kingsford-Smith and half a million by 2008. The Minister knows as well as I do that, if Badgerys Creek is built as a general aviation facility, there will be a sive influx of general aviation movements from day one. That is the problem with which the Government is confronted but which it is not addressing. When the Minister responds, I give him one warning, which is to be careful about what he says because the whole issue of Badgerys Creek has been addressed in the Department of Aviation's report on the second Sydney airport, and we have read it. When Cabinet finally makes its decision, just remember that we have read that, and we will quiz that statement. It had better be good. The Minister knows that he does not have the answers. That is why it is taking so long to reach a decision. 'December', he said. 'February', he said. He said, 'Last week', and now there is to be a meeting on Thursday to give us an answer. The reality is that a politically based decision is no basis for a sound economic decision, which is what this country really needs right now. While the Minister mucks around looking after his own marginal seat, this country is going down the gurgler. For every extra 1,400 tourists we get into this country an extra job is created. There is no telling what it means to the balance of payments. The Minister's concern is not for the good of this country; it is about his own superannuation, and it is the wrong priority. Mr MCGauran-What does Hawke say about him?",70
169,Mr BLUNT,FACILITIES FOR SYDNEY,"The Prime Minister obviously has major reservations about him. The real problem with this Government's aviation policy is that this man has too much influence, and not enough thought was given to it in the first place. We could fairly say that the Government's aviation policy is punch drunk. If it were run by the Minister for Transport and Communications, we might have a rational approach to it. I know that he has a rational approach. He is not renowned for speed of action. He is not renowned for radical reform. But he is renowned for a rational approach in addressing problems that have to be addr-sed. I am sure that he has spoken to the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown), who has said on a number of occasions that he hopes the Government will address this masissue and go ahead and build this third runway. He is being implicitly critical of the junior Minister's disinformation campaign. I will not quote him accurately as I do not have the quote with me today but in general terms he said, 'What has not been explained to people is that the third runway is about departures and it means less noise over the suburbs'. One might ask what the motive is in not explaining that to the people. The motive is crystal clear. The motive is political. It is parochial. It is Gary Pu.nch in Barton. That is what it is all about, and that is why the Minister has abrogated his responsibilities as a Minister of the Crown in not taking a rational and objective approach to the development of aviation facilities. The Government should do a few things. The first thing it should do in terms of Kingsford-Smith is to cut its losses. It should dump this politically motivated policy and say, 'We were wrong. We've got a whole stack of information and we're now prepared to work constructively and cooperatively with the New South Wales Government. We will accept its offer of an environmental impact study'. The question must be asked: why is this Government not prepared to even examine in detail the feasibility of a third runway? Why is it scared to have a public debate? Why is it not prepared to release the data that has been given to it by its own advisers? The Government has expert advisers with sophisticated computer modelling facilities. It has pages and pages of advice. It has seven authoritative studies that have looked at this. They have all recommended a third runway-yet the Government will not allow a public debate. It will not cooperate with the New South Wales Government, and for that reason the Minister keeps digging a deeper hole. The Government must take up that offer of the New South Wales Government, have the environmental impact study, and rationally develop the second airport-and not spend an enormous amount of money on fast tracking it because the cost of doing that is beyond belief. Finally, if that is not done, the Minister has to be removed from his portfolio. We have to have someone in there who will take a more responsible approach to the development of probably the most significant and important economic piece of infrastructure in this country  communications and Aviation Support) (4.54)-We have had two days of questioning. We have had every question on Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport bar one, two matters of public importance, and we are yet to hear something different from the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt) . We just hear a few more tired cliches, a few jokes along the way that are not too funny, and a few assertions. The honourable member for Richmond is an overnight expert on this issue. But there is nothing new in the debate. It never ceases to amaze me that all through this debate it is supposedly just me, the second most junior Minister in this Government-I have been in the Ministry for a little over 12 months; it is just me and me alone, no-one else supposedly-who has put together a policy to stop the expansion of Kingsford-Smith Airport. It shows a very selective reading of history. The facts are-and the honourable member for Richmond knows this full well-that for 20 years the Australian Labor Party has, in one forum or another, opposed the expansion of Kingsford-Smith Airport. The honourable member knows full well the history of that with the former member for St George and Minister for Defence in the Whitlam Government, Bill Morrison. He knows the long case history of the Whitlam Government's attitude to this issue, as an Opposition Party before it was even in office. Supposedly I have designed all this on my own. We had the 1983 statement from the present Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley). Did I have the Minister's arm up his back? We had the 1985-86 process of site identification of Badgerys Creek. Did I have Morris's arm up his back? Senator Gareth Evans made a statement last year on the issue. Did I write that too? It is a pity for the honourable member for Richmond that the facts get in the way. This whole exercise is all supposedly to save one marginal seat-to save me. If that is the case, I would like to take the opportunity of thanking a few people who are putting in a considerable effort such as all those councillors in the western suburbs who are members of the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils (WESROC), today. which is chaired by-and the honourable member for Richmond might be able to tell me-the Liberal Deputy Mayor and the State member for Parramatta. Is he busy looking after my seat as well? Is it a big John Books conspiracy? Is it the councils in the seat of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard)? I draw the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to the Daily Mirror of 23 January. It states: Hunters Hill mayor Sheila Swain said today that her council was opposed to the plan. She said the second international airport at Badgerys Creek should be given top priority. ""At the western end of the municipality we already have quite a bit of noise from aircraft"", Mrs Swain said. ""With a third runway, noise levels would rise so that we would have even greater support on the issue from ratepayers. Is the Hunters Hill Council a Labor Party front? Is Sheila Swain out there barracking to keep me in my seat? I think the honourable member should come back to reality for a short while. If that is not enough, what about the Mayor of Lane Cove, Sydney Friedlander? He said that while present levels were not a problem, he would consider action if a new flight path increased noise. The flight paths that the honourable member is talking about are going to the north. Are those mayors busy looking after my seat? It is an interesting perspective in politics, that supposedly all this is just me and my self-interest. When a National Party Minister for agriculture, State or Federal, gets up and talks about agriculture, it is for the good of the country. But because I am the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support when the portfolio Minister has responsibility and has policy prerogatives on this issue, which honourable members on the other side of the House do not seem to understand-and I have supported the broad thrust of everything this Government has done-suddenly I am selfish, when the National Party agriculture Minister who is in the same situation is not. The honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) took the honourable member for Richmond outside yesterday for 15 minutes after his staggering performance. I wonder whether the honourable member for Richmond said, 'Back there in the 1970s you were really selfish. You were just grandstanding in your marginal seat when you were protecting Towra Point. You opposed your own government'. I wonder whether the honourable member for Richmond told the honourable member for Cook that. The best one is that somehow today the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair) gets himself thrown out of this House supposedly to protect me. What a joke. The answer is here and now. The honourable member has had two days of Question Time. The Opposition had the matter of public importance on the policy issue relating to the portfolio Minister. Today, despite the fact that there was a censure motion, we have given the Opposition every opportunity. The honourable member should come back tomorrow. He has been telling me for months that he will come back. So he can keep coming back. The interesting thing I also find about this debate is that it has been raging since before Christmas. Now the honourable member for Richmond is interested. Now he wants to discuss it when he knows full well that it is before the Cabinet. He knows full well that he has waited until it was before Cabinet before seeking out the debate. He knows very well that under the Cabinet system Ministers do not canvass specific details once they are before the Cabinet. He said yesterday that he wanted some broad community debate. I would like to point out to the shadow Minister that debate has been going on for months. He missed it. It left him behind. I find that amazing. This debate was going on all summer. The television debates that I participated in were all against Sid Londish, as were the television debates that Laurie Brereton was in. Sid Londish was on television doing the honourable member's job. Where was the honourable member? He was absent without leave. At the last Runway 3 committee meeting' at the Sebel Townhouse, Sid Londish was among the diminishing group of supporters. Where was the honourable member for Richmond? He was invited but he did not go. He did not show up. He sent the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). Why? Frankly, we on this side of the House are fascinated ,to know where the honourable member has been for months. What has he been doing since the public debate took place in the lead-up to the Cabinet discussions that are now at hand? I find it interesting that the Opposition is not without conflict on this issue. On 2 November, in a matter of public importance debate in this House, the honourable member for Richmond said: Badgerys Creek is needed. Let me assure the House that we on this side recognise the need for this airport We would certainly go ahead and build it Later in the debate, he said: The Government should proceed with Badgerys Creek in an orderly fashion, Badgerys Creek should not be used just for general aviation, The Government should recognise that Sydney is growing to such an extent that there is going to be a need for a second major airport and that there is a role for Badgerys Creek in terms of interstate and intrastate transport and; eventually, international transport That was on page 2226 of Hansard. What does the document Future Directions'Futile Assertions'-say? It says, in part: Approval for the construction of a second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek will not be granted until all the possible improvements to the capacity and safety at Kingsford-Smith has been made and the need for an additional airport clearly defined, Two minutes ago the honourable member told us that Kingsford-Smith would be operating at capacity in 1991. What does the coalition's aviation policy say? It says in part: Given the emphasis on upgrading Kingsford-Smith Airport approval for the construction of a second Sydney airport will not be granted until all the possible improvements to the capacity and safety at Kingsford-Smith have been made and the need for an additional airport clearly defined, He has been damned by his own two documents. He gets up in this House and says one thing while his documents say another thing. No wonder the honourable member has been missing since Christmas. The honourable member gets up in this House with a whole assertive stance that is supposed to reflect the fact that we have done nothing in Sydney about rectifying our capacity constraints that everybody looks at and acknowledges. In his own question today he mentioned the terminal upgradings that will more than triple the capacity for the international passenger traffic going through the international terminal building, as well as the interim measures that it will be concluding in May. He forgot blithely to mention that at this. very moment there is a Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) task force in the United States and Canada looking at what procedural changes can be made in the interests of safety and capacity at Kingsford-Smith Airport. He forgets to mention that. He forgets to mention that the joint task force addressed a whole range of issues concerning traffic management. He forgets to mention that we have said time and time again-both the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) and I-that it will be before Cabinet. He forgets to mention peak hour pricing. If I were he I would forget to mention it too because it does not relate to regular public transport or commuter traffic. In his press release on Friday, 2 December, he did his best to tell everybody about it. He said: The impact of this on country commuters will be severe. He went on to say: Country services will be no longer feasible. Many country centres could lose their direct link to Sydney. This is just fearmongering that does not even stand the most preliminary assessment of the facts about peak hour pricing. As the shadow spokesman on aviation-supposedly he has to go along with the drift and general stance of traffic management measures of Kingsford-Smith-he gets out in the bush and issues press releases like this. He forgets to mention that I have requested the CAA to speed up the institution of new radar facilities at Kingsford-Smith Airport and that it is in the process of talking to the air traffic controllers and will be shortly talking to the airlines if it has not already commenced. He forgets to mention the $18m worth of works and taxiways at Sydney Airport to improve efficiency. Why is there all this trouble at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport? It is because this Government has made it very clear that Sydney, regardless of what happens in the Cabinet deliberations, will remain a very vital and important aviation centre point in this country. There is no doubt about that. We are acknowledging most readily that fact and doing the most appropriate and responsible thing. Mr Blunt-Ha, hal  ber for Richmond breaks into a giggle. Yesterday I was supposedly hiding. After two question times and two matters of public importance he has said nothing new. He knows full well that the policy issue at hand is the responsibility of the Minister for Transport and Communications. He knows full well that the issue is now before Cabinet. He cannot get it right about which Minister in a matter of public importance is supposedly the one who stands up and talks about policy. He has gone through a whole lot of quotes that I have given over the last couple of months. I am not going to reply to each one of them because time does not allow it. But I say to the honourable member that he will hear more from me once we have made a decision. He should bear that in mind. The central feature of his misquoting of me is that he takes one quote about one particular issue out of one interview, whether it be about the Londish runway proposal or another proposal, but he never compares apples with apples. Yesterday we had a most blatant example. He got up and quoted me as saying there is only a 15 per cent increase in capacity for a runway. The honourable member knew full well that I was referring directly to the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) and the proposal he had for a close spaced runway when he was the Minister. That is indicative of the misleading and misquoting that he and his cohorts have gone on about. He can keep doing it. It does not worry me an iota. I have broad shoulders. I am about doing what is right. Cabinet is now considering the issue. Cabinet will consider all the options and all the bits and pieces of paper that we have collected along the way. It will make the appropriate and responsible decision. In seven years of the honourable member's government he never had the guts to identify a potential site for a second Sydney airport.",71
170,Mr JULL,FACILITIES FOR SYDNEY,"The matter of public importance reads: The need for the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support to explain the Government's policy on the development of airport facilities for Sydney. This debate has really been a waste of time because when we finally got the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support  absolutely nothing. I think that this is one of the very sad reflections that we have on this Minister. Time after time he has been given ample opportunity to come into this place to tell us what is really going on but he refuses to do it. It is all very well for him to make the feeble excuses we have heard this afternoon but quite frankly this drama about Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport has been going on for far too long. We have come to a situation where we have now reached crisis point. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, whether we are supposed to completely ignore the concerns of such organisations as the Australian Tourism Industry Association, the Mirvac Hotel Group, Flag International Ltd, the Inbound Tourism Organisation of Australia, the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Business Aircraft Association, Qantas Airways Limited, Australian Airlin,es, Ansett Airlines of Australia, the Combined Australian Chambers of Commerce, the New South Wales Government Air Transport Council, Hilton Hotels Australia, Colliers, the Australian Airport Owners Association and the Physical Measurements Laboratory in Sydney. All these organisations have been pleading for a decision finally to be made on what is going to happen at Sydney's Kingsford-Smith Airport. Those people have direct knowledge of exactly what is happening now in terms of the detriment to the Australian economy, to the detriment of the people of Sydney and to the detriment of the people of New South Wales. It is just no good for the Minister to come into this place and say, 'You sit there and wait and see what happens'. We have been waiting now for seven years. Seven years ago the Liberals, when in government, made a decision on that extra runway. That is what it is all about. The problem is now reaching crisis proportions. I must say that there have been previous Ministers in this place who really did have the decency and the openness to come out and tell it like it was. I wonder whether the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support would agree with the previous Minister Transport, the honour ris), who said in a statement to this place: Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport will continue to be Sydney's premier airport. Why? Because of its excellent position relative to its users. Kingsford Smith Airport is certain to handle nearly all the business market and most of the recreational market in the foreseeable future. That is dead right. Yet, since this Minister came to office we seem to have been making every effort to hamper that as much as we possibly can. We have hampered it to the point where we have a crisis situation on our hands, where we have more than two million people a year delayed at that airport, where we have delays of up to 40 and 50 minutes for people trying to get out, where we have high air fares because of the extra fuel burn of Australian and international aircraft that are lined up trying to get out. It costs airlines $30m a year for that extra fuel. What do they do about it? They have to pass on those costs, and they pass on the costs to the aviation consumers of Australia-the travelling pUblic. When we realise that about 10 million or 11 million people a year make trips in Australia and we look at what that might add to a ticket, we see that it is not an inconsiderable sum. Of course, Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport is just. one of the· airports that are a problem at the moment. There are problems in Brisbane. There are problems in Melbourne with radar. There are all sorts of problems in Perth. We hear about the difficulties in Darwin. It is interesting that all the time these problems come back to this Government's inaction or inability to sort them out. But, most importantly, the real difficulty lies in Sydney. It is the gateway to Australia. Fifty per cent of all international flights come through that Sydney gateway. It is a fact of life that most overseas visitors want to come through Sydney. It is a fact of life that there is more business traffic into Sydney than any other port in Australia. Yet, we still see no definitive move by this Government. All we have seen is months and months of excuses as to why a decision cannot be made. Deep down, the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, the honourable member for Barton, knows that there can be only one decisionone decision that is acceptable now; one decision that may have the capacity to stop the bottleneck at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. That decision is to go ahead with the third runway. Frankly some of the stories peddled in those suburbs surrounding Sydney Airport are just not true. It is true that there will be no major environmental impact on Botany Bay, and it is true that if we have that third runway the noise in many of those areas will be reduced-not increased. We never hear from the Minister what is happening in aviation development. I wonder whether he is even aware that the Boeing aircraft company has now on its drawing board major international aircraft that have the capacity to carry 800 people at a time. I wonder whether he realises how quiet aircraft engines now are and what sort of situation that will contribute to in the future. In fact, the airports of the world will become more user friendly than ever before because of this technology development. Despite those points, despite the fact that there is a critical threat at the moment to the economy of Sydney by virtue of the bottlenecks at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, we still have no definitive decision from the Government and especially from this Minister as to why we cannot get the policy right, get it announced and get the work under way. Let us make no mistake about it-we on this side of the. House are dedicated to the development of another airport for Sydney. But in the short term there is no option other than the third runway. As my colleague has quite rightly said, at the moment we have the aircraft that do not have to use that cross runway. It is a fact that we will be able to increase traffic usage, with the cross runway, by 40 per cent and that we will be able to get rid of many of the delays. We have an amazing situation. Seventy per cent of the jet fleets of both domestic airlines, Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines, pass through Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport between 6 a-m and 9 a.m. every day. Seventy per cent of those fleets are therefore subjected to delays or potential delays. The effect on the whole network around Australia is immense. We have seen it. How many honourable members on the other side have come down here on a Sunday night·and experienced immense delays getting the last plane out of Sydney to Canberra? We have seen delays of up to 1t hours. When one talks to the airlines about it, what happens? Because of the situation at Kingsford-Smith, their schedules are thrown into absolute chaos and the delays go on and on through the whole network Australia-wide. This Government's decision not to proceed with that third runway is affecting most Australian air travellers. Let us be perfectly clear about that: there are very few people around Australia who will not be affected in some way by this blithering decision of the Government. Yesterday I mentioned very briefly the effect a future foul-up in Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport could have on industry in New South Wales. I read out a list of people who have already expressed their concern about the effect that there could be on business activity. Most importantly, at a time when Australia has a critical shortage of international exchange and when we have managed to build the tourism industry up to be our second largest foreign exchange earner, here we are trying to do all we possibly can, it would seem, to stop that industry from expanding properly in New South Wales. Overseas airline and tour package operators are now looking at hQw they can avoid Kingsford-Smith Airport. Most of the Japanese operators are now putting an extra day in Queensland into their packages-as a Queenslander I am very happy about thatbecause of the situation that has developed in Sydney. We have to be very careful that if there are major delays in international traffic movements, people do not go .away and say, 'Well, to hell with Sydney. We'll look for other places around the world to start sending our people to because of the problems that are produced at Kingsford Smith Airport'. This has been a cynical political exercise by this Minister. He is looking after his seat. He is not being completely truthful with the people of his electorate. I think they know the overall benefits of having Kingsford-Smith Airport there. I am sure they will soon realise the tremendous benefits that a third runway can bring them in terms of noise reduction and the work created in that area. Why then is this Minister doing everything, it would seem, in his control to stop this development going ahead the way it should? That question has to be answered. It has not been answered yet.",74
171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FACILITIES FOR SYDNEY,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,77
172,Mr FREE,FACILITIES FOR SYDNEY,"This debate initiated by the Opposition is part of its to judgment campaign on this matter. Quesing tion Times yesterday and today and matters ago. of public importance yesterday and today have been taken up by this matter. Let me bring the House back to the basic point; that is, the question of where we are in the decithose sion-making process. The House will be aware that a detailed submission has been taken to Cabinet by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis). Understandaber bly, it is a complex submission. It will further considered by the Cabinet and a cision will be taken and announced. I make the obvious point that the carriage of this matter is in the hands of the Minister for Transport and Communications, who spoke in the debate yesterday. It is obvious the Minister for Telecommunications and  interest in this matter, as have many others. I will return to that later in the debate. Let me refer to the comments made both today and yesterday by the honourable memback ber for Richmond (Mr Blunt). He spoke frequently of the need to take a rational decision on this matter. I ask honourable members to look at the record, and I ask also: Who has been in government in his country for 31 of the last 40 years? It has been those people opposite. Did they ever make and implement a decision, rational otherwise, on this matter in all of those 31 years? The answer is no. Yet we hear the honourable member for Richmond today complaining about an alleged delay from December last year to March this year. We heard the honourable member for Fadden (Mr lull) complaining that the situation has reached a crisis point because of delays in decision-making. There have certainly been delays aplenty. Back in 1929 the Commonreached wealth Public Works Committee reported and recommended a second Sydney airport. There has been delay, all right. I ask: did coalition governments do about it in 1959, 1969 and 1979? I notice that the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) did not take relatively quickly. part in this debate although he was an aviation Minister in a coalition government. It is just as well he did not because the colour television monitors would have picked him up and observers would have seen him blushing. The honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) did not take part today because he rush was the man who was responsible for derailthe Towra Point proposal many years If there are guilty people around on this· matter, and I agree that there are, they are who sit opposite in this chamber. There has been 31 years of delay here, but across the world major cities have been making the ' rational decisions that the honourable memfor Richmond spoke about by building be second airports-Heathrow in London, deCharles de Gaulle in Paris and Narita in Tokyo. These people now have the hide to demand a quick fix, the short term solution of the honourable member for Fadden. After 31 years of inactivity by those opposite, I that wonder what they would call a long term solution. I think here we might be seeing the aviation thrust of the Future Directions paper, with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and his shadow spokesmen looking into the rear vision mirror and taking us to the airport facilities of the fifties. Let us have a look at the record of the Labor Party over those 40 years. Remember that we have been in office for nine of the past 40 years. In the early 1970s a Labor Government took a decision on the location of a second Sydney airport, a decision that was reversed by the Fraser Government when or it took office. That was followed by seven years of coalition torpor. In stark contrast, with the election of the Hawke Government this issue has been handled with care and propriety. There has been a lengthy and careful, study of the alternative sites, an exhaustive environmental impact study, followed by public exhibition of that study and public discussion of the plans. Now we have the acquisition stage, and the Government has already acquired just under half of the properties at Badgerys Creek. DeWhat pending on the decision the Government takes, depending on the Cabinet decision, the remainder of those sites can be acquired I make the obvious point: the decision in principle on the second Sydney airport site has been made; it was made years ago. The question of the timetable and the rate of implementation of that decision is now properly a matter for the Cabinet. I ask: Given the Opposition's own dismal and dilatory record on this question over 31 of the last 40 years, why the rush? I will tell the House why. The reason is that the Opposition's political agenda demands a rush at this moment because members of the Opposition imagine they can smell the blood of the Minister for Telecommunications and Avia about the Minister: he has interests in this matter. As I said earlier, he has interests and proper interests, in this matter. As the member for Barton, he has a proper concern for the welfare of his constituents. As a Minister in this Government, he has a proper interest in rational planning to meet Australia's transport needs. The Minister has discharged, and continues to discharge, both responsibilities with energy, with integrity and with resolve. He will continue to do both in this place for many years to· come. May I say that other people have interests in that area as well. Certainly the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils has an interest in this matter. That organisation met on 20 January and expressed firm support for Badgerys Creek as well as opposition to the third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. The report of that meeting, published in the Sydney Morning Herald on 21 January, is worth quoting in part. Under the heading 'Councils in west to press airport plan: Badgerys Creek backed' the report said: An influential western Sydney lobby group is to start campaigning to support the Federal Government plan for an international airport at Badgerys Creek. The Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils (WESROC) represents nine local governments in the west, as well as Prospect County Council. The chairman of WESROC, Alderman John Books, who is the Liberal State member for Parramatta, and also a member of the local council, said yesterday the Badgerys Creek Airport proposal was now supported by Liberal, Labor and Independent politicians in the west. 'It is estimated that at full development, the airport and related off-site services would generate over 13,000 jobs in the west,' Alderman Books said. 'A second airport at Badgerys Creek can be developed to its third stage-that is, capable of accommodating wide-bodied aircraft-within four to five years at an estimated cost of $240 million. 'A third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport would cost approximately $500 million. 'It would be at least six years before a third runway was ready for use.' That is the view of the Chairman of WESROC, an honourable man and a Liberal member of the New South Wales Parliament. In addition, we have strong expressions of support for Badgerys Creek and in opposition to a third runway at Kingsford Smith Airport from the Second Sydney Airport Supporters Group, a representative grpup of local government organisations from across Sydney as well as community organisations. We have strong support from the Labor members representing western Sydney electorates-the honourable member for  for Greenway (Mr Gorman), the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace), myself and others-because we believe it is important not just from the viewpoint of natiOl-al planning but also to give our region an economic base. It ought not to be forgotten that our region is home to one in 10 Australians and needs a solid industrial base. We believe that Badgerys Creek will provide that solid industrial and employment base. That is an additional reason for our rejection of the bandaid solution favoured by the Opposition and by its wealthy backers. I listened with interest to the censure debate earlier this afternoon and the high moral tone adopted by the Leader of the Opposition. During his speech and also during the speech of the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) they really let the cat out of the bag. The real target in that censure debate was not the Chair but the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support. The Leader of the Opposition frequently referred in his remarks to the Minister, as did the honourable member for Murray. I reject the accusations that have been levelled by the honourable member for Richmond during his speeches on successive days and his use of weapons of personal abuse and ridicule against this Minister. Throughout this affair the Minister has discharged his responsibilities honourably and energetically and effectively. This debate, which was initiated by the Opposition, is a cheap and squalid failed exercise in political headhunting. It is cheap because it ignores the realities of the eighties and it ignores the record of successive coalition governments. It is squalid because the Opposition has chosen to attack and denigrate the Minister rather than deal with the issues and the policies on their merits. It has failed because the Government will not be diverted from a proper decision making process by members of the Opposition or by any of their backers opposite. The matter is before Cabinet. It will proceed along the proper course. The submission of the Minister for Transport and Communications will be considered and a proper decision will be made.",77

Dr HEWSON-In answer to a dorothy dix question today in the House, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) claimed to quote from a speech I had made yesterday. I do not have the precise words, but he suggested effectively that I had advocated higher interest rates. The speech was in fact made today and it was misquoted. The quote was taken out of context. The speech was delivered this morning to the eighteenth National Congress of the Urban Development Institute of Australia under the title 'Development Challenge and Change-the Economic Realities'. Rather than advocating higher interest rates, I was indeed pointing out my concern for the Government's sole reliance on interest rates. I pointed out that if it stayed with that policy it could imply higher interest rates.

187,Mr WILLIS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the Treasurer, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to guarantee the repayment of loans and interest on funds raised by Qantas Airways Ltd to purchase three Boeing 747-400 aircraft and associated spare parts and equipaircraft ment. The Boeing 747-400 is a new series aircraft offering improved operating ciency and engine technology. A new techaviation nology cockpit enables the aircraft to crewed by two pilots, unless additional pilots are required for long tours of duty, and its strategic value lies in the flexibility and petitive advantage inherent in its extra longlian range capability. Qantas needs the flexibility that these craft will provide in order to meet the quirements of the rapidly growing inbound tourist market. Inbound tourism, as measthe ured by short term visitor arrivals, reached almost 2.22 million in the year ending vember 1988, an increase of almost 28 per cent over the previous 12-month period. The Bureau of Tourism Research estimates that overseas tourists visiting Australia will two and a half million in 1990. Other carriers serving Australia will also introduce B747-400s in 1989 and Qantas is likely to lose a significant share of the inbound tourQantas ism market if it is not able to operate similar aircraft. Qantas will use the aircraft ily to provide services between Australia's east coast and London via Singapore-the Kangaroo Route-as well as additional SydBill. ney to Los Angeles services, two of Australia's major markets. Deliveries of the aircraft are currently scheduled to commence in July. adjourned. The three aircraft that the Bill deals with are only the first of 20 that the company plans to acquire over the five years to 199293. In view of the magnitude of this program, Qantas's current capital structure is currently being examined by the Government, with the aim of ensuring its adequacy to underpin such a program. The Bill limits the guarantee of borrowings by Qantas the three aircraft to $US385 million, or its move: equivalent in foreign currencies, which represents 85 per cent of the total project cost for the three aircraft. The guarantee does not involve the Government in any cash outlay, but does create a contingent liability for the Commonwealth. While the board of Qantas has yet to evaluate all the options, Qantas has advised that it wishes to enter again into so-called Japanese 'cross-border' leases, to reduce the financing costs of these aircraft. Such leasing arrangements allow Qantas to finance new at a significantly cheaper rate than would otherwise be available. This type of effiarrangement is commonplace within the industry, and I am advised that the be National Tax Administration of Japan has published very tight regulatory guidelines, with which all leases of aircraft to foreign comairlines must comply. As regards the Austratax position, I made it clear during the last debate that the Australian Taxation Ofairfice ruling, which Opposition members were reconcerned about, did not apply to this type of arrangement, which is tax neutral from Australian Government's point of view. Similarly, the legislation proposed by the NoTreasurer to overcome 'double dipping' schemes, is to be directed at schemes that operated to the detriment of the Australian revenue. As I have stated before, the Qantas reach arrangements are not of this nature. I also indicated in the debate on the previous Qantas loan guarantee legislation that the appropriateness of guarantees for future aircraft is currently under review as part of the process of implementing the May primar1988 reform package for Qantas. I commend this Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to the Debate (on motion by Mr Sharp) NA (INTERNATIONAL LINER CARGO SHIPPING) AMENDMENT BILL 1989 Bill presented by Mr Willis, and read a first time. Second Reading",79
188,Mr WILLIS,TRADE PRACTICES,"1 That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to reform the outdated legislative framework under which Australia's international liner trade is carried by sea. The Bill will repeal and replace part X of the Trade Practices Act. Liner shipping is characterised by the carriage of mainly containerised cargoes on defined trade routes. In 1986-87 Australia's liner exports totalled 8 million tonnes valued at nearly $13 billion. In the same year our liner imports totalled over 6 million tonnes and were valued at over $21 billion. In total around 50 per cent of Australia's foreign trade will be transported under commercial conditions coming within the framework of this Bill. Australia's liner exports are mainly primary commodities such as wool and meat and liner imports are mainly high value manufactured items such as industrial machinery and equipment. The.changes embodied in this Bill will encourage a more competitive shipping environment for the benefit of Australian shippers. At the same time Australia's exporters and importers will continue to have access to the benefits of frequent and reliable sailings provided by liner conferences. These reforms are part of the Government's strategy for overall micro-economic reform and complement our efforts in the national shipping and waterfront sectors. An international feature of liner shipping is the organisation of ocean carriers into so called liner conferences. These conferences are in fact cartels combining resources and restricting competition among themselves in order to provide high quality, integrated shipping services. Liner conferences continue to carry the majority of Australia's liner cargoes with participation levels between 5080 per cent on Australia's trading routes. Non-conference or independent ocean carriers transport the remainder and their competition with conference carriers provides exporters with alternative freight rates. The benefits to exporters and importers of access to reliable, efficient and frequent shipping services have been recognised by governments of all major trading countries. Where ocean carriers have associated to offer these services as a liner conference, the necessary exemptions from national laws regulating anti-competitive practices have been provided. Australia is no exception, and conferences for many years have received full exemption from part IV of the Trade Practices Act, which prohibits anti-competitive and exclusive dealings in exchange for complying with the regulatory provisions of part X. Nevertheless, there has been strong concern within the shipper community that the exemptions were too broadly based and while there were benefits in the conference system, conferences were overly protected to the disadvantage of shippers and non-conference operators. The Government shared this general con-· cern and established the industry task force to review Australia's liner shipping legislation. Shipper, ocean carrier and union interests were represented on the task force. Following consultations with some 50 industry and government organisations, the task force presented its findings and recommen. dations in 1986 in the liner shipping report. The report was circulated to all members of Federal Parliament at that time. The task force was strongly of the view that Australia's overall interests would best be served by regulation that is directed to the promotion of a fair, competitive environment which would ensure access to the market for all ocean carriers on equal terms and which would penalise and eliminate abuses of the system and anti-competitive practices. It has been the focus of much public debate and comment. The report and industry reaction to it formed the basis of the Government's consideration of the reforms which are now embodied in the Bill that we have before us. The overall thrust of the Bill is set out in the 'objects' section and is aimed at creating a more balanced, competitive liner shipping industry to enhance Australia's trading interests. Australian exporters' access to conference services has been retained with appropriate safeguards against abuses of conference power. This will be achieved through three key mechanisms incorporated in the Bill, namely: A transparent registration procedure which requires conference agreements to be publicly available and contain minimum standards; permitting only partial and conditional exemption from part IV for anticompetitive and exclusionary practices; and requiring conferences and ocean carriers with a substantial degree of market power to negotiate with representative shipper bodies. In enhancing shippers' negotiating position with conferences the two stage transparent registration mechanism will give shippers advance notice of proposed carriage arrangements, permit shippers to participate in negotiations regarding minimum service levels before the conference agreement is· finally registered and provides an early opportunity for registered agreements to be investigated by the Trade Practices Commission on complaint by an affected party. The Bill seeks to limit the exemption from part IV to the minimum necessary for the continued provision of conference services to Australian exporters and provides that breaches of part X be enforced by the provisions contained in part VI. The Bill is therefore an integral part of the Trade Practices Act, while recognising the uniqueness of the liner shipping industry. The resultant complexity of the Bill can better be understood by dividing its major provisions into seven broad categories. The first of these is Limited Exemptions for Conferences. The Government has accepted industry arguments that there are benefits in the continued operation of the conference system. However, in future, conference exemption from part IV of the Trade Practices Act for the provision of services to our shippers will be restricted to section 45, anti-competitive agreements and section 47, exclusive dealings and then only to the extent necessary for the provision of rationalised services. The Bill provides the exemption for both inwards and outwards liner conference shipping services for the 'blue-water' and foreign land based components only. The exemptions do not extend to stevedoring operations and the transport of cargo by land or air in Australia, which will now be exposed to part IV. However, the Government has accepted that the fixing of door-to-door service freight rates and the determination of common terms and conditions for bills of lading which could breach part IV are of benefit to Australian shippers and will be given limited exemption from part IV. In order to minimise potential conflicts of law with other countries, the additional safeguards and regulations of registration and negotiations associated with the exemptions are confined to outwards liner shipping services. For outwards liner shipping services the exemptions will limit conferences to practices such as the charging of common freight rates by their members and entering into loyalty agreements with shippers. However, for conferences to gain an exemption for practices not specifically identified in the Bill, the additional practices will have to be necessary for the effective operation of the conference and have overall benefits for shippers. Section 46, misuse of market power, will be expressly applied to all conference operations. The Government cannot accept the situation where conferences continue to be exempt from the Trade Practices Act's provisions concerning misuse of market power. The Bill also contains a provision modelled on section 49, price discrimination, which prohibits discrimination between similarly situated exporters. The second category is minimum standards for conference agreements. An important condition attached to the exemptions I have outlined is that conference agreements in our export trades must meet certain minimum standards. Most importantly, the agreements must contain details of minimum service levels such as frequency of sailings, ports of call and cargo carrying capacity, which conference members undertake to maintain. The Bill ensures that conferences will be required to negotiate minimum service levels with a shipper body designated by the Minister. Conference members will also be required to provide for the resolution of disputes in Australia in accordance with Australian law rather than be able to utilise some other procedure. The Minister will be empowered to waive this requirement where particular circumstances warrant. Conference agreements will have to provide for the withdrawal of a party to the agreement upon reasonable notice without penalty. This recognises that over time an ocean carrier should be in a position to respond to changing market circumstances by being able to withdraw from a conference without undue delay. Thirdly, transparency. Under the regulatory scheme contained in the Bill, the secrecy provisions of the existing part X will be swept away. In future, all outwards conference agreements will be entered onto a public register. Details on the register and copies of the agreements will be publicly available. To ensure our shippers have an opportunity to examine and challenge such agreements, all conference agreements will have to remain on the public register for 30 days before coming into effect. Provision will, of course, be made to protect commercially sensitive matters contained in conference agreements where this is justified and does not disadvantage Australian exporters. Even in circumstances where a request for confidentiality is granted, an abstract of the relevant matters must be provided for the public record. Fourthly, enhanced shipper rights. The Bill encourages shippers to associate to act as a counterbalance to the cartel powers of conferences and the negotiating powers of ocean carriers with substantial market power. The Minister will be able to declare a shipper association, which represents Australian shippers generally, to be a designated peak shipper body and a certain association, which represents the interests of a particular group of shippers, to be a designated secondary shipper body. The designation of a peak shipper body or the nomination of a secondary designated shipper body will empower that body to negotiate minimum service levels. Such bodies will also be able to require conferences and non-conference operators with substantial market power to negotiate, whenever reasonably requested, over arrangements for and the terms and conditions of carriage in our export liner trades. The parties to the conference agreement will have to have due consideration to matters raised by the shipper boy and exchange such information as is reasonably necessary for the purposes of the negotiations. The Bill grants appropriate exemption from part IV of the Act for designated shipper bodies to exercise the powers which I have just indicated. In addition, all designated shipper bodies will receive exemption to negotiate and enter into loyalty agreements with ocean carriers. The Bill overcomes a deficiency of the existing part X which permits ocean carriers to unilaterally impose freight rate increases without negotiating. In future, ocean carriers regulated by the new legislation will need to provide 30 days notice to the relevant designated shipper body before freight rates and service levels can be varied. This period of advance notice can, with the agreement of the designated shipper body, be reduced to meet commercial circumstances. Shippers will have access to the Trade Practices Commission to resolve problems which may arise between themselves and ocean carriers. The provisions of conference agreements and the way they are being applied will be able to be challenged before the Commission on the grounds that the shipping services are not efficient or economical or are not being provided at the capacity and frequency to meet the needs of affected shippers. Complaints in regard to loyalty agreements will also be able to be referred to the Commission. Fifth, non-conference operators. With the exception of the requirement to have an agent for the purpose of official communication, most non-conference operators will not be regulated by the provisions of the Bill. In other words, the pro-competitive provisions of part IV of the Trade Practices Act will apply. However, where non-conference operators are deemed to have substantial market power they will be required to negotiate with an appropriate designated shipper body over arrangements for and the terms and conditions of carriage. Sixth, unfair pricing. The Bill provides for allegations of unfair pricing by ocean carriers to be referred through the Minister for consideration by the Trade Practices Tribunal. The provisions concerning unfair pricing are a safeguard measure to help ensure the long term stability of commercial shipping services. They will not provide protection from fair competition for inefficient ocean carriers. It is not in our national interest to discourage any genuinely low-cost commercial operators from offering competitive services to Australia's shippers. The Bill provides minimum criteria which have to be met in order to sustain allegations of unfair pricing and ensures that our national interest is taken into account by the Tribunal. Seventh, Australian flag shipping. The Bill continues the existing policy whereby conference and non-conference operators with substantial market power will be prohibited from hindering an Australian flag operator from engaging efficiently in outwards liner cargo shipping. Australian flag shipping will, in the event for example of its operations being unreasonably disadvantaged by other carriers on non-commercial grounds, have access to the Trade Practices Commission for investigation of the complaint. Australian flag shipping accounted for the carriage of some 7 per cent of our liner exports and 9 per cent of our liner imports in 1986-87. The Government has made strenuous efforts to encourage Australian flag shipping to be more efficient and we are not prepared to stand idly by and allow our operators to be discriminated against on a non-commercial basis. Against the background of the major provisions I have just described, the regulatory framework embraced by the Bill represents a substantial change from that with which the liner shipping industry has become familiar over the last 20 years. In relative terms the position of shippers will be significantly strengthened while the conferences will lose a good deal of the immunity from part IV of the Trade Practices Act which they enjoy under the existing part X. In order to enable the necessary negotiations to take place and to ensure a smooth change is made to the new regulatory regime, the Bill provides a six month transition period during which the business of carrying our exports can continue uninterrupted while agreements are submitted for registration. Liner shipping, like any other sector of international economy, is constantly evolving. While there is some flexibility in the provisions of the Bill to take account of change in the marketplace, the Government is determined to ensure that Australia's liner shipping legislation remains relevant in the light of future developments and is achieving its objectives. Therefore, it is the Government's intention that this legislation should be the subject of a review which will commence no later than seven years after it enters into force. Finally, the legislation being proposed makes no specific calls on the revenues of the Commonwealth. Similarly, the fees to be prescribed under appropriate provisions of this legislation will do no more than offset costs incurred in administering the regulatory process. I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Sharp) adjourned. NA NA (No.2) 1989 Bill presented by Mr Kerin, and read a first time. Second Reading",80
189,Mr KERIN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is an omnibus Bill for legislation administered within the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio. Its introduction will facilitate the passage of amendments to existing legislation. The Bill contains minor administrative amendments to the Dairy Produce Act 1986 and the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Collection Act 1964 and repeals the redundant Derby Jetty Agreement Act 1962, Oil Companies (Stock Loss Reimbursement) Act 1986, Pipeline Construction (Dalton to Canberra) Act 1980, Pipeline Construction (Young to Wagga Wagga) Act 1980, South Australia Grant (Fruit Canneries) Act 1971, States Grants (Fruit-growing Reconstruction) Acts of 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1976, Victoria Grant (Shepparton Preserving Company Limited) Act 1971 and Wheat Industry Stabilization Fund (Disthe posal) Act 1962. These amendments will be self-evident and are sufficiently explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill. I propose to confine my comments to addressing the more significant changes which will be made by the Bill. Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 Sections 12 and 38 of the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 will be amended to give the grantee of plant variety rights the right to produce, or licence others to produce, plants or reproductive material of the protected variety for the commercial production of fruit, flowers or other products of the variety. The present Act does not recognise the practical difference between propagation from seed and the much more rapid process of asexual reproduction. It allows a person to buy a small number of protected plants from the breeder and in a short time asexually propagate a commercial planting. If only the product such as fruit and cut flowers are sold, and not the plants or reproductive material, the Act is not infringed and the grower rather than the breeder of the new variety receives the commercial gain. The objective of the Act is to stimulate plant breeding by giving sole rights to the breeder from a period of 20 years. This was not happening under the present provisions. Overseas countries and the International Union for the Protection of New Plant Varieties (UPOV) Convention have provisions similar to those proposed in this amendment. Sections 18 and 28 are being amended to ensure that public notice of decisions is given as soon as possible but provides the flexibility needed for the quarterly publication of the Plant Varieties Journal. Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Legislation The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Exploration Permit Fees) Act 1967, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Pipeline Licence Fees) Act 1967, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Production Licence Fees) Act 1967, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Registration Fees) Act 1967 and the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Retention Lease Fees) Act 1985 contain provisions for the charging of fees for applications and annual rentals for titles granted by the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 and for registration of dealings affecting, and transfers of, titles. Amendments in this Bill will enable the determination of the level of application and rental fees, minimum registration fees and securities required under the legislation, by regulation rather than by amending the principal Act. This will enable the timely adjustment of these fees and securities so that they more closely reflect actual administrative costs. All fees collected in respect of the State and Northern Territory adjacent areas are paid to the States and the Northern Territory in recognition of the costs incurred in administering day-today petroleum activities in these areas. An amendment will also abolish the provision for refunds of application fees to unsuccessful applicants for titles under the legislation. Experience with administering the legislation has shown that costs of assessing applications are the major costs involved in the application process and the abolition of refunds will enable application fees to reflect actual administrative incurred. Another amendment will enable a fee to be charged for an application for a special prospecting authority. Again this change will more closely align fees with administrative costs. Under the existing legislation, renewals of titles can be granted to the applicant only for the renewal. In such cases, it has been necessary to postpone approval and registration of a transfer until after the renewal has been granted. An amendment will enable the timely approval and registration of transfers which otherwise would be held up until a renewal of a title is granted. Seismic surveys and other types of surveys undertaken by holders of special prospecting authorities over vacant acreage are an important factor in stimulating interest in offshore petroleum exploration and competition in bidding for exploration acreage. An amendment will facilitate such activities by enabling holders of special prospecting authorities to apply for an access authority to adjoining title areas in order to link new surveys with existing surveys or wells. In such cases, the designated authority will be expected to take account of the views of affected titleholders before granting an access authority. Holders of special prospecting authorities will be expected to comply with any special conditions applying to the area covered by the access authority and not interfere with the activities of titleholders. At present holders of special prospecting authorities must rely on an existing titleholder to apply on their behalf for approval to undertake the survey in the title area. Another amendment will facilitate the provision of access authorities to enable access to adjoining acreage which is administered by a different State or Territory. The amendment will enable a titleholder, or holder of a special prospecting authority, to apply to the relevant designated authority for an access authority in an adjoining adjacent area thus ensuring that a titleholder has only to seek approval from one designated authority. However, the amendment will ensure that the consent of the designated authority for the adjoining adjacent area is gained prior to the granting of the access authority. The holders of such authorities will be expected to comply with any special conditions costs applying to the area covered by the access authority. The repeal of section 57 of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act will remove the requirement to undertake a minimum amount of work or produce an equivalent value of petroleum, in production licence areas. This will enable production licence holders to determine their own investment priorities. However, the Government still has powers under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act to require a discovery to be developed at specific production rates. The amendments will have no net impact on the Commonwealth Budgetary position as any increased revenue from fees will be offset by payments of those increased fees to the State and the Northern Territory. Those payments will assist the States and the Northern Territory in recovering costs they incur on behalf of the Commonwealth in the administration of offshore petroleum activities in adjacent areas. The proposed amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Legislation have been the subject of consultation with the States, the Northern Territory and the industry and have general support. They are essential to the effective and efficient administration of the Commonwealth's offshore petroleum legislation. Tobacco Marketing Act 1965 The proposal to change the name of the Australian Tobacco Board to the Australian Tobacco Marketing Advisory Committee follows a review of the Board carried out in conjunction with Government consideration of the assistance arrangements to apply to the tobacco growing and manufacturing industries. Legislation to give effect to the assistance arrangements announced by the Government on 19 November 1988 will be introduced separately. This Bill is proposed to give effect to the name change foreshadowed in that announcement. The Australian Tobacco Board, established by the Tobacco Marketing Act 1965, comprises representatives of tobacco growers, manufacturers, the Commonwealth and the three States in which tobacco is grown. The Board's principal task is to administer the tobacco industry stabilisation plan which is primarily directed at increasing the competitiveness of the tobacco leaf growing industry. The plan, which was recently extended to 1993, is the final in a series of five year plans which commenced in 1965. In pursuing stabilisation plan objectives, the Board makes recommendations to Commonwealth and State Ministers responsible for agriculture on annual determinations of tobacco leaf prices and quotas. The Board acts largely as a negotiating. forum and has no role in the receival, handling or sale of tobacco leaf. The latter functions are carried out by statutory leaf marketing boards in the tobacco growing States. The name change proposed reflects the Board's major function of advising Ministers on prices and quotas. It also recognises that its functions differ from those of the main body of statutory marketing authorities within the primary industry portfolio to which recent major policy and legislative reforms were directed. The Bill is confined, therefore, to giving effect to the name change and a minor operational amendment made necessary by the abolition of the Public Service Board. As the Australian Tobacco Board is named in complementary State legislation, the name change will not take effect for six months so that States may legislate for a common date of effect. None of the proposed amendments have any significant financial impact. I commend the Bill to the House, and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr N. A. Brown) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.3) 1988-89 Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation for proposed expenditure announced. Bill presented by Mr Duncan, and read a first time. Second Reading",84
190,Mr DUNCAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1988-89, together with Appropriation Bill (No.4) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2), which I shall introduce shortly, comprise the Additional Estimates for 198889. In these Bills, Parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1988-89 under Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act. These additional appropriations are required to meet commitments that have been approved by the Government since the Budget, as well as requirements of an ongoing nature. The principal factors underlying the requirements include certain unavoidable cost and price increases and other parameter changes since the Budget was prepared. Although the Budget figuring contained allowances for prospective wage and salary increases, those amounts were not then appropriated, and funds are now required to meet the impact of the national wage case decision. Of the additional appropriations in the three additional estimates Bills totalling $683.9m, $609.9m is sought in Appropriation Bill (No.3), $68.4m in Appropriation Bill (No.4) and $5.7m in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2). These amounts are offset in part by savings in the appropriations made by Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1988-89, reflecting the Government's continued determination to improve the efficiency of ongoing programs. These savings, amounting to $425.7m, are detailed under the relevant ap. propriation headings in the document, 'Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations', which has been distributed to honourable members. In addition, a clause which has the effect of reducing an appropriation for the Defence Service Homes Corporation made by Appropriation Act (No. 2) by $40.5m is included in Appropriation Bill (No.4). After allowance for this reduction and prospective savings, the appropriations now sought represent a net increase of $217.8m in expenditures financed from annual appropriations. As a proportion of total estimated outlays-encompassing both annual and standing appropriations-this increase amounts to 0.3 per cent. I now outline some of the main areas in respect of which the Government has found it necessary to seek additional provisions in the Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1988-89 to meet expenditure for the ordinary annual services of the Government. One hundred and thirty million dollars is included to the costs of the national wage case. Other significant amounts provided in the running costs appropriations include $35m for early retirement; these funds have been 'borrowed' by departments and agencies under the negative carry over provisions of the running appropriations. With regard to the Defence portfolio, gross additional estimates of $241.2m are sought in Appropriation Bill (No.3), significantly offset by savings of $145.5m, giving a net increase of $95.7m in Consolidated Revenue Fund expenditures. The gross figures include $122m for running costs, reflecting the impact of the national wage case and other awards on civilian and defence personnel salaries and allowances; a provision of $14.9m for redundancies; and a $20.6m increase in the provision for fringe benefits tax. Other costs of $47.7m not provided for at Budget time are associated with the establishment of Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd. The additional funding of $9.1m provided for defence housing largely reflects increases in market rents to be paid by Defence to the Defence Housing Authority. In summary, and taking account of all transactions contributing to the defence function, total defence outlays are estimated to increase by $79.6m. Appropriation Bill (No.3) also provides $50m for the Australian Trade Commission to meet eligible grants under the export market development grant scheme. The additional funds are estimated to be sufficient to enable settlement of all grants that are expected to be processed and hence payable by 30 June. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr MCGauran) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.4) 1988-89 Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation for proposed expenditure announced. Bill presented by Mr Duncan, and read a first time. Second Reading",86
191,Mr DUNCAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. cover In Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1988-89, appropriations totalling $68.4m-additional to those made by Appropriation Act (No.2) 1988-89-are sought for capital works and services, payments to or for the States and the Northern Territory, advances and loans costs and for other services. The proposed appropriations are needed to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures for which provision was not made in that Act. The additional appropriations are sought to meet certain cost and price increases which have occurred since the Budget and other requirements which the Government has considered it appropriate to meet this financial year. Areas where significant increases are sought over amounts provided in Appropriation Bill (No.2) 1988-89 are the provision of $9.lm under the Department of Administrative Services for buildings and works-departmental, which principally relates to the Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney Commonwealth office projects; an amount of $10m under the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of which $7.3m is a contribution to the United Nations Transitional Assistance Group, $2.2m is for costs associated with the United Nations Iran-Iraq military observer group, and $8.6m under the Department of Primary Industries and Energy for the Commonwealth-Tasmania forest industry package which includes an exgratia payment to the Tasmanian Government following the decision on World Heritage nomination for the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests areas of Tasmania. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr MCGauran) adjourned.

192,Mr DUNCAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) 1988-89 appropriations totalling $5.7m additional to those made in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1988-89 are sought for recurrent expenditures of the parliamentary departments. The increase sought relates primarily to essential and unavoidable costs associated with the move to and operation of the new Parliament House. I commend the Bill to the House.

193,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill contains proposed amendments to six Acts: the Air Navigation (Charges) Act 1952; the Airports (Surface Traffic) Act 1960; the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act 1988; the Broadcasting Act 1942; the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985; and the Telecommunications Act 1975. The Air Navigation (Charges) Act provides for landing charges in respect of aircraft using Commonwealth airports or other airports for which Commonwealth financial assistance is provided, and for penalties for late payment of those charges. There is provision in the Act for the refund or remission of these charges and penalties but currently no appeal mechanism against a decision to refuse a refund or remission. The amendment provided for in part 1 of the Bill will provide an appropriate appeal mechanism. In the first instance, an affected person will be able to apply to the Secretary of the Department of Transport and Communications for a reconsideration of the decision. If the affected person is not satisfied after the review, he or she may then apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for further review. The amendment of the Airports (Surface Traffic) Act is a purely technical amendment, which effects the repeal of section 16 of that Act. This follows advice to my Department from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions that section 16 is now entirely unnecessary. Section 16 was included in the Act to prevent unmeritorious private prosecutions for offences against the Act. It is now superfluous as the Director of Public Prosecutions has the power to take over and discontinue any unwarranted private prosecutions. The amendment to the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act 1988 honours an undertaking given by Senator Evans in the Senate on 21 December last year during debate on the Bill for that Act. The Act provides for a program of financial assistance for land transport over the next five years. The funds are provided by a designated share of the excise on motor spirit and diesel fuel, known as the charge rate. The charge rate can be varied in a determination made by the Minister. Some concern was expressed in that debate that a determination of the rate should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. The amendment meets this concern by providing that such a determination must be tabled in the Parliament, and is subject to disallowance. The Bill also includes an amendment to the Broadcasting Act 1942 to enable the grant of limited broadcasting licences which involve transmissions from transponders on an Aussat satellite. This will correct an oversight in the scheme for iimited licences which was introduced by the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Act 1988. Limited licences allow streamlined licensing of a range of broadcasting services which, because of restrictions on duration, purpose, content or other aspects, do not raise the same public interest concerns as conventional broadcasting licences. For example, teletext services will be authorised under limited licences. As the legislation currently stands, only terrestrial transmissions can be authorised under a limited licence. The provisions in this Bill will allow ing remote commercial television service licensees to seek limited licences to broadcast teletext services to remote area homesteads which have satellite receivers. It would also allow licensing, if and when appropriate, of other limited broadcasting services by satellite to remote homesteads. The Bill also amends the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 to introduce a scheme for payment by instalments of the charges due under the Act. Members may recall that Senator Evans, then Minister for Transport and Communications, made this promise to representatives of truck drivers during the blockade outside Yass last year. The amendment is a further indication of this Government doing what is within its means to reduce the impediments to efficiency in the long distance road transport industry and to alleviate the financial burden carried by independent owner-drivers in the industry. The Bill also amends the Interstate Road Transport Act to clarify the validity of regulations which are now in place for the enforcement of vehicle and trailer mass limits. The amendments to the Telecommunications Act in Part 7 of the Act aim to validate a number of routine zonal and telex changes which had been inadvertently implemented by Telecom Australia without authorisation in appropriate by-laws. Routine changes to Telecom's zoning arrangements typically arise when obsolete exchanges are replaced by modern exchanges and the boundaries of charging zones, which relate to the location of exchanges, are consequently changed. Zoning determines charges and changes to zones require amendments to the by-laws. The zonal changes which now require by-law authorisation are generally of a routine nature. The errors, identified by Telecom as dating back to 4 May 1980, though small in number compared to the total number of by-laws made over this period,generally reflect inadequate administrative controls and inappropriate reporting procedures within Telecom's organisation. Most zoning changes without by-law authorisation have not been zoning changes for the purpose of varying existing charges but have arisen as a result of additional zoning points in existing exexisttended zones or additional exchanges in existing zones. These do not alter the call charges applicable. In the remaining cases, changed call charging arrangements were put in place between particular exchanges or occurred as a result of the installation of new exchanges and the consequent transfer of customers from closed exchanges. Telecom is unable to identify the precise effect on individual customers. The new exchange arrangements resulted in higher charges in particular directions offset by lower charges in the other directions. The net result would depend on the individual customer's calling pattern. Investigation of the above issues has also revealed errors in amendments to the Telecommunications (Telex Charging Areas) Bylaws. These errors have arisen from clerical oversights in the listing of new exchanges and deletion of closed exchanges in the by-law amendments. They have not .altered the charges applicable. When he became aware of these errors the Minister for Telecommunications and Avia tailed report on the matter and requested Telecom to institute arrangements to ensure that zonal changes cannot be implemented without proper by-law authorisation. Under new legislation which will be introduced later this session, it is proposed that Telecom's zonal and charging arrangements be subjected to simplified administrative arrangements, which should ensure that such problems do not recur. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr MCGauran) adjourned. NA NA Reports",88
194,Mr HOLLIS,WORKS,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the first, second and third reports of the Committee for 1989 relating to the construction of the National Medical Cyclotron Facility at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, to the construction of new communications and recruit schools at HMAS Cerberus, Crib Point, Victoria, and to the development of a military police complex at Green Hills,. Liverpool military area, New South Wales. Ordered that the reports be printed.",90
195,Mr HOLLIS,WORKS,"by leave-The Committee welcomes the Government's decision to establish a national medical cyclotron facility at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney. The provision of this facility will enable the production of a range of short lived radio isotopes which presently are unavailable in Australia and have to be imported. The use of the cyclotron in conjunction with a Pet camera, to be operated by Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, will enable the introduction of technology which is vital to the early diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of medical conditions including cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke and severe trauma. The Committee's report on the construction of new communications and recruit schools at HMAS Cerberus, Crib Point, Victoria, at an estimated cost of $15.95m, is the second report the Committee has presented in relation to the redevelopment of HMAS Cerberus since November 1986. In November 1986 the Committee recommended the construction of the first phase of the redevelopment of facilities at HMAS Cerberus, including a wharf, a seamanship school, a marina and a boat ramp, at an estimated cost of $14m. The Committee has also recently held a public hearing into a further phase of the redevelopment of HMAS Cerberus-the upgrading of living-in accommodation. The Committee will report on this project shortly. The estimated cost of this project is $15.7m HMAS Cerberus is an historical base. The Committee is particularly pleased with the architectural design of the redevelopment and wishes to congratulate both the Department of Defence and the Australian Construction Services for their efforts in this regard. However, in the report I have just tabled, the Committee has suggested that there is merit in involving heritage organisations, particularly the Australian Heritage Commission, in heritage issues at an early stage in the planning process. The Committee's report relating to the development of a military police complex at Green Hills continues the Committee's involvement in the upgrading of facilities in the Liverpool military area. Since mid-1986 the Committee has recommended the expenditure of approximately $95m on the upgrading of facilities in the Liverpool military area, including this project. This expenditure covers accommodation, warehouse facilities and the redevelopment of the School of Military Engineering. This complex is in the electorate of the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner), and he has given this project his wholehearted support. I, as Chairman of the Committee, am delighted to see that he is in the chamber to see and listen to the presentation of this report to the House. I commend these reports to the House.",90
196,Mr TICKNER,WORKS,"by leave-I begin by thanking the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) for his kind words. The matter I rise to address is not the construction at Liverpool but, rather, the National Medical Cyclotron Facility. I want to place on record my belief in the very great significance of this proposal. Honourable members may not be aware of the great importance that this proposal has to nuclear medicine in Australia. Regrettably, we have lagged behind the rest of the world in not having a national medical cyclotron facility. That, I believe, is a matter that we should have addressed a long time ago. Nevertheless, I am very pleased that the Joint Committee on Public Works has reported favourably on the proposal. The Government is deeply committed to the construction of this facility. My own interest in this matter arises, firstly, because the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, which has been an active proponent of this proposal, is within my electorate of Hughes. Secondly, I have a very passionate commitment to this project because the other main proponent has been the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, which was the hospital my father was in when he was treated for cancer by the doctors involved in nuclear medicine at the hospital. I think they do an outstanding job. Their role will be enhanced by the development of this facility. Therefore, I compliment the Committee on its contribution to that. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION (EQUAL NA WOMEN) AMENDMENT BILL 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed. . Mrs DARLING (Lilley) (6.28)-ln addressing the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Amendment Bill 1989 at an earlier hour this day, I was demonstrating through a reference to practical policies that the Hawke Government does not commit the error of stereotyping women, but recognises that all issues considered by this House in a budgetary context are women's issues. For instance, the Government realises that a key means of improving the economic position of people who are capable of working and who want to work is access to adequately paid employment. Education can be the key to a choice of employment opportunities. 'rhe completion of full secondary education by girls in Australia has increased· rapidly over the life of this Government, from 44 per cent in 1983 to 57 per cent by the end of 1987. The Government recently released the national policy for the education of girls in Australian schools to provide girls with increased access and better educational choices. In 1988-89 $lm has been allocated to increase the participation of girls in maths and science. To enable women to benefit from increased higher education participation, the Government is developing national equity objectives in higher education, and it has expanded the higher education equity program from $1.2m to $2.2m a year, again demonstrating that it is not a government that only mouths support for women but one which brings forward practical policies. For instance, women are the major recipients of social security outlays with about 61 per cent of total social security expenditure on pensions, benefits and allowances going to women. Getting women out of poverty is a major government priority. Since 1983 the Government has worked towards increasing the single pension rate to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings (A WE). The single pension rate increased from 22.7 per cent of AWE in March 1983 to 24.8 per cent of AWE in June 1988, with corresponding increases in the married rate of pension. The single rate of unemployment benefit for those aged 21 or over has also increased. Between 1979 and 1983 this rate had fallen from parity with the single pension rate to 83 per cent of the rate. By June 1988 the percentage had risen to 93 per cent. We aiso und-erstandthe very close concern of women regarding the issue of the family. The Government has introduced major changes to family assistance, largely as a result of the work of the social security review. The family assistance supplement-part of the family assistance package-provides $24 and $31 a week respectively depending on whether children are 13 to 15 or over 15 years of age. Other major initiatives have been put in place for pensioners, some 70 per cent of whom are women, including poverty trap relief measures involving increases in income test free areas and removal of the rental assistance income test. There has been a 50 per cent increase in rental assistance with further increases foreshadowed by June 1990 for certain categories of pensioners and beneficiaries. We have seen a 100 per cent increase in the mother's or guardian's allowance which is another indication of the strong support that this Hawke Government gives to families. With regard to indexation, the entitlements to fringe benefits have eventuated as a result of this Government's policies while pensions have been increased by 7 per cent to some 24.8 per cent of average weekly earnings. I have already mentioned the manner in which this Government has looked at the concerns of women in rural areas, particularly, and employment opportunities at the executive level. The Government is committed to achieving equal representation of men and women on boards of government authorities and on government advisory bodies wherever possible. To facilitate such appointments the Government has expanded the register of women to provide a source of information on women suitable for appointment and has actually been acting on this register. Employment is the main way to improve the position of disadvantaged people in society. Starting this year New-Start will help the long term unemployed to improve their skills. The jobs, education and training program, JET, will assist sole parents in employment and training. Austudy payments for eligible full time pensioner students doing approved education courses will double to $30 a week. Child care is another area in which this Government has achieved much for Australian women.",91
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,92
198,Mr WEBSTER,EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR,"It is always different following the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) who always puts forward a very pleasant case for her side. It would be difficult to launch into a full-scale criticism of it right now. During the course of my speech some of the things I will be saying will be in direct contrast, and rightly so, to some of the things that she and other speakers on the Government side have said. We are discussing here today another piece of legislation from the Government which cynically targets women voters. As usual the Government is playing around the edges of a policy problem. The reason this Government is losing the votes of women is that, very simply, women do not like being discriminated against. For example, why does the Government go to male voters on central issues such as their weekly disposable income and retirement security but think that women will determine their vote on what the Government thinks are women's issues only? The reason the Future Directions blueprint, released by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), has been so well received and given such a good reception by women as well as men is that central to its philosophy is the belief that each citizen, male or female, is an intelligent and capable judge of issues which affect them as individuals, family members and citizens. The Government sadly comes into this place on International Women's Day with the empty symbolism of an amendment Bill for affirmative action. On the other hand, the coalition comes into this debate and says to the Government, 'What women are really worried about is the opportunity for quality of education, the opportunity for work and superannuation cover, the choices as to whether to work or stay at home in the first years of their children's lives, physical security for their families and themselves and, very importantly, for the future of their teenagers'. The Government assumes that women are naive and that they can be deflected from the central issues by talk of national agendas for women and affirmative action. But the women cannot be put off. That is the substitutionary politics of words and illusion for the realities of sound government in the interests of women not only as students, workers and mothers but also as senior citizens. On this international day for women and with the release of that devastating report by the Institute of Family Studies last weeka report that has been quoted here a number of times-on families and tax, women around Australia might have thought that some special statement, not just an answer to a question in passing, by the Prime Minister might have been brought down on the important matter of tax and women, family life, work incentives and security for women. Of course, it was not to be the case. We ask the question: why not? The answer is: because the Government never likes to admit that it is reacting to foundational work in these areas by the coalition and the Leader of the Opposition. I refer to the Future Directions document once again. Let not those listening to this debate think that it is only the coalition which has overshadowed a weary and directionless government when it comes to the life opportunities of women as students, workers, mothers and senior citizens. I have referred to the Institute of Family Studies. What did its research reveal last week? It revealed that the women of middle Australia have been caught by the Hawke Government between a rock and a hard place. If they choose to stay at home in the formative years of their children's lives they will do so in the face of unprecedented inNA Single taxpayers: 0.5 AWE. AWE 1.5 AWE. 2 AWE. 4 AWE. · ... , ...

The mother who stays at home in those years, whose husband is on an average wage and who is ineligible for a family allowance supplement, is carrying the burden of this Government's tax regime. They are the victims of this Government's hidden recession which is destroying so many single income families through tax, inflation and mortgage rates. If they are forced out to work to survive what are they faced with? They are faced with an Australian Council of Trade Unions regulated work force which pays women less and robs them of superannuation opportunities. When they are out working they discover the disheartening levels of marginal tax under this Government. I challenge the Government to be honest and objective about this issue. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard Table 1 and Table 2 of the Institute of Family Studies report entitled 'Families and Tax in 1989'. I did seek leave of three Ministers earlier to have those tables incorporated and they agreed. Leave granted. The tables read as followsTable 1 TYPES AT DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS, 1976-77 AND 1988-89 Percentage point Dollars Average tax rates change per week 1976-77/ more tax, 1976-77 1988-89 1988-89 1988-89 10.5 14.7 +4.2 10.43 21.9 24.6 +2.7 13.41 28.2 30.6 +2.4 17.88 33.3 35.2 +1.9 18.88 47.4 42.1 -5.3 -105.32 19.0 +5.5 27.32 22.6 26.9 +4.3 32.04 29.1 32.4 +3.3 32.79 45.2 41.3 -3.9 -77.50 0.0 8.3 +8.3 20.62 16.6 21.4 +4.8 23.85 24.6 28.5 +3.9 29.06 30.7 33.6 +2.9 28.81 46.0 41.3 -4.7 -93.40 -18.38 11.8 18.0 +6.2 30.80 21.5 26.2 +4.7 35.02 28.3 31.9 +3.6 35.77 44.8 41.1 -3.7 -73.53 Couple: two-income, (1) no children: AWE 1.5 AWE. 2 AWE. 4 AWE.

199,Mr WEBSTER,CHANGES IN REAL DISPOSABLE INCOMES,"These tables confirm the thrust of the claim in the amendment by the coalition that there is a Government policy bias against the families of middle Australia and that there have been six years of declining living standards for women and their families. We have a Bill before us on affirmative action. I have argued that it is peripheral to the central issues concerning women in Australia today. I want, however, to comment briefly on one issue of affirmative action that really scares the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I want to talk about the unacceptable levels of pornography and violence against women in videos, films, television and magazines and relate these comments to this amendment before us tonight.

Committee on Video Material and the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. For three months an expert committee of Caucus has been seeking a political solution-I emphasise the words 'political solution'-not so much to this issue as to the strength of the libertarian wing of the Australian Labor Party presently led by the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman). There were strong submissions on the issue put to the Prime Minister through the National Agenda for Women process. Very sadly, it was the only issue that the Prime Minister declined to comment on when he tabled his national agenda statement with much pomp and ceremony last year. One simply cannot talk of affirmative action and continue to allow the promotion of destructive and exploitative images of women portrayed on paper, on television, on videos, in newsagents, and in houses and suburbs around Australia. It just cannot be done. When will the Prime Minister take a leadership position on this issue? When will he tell the Premiers where his Government draws the line on pornography and violence involving women and children in particular? Amendments on affirmative action such as those before us can be moved day in and day out but if a social culture is permeated with destructive and exploitative images of women, it will be to no avail. We can play at the symbolic edges of the life concerns of women or we can go to the heart of their concerns-education, work, income security, quality of life at home for their children, their security on the streets and, indeed, in their own homes. The coalition, under the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), has gone to the heart of these concerns in Future Directions and will do so in government. The challenge to this Government in its last six months of office is whether it can wake up to itself respond to the coalition's policy leadership in the interests of women as students, women as workers, women as mothers, women as Australian Defence Force service personnel and women as senior citizens. In view of the shortness of time, and in view of the fact that today it is the birthday of the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) and she wishes to speak, I will sit down.",94
200,Mr CUNNINGHAM,CHANGES IN REAL DISPOSABLE INCOMES,"1 support the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Amendment Bill and oppose the amendment put forward by the Opposition, which seeks to narrow the debate into economics considerations rather than the real issues relating to equal opportunity for women, which is the major issue of this amendment Bill. I want to take a slightly different approach to that of other speakers and go to an interview which appeared in this week's Bulletin, dated 14 March. It is an interview by a chap named Stephen Downes with Fay Maries, an equal opportunity consultant. Fay Maries was Victoria's first Commissioner for Equal Opportunityholding the post for 10 years from 1977. She had a very important role to play in this issue. In fact, in 1977 the Liberal Government in Victoria-and at that stage. women from all political parties as well-were working to improve the situation. It is now the Labor Government at the Federal level which is taking a very strong position and is seeing that ideas are put into action by way of legislation. I would like to turn to that interview and put on record some of the issues raised with Fay Maries and make some comments. One of the questions asked of her was: You've said that surprisingly little has happened in the 10 years of equal opportunity legislation. What has and hasn't happened? Her reply was: Well, I think a lot has happened with people's attitudes. I think that the words ""equal opportunity"" are commonplace now and people accept them. I think that people expect to give equal opportunity to women when they apply for jobs. I don't think they say any more: ""We don't want a woman for the job, we won't interview them."" That is a big step forward which has occurred in Australia, but one that, at this and stage, has not spread across the country. It is growing, and many of the people that have worked towards this would be grateful for that, but there is still a lot to be done. She went on to say: But one of the biggest problems for women in the workforce arises from the fact that the workforce is very sex-segregated. You've got women's occupations and men's occupations. And until that changes there are a whole lot of things that won't change for women because women's occupations tend to have less well-developed career paths. They tend to have depressed remuneration too and these are two of the reasons why affirmative action has to take over ... you need programs to change those things. I could not agree more with those comments. A look at history will show that during the Industrial Revolution women and children were the ones thrown to the machines until such time as the males of the community realised that there was money to be made in it. When the money was high enough, the males took over. We see that today in many of the lower paid jobs: they are not jobs that men in our society are rushing into train for. We do not see many men working in the textile industry, simply because, until wages get to the point where it is worthwhile, those equal opportunities will never be quite equal. Fay Maries was then asked: How is affirmative action superseding equal opportunity? She answered: For a lot of organisations that did not have complaints made against them, equal opportunity made no impact at all. Unless you had a complaint you could go on exactly as you had gone on before. That is obvious. They will not get complaints when there are only male employees in an area. She continued: With affirmative action, organisations are required to have programs. There are two big thrusts to itone is achieving selection on merit, and that means employers reviewing their practices and structures so that they do get that happening. That is an attitudinal change. She continued: When women apply they've then got an equal chance with men of getting a job on their merits. The other one is developing the potential of women. You're looking at staff development and you're also looking at reviewing traditional women's occupations and getting career paths where you mightn't have had them before. What is quite critical in Australia is that affirmative action is aimed at making people competitive. It's not aimed at removing competition. I think it has got a bad name in some quarters because it has been confused with quota systems in the US. That is a very true statement and one that I think we all ought to take on board because attitudes are very important in this debate. She was then asked: Two years down the track, how has affirmative action gone? She replied: Although it has been a very exciting development I feel at this stage it has gone variably. In some organisations it has gone very well and there have been quite considerable changes. When asked which organisations, answered: There have been some big changes in tertiary institutions. They were, of course, the first group to come in so you'd expect that. This legislation before the House deals with those educational institutions which are amalgamating. This is very important for organisations with more than 100 employees. She was then asked about private enterprise. She said: Yes. The organisations of 1000 or more are almost all private enterprise. They've varied. Talking to consultants and equal opportunity officers one of the big problems they've found is that a lot of organisations are practising what I've called cosmetic compliance. This is when employers haven't actually done much and they tried to look good because they've got to put their report in. So there's a great temptation to employ women even if they're not the best for the job just to make the profile better. It would be a tragedy if all the work that has gone into affirmative action were not taken seriously by the boardroom directors of some of our big companies who come under this type of legislation. Attitudinal changes, once again, are very important in ensuring that these sorts of things occur. The answer continued: What they do is introduce a self-imposed quota system. The thrust of the legislation is to reverse the gross under-use of female talent. It certainly isn't to reduce the use of male talent. I mean, that would be crazy. If you've got talent you might as well be using it. I find in the community that a lot of these attitudinal changes have not broken through yet. There certainly are doubts in the minds of many people. It is a real tragedy that some of the things we saw in this very Parliament today may be a symptom of attitudinal changes needing to be upgraded and improved. Fay Maries was then asked: Can you put a figure on the number of companies practising cosmetic compliance? She answered: No, I couldn't really, because I don't think there has been any research into it and programs are aimed at looking as if they're real. So what we've got is anecdotal evidence, people in the area telling us that they're not being asked to do the real things. They're being asked to make the organisation look good. My own feeling is that it's fairly widespread. I hope it is not. I hope that the types of approaches that are being taken by governshe ments in Australia, particularly Labor governments, will not be used in this way. But if there is some evidence of cosmetic compliance, then we have to work to see that it is eliminated because it has great dangers. As Fay Maries stated: I think you've got dangers when organisations get away with that, because we're at a point where far more organisations are about to come into the scheme and they'll be looking at the employers that are already in. One of the things that a lot of employers don't realise is how much benefit there is in a good affirmative action program. There's a lot of misconception about what it's all about. A lot of organisations think it's a numbers game and it's not that at all. I agree wholeheartedly with what she said in that interview in the Bulletin this week. I know that in the area I represent, the Latrobe Valley, which is a very strongly maledominated unionised area, there has .been a slow movement to give female apprentices coming through the system an equal opportunity. The situation is now changing, and changing quite rapidly. I believe that the legislation we have before us is the sort of legislation that will be the catalyst for attitudinal changes. If we can get a strong lead from companies who take this seriously, then I think we will see an improvement in attitudes, which will eventually mean that all the other measures that are being put into place will be positive .. The opportunity for education will become positive because at the end of the education there will be job opportunities. Let me take that in reverse. I would like to talk about some of the issues in education, which are vital as far as this Bill is concerned. Previous speakers have mentioned retention rates and participation in education and talked about how those measures are clearly improving. I do not think there is any going back on that now. I do not think that the implementation of the policies this Government and the State Labor governments have put in place will ever be reversed. Regardless of time, I think we are going to see a major improvement. The situation with regard to nursing education is a major issue in my area, where we now have the Gippsland Institute. It is one of those bodies that have taken up the issue of nursing education since the G()vernment announced in August 1984 that there would be a full transfer of basic nurse education from hospitals to the tertiary education sector by 1993. I often see articles relating to this and I am a little amused that some material points out that this is also bringing nurse education into line with that of other health professionals and will enhance education and career opportunities for women. I point out that it is certainly enhancing career opportunities in nursing for men. That movement away from the hospital sector into educational facilities means that there is an opportunity-with the better pay and so on that the nurses have won-for an equal opportunity of real substance on both sides. I think it is important in any discussion of this nature that we get away from the hysteria, the reaction that it is just women pushing women's issues. This issue is about equal opportunity, and equal opportunity will not .come until we create the necessary forces. As I said earlier in my speech, at the start of the Industrial Revolution the women and the children were the ones who were expected to do those types of jobs until the economics of the structure were such that it became worthwhile for males to take up the equal opportunity. Over. a period I think we are going to see changes in a lot of structures, particularly in the union movement. I concede that in the union movement there needs to be movement on this. A lot of jobs that are now female dominated could also provide opportunities for males. Real success will occur only when we look realistically at equal opportunity on the basis of what a job is worth-not because a woman is doing it but because of what the job is. Why should we have pay rates that are not sufficient for the main breadwinner in a family? One can walk into a factory and find 200 women working for a salary, which is seen to be equal opportunity and equal pay, but it is not true equal opportunity as I would see it in today's society. Mrs Sullivan-Nurses' salaries too.",95
201,Mr CUNNINGHAM,CHANGES IN REAL DISPOSABLE INCOMES,"Nurses' salaries were low, but I would say now that they are at a recognised level. Our birthday member on the other side comments on it but that is definitely changing because of the structure in pay. Mrs Sullivan-Because men are getting it; that's why.",97
202,Mr CUNNINGHAM,CHANGES IN REAL DISPOSABLE INCOMES,"Yes, I concede that, as well as being attracted by the education opportunities, men now see nursing as worthwhile. That is equal opportunity of a sort, but there is still a long way to go. We have a lot to do in this Parliament in relation to it. We cannot by legislation direct and force people to do things. It is an educative process. It is one where I think we have shown the lead, but it is a long way from being finished. I would be very interested to hear the views of the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) in relation to the Opposition's amendment condemning the Government for its effective discrimination against women through the pursuit of policies which are biased against families and which have resulted in six years of declining living standards for women and their families. Some 60 per cent of the 1.2 million jobs created in the last six years have gone to women who today can be independent and say to the Government, 'We do not really need the family allowance supplement in this family; we have job opportunities'. A woman can be independent and say to her family, 'This is the choice, 1 can work and, if I get that job, I am totally independent'. And women are getting that sort of work. Mrs Sullivan-Jobs are not the only form of work.",97
203,Mr CUNNINGHAM,CHANGES IN REAL DISPOSABLE INCOMES,"There is work available today which is much more of an equal opportunity type. People are taking up those jobs, and the families that have picked up those extra jobs are in a much stronger position than they were six years ago. 1 the amendment, which condemns the Government for its so-called effective discrimination. There is not that kind of discrimination. Where those families still are not able to obtain a second job, we have put in place the structures of the family allowance supplement, Austudy for going to school, all the things that are assisting famigamations lies. This Government is not discriminating against women through policies biased against families. This Government is taking a positive approach. I would hope that those on the Opposition side at least announce some policies which will give us an indication of where they stand. Attitudinal changes are the ones I am most concerned about. I can honestly say that 1 was horrified today in this Parliament at some of the attitudes expressed in the attack on the chairperson. Tragically, 1 believe that until those attitudinal changes take place we will continue to see such attacks in this Parliament against a female Speaker, attacks which would never take place, I believe, if the Speaker was a male.",98
204,Mrs SULLIVAN,CHANGES IN REAL DISPOSABLE INCOMES,"1 recognise that the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Cunningham) was sincere in what he said. It is because I believe that he was sincere that I am going to try very hard to explain this to him nicely. I say at the outset to the honourable member for McMillan that he meant to be saying the right things about women, but I warn him that the contents of the last five minutes of his speech were almost calculated to enrage. 1 recognise that certainly the right of employment, attitudes and things that happen in relation to affirmative action and salaries are important to women. But it is also important to women that it be recognised that the work of child rearing, of mothering and work in the home is a job. The honourable member talked about jobs exclusively in terms of paid employment outside the home. Whilst I think it is good that there is a better understanding about the needs of women in the work force and, therefore, the role of affirmative action policies, that will not achieve very much if it is not recognised that the so-called traditional work of women is also work. It is an honour to second the amendment to the motion for the second reading moved reject today by my Opposition colleague, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), and to be given an opportunity to put a little balance into the debate. The House is debating the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Amendment Bill. It is necessary because of some attempted changes in structures, some amalin relation to the tertiary sector, that the Government has undertaken. I have a particular interest in that, because one of the affected institutions-the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education-is in my electorate. These changes are necessary in a machinery sort of sense. It gives us the opportunity to do some reviewing and to make further contributions to the affirmative action debate. In saying that I am pleased to second the amendment of my colleague, the honourable member for Flinders. I am also pleased to say that the Opposition is supporting the legislation. The second reading amendment gives us a chance to have the sort of debate that honourable members would seek to have: For example, without the amendment, the honourable member for MCMillan could not have given about three-quarters of his quite carefully prepared speech. 1 say to the honourable member for MCMillan that women do not want to be patronised. I am not suggesting that he was being patronising willingly, but one has to be very careful. It is a simple fact that most Australian women will marry and of those who marry or form marriage-type relationships, as we call them these days, most of them will have children. As the nurturers, that will put particular pressures on them. There is a change in some patterns of behaviour in our society whereby the mother will then go back to work and the father will stay at home as the nurturer. But in percentage terms, that number is a very small at present and the situation is not the norm. Nearly all the women that I have known are very pleased to follow that pattern. What they do not want is for somebody else to tell them that they should never do anything else; that having become mothers they should never at some subsequent stage, whether it is two months, two years or 20 years after the birth of their children, do any job rather than mothering. There is a growing anger and resentment amongst women who make the decision, as the great majority of them do, to follow the full time nurturing job when their children are very young that they seem to disappear off the face of the earth in the debate about the importance and significance of women. I ask the honourable member for McMillan to look fairly carefully at what he said about family allowances in that light. When the family allowance was introduced it was stated by the Fraser Government at the time that it was intended as a recognition of the economic contribution that women made as mothers. The Fraser Government never minded if a mother was also in outside employment and perhaps pl:l.id somebody else to look after her children while she was at her place of employment. That distinction was never drawn. The Fraser Government never means tested the family allowance. It was a fundamental misunderstanding or unwillingness to recognise nurturing, child ing, as a vocation, whether the child rearing was done by the child's natural mother or by somebody that the parent paid to do some part of it that lead to the means testing of the family allowance. The family allowance was never a social security measure under the Fraser Government. The family income supplement was the social security measure. Family allowance was paid, in most cases, to mothers of dependent children. Family income supplement was the social welfare payment for low income families with children. It was that utter lack of understanding that, I believe, led to the means testing of family allowances. I find it totally obnoxious philosophically to means test the family allowance. It is the only benefit other than Austudy, paid by government where a means test is applied to the recipient according to the income that somebody other than the recipient gets. In the case of Austudy, the means test is applied to the recipient, the student, according to the taxable income of the student's parent or parents. In the case of family allowance, the means test is applied to the mother according to the income of the father, and there is no guarantee that the mother sees one cent of the father's income as disposable income for herself. If the Government wanted to do some redistribution, it could be done in other ways, but means testing is the most iniquitous possible way. As well as being unfair, it shows that the Government still has some pretty muddled thinking on the subject of women. I want to refer to another couple of comments that the honourable member for MCMillan made. I tried an intervention earlier in his speech which he ignored. I thought he was quoting from an article which appears today on page 3 of the Australian. It is an article on interviews with a number of people, including former Senator Susan Ryan, on the progress of affirmative action and equality for women. An enormous irony is that on the facing page of the Australian, page 2, there is a very large article by a gentleman called Padraic MCGuinness in which he took feminists to task. In the article Mr MCGuinness managed to reveal that he knew absolutely nothing about the subrearject. He was certainly able to enunciate the well-known prejudices and some of the welldeserved criticisms of the more extreme areas of feminism but, as a former university employee, I was really quite bowled over by what he had to say about how women had not wanted to go anywhere as academics over all the years in which the cluster of academic appointments of women in universities had been at the tutor level-year-byyear temporary appointments, which carried no superannuation and no advancement prospects-and not at the lecturer level. I cannot believe that Mr MCGuinness has ever talked to a single female academic the subject, if he wrote the nonsense that put in his article. If there is one area where women have been really vocal, it has been in the area of discrimination against them academia. Of course, the women who are complaining about that discrimination tend to be fairly literate and quite able to present their point of view. That complaint was made as far back as 30 years ago. Of course women wanted the academic appointments, of course they were applying for them, but they did not get them. The whole subject of discrimbest ination within universities, not only on academic side but in the whole area of ployment practices until very recently, is something I would like to say more about and have said more about on previous occamovement sions. Universities were notorious in their discrimination against all categories of male. employees. Happily, that is no longer so. The statistics are not good, but things changing. When we started talking about affirmative action it was tertiary institutions that were prepared to move-at that stage some of them had moved anyway-faster than others, but not all. There is one celebrated chancellor, who will remain nameless in this debate, who also talked a lot of rubbish the subject of sex discrimination at the time. He was, I might say, mainly talking about State legislation, but he presented it as though it was Federal legislation. I mentioned earlier that there is a college in my electorate-the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education (CAE)-which is subject to the amalgamachildren, tion proposals of the Government. The coltion lege is resisting that vigorously, as is Gold Coast community. I hope that the Mintion ister for Employment, Education and Trainand ing (Mr Dawkins) will change his mind on it. The Gold Coast CAE does not measure up in terms of size, but of course, it is only two years old; it is growing at a phenomenal pace. There is no doubt that in very few years indeed it will reach the minimum size required by the Minister for an institution stand alone. For the rest of my speech-and I am going to run out of my allotted time but I shall try to finish by the time the House is due to adjourn this evening-I want to refer again to some of the things that my colleague the on honourable member for Flinders was saying he today. He took the Government and the union movement to task over their role in relation to flexible working arrangements. My in involvement in the women's movement-although it was not then called that-goes back some 25 years when I was involved in a committee set up by the National Council of Women relating to the status of women. It was one of the early campaigners for equal pay for women. The greatest enemy or obstacle, at worse on some occasions, and at on other occasions, to equality for the women, particularly in the equal pay area, emwas the union movement. At best it could not give a hoot and at worse it was overtly hostile. Of course, in those days the union was almost entirely male. It was only in the few traditional areas of female feemployment that there were any women employed in the union movement. I am quite are proud to say that I was one of those women. For as long as I was in my previous working life I was on the executive of whichever relevant union there was; but we were very few indeed. The honourable member for Flinders was viceright in saying that if we had a less rigid approach to the matter of awards and strucon tures and so on-the rigidity which is being insisted on by the union movement at present-then women would be among the first to benefit. That has ever been so. The notion of permanent part time work, for example, with the benefits that go with it-continuity of employment when a woman has young the right to accrue a superannuaentitlement, which makes a great deal the of difference to the aged-the superannuaentitlement versus pension dependency so on-these are very much female issues that the honourable member for Flinders was addressing today, and of course that is affirmative action. That is examining the obstacles in the work force that do not need to be there and structuring working hours and conditions in a way that enables more to ready access to employment by women. When Mr MCGuinness maybe looked at the figures-I suspect he did not-and drew some conclusions about women in academia, he fell for the eternal, extremely difficult to avoid thought process fallacy that if the women are not in the field, it is because they do not want to be there. I am the only woman in the Opposition in the House of Representatives. Would Mr MCGuinness seriously suggest that there is not another woman in Australia committed to the antisocialist philosophy who does not want to be or is not capable of being here? Would he suggest that I am the only one in Australia? Rubbish. I am not that good. I am pretty good, but not that good! Of course not. There are other reasons. I am saying it is because there is overt discrimination. I think it is because those who make the selection on our side of politics fall for same mistakes as the honourable member for MCMillan; they do not see that the work that a woman does, say as a mother, is work, so it is not assessed as such when women come before a selection council. And so it goes. Of course, the Australian Labor Party had to take a pretty thorough beating around the ears from Senator Ryan before it woke up to it and embarked on an affirmative action program in its own ranks-with outstanding results, I might say. Mrs Darling-And now there is no stopping them.",98
205,Mrs SULLIVAN,CHANGES IN REAL DISPOSABLE INCOMES,"That is right. Well, there are some attempts to stop them. I point out that I applauded the affirmative action taken by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) when he appointed his Ministry after the last election. I deplore the fact that factions were not able to do the job for him and that he had to go to those lengths. I am also very sorry that, the Prime Minister ing determined that his Party was to pursue its affirmative action objective when in ernment, that did not happen when Senator . Ryan retired. On behalf of the Opposition I am pleased to support the Bill. I am also pleased to support the amendment and I would urge all those who have a care and concern on the subject of women to look at all the dimensions-the woman·- in the work force, the woman attempting to get into the work force, the woman who has never been able to get into the work force, and those who consider they are in the work force when they are doing their work in the home.",101
206,Mr JOHNS,CHANGES IN REAL DISPOSABLE INCOMES,"One always feels a bit sensitive in encroaching on an area where supposedly women have an advantage in the sense that this is affirmative action for women that we are debating. Nevertheless, I feel quite comfortable in the debate and I want to make a number of points which go to the question of the values that men and women hold, which might well affect the opportunities that. women have in society, either to enter the· paid work force or to remain in the home and to play that role. I do not distinguish or place a value on a woman's role in the work force as opposed to her role at home. What we must avoid the though is, for instance, intervention by the Government which might discriminate in favour of keeping a woman in the home. There is often debate about the level of the dependent spouse rebate. In my mind the dependent spouse rebate is a biased method which says, often to the male who is the single income earner, 'Your wife has a certain value on her head if she stays at home'. The tax system in that sense is not value free. It is making a statement about the worth of a woman at home and in that sense I believe it reinforces an attitude which says that a woman-'s place is in the home. Better that we place the emphasis squarely on assistance to the family; that is, children being nurtured in a family. Where governments can intervene it is, for instance, to support a family through family allowance the or family allowance supplement. So let us get that right. Governments can intervene and positively discriminate or place a bias hav- towards the woman in the home, and that has been occurring ,for many years. We are gov- attempting to have government intervention which either removes barriers to entry into the work force or takes away the bias that previously existed that held women at home without other options. It is their choice whether they want to stay at home or to work. Let me use some illustrations about values, because many other members have given us marvellous figures of the performance of women in the work force and so on. I was recently at the Bald Hills College of Technical and Further Education (TAFE), which is in the electorate of Lilley but close to my electorate, and was lucky enough to be able to launch in a local sense the Australian Women's Employment Strategy, which is published by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Mrs Darling-You did very well.",101
207,Mr JOHNS,CHANGES IN REAL DISPOSABLE INCOMES,"I thank you. At that time met a dozen young women who were taking on a pre-vocational apprenticeship course,· which means that they spent about six workers months at a T AFE college and then they moved off and searched for an apprenticeque, ship. The marvellous thing about these 12 women is that they were in an industrial and construction area. They were talking about tiling, carpentry and electrician's work. sort of modern man I still feel not so much uncomfortable but a little amazed that women choose to go into those sorts of areas of employment. I was amazed at our converyears. sation, because they wanted to du it. They chose it. There were no barriers in their path. We educated them, we assisted them and then the T AFE college eventually got them into apprenticeships. The electrician who fixed the wiring recently in my new electoyou, rate office was a woman electrician. She did a marvellous job. But I am not used to seeing that. So there is still a long way to go before we see a complete overturning of the segreattitudes gation that we are used to in various areas of industry and various jobs. I was talking one of the female teachers from the TAFE college and she told me that when young women first enter the college for a fitting and turning course or whatever, an old storeman would hand out the equipment before the class. This bloke could not handle the fact that a woman would come to him wantrance I might saying a piece of equipment. He refused to take from the store whatever the woman wanteda saw or a screwdriver-and hand it over to what? her. I guess that is the sort of attitude women have to face. I am not aware of that until am told. I was amazed by that sort of attiillustrations tude. Sure enough, the storeman had to be sat down and talked to and told in no certain terms that these women were genuPrime ine, they wanted to become electricians, tilers, carpenters and whatever else. he began to hand over the tools and do the right thing. These are the problems women face. My other point illustrates that men have a long way to go. I had cause recently to phone the Trades and Labour Council over the issue of bank charges on workers' incomes. Under the second tier arrangements all workers in the trade unions affected I shifted from a cash payment system to a bank payment system. As part of the negotiations I understand that a number of male were complaining that the little piece they used to keep back from their pay checalled the 'cunning kick', might disappear. In other words, they used to get $200 in their pay packet and take $40 out for the smokes, the grog, the Totalisator Agency As a Board (TAB) and whatever else, go home and tell the wife, 'That is how much I earn, $160 a week. See how you go on that'. I was amazed as I had not heard of that for 20 I thought it was outmoded. Not only is it not outmoded, but recent negotiations have now placed it in concrete so that the workers now get two bank accounts, one for the $160 which goes to the family, and the other for the $40 for the TAB and the grog. The kick back at least is that he now has to pay two bank charges. I say, 'Bad luck to sport. You should consolidate the bank accounts, pay the $200 all into one, be honest and tell your family you are supposed to be supporting that you earn $200'. Those still abound today. I am amazed that they are still with us. They are now to ensconced into legislation and the boys are still slipping money out the back door to have their fun. I am amazed by that. Mr MCGauran-You are amazed at a lot of things, aren't you?",102
208,Mr JOHNS,CHANGES IN REAL DISPOSABLE INCOMES,"Yes, I am, at your ignoMr MCGauran-Ignorance in regard to",102
209,Mr JOHNS,CHANGES IN REAL DISPOSABLE INCOMES,"Your entire role here, I I would suggest. I want to continue with these as they are fundamental to this notion of values. As I travelled recently on unthe retirement incomes task force of the Minister (Mr Hawke) the question of whether women should retire at the age of So reluctantly 65 was often debated. Mr MCGauran-1 suppose you are amazed at that.",102
210,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHANGES IN REAL DISPOSABLE INCOMES,"Order! The, honourable member for Gippsland will cease interjecting or I will deal with him.",103
211,Mr JOHNS,CHANGES IN REAL DISPOSABLE INCOMES,"Thank you. Many people were in favour of that notion. The men who were in favour of it are those who said, 'Look, there is equality for women, there is affirmative action, so why not let them retire at the same age as men?'. Mr MCGauran-Amazing.",103
212,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHANGES IN REAL DISPOSABLE INCOMES,I warn the honourable member for Gippsland.,103
213,Mr JOHNS,CHANGES IN REAL DISPOSABLE INCOMES,"The important aspect there is that these are the sorts of fellows who really did not have much regard for the amount of time that women have spent in the work force, the degree to which they have even entered the work force, whether or not they have access to superannuation, good conditions, a career structure; and all the rest of it. There was just this reaction, 'Women have equality of opportunity. We passed a law one day, did we not? Therefore they should retire at the age of 65'. We have a long way to go when some people can hide behind our legislation and say that the lem has all been fixed. It has not been fixed. It certainly has not been fixed. Until women have significant career paths, superannuation to support them, the opportunity to move that superannuation between different jobs, to leave the work force and take part in that nurturing process of bringing up children, and then, if they wish, to re-enter the work force, we could not possibly contemplate moving the retirement age to 65 to be equal with men. So we have a great deal of the way to go yet. The thing that I guess annoyed me a little is that mainly the Nationals, not so much the Liberals, argued today that we could not legislate for values. Yet in my dear State of Queensland we have a National Party Government that always seeks through legislation to impose its values. It sees itself as God's own police. It tells us what films we should watch, what books we should read and what we should write. It keeps important information from school girls about sexuality. The National Party is very keen to legislate and impose its values. But here it says, 'We cannot have affirmative action legislation, we cannot seek to change values in favour of women's opportunities', but it is not slow to rub it in in its State legislation to tell us how each of us should live by a moral code. The Liberal Party is a lot softer in that I think the hearts of at least the small 'I' liberals are always in the right place. But at the moment they are fishing around for rednecked voters and I think they have to move a little towards the National Party line. Let me look a little at the response of the Queensland Government to the Australian Government's initiative written up in the Australian Women's Employment Strategy. The Queensland Government acknowledges that one of the important elements in this whole question is the element of values. The Queensland Government neither goes beyond that nor seeks to play much of a role in the equality of women through government intervention. The Commonwealth Government and various State governments have brought down various pieces of legislation, such as the Sex Discrimination Act, the affirmative action legislation and so on. The prob- Commonwealth Government has introduced a series of Acts, as have the New South Wales Government, the Victorian Government, the South Australian Government, the Western Australian Government the Tasmanian Government, the Northern Territory Government and the Australian Capital Territory. I had to ask earlier in the day whether there was a misprint in this document as there is no mention whatsoever of legislation by the Queensland Government on matters of equal opportunity, sex discrimination or affirmative action. It does not exist, there is nothing there. It legislates for values when it wants to deny us and keep us ignorant, but it will not legislate for values for the equality of women. There are a whole string of other issues where the Federal Government and the State governments have picked up the ball and run and have sought to overturn barriers placed in front of women. In the issues of maternity and parental leave, the notion of paid maternity leave is available in the Commonwealth, Victorian, New South Wales and Northern Territory public sectors. But in the Queensland public sector there is unpaid maternity leave-a failure. On the question of child care the ComIt monwealth Government's record is clear. But in addition, New South Wales has picked the ball and run, as have South Australia, the Northern Territory and Victoria. They have all assisted to make child available, but Queensland has not. International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convenperor tion No. 156 seeks to invoke the rights of paternity for the male. South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania have all ratified the ILO Convention, but Queensland has not. In removing discriminatory proviout sions in awards and legislation we have movement on the Commonwealth front and in New South Wales and Victoria, but none in Queensland. I understand that under Commonwealth law there are full rights for women in regard to Commonwealth superannuation, but only recently has this been true in Queensland. So in perhaps three out of the five critical areas where we can remove barriers for the equal opportunities fOf women, the QueensSome land Government has not assisted. It has taken a stand against equal opportunity for women, whether it is women who want to stay at home and do that marvellous and important task of raising children, a task which I might say I enjoy, or whether it to go into the paid work force.

214,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., the this debate is interrupted. I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.'",104
215,Mr ROCHER,ADJOURNMENT,"The presment ence this week in Canberra and in Parliacrop ment House of a delegation from Ethiopia prompts the expression of views which memreports bers of that delegation should understand exercise the minds of many Australians. Centheir tral to their concern and mine is the view that Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam is carving his niche in history as possible the world's, and certainly Africa's, most brutal contemme porary dictator. Some of that brutality made possible by the $US6m in military and hardware given to that country since 1977 by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. is also partly made possible by the active presence of 2,000 crack Cuban troops, who, up not surprisingly, provide for the personal safety of Mengistu himself. To that figure one can add 700 Soviet and 500 East Gercare places man military personnel. Following the overthrow in 1974 of EmHaile Selassie by a group of middle and junior grade officers known as the Dergue, Mengistu murdered his revolutionary colleagues and opponents alike to rise to outright power over the Dergue in a shootthat he led in February 1977. In November 1977 Mengistu embarked on a four-month bloodbath-later described as the 'red terror'-in which 10,000 real and perceived civilian opponents were killed. Despite the creation in 1987 of a national legislature known as the Shengo, Mengistu has com'plete personal control over Ethiopia's government and militia. He heads that country's only political party, the Marxist Workers Party, and is commander of the armed forces. of his top advisers and aides to abandon him over the period of his dictatorship include Foreign Ministers Zewdie G. Selassie, Kisle Wodago and Goshu Wolde, as well as Minister of Justice Getachew Kibret. Added to that list are his two top officials in is charge of famine relief, 23 ambassadors and 42 other diplomats posted outside Ethiopia. That number of defectors is chicken feed alongside the estimated three million EthioLike Stalin, Mengistu deliberately has starved areas of strong opposition by denying and food assistance. He supplemented genocidal tactic by military assault, employing tanks and bomber aircraft. Ethiopia's famines are as much due to forced resettleand labour policies which interrupted planting as they are to two more publicised droughts. There were better publicised of ships carrying Western food aid laying in harbours with perishables rotting in holds while military hardware was being unloaded from Soviet and Eastern bloc ships. The catalogue is seemingly endless and far too long to record in the time available to tonight. I refer, for instance, to the is breaking up by the use of famine of social religious communities that might threaten this ogre's rule. What about the massive suppression in Eritrea and Tigre? From my not dwelling on that matter, and the tens of . thousands of casualties in those regions, should not be construed that they are unimTo portant or insignificant; far from it. The presence in these precincts of a visitthe ing delegation would normally deserve a more moderate reaction, if only as' a matter of courtesy. For the reasons that I have touched on, I can do Colonel Mengistu Haile Hariam no honour. He is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of his countrymen and for the pitiful hunger of millions more. His leadership can be likened already to of Pol Pot. Dr Claude Malhuret, French Secretary of State for Human Rights,early in 1977 stated: Western governments and humanitarian groups Live Aid are fuelling an operation that will scribed with hindsight in a few years time as one of the greatest slaughters in the 20th century.",104
216,Mr GEAR,ADJOURNMENT,"In last Saturday's edition of the West Australian there appeared a brochure from Citibank Ltd ofbank fering up to $10,000 revolving credit and, its words 'with lower monthly p-yments' and 'low minimum monthly repayments that will be up to one third lower than most credit card facilities you may be using right now'. Whilst in a sense, these statements are true, Citibank has used ambiguous language. For instance, it is obviously intended to give impression that because payments are lower the loan will be cheaper. A closer reading of the brochure shows us that exactly the opinstitutions posite is true and if the consumer acts in way suggested by Citibank the use of credit will become extremely expensive. The small print reveals that the interest be charged is at an annual rate of 24 per cent-expensive even by credit card standcredit ards. The small print also reveals an example of how the scheme works and why the facility monthly repayments are lower. It is obas viously not cheaper credit at 24 per cent, but the minimum payment is only 3.5 per cent of the outstanding balance, not the standard 5 per cent required by credit card accounts. The example given states: For instance, on a balance of around $5000 mum monthly payment of 3.5% is only $175 comlians pared to 5% which is $250 per month. This example is used to substantiate Citibank's claim that its offer-and I quote: could mean an extra $70 to $80 each month. it A tidy sum towards balancing the Budget. put its example to the test and to see what impact that example would have on family budget, I had the Parliamentary Library calculate what the cost to the consumer the offer by Citibank would be over time-not the single monthly example used in the brochure. At a repayment of $175, the loan would be repaid in 43 months with a total interest payment of $2,488. At a repayment of $250 the loan would be repaid in 26 months with a total interest bill of that $1,449. Using its own example, and taking advantage of the low monthly payment, it can be seen that the consumer pays an extra $1,039 and has to continue the repayments like for a further 17 months. All those extra be depayments would also be handy for balancing the budget, but of course that is not spelt out. My purpose in raising this matter tonight is to illustrate how the advertising by Citipresents a very distorted image to the in consumer. It is time for a bit of honesty, if this brochure by Citibank is to represent the standard of advertising in the consumer credit area. Consumers should be presented with all of the benefits and all of the costs so that they can make a balanced judgment. It is obvious that Citibank has gone to a great the deal of trouble to spell out the benefits; however, there should also be a requirement, preferably by the banking industry itself, that offering credit present the costs the of the service in a truthful and comparative way. As an example, Citibank's offer is aimed at the credit card, revolving credit market to and, as such, should state whether it gives up to 55 days free credit, as advertised by card operators. It should also inform the consumer of his liabilities if the credit is stolen and used by others, as well the extra cost over its competitor of using its offer, which is what I showed earlier. There is a growing concern over the rise in consumer debt in Australia, with credit card debt currently standing at $10.8 billion. It may well be that the distorted advertising a miniused by Citibank helps explain why Austraare being conditioned to accept continuous debt as the norm. In conclusion, I believe it is about time that advertisements offering credit told the whole truth, warts and all, to give consumers a fighting chance of making a rational judgment as to which credit facility suits their circumstances. This is a matter that I will pursue further with the banking industry, the advertising council, and Ministers for consumer affairs.",105
217,Mr ANDREW,ADJOURNMENT,"While we have enjoyed the relative comfort of this chamber, South Australia has just spent its tenth day in temperatures that have exceeded the old 100 degrees. In fact, last Saturday was the only day in that 10-day period that the State has had anything like tolerable weather; I understand the top temperature on that day was 34 degrees. While this may not be a particular burden to honourable members who have the facility of this chamber, one should point out that, for those growing horticultural crops in the Adelaide hills, this spell of hot weather has been disastrous. For apple growers and wine grape growers in the Barossa Valley and Clare Valley, the opportunity to deliver fruit of the quality that they had originally expected to deliver has been lost entirely. However, every cloud has a silver lining. For those in the Riverland area who are currently in the dried fruit game, this spell of hot weather has allowed them to dry fruit in record time. In the few minutes available to me in the House tonight, I would like to bring to the attention of the House a new dried fruit product that has emerged in the South Australian Riverland, relatively unrelated to the hot weather but more readily available because the hot weather has speeded up the drying process. Honourable members will be familiar with the historic technique for drying fruit. The technique used is either to place grapes on racks and spray them with an appropriate chemical to hasten drying, or in the case of fruit itself, to slice the fruit, remove the stones, place it on trays, stack those trays in what are called sulphur boxes, expose them to sulphur dioxide so that they have some form of preservative and then stand them out in the sun to dry. It is a very labour intensive industry which, not surprisingly, produces a relatively expensive product. Those honourable members who have been discouraged by the price of dried fruit in the local retail store will be encouraged to know that a new, but old, product is now emerging. As a result of work done by the Waikerie Producers, the old technique of slicing fruit, placing it on trays and in the sun is no longer necessary. This group has now allowed growers to take fruit which may be overripe-if it is overripe, it has an even higher sugar content-collect it in scrupulously clean plastic buckets, add to those buckets the minimum amount of metabisulphide necessary to preserve the fruit and stand it in the cool store until the processor is ready to take those buckets and place the product through a sieve, which takes the stones out and produces a fruit mix of about the same consistency as tomato sauce. This 'tomato sauce' is spread on plastic trays and run through a dehydrator. The end result is what was once known as fruit leather-a slice of fruit which is quite malleable, pliable and, of course, very tasty because of the high sugar content from which it is formed. The great advantage of this fruit leather is that all sorts of crops can be turned into what was known in biblical days, and has now emerged in 1989, as kamaradin. Apricots, pears, plums, peaches, or combinations of these, can be produced in this form of kamaradin. A baker does not particularly want to buy expensive sliced apricots because all he does is put them through a mincer and produce a tart. He is much happier buying a product which is cheaper and with an even higher sugar content than a sliced and dried apricot. - I I am proud to have In my electorate a new industry emerging and producing a product older than biblical days when it was known as kamaradin or fruit leather and which at one stage had some religious significance because it allowed people to consume something in the way of food on days when consuming what was the normal diet of the culture was regarded as improper. Here we have a product that shows what innovative Australians can achieve. More than that, we have a product that allows us to ensure that wl!at we export overseas may well be value added and help to address our balance of payments deficit. I",106
218,Mr LAMB,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I wish to pay tribute to Pauline Toner, a former Minister of the Cain Government in Victoria who died last week, too soon, at the age of 53. I would have preferred to have paid this tribute last week, just after she resigned, so that she could have heard the goods words herself. It is appropriate that I should do so today, International Women's Day, given her great contribution to the cause of a more humane society and to the advancement of women. My family knew Pauline Hoare's family well in Horsham. Her father was a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and a councillor. Pauline was educated in Horsham at Brigidine Convent. As a young student, like so many who had to leave the country regions to go to the metropolis for education, she went to Melbourne in 1952 and became a teacher. Some time later, she married Brian Toner, an architect, and together they had five children. I should point out that it was very difficult at that time for a married woman to continue her prof-ssion as a teacher. If I recall correctly, women were forced to resign, they were made temporary staff and they did not have access to superannuation. These things changed later. However, Pauline Toner undertook further studies-first of all an arts degree and later an education degree-while she continued to be a mother and wife. She joined the ALP in 1968 and in 1973 was the first woman elected to the Diamond Valley Shire Council. It was in recognition of her considerable talents that she was elected by her colleagues as the Shire President four years later. This was again a firstshe was the first woman shire president in Victoria. In 1977, she was elected to the Victorian Parliament as the member for Greensborough-the second woman ALP member to be so chosen. In 1979 she achieved another first-she became the first woman to be a Labor shadow Minister in Victoria. On the election of the Cain Government, she became the Minister for Community Welfare Services. In yet another first, she also became Victoria's first woman Cabinet Minister. There is no doubt that she did an excellent job under very difficult circumstances. It was a time of change and the changes in her portfolio, particularly in the area of prisons, made political life very difficult for her. cause she was a woman, criticism and pressure was all the more fierce. She came through this storm of criticism with flying colours. As the now Deputy Premier, Joan Kirner, has said, Pauline was 'a trail-blazer, who had shown women MPs how to cope with the ""bear-pit"" that was State Parliament'. It is interesting to note that, following Pauline Toner's time, the portfolio she held was changed, with responsibility for prisons being separated from community services. Pauline did much to humanise corrective services and drag the prison system out of, as she called it, the 'Dark Ages'. Pauline Toner never sought to run away from a difficult issue, whether it was in politics or in life generally. She had great courage. She understood that politics was a difficult and demanding job. She never complained when situations were not to her liking. She was forceful, but very fair when attacking her political opponents. She did, indeed, epitomise the phrase 'Grace under pressure'. In recent days, very few people, including many of her close friends, knew the seriousness of her illness. She led a normal life almost to the last, again showing her remarkable courage. Pauline Toner will be sorely missed by the community which she served with such dedication and spirit. Her memory will live in the minds and hearts of those whom she helped. Our sympathy goes to her familyhusband, Brian; four daughters Jane, Madeline, Rachel and Lucy; and son, Denis. Understandably, Melbourne's metropolitan newspapers have been filled with tributes to Pauline Toner. One anonymous tribute in particular put well how those of us who knew Pauline feel: It would take a book to list Pauline's accomplishments and the names of those she helped. If all politicians had her courage, dedication, integrity and compassion this would indeed be a lucky country. Pauline gave freely her loyalty and friendship, most precious gifts one person can bestow on another and I was privileged to have been one of these recipients.",106
219,Mr BLANCHARD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to put on record thaJ this week, with some of my colleagues, I met with the Attendant Care Coalition of Victoria. This body was formed as a result of an initiative of this Be- Government in 1986 to provide money for attendant care in the community. Attendant care is the provision of care by an able bodied person for a disabled person. In other words, the carer becomes the arms and the legs of the disabled person and does those things which the disabled person cannot do. This may range from assisting with personal care, providing meals, transport, secretarial services or assisting with shopping. The Attendant Care Coalition was led by its convener, Mary Reid. It is interesting to note that Mary Reid herself is a disabled person. At the age of 10 she contracted polio and was severely paralysed in all limbs, including impaired respiratory involvement. It is to her credit that she has overcome her disabilities. I must say that she was helped to overcome her disabilities through the attendant care scheme. In other words, attendant care provides a tool for independent living for the severely disabled. However, it has benefits not only to the consumer but also to the community because it reduces community costs in that it gets people out of institutions into the wider community. In that sense it is a valuable benefit to all of us. There are areas of concern which the Attendant Care Coalition has brought to our attention. These include the need to restructure the current eligibility criteria to allow the inclusion of acute rehabilitation patients-spinal or otherwise-and other at risk groups currently living in the community. Under the present guidelines, which are obviously very restrictive, one has to be i- a hospital for six months before one is entitled to a benefit under the scheme. Quite recently we had a case in Victoria where a person could not obtain this benefit because that person was living at home. It seems that for those people who live at home we have a real problem. This problem should be addressed by the Government. People with disabilities presently living in the community rely on the personal family structures, and this puts an increasing strain on family structures. The result is that the traditional minder within the family is unable to attend their own work and so attracts a social security benefit. There is also the problem that that person, in caring for the acutely disabled person within the home, eventually runs the risk of burnout or grows old and cannot care adequately for the person. So the provision which requires a person to have six months of institutionalisation before getting a benefit under the attendant care scheme needs careful revision. I suggest that this is an issue that the Government should carefully look at.",107
220,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, today, as you would be well aware, the House had included in its activities a motion of censure on Madam Speaker. As a consequence of that a number of media people have expressed considerable interest in conveying that to the· public through the television media and others. They thought that the best way of achieving that would be by way of a debate between two of the participants. I understand that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) agreed to debate with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). We all know the rules in this place. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) repeats them constantly. He debates with the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for  Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) say that if he is prepared to debate with anyone at all, he will debate only with the Leader of the Opposition. They are the rules of this place. So it is quite clear that the offer of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) to debate with the Leader of the Opposition was not according to the conventions of this place and somebody else had to be provided. The Opposition offered me. Mr Dawkins-What is the point?",108
221,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,I made the point that participants were wanted for the debate. It appears that the Leader of the House declined the opportunity to debate with me. Mr Cunningham-You are not the Leader of the House.,108
222,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"No, but I was to be a participant in the debate. I think that was of significance. Our relative positions in the shadow Ministry and in the Cabinet are roughly the same, so it seems that the Leader of the House had little excuse on the issue of pecking order to decline the debate. One can only assume, therefore, that he did not want to find himself in a debate with me on television because presumably he would lose it. I think it is worth this House knowing that although the Leader of the House likes to use the domination of numbers in this place,he is not too anxious to get involved 10 a one on one situation on television with someone such as me. I think that that is delightful because those opposite laud themselves around the chamber when they know that the eventual result will be the vote. There is another matter that I think is worthy of reference in regard to that debate. Something that I thought was quite scurrilous and possibly an insult to Madam Speaker was the suggestion that the Opposition had picked upon Madam Speaker because she was a woman. Mr Deputy Speaker, if that is the case, you might consider why we picked on you on three occasions.",108
223,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor should not rehearse a debate that has already occurred in the House today or reflect upon the Speaker or other honourable members who are not here.,109
224,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The point I am making is that in recent times· there have been four censure motions or motions of dissent against the Speaker who was in the chair at the time and on three occasions it was not a woman. I think, therefore, that the Government in ma-in.g that claim could not even support it statIstIcally, but I am also very disappointed that it made it at all. My comments today were aimed much more at the Government, and I produced evidence to show the lack of support that this Government has given to its. Speakers. In fact, I read a newspaper artIcle that even referred to some discussions that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, were reported to have had with the Treasurer.",109
225,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The honourable member for O'Connor had better make sure that he does not reflect on me either. . Mr TUCKEY-I certainly did not, sir. I Just draw your attention to the fact that in my remarks I made substantial reference to the inadequacies of the Government in all of this. Had I been debating on television with the Leader of the House tonight, I would have been pointing out to him all the statistics that show that this Government has used Ques.tion Time for the purpose of dodging the Issue. It is only since the Opposition refused the Government this position-in fact, I call it drawing the teeth of rhetoricand demanded of Ministers that they give answers which can be understood and which deal with the questions, that it has been shown to be completely deficient in its ability to work in that way. The myth of the best front bench, et cetera has proved to be a farce. The Minister for Telecommunications  sic example of a failure. It is not that long ago that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) assumed the role of Treasurer for a while. Although he made a valiant attempt to answer the questions-and I congratulate him for trying-he failed to do so.",109
226,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,109
227,Mr CUNNINGHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"ln the minute remaining to me I would like to put one question before the House this evening. A censure motion was moved today. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair) had been removed from the chamber. I ask: Why did the Opposition not stand and defend him prior to his being removed from the House? When the debate came on, why did no-one seek to defend the very actions taken by the Leader of the National Party? Perhaps it is because the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who is now leaving the chamber, has a great disagreement with that gentleman at the moment in relation to policy positions in the rural sector, particularly on wheat. Members of the Opposition did not get .up and defend him. In three speeches, they did not bother to say one word in defence of his action. For the honourable member for O'Connor to come in here tonight is an absolute farce. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 8 p.m NA The following notices were given: Mr West to move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of National Medical Cyclotron facility, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney. Mr Tickner to move That this House: (I) expresses its deep concern about the violation of internationally accepted standards of human rights in Iran as recorded by Amnesty International; and (2) calls on the Government of Iran to act in response. to international opinion on this issue to prevent further violations.

Mr Cobb to move That the present Government's program to educate the Australian population with regard to AIDS should be redirected more towards preventing the disease through changing lifestyle patterns of risk groups in the community. Mr Tickner to move That this House: (I) notes the development of agribusiness in Australia; and (2) calls on the relevant Government departments to devise strategies to: (a) control appropriately the activities of agribusiness companies; (b) limit further concentration of ownership of their companies; (c) develop alternatives to agribusiness; (d) encourage research to enable farmers to move towards more sustainable agricultural practices; and (e) provide guidelines for the operation of agribusiness in Australia.

International Debt Management Facility (Question No. 650) Mr Langmore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 23 February 1988: (I) Is he able to say how the 'debt-for-bonds' swap agreement between Mexico and the United States of America, which was announced on 30 December 1987, operates. (2) Is he able to say whether this agreement involves the United States Administration in accepting the principle for officially trading in Mexican debt at a discount on its nominal value. (3) Is he able to say what support there is within the United States Congress for an international debt management facility based on this approach. (4) What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach to handling the Third World debt crisis.",123
230,Mr KEATING,YWCA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The debt exchange scheme for Mexico, as implemented in March 1988 under agreements involving the Government of Mexico, its commercial bank creditors and the Government of the United States, has the following main features: (i) the .issue by Mexico to participating creditor banks of $US2.6 billion in new, marketable 20 year bonds in exchange for the retirement of $US3.7 billion in Mexican debt owed to participating banks; (ii) the issue in (i) involved: the acceptance by participating banks of an average discount of 30 per cent on the face value of the retired debt, with the benefit of this discount accruing to Mexico through an immediate reduction of $US 1.1 billion in its outstanding external debt; National and Survey accounts - estimated net savings in interest payments basis basis by Mexico of $US 1.5 billion over 20 years; $ $ (iii) the issue by the United States authorities to 435.61 Mexico of $US2.6 billion in 20 year zerocoupon non-marketable United States Treas442.50 ury bonds for which Mexico paid $US532 million from its official reserve holdings; (iv) on expiry of the 20 year period Mexico will be paid the principal on the United States Treasury bonds and use these funds to redeem its own bond issue; the United States Treasury bonds are thus used as collateral for the Mexican bond principal, encouraging market acceptance of the scheme and larger discounts than might otherwise have been obtained; and (v) discounts were arrived at by a bidding process, with individual creditor banks deciding whether to participate in the scheme and, if so, what amounts and discounts to offer, and with the Mexican authorities free to decide which bids to accept. (2) In facilitating the scheme, the United States authorities have given support to a voluntary commercial arrangement between Mexico and its creditor banks in which Mexican debt is traded at a discount on its face value. United States official involvement was limited to issuing United States Treasury bonds as an effective guarantee against non-payment by Mexico of the principal on its bond issue. The United States issue was made at a price that compared favourably with the cost of alternative United States Treasury financing and the proceeds were used to meet official United States borrowing requirements. I am advised that there was no additional cost to the United States taxpayer beyond normal public sector borrowing costs. (The difference between the $US2.6 billion face value of the bonds and their $US532 million purchase price reflects the fact that interest is not paid on the bonds during the 20 year term but is capitalised at a compound rate.) (3) I understand that some members of the United States Congress have proposed the establishment of an international debt management facility which would buy developing country debt from commercial banks at a discount, restructure it on terms more favourable to debtors, and guarantee some of the banks' remaining exposure. Creditor governments would subscribe most of the facility's capital and effectively guarantee its market borrowings. Such proposals differ, however, from the Mexican scheme in that they would involve a financial cost to taxpayers in industrial countries and a transfer of risks from the commercial banks to the international debt management facility and creditor governments. Official intervention of this kind could also result in a reduced incentive for commercial banks to provide debtor countries with new loans and for debtor countries to adjust their economies, delaying their return to creditworthiness. There are also issues relating to equity as between debtor countries which have implemented strong adjustment measures and those whose adjustment efforts have lagged. (4) The main advantage to a debtor country from discounted trading of its debt is a reduction in its outstanding debt and debt-servicing obligations (as, for example, under the Mexican debt exchange scheme or debt-equity swap arrangements). However, debtor countries have not always benefited from secondary market discounts on their debt. Cash sales on the secondary market and debt swaps among banks can result in a change of ownership of bank claims while leaving the debtor's obligations unchanged. From the banks' viewpoint, the advantages and disadvantages of accepting discounts on their claims are a matter for their commercial judgment in the light of the specific arrangements proposed, including relevant taxation and regulatory provisions, the benefits of further rationalising their loan portfolios, risk of damage to market perceptions of the value of their remaining claims, and the likelihood of eventual full repayment. So far, international banks with large claims on problem debtors have accepted discounts on the face value of only a small proportion of their claims. The Mexican debt exchange scheme resulted in a net reduction in Mexico's external debt of $USl.l billion, or just under I per cent, compared with initial expectations in some quarters of up to $USlO billion. International Monetary Fund (Question No. 997) Mr Langmore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 19 May 1988: (1) What issues were discussed at the April 1988 meeting of the International Monetary Fund and associated groups in Washington. (2) What was Australia's position on each issue. (3) What was the outcome of the debate on each issue.",124
231,Mr KEATING,YWCA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) There were two main meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and associated groups in Washington in April 1988; the IMF Interim Committee meeting on 14 April and the IMF/IBRD Development Committee meeting on 15 April. The main issues discussed by the Interim Committee were: International economic developments prospects; The debt situation and strategy; and The role of the IMF in adjustment and financing. In particular, how to increase the effectiveness of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF); the Compensatory Financing Facility and how best to incorporate into IMF programs external contingency mechanisms that could help maintain the momentum of adjustment in the face of adverse external stocks; the Ninth General Review of Quotas; and the question of a resumption of SDR allocations. The Development Committee discussed two broad issues: The adequacy of resource transfers to all developing countries, including the problems of the indebted countries; Environment and development and the role of the World Bank. (2) The Hon. Peter Morris, MP, Minister for Transport and Communications Support, attended the Washington meetings in his capacity as Minister Assisting the Treasurer. Mr Morris' participation in the the meetings was on behalf of all the countries in our constituencies in the IMF and World Bank. A copy of statements made by Mr Morris to the Interim and Development Committees has been forwarded to the member for Fraser. (3) In discussing international economic developments and prospects, the Interim Committee noted that economic activity seemed to have been relatively well sustained in industrial countries despite the stock market slide; the prospects were for continued steady growth and low inflation. Despite some improvements, external imbalances continued to be large, and unemployment, especially in Europe, remained high. In the developing world, the Committee noted that, despite some improvement in export earnings and the debt/exports ratios, progress in restoring the momentum of investment and output growth had been inadequate. The burden of external indebtedness remained a major source of concern. Committee members remarked that there had been some positive developments in the debt situation, but they emphasised that strong cooperative efforts remained essential. Members emphasised the importance of continuing the case-by-case approach to debt problems and noted that this was the only way in which adjustment programs and financing flows could be tailored to individual country circumstances. The Members welcomed the recent development of the 'menu approach' as a demonstration of the flexibility of the present strategy. It was important to maintain open and growing markets for debtor countries' exports and adequate and timely financial support from creditors to facilitate the pursuit of growth-oriented adjustment policies in debtor countries. and The Committee reiterated that the Fund must continue to play a central role in the debt strategy through its assistance to members in the design of efficient adjustment programs. In this context the Committee welcomed the proposed changes to the Extended Fund Facility and the restructuring of the Compensatory Financing Facility and development of an external contingency mechanism. The Interim Committee noted that the broad support needed under the Articles of Agreement to enable the Managing Director to propose a resumption of SDR allocations has not emerged. The Committee requested the Executive Board to continue to monitor developments in international liquidity and to consider the question of SDR allocations and of increasing the usefulness of the SDR to all members. The Committee noted the progress the Executive Board had made on the Ninth Quota Review and urged the Board to complete its work by the April 1989 deadline. Development Committee members welcomed a number of positive developments since they had last met, including: The full effectiveness of IDA-8; The establishment of the IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF); The launching of the special program of assistance by the World Bank to help highly indebted low-income African countries; Agreement for a World Bank capital increase; and Progress achieved by many developing countries in their adjustment efforts. However, the Committee agreed that an enlarged volume of financial flows to the developing countries was required to meet the needs for economic growth, poverty alleviation, environmental conservation, structural adjustment and the resolution of debt difficulties. There was also need for a more supportive world economic environment. They also agreed that the flow of resources, which for some countries has been negative, could be enhanced by policies and actions by both developed and developing countries. Improved aid coordination, further strengthening of the international financial institutions, improved prospects for commodity export earnings and reductions of protectionist measures would contribute toward increased resource flows. Copies of the Communiques of the Interim and Development Committees and the G7 and G10 (which met prior to the IC and DC Meetings) have been forwarded to the member for Fraser.

(2) Has his attention been drawn to the concerns of pensioners with regard to the (a) lack of consultation with consumer bodies during the Clarke Review, (b) proposed downgrading of the Office of the Aged, (c) location of the secretariat in a Division within his Department, (d) size of the secretariat, (e) representation of the structure as a consumer body, (f) decision not to pay sitting fees and (g) appointment of members as individuals rather than representatives. (3) What will he do to answer those concerns. (4) Will he place a moratorium on those proposed changes to the Office for the Aged, pending consultation with aged persons. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) A review was undertaken by Mr Mike Clarke, Consultant to the Minister for Community Services and Health, into consultancy and advisory mechanisms in the Department of Community Services and Health. The Review report confirmed the Government's need to strengthen the advisory mechanisms dealing with consumer input, in particular to programs for the aged and the disabled. The implementation phases of policies recommended by the Nursing Homes and Hostels Review and the Handicapped Programs Review are now under way. Accordingly, the Review report also considered it would be more appropriate for both the Office of Disability and the Office for the Aged to be located in Canberra, in association with the Department of Community Services and Health's functional divisions of Disability Programs, Community Programs and Residential Programs. (2) I am aware that some community groups have expressed concern at various aspects of the decisions affecting the Office for the Aged and Office of Disability. They have received an explanation for the decisions in the terms outlined above. I have also had an extended meeting with representatives of both the Australian Pensioners' Federation and the Australian Council on the Aged to discuss the future of the Office for the Aged and progress being made on general advisory structures involving aged people. I believe the meeting was useful in dispelling misconceptions and in clarifying the ongoing role of the Office for the Aged as well as in sharing viewpoints on the consultation process. (3) The Government has established a major consultancy on User Rights to overcome the difficulty Aged Care of gaining access to the views of the users of,services. The consultancy, being undertaken by Ms. Chris Ronalds, a New South Wales barrister with wide experience in the fields of consumer and human rights, will not only provide invaluable information on consumer views at the present. time, but will encourage the development of mechanisms which will ensure that the views of aged people continue to be heard. Ms Ronalds's first report was released on 8 February 1989. (4) There will be no moratorium on the proposed changes to the Office for the Aged. Third World Debt (Question No. 1324)  notice, on 2 November 1988: (1) What was Australia's official input to the IMF and World Bank annual meetings held in Berlin between 24 and 30 September 1988 regarding Third World debt and development. (2) What was the outcome of those IMF and World Bank meetings with regard to the Third World debt crisis.",126
234,Mr KEATING,YWCA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Australia's input was reflected in statements I made to the Interim Committee and Plenary session, and in a statement by the New Zealand Associate Finance Minister and Minister of Commerce to the Development Committee on my behalf. The Interim and Development Committee statements were made on behalf of all the countries I represent in those Committees. Copies of these statements have been made available to the honourable member. Briefly, they indicate Australia's support for the present case-by-case, growth-oriented debt strategy and the important role of the IMF and World Bank in this strategy. As I noted in Berlin, Australia believes that the solution to the debt problem lies in a firm commitment by all countries to appropriate domestic adjustment policies and more open trading policies, supported by adequate external financing and the case-by-case application of voluntary, market-oriented 'menu' techniques in debt rescheduling. I emphasised the importance for sustained world economic growth-and for debtor countries-of further progress in reducing external imbalances between the major deficit country, the United States, and the major surplus countries, in particular West Germany and Japan. I noted that the single most useful contribution that governments can make to assist debtor countries over the medium term would be to progressively dismantle international barriers to trade, especially in agriculture but also in services and manufacturing. It is a sad indictment on decades of supposed international cooperation that, according to World Bank estimates, protection by developed countries reduces developing country national incomes by almost twice the amount of official development assistance that they currently provide. (2) The outcome of these meetings is reflected in the press communiques of the Interim and Development Committees. I have arranged for copies to be provided to the honourable members. Membership of Organisations (Question No. 1409) Mr Scholes asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 30 November 1988: (I) Who are the part-time members of the (a) Australian Statistics Advisory Council, (b) Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, (c) Commonwealth Banking Corporation, (d) Reserve Bank of Australia and (e) Foreign Investment Review Board.

Franked Dividends: Medicare (Question No. 1156) Mr Hawker asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 29 August 1988: (I) Has his attention been drawn to the situation where individuals who receive franked dividends pay the Medicare tax at the effective rate of 2.45 per cent on that income; if so, will he undertake to remove this anomaly so that the Medicare tax is 1.25 per cent on franked dividends, as it is with other forms of income. (2) If he will not do so, why not.",128
236,Mr KEATING,YWCA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The imputation system of company taxation was introduced on I July 1987 to eliminate the double taxation of company income-first at the company level and then in the hands of the shareholders when it was distributed as dividends. The system operates by giving shareholders who receive franked dividends a tax credit equal to the amount of tax already paid at the company level. Thus, of each $100 of profits a company earns, it first pays company tax of $39, leaving $61 available to be distributed as franked dividends. The shareholder who receives these dividends is then assessed for income tax and Medicare levy on the $100 of company profits and is entitled to a tax credit of $39 which reflects the tax already paid on these profits at the company level. Under the imputation system, therefore, distributed company profits are effectively taxed only once-in the hands of the shareholders at their relevant personal tax rates, including the Medicare levy. In this way the total amount of income tax and Medicare levy on company profits will be the same as that on income from any other source. The Medicare levy on company profits underlying distributions is 1.25 per cent, the same as on income derived by individuals from any other source. There is therefore no anomaly and no need to reduce this rate. Taxation of Pensioners (Question No. 1142) Mr Wright asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 24 August 1988: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the concerns and claims of the Pensioner League movement that the pension tax rebate system impacts unfairly on pensioners who have earned, during 1987-88, in excess of $6,142 because of what has been called the '12t% subtraction rule'. (2) Will he review the present application of tax on pensioners to bring it into line with other wage earners while retaining the full advantage of the tax rebate to pensioners as the rule effectively means that pensioners pay tax on income over the threshold at an average rate of over 36% compared with other income earners at 24%.",129
237,Mr KEATING,YWCA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The pensioner income tax rebate ensures that those wholly dependent on the pension and also those with some income in addition to the pension are not required to pay income tax. In order to provide maximum assistance to those in the greatest need, the rebate is withdrawn at the rate of 12.5 cents for each dollar of income in excess of a specified level. For the 1988-89 income year the rebate was increased to $430 and commences shading out when a pensioner's income exceeds $6,892 and is fully extinguished at an income level of $10,332. (2) The progressive withdrawal of tax concessions provided on an income-tested basis inevitably has the consequence of producing a combined concession withdrawal and marginal tax rate above the marginal tax rate faced by those who do not receive the benefits. However, it is never the case that a pensioner or part-pensioner is subject to an average level of tax greater than that applicable to a non-pensioner with the same income. Rental Assistance to ex-Prisoners (Question No. 1614) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 2 March 1989: (I) What are the details of the proposed changes to the 26 week waiting period for rental assistance to ex-prisoners. (2) How will reductions to the waiting period operate. (3) Is the waiting period to be reduced by the period of time a prisoner spends in gaol; if so, how will the arrangements operate when a person has spent two years in prison.",129
238,Mr HOWE,YWCA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I), (2) and (3) Currently claimants for unemployment, sickness or special benefit are not eligible for rent assistance for the first 26 weeks after they claim unless they have a dependent child. This includes released prisoners. Under the new provisions which come into effect from 13 June 1989, the time spent in prison will count towards the 26 week waiting period. Therefore, if a person has been in prison for 26 weeks or more rent assistance will be payable immediately on release regardless of whether the person has a dependent child. If the period in prison is less than 26 weeks the waiting period, before which rent assistance may be paid, will be reduced by the time spent in prison. For example, if a person is in prison for 20 weeks, rent assistance will become payable 6 weeks after release.",129
