Second Reading  Secretary to the Treasurer) (9.01 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Cross-Border Insolvency Bill 2007 gives effect to the model law on cross-border insolvency adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. Adoption of the model law will improve the efficiency and effectiveness with which Australia's laws deal with cross-border insolvency. ‘Cross-border insolvency' is a term used to describe the circumstances in which an insolvent debtor has assets or creditors in more than one country. Many businesses have interests stretching beyond their home jurisdictions. Firms are increasingly organising their activities on a global scale. With advent of sophisticated communications and information technology, cross-border trade is no longer the exclusive preserve of large multinational corporations. With businesses increasingly having assets, creditors and employees in a number of countries, it is important that laws are in place to deal with the circumstances that arise when such businesses fail. The bill provides for cooperation and coordination between courts with respect to insolvency proceedings that may occur in several countries simultaneously with respect to a debtor. Debtors with assets or creditors in more than one jurisdiction may not necessarily be incorporated. It can be equally important for 2007 cooperation and coordination to occur between jurisdictions with respect to individual debtors as it is for corporate debtors. Accordingly, the bill will also apply the model law to cross-border bankruptcy proceedings. The bill delivers three key reforms. First, it will ensure that there is no discrimination between foreign and domestic creditors in Australian insolvency proceedings. Second, where there is a foreign insolvency proceeding involving assets in Australia, it will provide the foreign administrator with direct access to assistance from Australian courts. And, third, where there is a foreign insolvency proceeding and a local insolvency proceeding, it will provide for the courts to cooperate with the goals of maximising the value of the debtor's worldwide assets, protecting the rights of debtors and creditors and furthering the just administration of the proceedings. The bill will also align Australian law dealing with cross-border insolvency with that of our major trading partners, many of which have already adopted the model law on cross-border insolvency. These include the Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. In conclusion, I note that the current bill has been developed after extensive consultation. The government appreciates the assistance of the members of the Insolvency Law Advisory Group and the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia in the preparation of the bill. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Edwards) adjourned. NA BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Ian Macfarlane. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
2,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,TRADEX SCHEME AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill will decouple the Tradex Scheme from the requirements of the customs drawback provisions and will simplify the administration of the scheme. The Tradex Scheme was a key initiative in the government's Investing for growth industry statement. It was introduced to provide a streamlined program for providing relief to businesses paying customs duty and GST on imported products that were to be reexported or incorporated into other goods that were to be exported. Decoupling the Tradex and drawback programs will enable the Tradex Scheme to remain consistent with the customs drawback provisions without being dependent on them. Both programs are designed to ensure customs tariffs are not paid on goods that are imported and subsequently exported, and that they are not inappropriately used or consumed while in Australia. This is consistent with the international taxation principle that duty should apply in the country of consumption. The essential difference between the two programs is that, under the drawback provisions, duty is paid on importation and then is subsequently returned on exportation. Under the Tradex Scheme, duty exemption is provided up-front and only becomes payable if the goods are not exported or are used or consumed inappropriately while in Australia. The separation of the legislation for the two programs should enable both programs to be better tailored to meet the particular demands of its customer base. Wherever possible, the elements of the drawback provisions will be adapted for incorporation into the Tradex regulations. The other amendments contained in this bill are aimed at enhancing the administration of the Tradex Scheme and will further reduce the regulatory burden on industry. The Tradex Scheme will continue to provide real benefits to Australian industry and improve our international competitiveness as a trading nation. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Edwards) adjourned. FAMILIES, COMMUNITY SERVICES NA NA (EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONSOLIDATION) BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Brough.

3,Mr BROUGH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Longman-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs) (9.08 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill introduces amendments to consolidate the government's major legislation responding to the national emergency confronting the abuse of Aboriginal children in the Northern Territory. Before outlining the details of the bill, this is an opportunity to provide an update on progress, report on some of the issues that have emerged and outline some important developments to do with land tenure and engagement with Aboriginal people. I have just left a meeting with Major General Dave Chalmers, who is overseeing the operation of this intervention. At the conclusion of this speech, I will be chairing a isterial task force meeting with my colleagues to ensure the implementation of this legislation is carried out to the full. Of course, we all would like everything in place as of yesterday, but there is a level of complexity that requires care and time, and local people have to be engaged in the process. The Northern Territory Emergency Response Taskforce is in place, fully staffed and working well under the leadership of Dr Sue Gordon and Major General Dave Chalmers. All 73 communities that were identified have been visited by departmental survey teams. Fifteen government business managers have been deployed, and more are on their way. Over 2,000 children have received health checks, and arrangements are in place to follow up on the results of those checks. The process of quarantining welfare payments in the first four communities has been completed. Over 20 people previously on CDEP at Imanpa and Finke have now converted into real jobs in health care, child care, night patrols and municipal services. Last weekend, the alcohol and pornography bans came into effect. The government has just announced a further $740 million in additional funding for policing, health, education, employment and housing, bringing the total emergency response so far to $1.33 billion over four years. This clearly demonstrates that the government is in here for the long haul to once and for all rid the Territory of the abuse, the neglect and the despair that have plagued it. But this is not just about spending more money. We are requiring better results on the ground. It is about a radical overhaul of the way we do business. It is about better value min- for money, and stronger and more positive outcomes. The response received from the public and people on the ground has been overwhelmingly supportive. Of course, there are issues where people differ in their views, but communication tends to solve most of these problems. Some people still argue about the permit system, even though it only applies to about 0.02 per cent of Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. But, over time, I expect some of the critics to see the long-term benefits that will be achieved by this very important measure. Some have expressed concern about the five-year leases of townships. Some, for mischievous reasons, have called it a ‘land grab'. Even the Leader of the Opposition says that he understands the relevance of this particular measure to the prevention of child abuse and he supports our approach. Since announcing the emergency intervention, more fundamental land reform measures have occurred. The people at Nguiu in the Tiwi Islands have signed a 99-year headlease so that they can enjoy greater economic benefits for their town, and local residents finally have the opportunity to realise what we all take for granted-our capacity to own our own home where we live. The people in the town camps at Julalikari have agreed to negotiate a 99-year sublease in return for a major new investment in housing and infrastructure by the Australian government. That is at town camps just outside of Tennant Creek. Another important model that has emerged recently in the Northern Territory will be outlined later. The tide is turning. The landscape is changing for the better. One of the difficulties we have faced in implementation in the early days has been a pushback from people with vested interests who want to maintain the status quo-people who are employees in some of these communities, often not Indigenous people, and people who work for community service organisations that purport to represent the views of Aboriginal people in local communities. It is the people they are paid to serve who are our priority in government. We will not bow to these pressures. We want to involve local people and empower them. Those who are trying to undermine the intervention have said it is a deliberate attempt to destroy Indigenous culture. The reverse is true. It is being destroyed now by dysfunction, alcohol, drugs and violence. Any culture would be destroyed under those circumstances. We want to empower the elders and allow the strength of Aboriginal culture to come to the fore-a living and vibrant culture engaging with the rest of world and respected by all. Several weeks ago, I met with Galarrwuy Yunupingu, former Australian of the Year and an important law man in his local community and elsewhere in the Northern Territory. He had sent a message stick to the Australian government asking for a meeting. I responded to that message stick. We talked at length about the intervention and arrived at a meeting of minds. He, like other Aboriginal leaders in the Northern Territory, very much wants children protected and wants a much better future economically and socially for their people. Mr Yunupingu supports the intervention in its efforts to protect children and create a better future for those children. His concerns were about how the five-year leases of town areas would operate and he wanted to ensure that the task force members and the government would be able to interact properly with local people in a culturally sensitive manner. His preference is for long-term and more formal leases. The government has signed a memorandum of understanding with him which agrees to the negotiation of an innovative 99-year lease arrangement for his traditional lands. The MOU recognises that the traditional owners can hold a headlease over a town and surrounding areas, with a 99-year sublease over the town to be negotiated with government. This model will become another avenue for other traditional owner groups if they wish to pursue a new pathway. The Australian government has also instructed government business managers and government agencies to work closely with local elders to make sure that our activities in the townships during the five-year emergency leasing period are fully understood and, most importantly, do not disturb sacred sites or other places of local significance. Mr Yunupingu also raised the prospect of establishing a senior elders group in the Northern Territory. Respected and legitimate Aboriginal law men and women drawn from local communities across the Northern Territory emergency response could provide a valuable source of advice to the Northern Territory Emergency Response Taskforce, to me and to government. I know Mr Yunupingu is committed to establishing such an important group and I wish him well with this very important undertaking. The government welcomes this initiative and commits to engaging with and taking advice from such a group, once formed. It is absolutely essential that the senior elders group be formed by local Aboriginal people themselves and not be just another construct of government or a group of governmentfunded service providers. Ideally, it would be a body that would, in its own way, be truly representative of local Aboriginal elders in the Northern Territory. This will send the strongest possible message to Aboriginal youth, reinforcing the importance of Indigenous culture and most importantly, in my eyes, the respect for their elders. On a final matter, Mr Yunupingu also told us that he is fiercely determined to realise economic potential of Aboriginal land. This is an important discussion that needs to continue to occur and the Australian government is committed to this continuing discussion. Without economic development, there will be no jobs and no future for Aboriginal children. The traditional owners must be full participants in this process if we are to ensure the future sustainability of the regional and remote areas of the Northern Territory. Returning to the details of this bill, the government's recent legislation included prohibitions on the possession, control and supply in prescribed areas of pornographic material. This bill addresses a further area of concern about inappropriate material, raised by the Northern Territory government and, again most importantly, by Aboriginal people themselves. Through amendments in this bill to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, any subscription television narrowcasting service will be prohibited from providing programming that is rated R18+ to subscribers who receive the service in the prescribed areas. This arrangement will be consistent with the pornography amendments already made to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995, including the sunset provision. A further measure in the bill will make sure that, if a roadhouse effectively takes the place of a community store in a remote area, it is properly treated as a community store in having to meet the new licensing standards. Assuming the community substantially relies on the roadhouse for grocery items and drinks, the roadhouse should be part of the scheme applying to community stores. Otherwise, roadhouses will continue not to be regarded as community stores. The legislation passed recently will have the effect of making the Commonwealth a the landlord for the purposes of the Residential Tenancies Act in the Northern Territory. The Residential Tenancies Act normally imposes requirements on a landlord about the state of repair of the premises in question. However, the fact is that the Northern Territory government has not been enforcing these standards in these communities. Under the new legislation, the Commonwealth has become the landlord of what is often dilapidated housing stock. The Commonwealth simply cannot comply with the already in place Residential Tenancies Act obligations in the short term, although we are committed to bringing the quality of this housing to an acceptable standard as quickly as possible. This bill now provides for the Residential Tenancies Act and the related tenancy act in the NT not to apply in the situations covered by the new lease arrangements. I want to make it clear that this does not mean the Australian government is avoiding its responsibilities as a landlord. It is simply to allow the response to do its proper work in making the substantial and essential improvements already announced, and to avoid any mischievous application of the Residential Tenancies Act by the Northern Territory government. The bill will amend the Defence Housing Australia Act 1987 to enable Defence Housing Australia (DHA) to assist with the construction of housing in remote Indigenous communities, subject to DHA being able to maintain its primary defence focus on meeting the needs of Australian Defence Force personnel. While DHA's functions are essentially limited to providing housing and housing related services for defence personnel, DHA has the expertise and construction market knowledge that would be required for assisting with an Indigenous construction program. The bill also makes minor or technical refinements to the land related provisions in the previous legislation. I commend the bill and the other measures I have described, aimed at protecting Aboriginal children in the Northern Territory and providing them with a much brighter future, to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Edwards) adjourned. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TAXATION OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Dutton. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",20
4,Mr DUTTON,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Dickson-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (9.21 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Tax Laws Amendment (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Bill 2007 introduces a comprehensive framework for the taxation of financial arrangements (TOFA). The objectives of the bill are to reduce tax induced distortions to investment and financing, to facilitate efficient risk management, and to reduce compliance and administration costs. The bill will reduce tax distortions by generally ignoring the distinction between capital and revenue in tax law, and taxing financial arrangements on their economic substance rather than their legal form. In order to align the tax treatment of economically similar financial arrangements, many financial arrangements will be taxed on an accruals basis. The bill will facilitate efficient risk management by allowing for the alignment of character and tax timing of hedging arrangements, increasing the post-tax efficiency and effectiveness of hedging. The bill will also reduce compliance and administration costs of Australian businesses by permitting closer alignment between tax and accounting outcomes on an elective basis, and reducing the complexity of accruals calculations. The bill contains a number of elections which allow eligible taxpayers to use results from their financial reports for tax purposes. The provisions in the bill will apply on a mandatory basis to taxpayers with substantial economic resources and sophisticated financial systems. Approved deposit-taking institutions, securitisation vehicles or financial entities must follow the new rules if their aggregated annual turnover is $20 million or more. Taxpayers with an aggregated annual turnover of $100 million or more must comply with the rules. Other taxpayers may choose to apply the new rules. Full details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Edwards) adjourned. VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (DISABILITY, WAR NA PENSIONS) BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Billson. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",24
5,Mr BILSON,WIDOW AND WAR WIDOWER,"Dunkley-Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence) (9.23 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to present legislation that affirms the government's ongoing commitment to Australia's veteran community and assists veterans who have been disabled as a result of their service for our country and our war widows and war widowers. The legislation increases payments to disability pensioners and war widows and war widower pensioners and changes the methodologies used to index their pensions. This bill will benefit more than 140,000 disability pensioners and approximately 114,000 war widows and war widowers, and ensure that their pensions retain their relative value and equity across the veteran community. The amendments will provide for a oneoff increase of $15 per fortnight to the extreme disablement adjustment rate; a five per cent increase to the general rate; and a change to the methodology used to index the general rate pension for veterans-all with effect from the March 2008 adjustment. The bill also allows a one-off increase of $10 per fortnight to the former domestic allowance component of war widows and war widowers pensions, and amends the way it is indexed, also with effect from March 2008. The legislation's one-off increase to the EDA brings it into line with increases to the special rate and intermediate rate disability pensions introduced in the 2007 budget. Additionally, the bill provides a five per cent increase to general rate disability pensions, which will mean a fortnightly increase of $20 for all pensioners at or above the general rate. These amendments will ensure equity across all veterans' disability pensions. The legislation also changes the way the general rate pension is indexed, from indexation to the CPI alone, to indexation with reference to both the CPI and MTAWE-male total average weekly earnings-in the same manner used to calculate service pensions. And, unlike the current methodology, the new means of indexation will take into account the present economic environment of wages growth and low inflation to calculate the relative value of all disability pensions. Currently there are two components in the calculations for special rate and intermediate rate disability pensions. The general rate provides compensation for non-economic loss or pain and suffering, while the above general rate provides compensation for economic loss. Compensation for non-economic loss is currently indexed to the CPI, while the economic loss component of disability pensions is indexed with reference to both the CPI and MTAWE. While CPI indexation continues to be used to maintain the value of non-economic loss payments in major injury compensation schemes, some smaller schemes do feature wage related methods of indexation. In keeping with the government's commitment to a ‘best practice' and beneficial system of support for service related injuries, illnesses and impairment the non-economic loss component of disability pensions will also be indexed with reference to both CPI and MTAWE in the same manner as the service pension from March 2008. The veteran community-particularly those veterans on the special rate disability pension-has argued strongly that these calculations are inequitable and should be changed. The government has worked closely with the veteran community on this matter and I am pleased to present a bill that introduces a uniform-and a more rational and equitable-method of indexation for all disability pensions. The legislation also ensures that war widows and war widowers will continue to receive equitable pension payments that will retain their relative value bill provides a one-off fortnightly increase of $10 to the former domestic allowance component of war widows and war widowers pensions, taking it to $35 per fortnight. Furthermore, this component will be indexed for the first time, also with reference to both CPI and MTAWE. The implementation of these enhancements is supported by a funding commitment of around $470 million from the March 2008 introduction and through the out years to 2011-12. This bill continues the Howard government's ongoing commitment to supporting Australia's veteran community and will ensure ongoing fairness and value in the pensions for our disabled veterans and war widows and war widowers. I would like to acknowledge, with my sincere thanks, the work of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, particularly the department staff-Caroline Spiers, Sean Farrelly, Leanne Kossatz, Jenni Stephenson, Mushtaq Butt and Jacqui Blackall. All have worked very hard with my own department staff to turn around the government decision and bring it to this stage where it can be put before the parliament as a proposed bill. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Edwards) adjourned. NA Public Works Committee Approval of Work",25
6,Mr MCGAURAN,COMMITTEES,"Gippsland-Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (9.29 into the future. This am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: RAAF Base Amberley redevelopment stage 3, Queensland. RAAF Base Amberley is the largest operational Air Force base in Australia. The development will sustain Amberley's growing base population and position it to better embrace the new aircraft platforms that are being introduced and are proposed for the future. This third stage of redevelopment will include 14 project elements encompassing fuel farm works, training accommodation, medical and dental facilities, trainee living-in accommodation, combined messing facilities, physical fitness training facilities and office accommodation. The estimated outturn cost of the proposal is $331.5 million, plus GST. In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed subject to the recommendations of the committee. The Department of Defence accepts and will implement those recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence in early 2008 and finish by late 2011. On behalf of the government I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",26
7,Mr MCGAURAN,COMMITTEES,"Gippsland-Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (9.31 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: CSIRO collocation with Queensland Government on the Ecosciences and Health and Food Sciences precincts, Brisbane, Queensland. The proposed knowledge based research business initiative will be a collaborative venture between the CSIRO and a number of Queensland government agencies at two key locations in south-east Queensland. These are: the Ecosciences Precinct at the Boggo Road Urban Village in Dutton Park and the Health and Food Sciences Precinct at Coopers Plains. The Ecosciences Precinct will be a centre of excellence focusing on climate change adaptation, better managing Australia's natural resources and environment, and growing Australia's farming, mineral, forestry, marine and tourism industries so that they are competitive and sustainable. It will consist of laboratories, offices and appropriate support facilities, including staff interaction areas. The Ecosciences Precinct will also create one of the largest concentrations of scientists in their field in Australia. Similarly, the Health and Food Sciences Precinct will consist of laboratories and support facilities, as well as a pilot plant for the development of new food products. The two precincts will foster increased sharing of skills, equipment and facilities. This will enable efficient and cost-effective research. They will collectively provide accommodation for 1,200 science professionals and support staff. The building designs will maximise opportunities for interaction between the partners, to provide flexibility in the use of space and to meet the changing needs of the research. The cost of shared facilities will be attribthe uted between the partners and the specific costs of any special facilities will be incurred by the individual agency. The estimated completion cost for the two developments is $375 million, of which the CSIRO component is estimated at $85 million. In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that this proposal should proceed subject to the recommendations of the committee. The CSIRO accepts and will implement those recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval, it is anticipated that early packages will be let to allow site establishment works to commence in February next year for the Boggo Road site and main works to commence at the same time on the Coopers Plains site. On behalf of the government I wish to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",27
8,Mr MCGAURAN,COMMITTEES,"Gippsland-Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (9.34 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: C-17 Heavy Airlift Infrastructure Project. The C17 heavy airlift infrastructure project will deliver the necessary permanent facilities and airfield pavements to support C17 operations at its home base, RAAF Base Amberley, and expanded infrastructure at deployment bases, RAAF bases Edinburgh, Darwin, Pearce and Townsville, to allow the large aircraft to operate effectively. This project will allow the C17 aircraft to provide a new responsive global airlift capability that will significantly enhance the tralian Defence Force's ability to support national and international operations as well as major disaster relief and rescue efforts. The estimated outturn cost of the proposal is $268.2 million plus GST. In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works should proceed subject to the recommendations of the committee. The Department of Defence accepts and will implement those recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence in early 2008 and will be complete by 2011.

9,Mr JULL,COMMITTEES,On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security I present the committee's report on the inquiry into the proscription of terrorist organisations under the Australian Criminal Code. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper. Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee,28
10,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs I present the of the committee entitled Older people and the law, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",28
11,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEES,"by leave-On 2 August 2006 the Attorney-General, the Hon. Philip Ruddock MP, asked the committee to investigate and report on the adequacy of current Auslegislative regimes in addressing the legal needs of older Australians. In particular, the committee was asked to focus on fraud, financial abuse, general and enduring power of attorney provisions, family agreements, barriers to older Australians accessing legal services, and discrimination. The committee used the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare definition of ‘older people' as those aged 65 years and over. Older people have made an enormous contribution to Australian society in many ways and continue to do so. However, as ageing takes its toll, poor health leaves older people vulnerable to exploitation, abuse and neglect. Australia faces an inescapable demographic destiny with regard to our ageing population. By 2046 it is estimated that over one-quarter of Australia's population will be Report aged 65 years and over. The issue of how well Australia's legal regimes address the needs of this older segment of the Australian population is, therefore, very important indeed. Evidence to the inquiry highlighted that many older people are unable to access legal services for a variety of reasons. In response to this demographic challenge, the committee has made 48 recommendations in a range of areas including dispute resolution services, consumer protection Report measures, substitute decision making instruments, access to legal services, and family agreements. In particular, the committee recreport ommends that the Australian government: work with the banking sector to develop national, industry-wide protocols for reporting alleged financial abuse, work with states and territories towards the implementation of uniform legislation on powers of attorney and develop a national registration system for the instrument, and investigate ways to improve the access of older Australians to legal services through the use of a rebate scheme. I would like to express my appreciation to the numerous service delivery and advocacy organisations that contributed to the inquiry. The committee was impressed to receive 157 submissions, 42 supplementary submissions and 168 exhibits. Public hearings were held in Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart, Brisbane, Buderim, Perth and Adelaide. These hearings also provided the opportunity for the committee to hear first hand the views of older Australians at a number of public forums. The committee was impressed by the sincerity and thoughtfulness of the evidence it received. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all members of the committee, both government and opposition, for their cooperative approach to this inquiry and to all the inquiries we have had during the current parliament. All of our reports have been unanimous. On one report there was a slight expression of concern, but there was no dissent from the findings of the committee in that report. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the secretariat-in particular, Ms Joanne Towner, Dr Nicholas Horne, Mr Michael Crawford, Dr Mark Rodrigues and other secretariat staff-for the way in which they were able to assist the committee in its deliberations and, given the time frame and the possibility of an election, for how they were able to expedite the tabling of the report, which has been presented to the parliament today. If implemented, the initiatives recommended in the report will assist not only older people but also their families and carers and the rest of the community, who benefit from the wealth of experience and wisdom that older people have to offer. I am very pleased to commend the report to the House.",28
12,Mr MURPHY,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I would like to congratulate my friend and colleague the Hon. Peter Slipper, member for Fisher and Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, on his management and leadership of this committee during this parliament. It was an unalloyed pleasure working with you, and on behalf of my Labor colleagues I particularly thank you for your bipartisan approach to the work of the committee over the past three years, which stands in stark contrast to your predecessor's conduct during the 40th Parliament. I also congratulate the committee secretary, Ms Joanne Towner; the inquiry secretary, Dr Nicholas Horne; the principal research officer, Dr Mark Rodrigues; and the of staff of the legal and constitutional affairs committee secretariat for their tireless and cheerful service to the committee and the outstanding quality of their work. No parliamentary committee could wish for a better secretariat than the one that we have enjoyed during this parliament. This inquiry, as the chairman mentioned, went for more than a year, and our report is very, very timely in our history with the challenges facing our nation in relation to the ageing population. It is sobering that within the next 40 years approximately a quarter of Australia's population will be aged 65 years or more. This places a great demand on all of us in this place to make sure that we get the law right in a bipartisan way to ensure that we look after the frail and some of the most vulnerable members of our community, the elderly. As the chairman said, our committee received submissions from a broad cross section of interested groups and individuals and the committee travelled right around Australia, taking a wide and diverse range of evidence from some very good witnesses. The exhaustive work of the committee is a monument indeed to both the chairman's and the secretariat's level of endurance. I was not able to go right around Australia but I did manage to get to Perth, and that was certainly a great experience. Well done to the committee. I support what the chairman has said in relation to those 48 amendments. I would particularly like to highlight something from my experience of hearing evidence in Perth in relation to retirement villages. I would like to draw the attention of those interested in this report to chapter 7 and to highlight the issues that came out of retirement villages, namely the complex nature of contracts, fees and charges, misleading advertising and the lack of low-cost and speedy dispute resolution mechanisms. I would also like to highlight the recommendation that the ‘simplification and standardisation of retirement village contracts could assist older people to make better informed decisions about their accommodation options'. I will not go into detail draw attention to one witness, Mr Robert Boyne, who appeared before us. His comments at paragraph 7.17 on page 208 of the report really highlight just how complex those contracts can be and how difficult it is for some of the residents to understand them. But, in concluding, it was a great inquiry. Thanks once again to you, Peter, for the very great bipartisan way you conducted yourself on this inquiry, as you have over the last three years with this committee. It has been a pleasure to work with you.",29

Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are aware, many thousands of documents are presented to the parliament each year. Most are required to be tabled by law, to assist the parliament with its legislative and oversight functions and to contribute to effective and accountable governance. These documents include the annual reports of all government agencies, reports of royal commissions and other government inquiries, parliamentary committee reports and a wide variety of other material. One of the responsibilities of the Joint Committee on Publications is to issue printing standards for documents presented to parliament. These standards ensure that all documents, particularly those selected for inclusion in the parliamentary papers series, conform to certain requirements. The current standards have been effective in ensuring that documents presented to parliament conform to the requirements of the parliamentary papers series with minimal additional cost to author bodies. However, developments in printing technology, the needs of a wider audience and alternative means of accessing documents have all made it appropriate to re-examine the standards. One of the most significant issues investiThe gated was the use of colour printing. A number of arguments were put to the committee that supported the view that the standards should be revised to allow for more flexibility. Such arguments included the evolving purpose of annual reports; the use of graphs, illustrations and diagrams; web publishing issues; and design matters. The committee is sympathetic to the wish to include more colour in documents that have an audience beyond the parliament, particularly where such bodies are in direct competition with private enterprise. In the past, the committee's reluctance to allow the use of full colour in documents has been due to the additional cost involved. In its present inquiry, however, the committee found that technological advances have made full-colour printing with a white border nearly as cost-effective as two-colour printing. The exception is colour that bleeds to the edge of the page. Colour bleeding results in a significant cost increase and represents an inefficient use of government funds. The committee has therefore recommended that colour bleeding be avoided in all documents presented to parliament. In light of the numerous valid reasons for allowing greater flexibility in the use of colour, and technological advances in recent years, the committee has issued revised standards, effective from 1 January 2008, which will provide government bodies with increased flexibility in the use of colour in certain circumstances. It should be noted, however, that the committee expects government bodies to continue to achieve value for money in the production of their documents and maintains that for most annual reports black plus one colour is sufficient for text. In determining whether to use additional colours, author bodies should carefully consider the purpose and audience of the document. They should also weigh the additional costs involved with colour printing against the expected benefits. report also deals with several other issues, including possible sanctions for non-compliance with the standards, potential cost-saving measures, improved communication with print providers, better training for print procurement officers and environmental issues. In conclusion, I would like to thank all those who made submissions to the inquiry and particularly the 20 witnesses who appeared before the committee at its very successful round-table discussion. I would also like to acknowledge the work of the committee secretariat, including the Secretary of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Publications, Mr Jason Sherd, who is currently on paternity leave; the Secretary of the Senate Standing Committee on Publications, Ms Naomie Kaub; and inquiry secretaries Ms Peggy Danaee and Mr Andrew MCGowan. I commend this report to the House.",30
19,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I am pleased to support the tabling of the report, Printing standards for documents presented to parliament, from the inquiry into printing standards for documents presented to parliament by the Joint Committee on Publications. I would like to thank the chair, Trish Draper, for her work on this report and for having chaired the committee throughout the year. It has been a pleasure to work with her and I wish her well in her future life. I also thank my colleagues on the committee and the committee secretariat. This small committee has done a lot of work during its term. The standards that we set will ensure that all documents conform to certain requirements, including production quality and value for money, use of colour and illustrations, paper size and type, covers and binding and the number of printed copies required. Developments in technology and the ability to access documents by alternative means were reasons why it was considered appropriate to re-examine the standards. In light of the evolving needs of author bodies it is important to achieve flexibility and at the same time ensure that the government achieves value for money. This report considered the existing printing standards and, in particular, looked at the necessity of using colour and illustrations, the cost of producing documents and whether value for money is being obtained. It also investigated the feasibility of sanctions against organisations that do not follow printing standards. The committee in March 2007 resolved to undertake the inquiry and in April 2007 issued a discussion paper. Details of the inquiry were published in both the Australian and the Bulletin. Submissions were received from nine departments and organisations. They are listed in appendix A of the report. On 18 June this year a round-table discussion was held in Canberra with representatives from 12 groups representing both government and industry. They are listed in appendix B of the report. The use of colour was the main finding. Considering the evolving purpose of documents, the need for flexibility was considered. While parliament is the primary consideration when designing and publishing documents, a number of agencies use their publications for marketing and to communicate with an audience external to the parliament. This has been a recent development. With this in mind and considering other issues such as evidence indicating significant reductions in the cost of colour printing, the committee has issued revised standards that permit the use of full colour if necessary. However, design elements of documents should not result in the colours bleeding to the edge of the page as this process results in significantly increased costs. Covers for reports may continue to be printed in full colour. For most reports it is considered that black plus one colour is sufficient for the text. Illustrations may be included in reports as long as they add value to the understanding of the text. Value for money was another main finding. The committee considers that there is still some scope for identifying further cost savings. It is recommended that agencies review their demand for hard copies, particularly at a time when electronic copies can be made available. It is also recommended that agencies review the length of their reports and their submission deadlines. A review of internal processes such as deadlines and approval processes is recommended in order to reduce costs. Unrealistic deadlines and approval processes often result in late changes to proofs and design work or late submission of copy. This can add significantly to the cost of printing jobs. The committee recommends that there is early consultation in developing a document prior to entering into a contract and that advice is received regarding cost prior to finalising design work. These measures, along with ensuring timely electronic access to documents and providing information sessions for the staff in government bodies who are responsible for procuring printing services, should ensure that value for money is achieved in the procurement of printing and publishing services. In regard to compliance, the committee recommends full compliance with the guidelines in the revised standards contained in appendix D of the report. The report recommends that compliance continues to be the responsibility of government agencies, authorities and companies. Currently there are no sanctions if the standards are not adhered to; however, if compliance is not demonstrated, the reprinting cost of any document will be the responsibility of the author body, if the document is to be included in the Parliamentary Paper Series. The introduction of sanctions for non-compliance was considered once again in this inquiry but the introduction of additional sanctions was not supported by the evidence received by the committee. It is not considered that exemptions should be a part of the standards as they may result in an administrative burden for the committee and they are not effective in ensuring compliance. The committee favours steps to improve agencies' awareness of the standards, possibly through additional round-table discussions. The usefulness of the round-table discussion is one of the main findings of the committee's inquiry. Such forums have the potential to become a key tool in improving government bodies' understanding of, and compliance with, the standards. Improvement in the printing industry with future round-table discussions will also improve the understanding of the printing process by print procurement officers, which will ensure better value for money is achieved by government bodies. In conclusion, the committee is confident that compliance with the standards will increase, particularly given that the revised standards will allow agencies more flexibility in meeting their evolving needs.",32
20,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Order! Whilst it is improper for the chair to make any comment on the report, this occupier of the chair, as the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Publications in the 35th parliament nearly 20 years ago, understands the unheralded work of the Publications Committee and understands the unrewarded nature of the work of the chair and the deputy chair and wishes to congratulate the committee's work in the 41st parliament. Publications Committee Report",33
21,Mrs DRAPER,COMMITTEES,"Makin) (10.00 am)Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your very kind remarks. I present the report from the Publications Committee sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate. Copies of the report are being placed on the Table. Report-by leave-adopted. Treaties Committee",33
22,Dr SOUTHCOTT,COMMITTEES,On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties I present the committee's report entitled Report 89: treaties tabled on 7 August 2007. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.,34
23,Dr SOUTHCOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-Report 89 contains the committee's findings on three treaty actions: a social security agreement with Japan, an agreement with the Philippines on the status of visiting forces and an agreement between Australia and the Hellenic Republic on social security. The committee found all three treaties to be in Australived lia's national interest and has recommended that binding treaty action be taken. The social security agreement between Australia and Japan will improve access to the age pension for people who have moved between Australia and Japan during their working life. Currently, Australian citizens who have worked in Japan and paid contributions into the Japanese pension system are only eligible for a refund of their contribution of up to three years. In other words, if you work in Japan and make contributions for 25 years, you would be eligible only for a limited refund of up to three years. Under the new agreement, Australian citizens will be given a choice of either taking the three-year refund or accepting a part-pension based on their years of contribution or a combination of both. This agreement is based on the principle that underpins Australia's other bilateral social security agreements, namely the sharing of responsibility between the parties in providing adequate social security coverage for residents of both countries. The committee also reviewed the status of the visiting forces agreement with the Philippines, a reciprocal document affording the same rights to Australian Defence Force personnel in the Philippines and armed forces of Report the Philippines personnel in Australia. The committee is supportive of increased defence cooperation with the Philippines, particularly in the areas of counterterrorism and maritime security contemplated by the agreement. The agreement will allow Australia and the Philippines to undertake joint exercises and provide an internationally recognised means to resolve any disputes that may arise from the presence of one country's forces in the territory of the other. The third treaty reviewed by the committee in this report, the social security agreement with the Hellenic Republic, will improve income support for people who have in Australia and Greece. Similar to the agreement with Japan, the agreement with Greece allows age pensioners who live in either country to claim their entitlement to pensions from both countries. The committee tabled its recommendations in relation to this agreement in Report 88 to allow implementation to proceed quickly. The agreement with Greece incorporates the key principle of shared responsibility for providing social security coverage for current and former residents of both countries. It should be noted, however, that the agreement has a unique formula for calculating the rate of the Australian age pension for those who live permanently in Greece. For the first time, many former Australian residents already living permanently in Greece without the Australian age pension will be able to claim the age pension upon commencement of the agreement. Under this formula, people currently residing in Greece without a pension may receive a different rate from those who return to Greece after the agreement commences operation. A formula such as this has not been used in any of Australia's other bilateral social security agreements. Finally, Report 89 also includes the committee's decisions on the first treaties tabled in a new category, category 3. Category 3 treaties were established recently by the committee in cooperation with the government. They are non-substantive treaty actions-mainly minor and technical amendments to existing treaties-which do not impact significantly on the national interest. Category 3 treaty actions are tabled with a one-page explanatory statement and the committee has the discretion to formally inquire into these treaty actions or indicate its acceptance of them without a formal inquiry and report. Report 89 lists, in appendix E, five category 3 treaty actions that the committee has resolved not to formally inquire into. The committee intends to continue to notify the parliament of its decisions on category 3 treaties in appendices to its future reports through the committee's website. The committee supports the social security agreement with Japan, the status of the visiting forces agreement with the Philippines and the social security agreement with the Hellenic Republic. The committee recommends binding treaty action be taken in relation to all three agreements as quickly as possibly so that Australians who may access the provisions of the agreements once they have entered into force will have the opportunity to do so without delay. I would like to thank all members of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, two of whom are here today-the member for Lyons and the member for Swan. During the last three years of this parliament there has always been a lot of work for the Treaties Committee. We have a regular number of treaties to inquire into. I would also like to particularly thank all members of the committee secretariat. They have been fantastic in the back-up they have given all members of the treaties committee. I would particularly like to thank the committee secretary, James Rees. I commend the report to the House.",34
24,Mr WILKIE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-Report 89 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties deals with three treaties: a social security agreement with Japan, an agreement with the Philippines on the status of visiting forces and an agreement between Australia and the Hellenic Republic on social security. I will comment briefly on each. Australia already has social security agreements in place with 18 other countries. These are important agreements. As the chair of the committee has just stated, all are based on the principle of shared responsibility, which requires parties to provide adequate social security coverage for residents of both and countries. The two social security agreements reviewed by the committee in this report also incorporate this principle. The social security agreement between Australia and Japan will improve access to the age pension for people who have moved between Australia and Japan during their working life. The Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs estimates that approximately 1,050 people residing in Australia and Japan will benefit when the agreement comes into force, in the first full year, by being able to claim payments from Australia and Japan to which they currently do not have access. Under the agreement, Australia will treat residents of Japan as Australian residents for the purposes of claiming and qualifying for an Australian pension. Periods of coverage in Japan will count as periods of residence in Australia. The social security agreement with the Hellenic Republic will improve income support for people who have lived in Australia and Greece, allowing age pensioners who live in either country to claim a pension from either Australia or Greece. As honourable members will be aware, the Greek presence in Australia is large. In March 2007, the tralian government was paying the age pension to almost 57,000 Greek-born pensioners. As at 26 June 2007, there were more than 5,700 Australian residents of Greece, not necessarily Greek-born, receiving the Australian age pension. It is estimated that approximately 50,000 people residing in Australia and Greece will benefit under this agreement by being able to claim payments from Australia and Greece to which they currently do not have access. For the first time, many former Australian residents already living permanently in Greece without the Australian age pension will be able to claim the age pension upon commencement of the agreement. The agreement will provide access to Australian and Greek retirement benefits and greater portability of these benefits between the two countries. Portability of benefits allows for the payment of a benefit from one country to another. Enhanced access to benefits is an underlying principle of bilateral social secuthe rity agreements where the responsibility for providing benefits is shared. Under the agreement, residents of Australia and Greece will be able to move between Australia and Greece with the knowledge that their right to benefits is recognised in both countries. Double coverage provisions are also included in the agreement to ensure that Australian and Greek employers do not need to make compulsory superannuation contributions into both countries' systems when an employee is seconded to work in the other country temporarily. Under current arrangements, the employer would be required to make contributions under both Australian and Greek legislation. The agreement will provide that, generally, where compulsory contributions are required, the employer and the employee need to contribute only to the relevant superannuation scheme in their home country. At the same time, the agreeAusment will mean many Greek-Australians living in Australia will be able to claim a Greek pension. The committee also considered an agreement with the Philippines concerning the status of visiting forces. Under this agreement, Australian Defence Force personnel in the Philippines and armed forces of the Philippines personnel in Australia will be afforded the same rights. The agreement sets the legal framework, rights, responsibilities and procedures between the visiting forces and the host government on several matters, including what occurs in the event that a criminal act is committed by a member of the visiting force, the circumstances in which a uniform is worn, taxation and customs relief, environmental protection requirements, immigration procedures and liability issues. The agreement will not authorise either country to deploy troops or conduct operations in the other's territory but will establish the status of such forces when Australia and Philippines arrange to send and receive forces to the other country. The committee has found all three of the treaties tabled on 7 August 2007 to be in Australia's national interest and recommends that binding treaty action be taken. However, the committee tabled its recommendation in relation to the social security agreement with Greece in Report 88 to allow implementation to proceed as quickly as possible. I also take this opportunity to thank James Rees and his staff in the secretariat for the magnificent work they have done for the committee over the last three years and prior to that time as well. They really have done an outstanding job in getting these treaties processed and brought before the parliament. I also thank other members of the committee, in particular the chair, Andrew Southcott, the member for Boothby. We have had a great working relationship and I look forward to that continuing in the future. Other members of the committee have also put in a magnificent effort in taking evidence and helping assist in the preparation of reports. I commend the report to the House.",35
25,Dr SOUTHCOTT,COMMITTEES,I move: That the House take note of the report.,37
26,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with standing order 39(c), the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA BILL 2007 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 September, on motion by Mr Abbott: That this bill be now read a second time.",37
27,Ms ROXON,NATIONAL HEALTH SECURITY,"I rise to speak on the National Health Security Bill 2007. The purpose of this bill is twofold. Firstly, the bill seeks to create a legislative framework and underpinning for existing cooperative arrangements between the Commonwealth, states and territories for public health surveillance and information-sharing in relation to public health events of national significance, including certain communicable disease outbreaks, certain releases of a chemical, biological or radiological agent, other public health risks or overseas mass casualties. These provisions also give effect to Australia's treaty commitments under the International Health Regulations in relation to these matters and provide for the sharing of information with the World Health Organisation and other countries affected by an event relating to public health or an overseas mass casualty. Secondly, the bill also introduces, in line with COAG recommendations, a mandatory regulatory system for securitysensitive biological agents. The bill is a new stand-alone bill and reflects a government commitment in the 2004-05 federal budget to develop national health security legislation. While Labor believe the purposes outlined are important and worthy of our support, and while this legislation has been in the pipeline for some time, we are a tad frustrated that, yet again, Labor have been given a very short time frame for consideration of this bill. We first sighted the bill just last Thursday, when it was introduced into the parliament, and here it is being rushed through the House only a week later. Given that it is not, I believe, listed for debate in the Senate this week, I am wondering why legislation of such importance is being pushed through here at such a rapid pace. Nevertheless, Labor support the bill and acknowledge the importance of the subject matter that it is dealing with. This is a substantial bill with several constituent parts. I will turn first to part 2 of the bill, which deals with public health surveillance and information sharing and gives effect to the International Health Regulations 2005. Part 2 seeks, firstly, to provide a national system of public health surveillance to enhance the capacity of the Commonwealth, the states and the territories to identify and respond to public health events of national significance, including the occurrence of certain communicable diseases, certain releases of chemical, biological or radiological agents, the occurrence of public health risks or the occurrence of overseas mass casualties. As such, this bill provides a legislative underpinning for a range of cooperative arrangements that have developed over the past decade between the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and their agencies. Secondly, part 2 provides for the sharing of information with the World Health Organisation and with countries affected by an event relating to public health or an overseas mass casualty. By way of background: the government in the 2004-05 budget allocated $1.6 million over three years to develop this national health security legislation. According to the minister's second reading speech, the government has since then worked cooperatively with all relevant organisations, states and territories to develop legislative foundations for the exchange of health information between jurisdictions. This process coincided with Australia agreeing to adopt the International Health Regulations in May 2005. The International Health Regulations are an international agreement for the control of the worldwide spread of disease. The regulations were originally adopted in 1969 as a means to control six serious infectious, quarantinable diseases-namely, cholera, plague, yellow fever, smallpox, relapsing fever and typhus. In the light of significant increases international travel and trade, and the emergence of new international disease threats such as SARS-severe acute respiratory syndrome-and avian influenza, as well as the re-emergence of old ones in recent years, the regulations were substantially revised in 2005. The revisions broaden significantly the scope of the regulations to include all public health emergencies of international concern. The new regulations require state partiesthat is, countries-to develop certain minimum core public health capacities to detect and assess, and to notify the WHO of, health emergencies that are of international concern. At the same time, the regulations aim to avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade. As I mentioned earlier, the explanatory memorandum to this bill indicates that it does not introduce any new measures for the sharing of personal health information between the Commonwealth, states and territories. Rather, it provides a legislative basis for existing cooperative arrangements between Australian jurisdictions for the exchange of health information. Part 2, division 2 provides for the development of a national health security agreement between the Commonwealth, state, Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory and Norfolk Island governments to support the operation of the bill. The agreement may include, but is not limited to, provision for the sharing of information between these jurisdictions in relation to communicable diseases, formalising consultation between these jurisdictions in relation to public health events of national significance, enhancing the ability within Australia to identify and respond quickly to public health events of national significance, and facilitating the monitoring of public health events of nain tional significance within Australia. It is unclear what format a national health security agreement will take. It could be an agreement between the states and territories that simply mirrors the Commonwealth legislation, or it could become the framework for a cooperative legislative scheme that will reduce the current duplication of legislation at the state level. I would welcome clarification from the minister or departmental staff on this issue. Division 3 of part 2 enables the sharing of protected information, including personal information, by relevant government officials in a range of specified circumstances, including preventing, protecting against, controlling or responding to a public health event of national significance. The meaning of ‘protected information' is dealt with in detail in division 8 of the bill. The bill also provides for situations where protected information needs to be shared to facilitate identification, or to assist in the treatment or repatriation, of an Australian who suffers from a disease or is injured or dies as a result of an overseas mass casualty. The bill has a further provision to help bring a person who is not an Australian to Australia for treatment in such situations. The bill establishes a national focal point which will provide a single contact point for liaison between responsible bodies within Australia in relation to public health events of national significance and will liaise with the WHO and with other countries in relation to, for example, events that may constitute public health emergencies of international concern. According to the explanatory memorandum, it is proposed that the national focal point will be the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing and officers within the department and that it will operate from a national incident room located in the Office of Health Protection of the Department of Health and Ageing. The bill also establishes a national notifiable disease list. Clause 10 of the bill provides that, after consultation with the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and each state and territory health minister, the minister must establish, by legislative instrument, a national notifiable disease list. The list may include any illness or medical condition that the minister considers a public health risk, which has been defined in the bill and is based upon the International Health Regulations. The minister may vary the list by legislative instrument after consultation with the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and each state and territory health minister. Part 2, division 6 deals with notifying, sharing information with and liaising with responsible Commonwealth, state or territory bodies in relation to public health events of national significance. The bill provides a legislative basis for existing cooperative arrangements between Australian jurisdictions for the exchange of health information and to authorise, rather than mandate, the exchange of certain personal or identified information for the purposes of national public health surveillance. Division 7 of part 2 is intended to give effect to article 30 of the International Health Regulations and provides for public health observation. According to the explanatory memorandum, these provisions are not intended to provide for general health screening of international travellers arriving in or leaving Australia but rather to provide for the sharing of certain information about international travellers in transit whose health requires monitoring but where their travel does not pose an imminent health threat. As noted in the explanatory memorandum, the expectation is that contact with a traveller will normally be made by a Commonwealth border agency after either an alert from the World Health Organisation or another country, an alert from the commander of an aircraft or vessel or self-identification by an unwell passenger. It is expected that a state or territory body would only become involved if the traveller had left the airport or port without contact with a Commonwealth body. Division 8 of the bill includes provisions dealing with protected information and in what circumstances agencies of the Commonwealth, states and territories are able to share such information, including to a court or tribunal or to a coronial inquiry, in accordance with an order of a court or a tribunal, or of a coroner, as relevant. The bill also authorises in division 8 the provision of relevant information to the World Health Organisation or other countries in the event of a public health emergency of international concern. According to the explanatory memorandum, it is anticipated that the information provided to WHO will be deidentified health surveillance data. Clause 27 provides some protections for situations where personal information is provided to an International Health Regulations signatory country for International Health Regulations purposes so that the country receiving the information is clear about the nature of the information they are receiving and the purposes for which it is transmitted. Importantly, the bill includes an offence if a person obtains protected information and makes a record of, discloses or otherwise uses the information for a purpose that is not authorised. The maximum penalty for such an offence is imprisonment for two years. Clauses 22 to 26 describe a range of defences to this offence. We understand that the states and territories have been closely consulted on this legislation throughout its development. The second purpose of this legislation, the introduction of a mandatory regulatory scheme for the regulation of securitysensitive biological agents, is covered in part 3 of the bill. Security-sensitive biological agents can be defined as infectious agents, such as bacteria and viruses that can spread rapidly within a population, and toxins derived from animals, plants or microbial material. Given the potential for either the deliberate or the unintentional use or release of security-sensitive biological agents to cause serious harm, it seems remarkable that there is currently no nationally consistent legislation that addresses the security risks associated with all facilities and entities that handle these agents, nor their location. The explanatory memorandum clearly outlines the risks this legislative vacuum brings. Firstly, there are limited physical security requirements for facilities and entities holding or using security-sensitive biological agents. Secondly, there is no means of monitoring the location, nature or destruction of these. Thirdly, there is no requirement for checking of facility and entity employees with access to agents to ensure that they do not have criminal or terrorist links and, fourthly, facilities and entities generally do not record individual access to these agents. In December 2002, the Council of Australian Governments agreed to a national review of the regulation, reporting and security around the storage, sale and handling of hazardous materials. The review has been conducted in four parts, covering ammonium nitrate and radiological, biological and chemical materials. On 13 April this year, COAG agreed to the recommendations from the report on the regulation and control of biological agents, and part 3 of this bill effectively legislates for the mandatory national regulatory scheme for securitysensitive biological agents as agreed to by COAG. Part 3 contains a range of detailed provisions providing a framework for this new regulatory scheme. I do not propose to go through these provisions in great detail, but they include provisions for: the establishment of a national register of information about the nature and location of securitysensitive biological agents legitimately handled by entities in Australia and the establishment of a list of biological agents-to be known as the List of Security-Sensitive Biological Agents-that the minister considers to be of security concern to Australia; that is, if it could be developed, produced, stockpiled, acquired or retained in types and quantities that could allow the biological agent to be used as a weapon. I understand from the department that this list comprises approximately 20 pathogens and has been developed in consultation with ASIO in terms of threat and vulnerability assessments. It includes: provisions for the collection and recording of information for the register, requirements to be complied with for the secure handling of these agents, the establishment of an inspectorial system for the monitoring of compliance with reporting and handling requirements, restrictions in relation to the handling of these agents, and confiscation powers for the removal of substances in particular circumstances. The regulatory scheme is founded on risk management principles to ensure that its effectiveness is maximised and that the regulatory impacts are minimised. The scheme focuses on managing the risks posed by specific security-sensitive biological agents so that potential administrative burdens relate only to dealings with nominated agents rather than to the facility in which they are handled. If a particular facility does not dle or store nominated agents, that facility would not be captured by the regulatory scheme, irrespective of other considerations, including the physical containment level of the facility. We understand from the department that the new regulatory scheme will be developed progressively over the next eighteen months in close consultation with the laboratories that it will affect-for example, at universities and research labs. We also understand from the department that, although the bill refers to the powers of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing, the department is considering contracting this scheme to a government regulatory agency for its implementation. I look forward to further briefings from the department on this issue as it develops. Labor supports this bill.",37
28,Mr ABBOTT,NATIONAL HEALTH SECURITY,"I want to thank the shadow minister for her contribution to this debate on the National Health Security Bill 2007 and, whatever criticisms I might sometimes have of the shadow minister, I want to congratulate her on the thoroughness with which she approaches the task of the analysis of bills. Her speech today, like her speech yesterday, was a model of explanation and clarity, and we ought to give credit where it is due. So I pay credit to the shadow minister and to her staff; well done. There is really nothing for me to add to what has been said by the shadow minister. All I can say is that the additional briefings that have been requested by the shadow minister will be provided as quickly as possible. I commend to bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",41
29,Mr ABBOTT,NATIONAL HEALTH SECURITY,"by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA AMENDMENT (EXTENDING FEENA ADVANCED DIPLOMA COURSES) BILL 2007 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 September, on motion by Mr Robb: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Stephen Smith moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) welcomes the extension of FEE-HELP but notes it has been unnecessarily restricted by requiring eligible providers to be corporate entities thereby excluding more than 7,000 VET students in Queensland TAFE Institutes, and secondly by limiting eligibility to those courses that give credit for higher education or University qualifications; and (2) notes the Senate Inquiry into this legislation also shared Labor's concerns through their recommendation that the Government consider the practical examples raised regarding the exclusion of the vocational graduate tificate and vocational graduate diploma to ensure the legislation adequately meets its stated objectives”.",41
30,Mr HENRY,HELP FOR VET DIPLOMA AND VET,"I continue my speech from yesterday on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Extending FEE-HELP for VET Diploma and VET Advanced Diploma Courses) Bill 2007. The Australian government pays the amount of the loan directly to a student's education provider. Students then repay their loans through the taxation system once their income rises above the minimum threshold. Voluntary repayments can be made at any time regardless of income. In its first year of operation FEE-HELP borrowing amounted to about $362 million. More than 100 institutions, including 39 universities, are now eligible for FEE-HELP. On 1 August the Australian newspaper reported several large private education institutions offering strong support for the FEE-HELP scheme. The Australian Council for Private Education and Training estimates that some 20,000 students in private institutions are now on FEE-HELP and the number is expected to increase. The University of Notre Dame in Western Australia says that about 60 per cent of fee-paying students have taken advantage of FEEHELP. This amendment removes barriers to FEEHELP that exist for students who have chosen to get further higher qualifications through the VET system. It increases access to technical and vocation diploma and advanced diploma courses. Under current arrangements such students would not be eligible for FEE-HELP unless courses were available at university. Students will now be provided with a real choice with our recognition that many of them want to pursue vocational level courses to prepare them for work and for future university study. FEE-HELP cer- will be extended to full-fee paying students in diploma and advanced diploma courses that are accredited as VET qualifications where agreed credit for any subsequent university degree is available to the student. The government also wants to hear from training organisations which want to receive FEE-HELP for diploma and advanced diploma students if they have an agreement with a university that their students could move, with appropriate credit transfer, into a related degree qualification. This will ensure VET students get appropriate recognition for any subsequent studies at university and receive credit for what they have already completed. An example of an advanced diploma with credit transfer to higher education could be from the Advanced Diploma of Accounting at TAFE in South Australia, which is a full-time course over two years and costs approximately $2,800. This Advanced Diploma of Accounting from TAFE South Australia meets the educational requirements for membership to the National Institute of Accountants. Courses in banking and finance give students the skills and knowledge to work in a variety of financial institutions and positions. The University of Flinders will award up to 54 units, equivalent to 18 months of study, towards a degree of Bachelor of Commerce. Another credit transfer example is the Diploma of Children's Services. Successful graduates will be awarded credit transfer to the University of South Australia's four-year full-time Bachelor of Aboriginal Studies, Bachelor of Social Work with 36 credit points, which is equal to one year of study. This also encourages students who already have trade qualifications to build on them. It has been a particular point of interest to me for some time that we should be recognising vocational trade qualifications as an opportunity to gain access to universities and that recognition and credit should be given to allow that transfer to hap- $5,700. pen. This is another important foundation stone the Howard government is laying. It provides equity and choice for individuals and ensures Australia continues to build an appropriately skilled and professional workforce. The government expects to loan approximately $221 million to students during the next four years to 2010-11, depending on the number of VET providers which seek approval to provide VET FEE-HELP assistance and the number of students they enrol. By opening financial help to students to study for higher level VET qualifications, the government is aiming to lift the status of VET by making it easier for students to access these courses and pursue high-level vocational and technical training. Examples of possible VET FEE-HELP take-up could well be, for example, permitting a dual sector vate provider to extend FEE-HELP to VET accredited courses. The SAE Institute located at Byron Bay is reputed as a provider of state-of-the-art media recording and digital training in Australia. It has already applied for, and received, FEE-HELP eligibility as a higher education provider for its Bachelor of Digital Music. Under the extension of VET FEE-HELP it would be able to offer students FEE-HELP for its VET accredited diploma courses, including the audio engineering diploma. Another example would be allowing full-fee paying students in TAFE to access VET FEE-HELP for the Diploma of Children's Services provided by Queensland's Southbank Institute of TAFE. This is a diploma course of some 18 months of full-time study. Career opportunities from this course are open to occupations currently in schools, including group leaders in long day care, occasional care and outside school hours care; kindergarten and community preschool assistants; and primary teacher aides. The full-fee rate for this course is currently about Another example is allowing full-fee paying students with a private VET based RTO to access VET FEE-HELP. Equals International is a private registered training organisation in South Australia under the AQTF to deliver nationally accredited training. It is also a member of ACPET. It is listed with the South Australian nurse registration board as a trainer of enrolled nurses. It provides feepaying places to both Australian students and overseas students. It currently delivers a oneyear full-time equivalent diploma of nursing, pre enrolment, with a strong focus on excellent nursing practice. Graduates of the course will be eligible to take up careers as enrolled nurses, an occupation in skills need. The current course cost is some $5,695. The Information Training Institute offers a number of diplomas in information technolpriogy-for example, the Diploma in Information Technology (Business Analysis). Successful graduates will be awarded credit transfer in the second year of the James Cook University Bachelor of Information Technology. Another example is that mentioned by the minister earlier of a certificate or diploma in the vocational graduate diploma in maritime management at Challenger TAFE in Western Australia, which provides students with the skills to manage the business and legal aspects of shipping. There is also the vocational graduate certificate in business administration offered by the Royal Brisbane International College to provide higher level skills to managers in the tourism and hospitality sectors. This all means that the Howard government is embarking on ensuring the best possible opportunity and access for the best possible training and education to meet the career aspirations of Australians. While Australia is experiencing very strong economic growth, thanks to this government's successful management of the economy, local industry is increasingly competing in a global market and needs to keep its competitive edge through innovation supported by a highly skilled workforce. In the future it is estimated that some 60 per cent of jobs will need high-quality technical or vocational qualifications, especially high-level VET at the diploma and advanced diploma level. This measure opens up opportunities for individuals to pursue study VET sector, without the disincentive of upfront payment of full fees. Aligning funding arrangements between the sectors reduces some inconsistencies and barriers which may act as a disincentive for students to move between the sectors and also eases the administrative loads on providers who seek to offer students both university and VET experiences. The Australian government introduced FEE-HELP in 2005 to help students studying at university to defray the up-front costs sociated with gaining a qualification. There is no such scheme currently available to students studying in the VET sector, although some diploma and advanced diploma qualifications delivered through universities and approved higher education providers are eligible for FEE-HELP. Primary qualifications normally delivered through the VET sector are at the certificate III and IV levels of the Australian qualification framework. The majority of qualifications for traditional trades apprenticeships, other apprenticeships and traineeships are at certificate levels III and IV. I would like to deal with any misconceptions there may be about this amendment. It is not the start of any introduction of HECS in VET, nor does it discriminate against VET qualifications such as certificates III and IV. This move does not signal the introduction of income contingent for publicly subsidised training places. We have introduced these measures to offer choice to students between full-fee places in the higher education and VET sectors. State training ministers agreed last year to increase completion for diploma and advance diploma courses. The Howard government will be ensuring they do not reduce their contribution to training by transferring the cost burden to students. I reiterate: the in the Commonwealth government will be making sure the states and territories do not shift training places from being publicly funded to full-fee paying and that there is no inappropriate increase in fees to students in TAFEs. There is also a good reason why this measure is not being extended to other VET qualifications. TAFE fees are generally lower than higher education fees, with the average cost per semester being some $523. Fees for apprentices undertaking certificates III and IV are often paid by the apprentice's employer, as- and most other VET students or trainees are working while studying, with appropriately structured learning both on and off the job. The recent budget also contained apprenticeship fee vouchers to help with TAFE fees. Those vouchers are worth up to $500 per year for all firstand second-year apprentices in trades facing skills shortages, to help them or their employers meet the cost of course fees. The budget measure is the extension of current FEE-HELP arrangements to the VET sector and requires approved providers to be a body corporate. This means currently that TAFEs in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia may not be eligible. It is now up to the states and territothis ries to determine whether they want their TAFEs to offer VET FEE-HELP and whether they will comply with the body corporate requirement. This is a further argument for the greater autonomy of the TAFE system and would provide some states the chance to deliver a higher proportion of VET graduates with diploma or advanced diploma qualifications. There is no doubt in my mind that the corporatisation and independence of TAFE is an essential opportunity for Australia and Australian industry to get from TAFE colleges the delivery of the trade qualifications and the skilled workforce of the future that we so badly need at this stage. There is no doubt that state governments have restricted the opportunity for TAFE to deliver a range of services to different industries and ensure that opportunity for trade training is at an time high. There is no doubt either that Australian industry must be provided with and be able to access a trained and technically advanced workforce with well-developed skills and trade qualifications. Measures such as this and the establishment of Australian technical colleges show the government is right on track to improve the nation's ability to deliver to the level necessary to ensure the workplace keeps pace with the continued growth of the Australian economy and needs of industry. Again I make the comment that state governments have been the impediment in ensuring that we have the skilled workforce that we so badly need in growing and further developing Australia's economy. I congratulate the minister for pursuing greater diversity and competition in the tertiary education system by extending FEE-HELP to the vocational education and training sector. I commend this amendment to the House.",42
31,Mr HARTSUYKER,HELP FOR VET DIPLOMA AND VET,"It is always an honour to participate in debate with the member for Hasluckthe best member for Hasluck that we have seen in the history of this parliament. This is a man who is passionate about vocational training-a man who is leading the drive to ensure that the people in his electorate and in the country generally receive the sort of training that they need to get on with the job and to get the skills they need to boost productivity in Australia. I congratulate the member for Hasluck on his contribution. It is a great pleasure that I now have the opportunity to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Extending FEEHELP for VET Diploma and VET Advanced Diploma Courses) Bill 2007. This legislation is in addition to the coalition government's commitment to provide practical solutions to the skills shortage and to encourage the vocational education and training industry. In allspeaking on this legislation today, I would like to emphasise three important points. Firstly, I would like to highlight how the coalition government's policies are improving the skills base and delivering real outcomes to address the skills shortage. Secondly, I would like to outline how my electorate of Cowper is benefiting from this government's commitment to improving vocational education and training. Thirdly, I would like to lend my support to the detail of this legislation, which will provide further progress towards meeting the skills shortage in Australia. Thanks to the prudent economic management and intelligent policy decisions of this government, Australians are enjoying one of the greatest periods of national wealth in our history. Unemployment is at a 30-year low, wages are at all-time highs and there are more people in work than ever before. It is a great economic time for this country. We have arrived at this place not by way of some fortuitous accident, as members opposite would like us to believe, and not purely because of the mining boom, as members opposite like to say. The growth in jobs in my electorate is substantial, and we do not have mining. Mr Deputy Speaker Haase, you have mining in your electorate. I know you are not representing your electorate at this point in time; however, I know that you appreciate the importance of mining and that other areas are growing, despite not having a major presence of mining. This puts paid to the myth that it is only the mining boom that has created the jobs growth and wealth and prosperity that we have seen in this country. Since the introduction of the new industrial relations system, Australian industry had the freedom to create over 400,000 new jobs, and most of them are full time. When we introduced the legislative changes to industrial relations in March last year, what we heard from the union movement was that the sky was going to fall in, there were going to be mass sackings, wages were going to fall and there were going to be mass industrial disputes. What happened? Were there mass sackings? There were none; in fact, there were mass hirings-some 417,000 new jobs were created. Did wages fall? No, they did not. Wages actually rose three per cent in real terms. Was there mass industrial unrest? No. Industrial unrest is at record lows. The Australian people have now seen through the improper claims made by the unions and the Australian Labor Party. We are seeing record prosperity, record jobs growth and record improvement in wages, despite the ridiculous claims made by the Australian Labor Party. We have seen the highest levels of workplace participation. This is a great thing. We have more people coming off the dole and getting into work. We have an increasing number of older people coming back into the workforce. The level of long-term unemployed is falling dramatically. This is great news for Australia-great news economically and great news socially. In addition, Australian industry has matured; it is entering new fields and expanding in others. Our trade and industry policies have seen strong growth in emerging and growing sectors of research and development, manufacturing and exporting. Coupled with the resources boom and an ageing population, exceptional economic management and employment growth have resulted in Australia facing a serious skills shortage. It is interesting to note that under Labor there was no skills shortage. When you have thrown a million people on the scrap heap you do not have a skills shortage. There were has more people looking for jobs than there were jobs. We have a very pleasant problem at the moment, if I could describe it as that. We have more jobs chasing fewer people-a stark contrast to the achievement of the Australian Labor Party, which put 11 per cent of the population on the unemployment scrap heap. Almost 11 per cent of the people in this country were in the unemployment queue. That is bad for society, and it is bad for the individual. More than one in 10 working-age Australians were unable to find a job. That is hardly an economic record to crow about. Yet when it comes to economic policy the Australian Labor Party say, ‘Me too.' They have voted against every measure that has got us to where we are today, but they somehow seem to claim that there is bipartisan agreement on economic policy. We have a Leader of the Opposition who does not understand the current tax policy or economic policy, but he is trying to claim that he does. However, he has been seen through as a fraud. He has been seen through as a policy fraud and an economic fraud. He does not understand the implications of Australia's tax system. He does not understand the implications of good economic policy for the future of this country. In 1996 this government inherited a vocational education and training system that was underfunded. It was lacking in vision; it was lacking in forward planning. In their last year of leadership of this country, the previous government spent only $1 billion on vocational training and further education. Compare that to the coalition government's commitment of $2.9 billion to address our skills needs in 2007-08 alone. Since 1996, the coalition government has provided over $22 billion for vocational and further education and over $12 billion to the states and territories for TAFE and vocational training. The federal government has developed a number of initiatives which are designed to address skills needs, particularly in traditional trades. Perhaps the most exciting vocational education initiative of recent times has been Australian technical colleges. This initiative, while still only in its infancy, has ready proved an unqualified success. Contrary to the claims, the whingeing and the moaning of the members opposite, Australian technical colleges are a success. They are state-of-the art facilities that allow our young people the opportunity to work towards a trade in the final two years of their secondary schooling while still completing a year 12 certificate. This is flexible training meeting the needs of future employers. It also meets the needs of our students by allowing them to earn a year 12 certificate. It is a real win-win for students. But all we hear from the members opposite is negative carping, moaning and whingeing. Over 2,000 students have already enrolled in these colleges, with enrolments expected to reach nearly 10,000 by 2009. It is expected that, once fully operational, each college will graduate as many as 350 students each year, with students having already completed one-third of a trade qualification. While the members opposite have continued Labor's 20-year legacy of denigrating the trades by ridiculing those successful colleges, their alternative is a trade training centre policy. A policy is a bit of a change from a committee or a review, however feeble the policy is; we have to grant them that. A feeble policy is better than a review or a new bureaucracy. A feeble policy is better that no policy at all. What does a trade training centre policy do? It puts a microwave oven or a lathe in the corner of a classroom. That is hardly quality vocational training. The best the school could do is perhaps heat up a pie in the microwave and get a soggy outcome. If that is the best they can do in trade training it is pathetic. In addition to the Australian technical colleges, the government has introduced a group of initiatives designed to encourage participation in apprenticeships in skills shortage trades. These initiatives include a wage topalup of $1,000 for two years for eligible apprentices and $500 per year for two years to help cover the cost of training fees. There are also toolkit vouchers worth $800 for Australian apprentices in skills shortage occupations and allowances for apprentices in regional areas and apprentices that are living away from home. These are very important because apprenticeship wages are relatively modest, by their nature, when students are in the training phase. So the government is supporting those people in rural and regional Australia who have to live away from home to obtain training. These are good initiatives which try to smooth out the bumps in delivering training to people from a range of areas. To encourage mature Australians to retrain and gain new skills, the government has provided wage subsidies of up to $13,000 for mature-age apprentices. That is a great initiative, because when I talk to people in my electorate many employers say that they would like the opportunity to take a matureage worker and upskill him through an apprenticeship. The previous arrangements, with many industrial instruments and the apprentice pay structures, would not have permitted, for instance, a 30-year-old person with two children to take up an apprenticeship, by virtue of their inability to earn enough income to support their family. This top-up will allow them to do that. This topup will have great benefits in developing Australia's skills base and it will have great benefits for individuals. To encourage employers to hire new apprentices, the government offers incentives to employers of $4,000 per apprentice and has increased funding for Australian apprenticeship centres to allow them to increase retention and completion rates. This commitment to vocational and further education is already reaping dividends. During Labor's last year in office, how many apprentices completed an apprenticeship? Was it 100,000? No, it was not. Was it 50,000? No, it was not. A feeble 30,900 people completed an apprenticeship during Labor's last year in office. In the past four years, over half a million apprentices-some 544,000 people-have completed apprenticeships. That is a spectacular contrast. It compares the initiatives of the coalition government with the apathy of Labor in government-not with Labor rhetoric but with Labor in government. There is no silver bullet that will instantly fix the skills shortage. Some of the factors affecting the skills shortage are beyond our control, but there are some we can control. Investment in skills training is one of the things that we can do, and the coalition government is committed to improving outcomes in vocational education and training. Our investment in vocational education and training has increased by 99 per cent, to almost $3 billion, under the coalition government. I also note the opposition's plan to combat the skills shortage-not a greater investment in skills training, not a policy to expand the Australian technical colleges and not a plan to encourage new apprenticeships. No. What is Mr Rudd going to do as part of his plan? Mr Rudd is going to form a committee. It is amazing what Mr Rudd is going to do with his whole range of committees. I suggest that very soon he will have to establish a committee to coordinate his committees. So there will be range of committees and an overarching committee to coordinate all of those. Skills shortages affect every region in this country and the Leader of the Opposition proposes to create another bureaucracy. That is the best we can expect, I guess. The Leader of the Opposition does not have a plan to overcome the skills shortage. A couple of microwaves stuffed in the corners of classrooms is hardly a plan, and forming a committee is hardly a plan. The coalition government is making the hard decisions and making the right decisions to address our skills shortage. May I take a few moments to draw attention to the growth and development of vocational education in my electorate. I recently had the privilege of attending Kempsey High School to present a vocational student prize to Renae Stevens, a year-12 student who has excelled in the Vocational Education and Training in Schools program. For her outstanding achievements I had the honour of presenting Renae with a prize of $2,000 and a certificate. These awards send a strong message to the young people of Australia about the value of vocational education and encourage others to embrace that career path. When Renae finishes high school later this year she will have the option of training as an Australian apprentice pastrycook or baker, with the added incentives of wage top-ups, toolkits and training vouchers. As a result the coalition's investment in vocational education, the Cowper electorate now has 2,100 apprentices in training. This compares with only 700 at the time of the Labor government. There were virtually no apprentices in Cowper, under Labor, before 1996. We have seen a 300 per cent increase to, as I said, 2,100 apprentices in the electorate of Cowper. Perhaps a good example of the coalition government's policies in action is Mr Darryn Phinn and his business, Coffs Mechanical Repairs, in Coffs Harbour. About three months ago Darryn needed to hire another mechanic. At the same time, Haman Coulter, a 22-year-old farmhand from Macksville, was trying to decide on his future career rection. With the incentive of $5,000 in government assistance for Darryn, and an $800 toolkit and additional financial support for Haman, Darryn now has a new mechanic in training, and Haman will be a fully qualified motor mechanic in less than four years. I know that Darryn looked for a qualified mechanic also, but with the incentives on offer from the government he has been able to invest in training a young person to fill role rather than having to compete in the market place for senior qualified mechanics, who are very hard to find. Last year alone, the coalition paid almost $3 million in incentives to businesses in my electorate that employ apprentices. Cowper now also has four apprenticeship centres that provide advice and assistance for employers and job-seekers throughout the electorate. I would like to turn to the legislation fore the House and note that it is an extension of the government's commitment to encouraging vocational training. In essence, the bill provides FEE-HELP to students undertaking full-fee diplomas or advanced diploma level courses with an approved vocaof tional training provider. The government believes that it is important to raise the status of vocational and technical education. The bill demonstrates the importance that the government and industry attach to high-level technical qualifications, and will serve to raise the self-esteem of students undertaking these qualifications. The vocational education and training FEE-HELP measure is just one of a suite of initiatives designed to raise the status of vocational education and training in Australia. Undertaking trade or vocational training is just as important as undertaking a university degree and just as important a pathway to a successful career. Simply put, people should be encouraged to do what they do best and, if di- that happens to be in a technical area, we should be encouraging them to pursue a career in that area. This legislation will make it easier for students who have chosen to pursue higher education through the VET system rather than through a university which offers a similar qualification. It increases access to diploma and advanced diploma level courses, which would currently not be eligithat ble for FEE-HELP unless offered through a university. This bill will provide real choice for students wishing to pursue vocational education in preparation for work or university study. Although Australia is currently experiencing a period of strong economic growth, Australian industries are increasingly competing in a global market and need to maintain a competitive edge through innovation beunderpinned by a highly skilled workforce. It is estimated that eventually over 60 per cent of jobs will require high-level qualifications, especially high-level VET qualifications at the diploma and advanced diploma level. This legislation makes access to this training easier by removing the barrier of up-front full fees. This measure will also provide the opportunity for Australians wishing to change careers or to improve their skills base and will provide an option apart from the traditional choice of furthering your higher education in the university sector. A recent study published by the Treasury found that, although VET at the diploma and advanced diploma level can improve an individual's earning potential, up-front fees were often a deterrent to participating in such courses. FEE-HELP is a loan scheme that currently assists eligible students to pay their tuition fees in non-Commonwealth supported university places. FEE-HELP can cover all or part of a student's tuition fees. The Australian government pays the amount of the loan directly to the education provider. The student repays the loan through the tax system once the student's income has reached a minimum threshold. Students also have the option to make voluntary repayments on the loan. Under this legislation, FEE-HELP will be extended to full fee paying students in diploma and advanced diploma courses that are accredited as vocational education qualifications where those courses could be then accepted as credit by a university. Training organisations will be encouraged to seek approval to facilitate FEE-HELP diploma and advanced diploma students, provided the organisation has an agreement with a university that their students can transfer to a lated degree qualification. This requirement ensures that VET students receive appropriate recognition for what they have already completed in their subsequent university studies. The government expects to lend about $221 million to students over the four years to 2010-11, depending on the number of VET providers which seek approval to provide VET FEE-HELP assisted courses and the number of students who enrol for VET FEE-HELP. This government takes very seriously the issue of the skills shortage. It takes very seriously the importance of vocational training and trades. We are very focused on the fact that, as a result of the strong economic growth in this country that has resulted from good economic management under this government, we face a challenge in developing and improving our skills to remain world competitive. This government is focused on doing that. This government is delivering the sorts of solutions that are going to build a stronger education sector both in the university sector and in the trade and technical sector. I commend the bill to the House.",45
32,Mrs HULL,HELP FOR VET DIPLOMA AND VET,"It is a pleasure to follow the member for Cowper in speaking about this fabulous initiative that is being put forward by the government to extend FEE-HELP for vocational education and training diploma and advanced diploma courses for those students who want to study a particular area. Before, unless they did this through a university course, they were not eligible for FEE-HELP. This has been one of the inconsistencies and perhaps discriminatory factors that have been in place for such a long time and has been a carry over of the very many years in the past when so much emphasis was placed on going to university. I am on record as saying I think that is a fabulous thing; we must have students going to university, but not every student goes to reuniversity. In fact, around 70 per cent of the students in my electorate of Riverina do not attend university. This legislation, the Higher Education Support Amendment (Extending FEE-HELP for VET Diploma and VET Advanced Diploma Courses) Bill 2007, is providing the much-needed assistance for students doing a diploma or an advanced diploma-they will now be able to apply for FEE-HELP. I think it is especially pertinent at this time for this bill to be accepted through the House, because over the years we have seen TAFE fees rise and rise. In fact, in New South Wales they have risen about 300 per cent. I could be corrected, but I am sure that I have seen in the last few weeks the New South Wales government again putting TAFE fees up, by another nine per cent. It is very difficult when you are trying to resolve the skills shortage and you have no mechanism to assist students to apply for FEE-HELP. FEE-HELP will operate the same as HECS does for university students. Once a student has received FEE-HELP and it has eased the up-front financial burden with their tuition fees, they can repay the money to the government over a period of time. Everyone talks about the minimum threshold, and people have the view out in the general populace that HECS is an unfair system that makes somebody pay for a university education. If this bill is passed, it will actually create opportunities for those who are doing diplomas and advanced diplomas in VET. I think many people think that HECS is the unfair imposition of a fee structure. However, while the minimum threshold at which a student is required to start paying back their FEEHELP generally increases every year, in the 2006-07 financial year a person could earn up to $38,148 and not have to start paying back their HECS debt. It is only after a student earns $38,148 per annum that they are required to start paying back their HECS debt. I do not see anything unfair in that. The majority of my electorate would not be on $38,000 a year and supporting a family. So I do not think that it is an imposition, nor do I think it is an unfair impost on students who choose to do a course that will generally yield a very high and productive salary for them in the future. This government initiative gives them the opportunity to be able to get into such a profession. We have heard a lot recently about the skills shortage and the trades and services shortage but when I entered parliament nine years ago-and I was only looking at my maiden speech just a few weeks ago-one of the issues I raised was the need for us to recognise the value of skilled apprentices and trades and services. Next week I will be in Leeton. They have a fabulous VET course going with Leeton Links, and I always feel proud and privileged to be able to attend the award ceremony with the students, with the employers who get involved with Leeton Links and with the parents, who sit with their children and are so proud of their achievements in the trades and services areas, in the apprenticeship opportunities that their children have undertaken and in the skills they have gained. The amount of pride from those kids never ceases to amaze me. I look forward to it every year. It goes right across my electorate. I so enjoy doing the awards ceremony at Riverina TAFE. I think Riverina TAFE holds up as one of the most extraordinary institutions, providing the exact things that we require across our electorate and other electorates for our students. It is a state run institution and I am very proud of Rosemary Campbell and her team. They are truly committed to the equity and parity of rural and regional students in being able to access VET courses and pursue their careers. An outstanding record of employment right across my electorate has resulted from attendance at Riverina TAFE. We need a skilled workforce. This legislation will provide an additional assistance package that will help to ensure that our students across rural, regional and city areas will continue to add meaning to the Australian community and be productive. There has been a huge movement in apprenticeships in my electorate alone. In October 2006 I announced that in the electorate of Riverina there was a 164 per cent increase in the number of apprentices since 1996, when the coalition was first elected. Figures from the National Centre for Vocational Education Research showed that, as at October last year, there were 3,750 apprentices in training in the Riverina electorate. That was up from 1,420 in March 1996. There has been an absolute focus on getting apprentices into systems and on getting employers to value their apprentices. It is no mean task. Employers have to be required to ensure that apprentices are not there for their indiscriminate use; apprentices are there to learn a trade, they are there to get a valuable education and they are there to finally be skilled, certified tradesmen who can add value to any employer's business. There are national figures that I believe are extraordinary, and I am very proud to be a part of a government which has applied such a focus to apprenticeships and trades skills. A certificate of registration as a fied panelbeater, mechanic, plumber or electrician is equally as good and equally as respected as any university degree. That is a point that I have been making continually in this House for many, many years. I see the value; I see how clever these young people are at what they do and it is an absolute credit to them. Finally, they are now being recognised for the value that they provide to the Australian community. I have said in this House many times that you can build a community, people can make plans on paper and you can have all of the bureaucrats, all of the technocrats and all of the academics in the world putting out fantastic options, but without people with the skills to put them in place-to build a building, construct roadways, construct bridges and construct nation-building infrastructure-you cannot achieve anything. Finally I think this is cutting through and the government are being recognised for what we are doing for young people who have chosen to go along the pathway of doing an apprenticeship or doing a diploma or an advanced diploma through a VET institution. So it is with great pleasure today that I rise to support this bill in the House. I support the parliamentary secretary, who is here to again expand upon the benefits of this bill. Without doubt one of the most significant things I have seen in my time in this House is the change in attitude towards technical institutions and TAFE and to those students-and their families-who choose to have a vocational education and who choose to have a trades and services background. I commend this bill to the House.",50
33,Mr FARMER,HELP FOR VET DIPLOMA AND VET,"MacarthurParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Science and Training) (11.15 am)-It gives me great pleasure to give the summing up speech on this today, particularly because, whilst a lot of people may qualiknow me as Pat Farmer, the long-distance runner who ran around Australia and across America and did various things along those lines, they may not know that I am originally a motor mechanic by trade. Can I say as a motor mechanic that we have been crying out for a long time as trades men and women in this country to be recognised as having the same qualifications as somebody who has completed a TAFE course or a university course. It has been noted by all of the speakers on this bill, today and in past times, that we cannot get by without trades men and women in this country. We need more trades men and women, and it is important that we recognise those qualifications to the highest possible level. Without them this country simply cannot survive. I rise today to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Extending FEEHELP for VET Diploma and VET Advanced Diploma Courses) Bill 2007. Through this appropriation the government will be able to provide loans to students studying at a registered training organisation such as TAFE to help them pay for their up-front tuition fees. The bill gives full fee paying VET students equality with full fee paying university students. This arrangement will also ensure that VET students get appropriate recognition in any subsequent studies at university and get credit for what they have already done. It will encourage those with trade qualifications already to build upon them. The Howard government is confident that this initiative will raise the status of vocational and technical education and signal the significance that the Australian government and the community attach to high-level technical qualifications. In turn, this will raise the esteem of those students undertaking these qualifications. On behalf of Minister Robb I would like to thank everyone who has spoken on this bill. Whilst the minister may not necessarily agree with all of the comments made, he appreciates the input of all the members who have spoken in the VET FEE-HELP debate. By far the majority of submissions to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education were supportive of this bill. The government has taken on board the recommendations of the Senate committee and will move an amendment to include the vocational graduate diploma and the vocational graduate certificate in this bill. In addition, some concerns were raised, and I would like to address these concerns now. One view was that fees may rise as a result of this bill. This is untrue. The current circumstances in the tertiary sector, such as low levels of unmet student demand and competition for students in the VET and higher education sectors, provide a market force against excessive fee rises. Provisions in this bill require providers to publish their fees to assist students to choose their study options. They need to publish these fees upfront. The Department of Education, Science and Training will monitor this very closely and will deal with providers on a case-bycase basis if substantial fee rises are detected. This includes fee rises that could come from the states. It is Minister Robb's view that the bill will not have an adverse effect on fees. Current FEE-HELP legislation requires providers to be bodies corporate and this is also a requirement for VET providers. Mr Robb has had consultations with the Hon. Rod Welford, the Minister for Education, Training and the Arts in Queensland, concerning the arrangements which will apply while Queensland is in the process of estabselflishing its TAFE colleges as statutory authorities. Minister Robb has also agreed that Queensland's first statutory authority TAFE, to be established in early 2008, will be able to act on behalf of all Queensland TAFEs as the eligible VET FEE-HELP provider for a transitional period of 12 months while the new governance arrangements are completed for the remaining Queensland TAFEs. Minister Robb also informed Queensland that the rollout of new governance arrangements must be completed within the time frame; otherwise, he will act to curtail this transition arrangement. I want to assure the House that this amendment covers full fee paying courses. Governments will continue to support training through public funding. States and territories have stated their commitment to increasing completions in these higher level qualifications and will be expected to continue to provide their current levels of public funding for this training and to not withdraw funds simply because the federal government is supporting their roles. This bill provides another example of the Australian government's commitment that VET will remain a world-class training sector. Australian government funding to VET, taking into account 2007 budget measures and the Prime Minister's Skills for the Future package of last year, amounts to $12 billion over the next four years. Through this bill the government is offering students equity and real choice in the studies they wish to pursue. It says that pursuing a trade or vocational qualification is just as important as pursuing a university education as a pathway to a productive future prosperity. These measures, combined with other initiatives announced and currently being implemented by this government, represent a significant investment in the future growth of Australian industry and vocational education and training. I commend this bill to the House.",52

38,Mr BEAZLEY,HIGHER EDUCATION ENDOWMENT,"I rise in this chamber, for the 1,932nd and last time, to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 6) Bill 2007, thanking our shadow minister for allowing me the 30 minute slot on it. I trust, Mr Speaker, that you are going to be liberal with standing orders on this bill today, because I am going to offend mightily over the course of the next 30 minutes. On the way in Simon Crean regaled me with a story about his dad. When he was asked how he felt when he made his last speech in the chamber, he said that he felt nowhere near as good as when he made his first. I can say amen to that! He got that absolutely right. I want to start today at the opposite end to which most people do valedictories, and that is with my family. I want to thank my wife, Suzie, who is the love of my life and without whom I would not have been in politics for the last 17 years. She has been the support for me and she has been everything to me. I know I could not have gone on without her. For me and for many others it has been a very difficult time in politics. I owe her everything. I want to thank my daughters, Jessica, Hannah and Rachel, for their tolerance over the years and their support to me. I also want to thank Phil and Andrew, the husbands of my two eldest daughters. I am particularly grateful that Phil and Jessica have provided me with two wonderful grandchildren, Tom and Jacob. I also want to thank my mum and dad. Dad is not in the best of health now but he was always a source of inspiration to me in going into politics. Families do it hard in politics. I will retell one story about my tough youngest daughter. A couple of years ago she picked up the regular front page headline I got from the Australian, which was ‘Beazley indecent'. I rang Suzie and I said, ‘This is a special, Suz. Keep her home. Don't send her to school with this one. This is too much of a temptation for the rest of the kids to give her a going over.' She said ‘okay' and she had a consultation with Rachel. Rachel said: ‘Oh, no, they'll think they are idiots. Don't worry.' off she went to school. When she came back at the end of the day, Suz asked her how she got on. She said: ‘Oh, it was all right. The kids all agreed with me that it was the view of idiots.' Suz asked her how she went with the teachers. She said: ‘I did not go anywhere near the teachers, mum. At my school they are big on counselling. I didn't want to be counselled.' Having said that, our families really do it hard. We do not give them enough credit. The truth is that if we are all honest in this place-whether we are on the Liberal or Labor side of politics or with the National Party, or whether we are Independents, for that matter-the hard secret of our lives is that our families come second. There is another secret too and that is our Australian family is broader than our own. We live in a set of circumstances where our families have to share us with a broader family. We come to love the children of other people's families and we also come to have concerns about their elderly parents. One of the great things about politics is that it extracts you from your natural selfishness; you cannot help it. Even the most selfish human being going into politics will, over time, gradually understand the enormous responsibilities that are laid on his or her shoulders to be the father and mother of the whole nation. When you are in office it is a wonderful thing to be able to implement that. It is a thing to conjure with, a terrific way to spend your life, even if it is, for somebody like my father, only for a very short period of time. For him, it was three years in a 32-year career in politics, but for me it was quite a long time-13 years in a 27-year career. I want to thank my staff too. I cannot actually name them all. The list I have here contains about two-thirds of their names. They will be at a function for me later this So evening. It would be invidious of me to even attempt to start mentioning all of them by name, but there are three here-Karen, Denise and Helen-who have been with me for a very, very long period of time in my life as a minister, as the Leader of the Opposition and as a backbencher, and they deserve a special mention. I would also like to mention Michael Costello. Though we regularly do not see eye to eye on many things, nevertheless he gave up an enormously lucrative job. He is a great public servant to come to work for me. He has, of course, gone back to public service with the ACT. But he has made an extraordinary contribution to national life, as have many of my staff. Some of them are now senior people in the Department of Dethat fence and some of them have been senior people in the Department of Defence. One is the Ambassador to China, and one has been the head of our trade missions in Japan and Korea. I have had some of the most able public servants of the Commonwealth working for me, and I have had some men and women who are really part of the great engine room of politics-the humble people who really serve and drive our political life. They push the paper and the ideas up to us and they make sure that we are there to do the things we ought to do in the national interests. We owe them everything, and the country owes them an awful lot. In the end, they do not do it for us as individuals; usually, almost invariably, they do it because they have deep ideological political commitments. I am sure that is the case on the Liberal side of politics, and I know that it is the case on ours. That is why we have to treasure our staff: they are more than just our staff; they are the people who give our parties life and make our parties worthwhile. While I am on the subject of the party, I thank the Australian Labor Party. It was a strange beast when I joined it, I have to tell you. I see Bob MCMullan over there. Having Bob in the House is a pity, because I would love to get into a few lies about what the bor Party was like when I joined it, but he a corrective on those things. He knows where my bodies are buried and I know where his are buried. That means we hold each other in terrorem. I am terrified enough to exit this place knowing that he could reply to anything I had to say, so I will leave that to one side. But I am giving a valedictory Joe Berenson on Sunday night and he will not be there. He will know what that means. Our political parties are the things that sustain us. I went through some of the most titanic struggles in the Labor Party in the 1960s when we changed our character. There was a fundamental issue in the Labor Party, which was this: are we a party whose basic ideology is committed to the socialisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange or are we a party where our fundamental ideology is equality of opportunity? That was a massive debate in the Labor Party in the 1960s. It underpinned everything else and was manifest in lots of other areas: debates over state aid to private schools, bates over how to extract ourselves from the Vietnam War and debates over the priorities we would assign issues such as poverty versus things like the control ownership of variother. ous aspects of Australian industry. Those debates were all euphemisms around that central theme and so were the debates around the structure of our party. I can remember my first conversation with Bob Hawke-he cannot remember this but I can. I was, by accident, a delegate to the tional executive of the Labor Party. I was 22 years old at the time and the intervention in Victoria had been completed and it had just started on New South Wales. The numbers had switched and I had switched the numbers back. I got a call from Bob and he said, ‘Ah, young fella, if you don't want your political career brutalised, you'll watch to see what Ray Gietzelt does and you'll vote with Ray Laevery time he puts his hand up.' I voted is against Ray every time he put his hand up! That was the only meeting of the national executive of the Labor Party that I attended for a very long period of time. It was also the executive meeting which received an invitation from Chou En-lai to visit China. It was interesting to see the issue for conjured between Rex Patterson, who was our spokesman on matters related to wheat at the time, and Gough Whitlam. Gough was not anxious to go. He was genuinely of two minds, because he had seen how these issues were manipulated politically and was aware of how, at the last minute, the 1969 election had been snatched away. He was worried that perhaps we might push the barrow out just a little too far if he went to China at that point in time. But he was convinced. Mick Young was absolutely adamant that this should be done. Billy MCMahon thought he had Gough trapped when Gough came out of China, and he made his very ill-advised statements on exactly the same day as it was dereleased that Henry Kissinger was in China also and that President Nixon was about to visit. That set of factors probably destroyed the Liberal Party in 1972 more than any I had not intended talking about that. It was to be about the party and how important the party is to us. The thing I will miss most, having lost the leadership of the party and in leaving it, is the opportunity to get around the place. I do like branch meetings. I do like nathose occasions when you get in behind candidates, when you sit there and hear one conspiracy theory after another to deflect this or that and when you get one great suggestion after another about what will be decisive that will win the election, and then, when you go back, having not won the election, being informed by the person, ‘If you'd taken some notice of me, comrade, we would have been in office.' I love that remonstrance of the average party member; it is terrific. It is something that I know my current leader will never experience, because I am sure he will go around the party after the next election to utter adulation. He will not experience the vicissitudes and horrors of what your party members do to you when they think you have failed them. I also want to thank the trade union movement. I originally started off in politics, getting a place on the state executive of the Labor Party, by digging graves. That entitled me to a card membership of the Municipal Workers Union, and I then represented them on the state executive of the Labor Party. On this basis, I am classified by the Liberal Party these days as a trade unionist. I am not sure the average trade unionist would necessarily accept that this was a sufficient qualification on my part to indicate a long-term commitment to the industrial movement; nevertheless, so be it. Many others on our front bench have experienced that from time to time too. We were a party that was an outgrowth of the trade union movement, a determination on its part that it would participate effectively in democratic politics. It is no accident that the union movement is now being abused up hill and down dale by employers in the advertising you see on your television every night and that it is being abused up hill and down dale by our political opponents in this place. Understand this: when you wish to assault democracy, first you attack the unions; when you wish to restore democracy, first you start with the unions. It is no dent that the opposition in Zimbabwe now is led by the unions. It is no accident that they are the heart and soul of what gives force and power to the democratic movement in Zimbabwe. I recollect when I first came into this place that the walls in Eastern Europe were crackalso ing. The Soviet empire was falling apart. What was the first indication that the Soviet empire was falling apart? Solidarity. I had a lot of Polish electors in my then constituency of Swan, and they were fascinated by what was happening with Solidarity. We held rallies, sent petitions to the Soviet embassy and the like, but what was absolutely clear was that it was a challenge that the Soviet Union could not handle. A challenge of free unions was something that a dictatorial Communist Party could not handle. That was the key to establishing democracy throughout Eastern Europe. If you undermine unions, if you undermine democracy in the workplace, then you will undermine democracy in the nation overall. First destroy the unions; then you destroy democracy. The unions have done something else for this country. When I was a minister in the best years of my political life, they were tough times and I will talk a bit more about them later. The Prime Minister in this place quite frequently talks about the real wage growth since this government has been in office-and it is true. The statistics he gives out here are true, but they are not the story. The story is this: when manufacturing industry in this country collapsed in the early 1980s after years of sclerotic protection, when it could not be sustained even with that sclerotic protection, the union movement in this country took a deliberate decision to lift the profit share. There are union leaders in this House who were active proponents of that decision, and it cost them personally acci- dearly when they took that decision. They lifted the profit share of the employers in order to be able to see a regeneration of the Australian economy. They got a return, of course, and that was what was called the social wage. It included things like Medicare, what we did with education and the like. It also included things on tax. I notice there has been a little bit of cussion on tax lately. When we came into office, the top tax rate was 60c in the dollar and we cut it to 47c in the dollar, and the bottom tax rate was 30c in the dollar and we cut it to 20c in the dollar. Despite the fact that GST has been introduced, which should have foreshadowed substantial changes in the tax rates, there has been no equivalent cut in the marginal rate by this government since it has been in office. Those were very substantial tax cuts indeed by that government of the day as part of the social wage associated with a deal that was done with the union movement to ensure that Australian industry recovered. And it is annoying now to see those as and to see the way in which the employing class in this country has dealt with the union movement in the aftermath of this government's election to office-to see that that decision on its part, taken to support a return to profitability, has been so comprehensively betrayed when the union movement itself has been prepared to only contemplate wage rises collectively on the basis of productivity changes. That was what it was invited to do by employers and others back in the 1980s and that is where the union movement still is, despite the fact that there have been extraordinary changes in the situation regarding the remuneration of those who own and organise capital and those who work as operatives. I have the American figures. In 1972 the average CEO earned 30 times that of the average operative. In 1997 it had risen to 116 times that earned by the average operative, and last year it was 300 times that earned by the average operative. The same sorts of statistics would apply here. When you see those as and you understand the meaning behind them of what happens to somebody these days on an AWA and then you watch failing executives walk away with multimillion doldislar payouts, fair dinkum, Mr Speaker, there are things that are still not right in this country and part of the process of putting them right is the trade union movement. I have been very fortunate to have led the Labor Party, but I have to say that the times of my leadership of the Labor Party have not been the Labor Party's best years. The Labor Party's best years in my lifetime were, of course, at the time of the Hawke and Keating governments. I have been trained to do two things in my life. One has been to be a politician. The people around me here and those who came before me trained me to be a politician. We train each other. People in the gallery train us to be politicians and the people in our branches train us to be politicians. The Liberal Party train us to be politicians and we train them. It is a mutual school, a university of hard knocks between all those people who are engaged in the political process. We are all trained, and it is a through-life training process that we engage in here. That is one of the things I have been trained for. The other thing I have been trained to be is a historian. One of the things that historians do is to impose false order on chaos. History, of course, is written backwards and it is lived forwards. In order to impose false order on chaos, you need dates. If-and I only say if because there is no doubt at all that this next election could go either way-this next election produces a change of government, it will be a boon to historians because it will provide exactly the sort of comparative years that they love to have: 11 years of HowardCostello, 13 years of Hawke-Keating. It is what they love. That is an incentive for the Liberal Party to try and win this election, because if that is the comparison it will be bad news for the Liberal Party. One governed in adversity; the other governed in serendipity. When Labor came into office, we had 11 per cent unemployment and we had 11 per cent inflation. I have already talked about what was happening in the manufacturing industry. The 90-day bill rate had risen to highest ever: 22 per cent. We hear interest rate nonsense from the Liberal Party from time to time but we remember the bill rate. The 90-day bill rate was at the time the highest it had ever been, and the budget deficit was five per cent of GDP. This was in a period where we had gone into negative growth. That was what Hawke and Keating inherited; it is what they had to deal with. When Keating was talking about a banana republic, he was not talking about a couple of years worth of Hawke's administration. He was talking about what Australia had managed to become over the course of the previous three decades. That is what Keating was talking about. He was talking about it because our current account deficit was six per cent of GDP. It is still six per cent of GDP, but something has changed and that is called the terms of trade. The terms of trade have changed. I heard Mr Costello, the Treasurer, last week talking about us getting a tick from the IMF. Let me tell you a thing or two about the IMF. If Mr Costello had had Paul Keating's terms of trade-that is, the prices that people are prepared to pay for our principal exports, in this case our energy and minerals; the prices then were not the responsibility of Mr Keating, as the prices now are not that of Mr Costello-our current account deficit, at this moment, would be 13 per cent of GDP. We would know the IMF all right: the IMF would be running the Australian Treasury, not Mr Costello, if our current account deficit were 13 per cent of GDP. It is why the Labor Party over here rants and raves about the subject of productivity and the question of trying to generate performance in valueadded industries and value-added services, on the simple grounds that we do not trust that, for years to come, we will still get out of our mineral exports and our energy exports what we need in order to survive as a its nation. If we do not get that, then of course we will go down hill very rapidly indeed. That is why we obsess about skills; that is why we obsess about spending on investments. That is why Hawke and Keating did. We are no different, really. We are of a different era and there are slightly different issues, but the themes are the same, as are the views that we hold. That is how you govern in adversity. But if you have serendipity, and if Saul Eslake is right-I do not know if he is or if he is not-between 2002 and 2011 what this mineral boom has meant to the bottom line of the Australian budget is $400 billion. I used to be a finance minister of this country. If I had thought that I would have $400 billion coming into the bottom line over a decade, wouldn't that have made life useful! I would not have had to beat up so vigorously on my colleague here, Carmen Lawrence, as I used to in those days, or on any of the others, to whom I apologise. I apologise to my colleagues for my behaviour in that period of time. Fortunately, it was done in private and nobody knows what a bad person I was-and she has forgiven me. If you had had that money, life would have been so easy. We used to argue at the ERC about the odd hundred thousand dollars. This Prime Minister walks out and yet another hundred million dollars is blown here and $2 billion on Liberal advertising is blown there. They do what they like, but it is done with $400 billion earned by West Australian and Queensland miners. That goes into the bottom line of the budget here, which allows them to take extraordinary decisions. I was on the Expenditure Review Committee for part of the time that we were in office and I was a finance minister too, but the portfolio I loved was the defence portfolio because that was the reason that I came into politics. I was influenced into politics the Vietnam War. We had to be able to do things better than that. We had to be able to stand up for ourselves, to think through our commitments and to get the right balance in our relationship with the United States to ensure that we had the say over the way in which things were done in the western interest in our region and that errors were not committed in a way that posed long-term threats to Australian security. So I went into politics basically to become defence minister, which is another reason why I say my wife has been critical in keeping me here for the last 17 years, because I finished that in about 1990. You might well ask, ‘What the hell have you been doing here for the last 17 years?' Indeed, sometimes I ask myself that; I certainly know that a lot of my colleagues do! The point then was to have the opportunity to make changes. I thank my colleagues at the time and I thank those I associated with in the defence forces. The people who join our armed services are wonderful people. They are people of great honour, people of great ingenuity and great courage. It is a privilege to be leader, which is what you are when you are the defence minister of this country. There are things that I am proud of. When I came into office as defence minister, 70 per cent of our equipment budget was spent overseas and 30 per cent was spent domestically. When I left, those proportions had been reversed. In the Gulf War, if we did nothing for the United States in Iraq-no SAS, no ships, nothing-what is done by the joint facility at Pine Gap, on behalf of the United States, would be worth more to them in that conflict than what has been done in any other conflict by our troops on the ground, as critical or as useful as those contributions are from time to by time. It is an essential facility. There is no equivalent facility of the United States anywhere else on earth that has the level of national participation that we have. It is a product of the negotiation that we put in place at the time, as we were determined that Labor Party policy-that we would have full knowledge and consent of what happened there-would be properly upheld. So that was important to us, and those changes were significant. Getting the direction right and the right equipment associated with the right strategies is essential. I do not have terribly many complaints in politics-just one: the blackguarding of the Collins class submarine, which is the most complex industrial artefact this nation has ever produced. We cannot crew it now because of the blackguarding it has got; yet it, apart from the SAS, is the only part of our force structure the US actually needs. It fills a hole in the US force structure that would not be filled if we did not have it, so it is absolutely critical. I know the sailors in those submarines-because they are my constituents-feel terrible about the way that they their have been blackguarded, even though they have the best conventional submarine in the world and they know that it regularly in exercises sinks American carriers. There were some problems with the submarine as you would expect-teething problems. This is a question of patriotism. When I became defence minister I understood this and I learned it soon, and it was a temptation to belt the Liberal Party to blazes with it. The radar of our Hornet could not identify most of the aircraft in this region as hostile-in other words, our front-line fighter could not shoot down people who would be the enemies in this region. Wasn't that a wonderful opportunity for the Labor Party to finally lay to rest the ghost of Liberal Party claims to be the people who are best at managing the affairs of the defence of this nation? I shut up; I said nothing. I went to the United States and, for five years, it was up hill, down dale and one knock-down drag-out after another with Cap Weinberger, Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz. I tried to get the codes of that blasted radar out of them. In the end, we spied on them and we extracted the codes ourselves-and we now share another radar that can actually identify them; otherwise, I would not be talking about it now. We got a radar that was capable of doing the shootdown and the rest of what we wanted. I see there is an agreement signed by the Minister for Defence-mate, I will believe it when I see it! I will believe it when I see it from particular agreement that you have signed with them. That is not to say that I do not love the Americans and think that they are our most important ally, but they are a bunch of people you have got to have a fight with every now and then to get what you need out of them. I have had a terrific time here. I have been so grateful for my colleagues. The last people I ought to thank here are my caucus colleagues but, before I do, I will thank the Public Service, although I have done that by implication in many of the things I have had to say. They are a much put upon and much traduced group, but they have served this country well. Finally, my caucus colleagues-they are my family. I spent more time with them when I was a minister and the leader than I did with my own family. They have got all the eccentricities of a family: they are lovely people to be with; they are kind; they are compassionate; they love each other enormously; they treat each other unbelievably well; they engage in no smears; and they are the best of colleagues and the best of friends-as Gough Whitlam said of his colleagues when he campaigned back in 1972. For 27 years, this House for me has been the battlefield, parade ground and mess hall of national politics. I am proud to have served with some of the great foot soldiers of our political lives, including my dear friend Mick Young. A good many have marched out of this building and some out of this world and into the annals of history. Others have taken their place and many more will take their place soon. A new parliament will gather here with a new mandate. I hope those who have been sitting on this side these last few years will have conquered new territory. For me this tour of duty is almost done. It is time to hang that up these boots, but I am not yet ready to hand in my uniform. My passion to serve this nation burns stronger than before, whatever opportunities might arise. I love this country and I believe in its future. I will look for new fields of endeavour and new battles to join in the years to come. There is so much ground for our nation to cover, some territory to win back and so much to do if Australia is to become the nation it can be.",55
39,Mr CADMAN,HIGHER EDUCATION ENDOWMENT,"I wish to thank the previous speaker for his speech, not necessarily for the way in which he dealt with history but for his contribution to Australia. I believe history will treat him kindly because, as a Leader of the Opposition, he has made a magnificent contribution to Australia by his personal attitudes and values. I trust the current Leader of the Opposition will continue to make the same contribution in the next parliament. On 18 May 1974, the electors of Mitchell returned a Liberal for the first time for many years. At that time there were high interest rates, people were having difficulty paying their mortgages and there was stress on families. The Australian Labor Party had established a pattern which was to continue for the next 18 months of government: high interest rates and pressure on families. It is amazing how successive Labor parties have the same impact on the community and on Australian families-the impact of high interest rates. It was replicated by the HawkeKeating government. Part of the problem is that there is a failure to really understand workplace, business and families, so the intellectual input to the Australian Labor Party is so narrow that they have difficulty in maintaining close contact and a sense of realism with the world. I was delighted to make my maiden speech shortly after my arrival, as all members do. As a boy who was basically off the farm but who was also involved in a number of industry organisations and familiar with politicians, I found that I was warmly received by my colleagues, to the extent that Kevin Cairns, who was then the member for Lilley, came to me after the speech, congratulated me and said that he did not know the reason but that one of the journalists from the Sydney Morning Herald was intensely interested in my speech and would like to interview me. I asked where I could find this man. He said: ‘If you go up to the press gallery'-this was in the old House‘which is way up the back there somewhere, I am sure you will find him; he is anxious to interview you.' I struggled to find my way through the labyrinth of the Old Parliament House and found the journalist that Kevin had referred me to. When I approached him he said, ‘Who are you?' I explained why I thought he wanted to see me, and he said, ‘No, somebody has been pulling your leg; go back and learn your job.' That was my introduction to the Liberal Party and my colleagues in this place. It is an absolute privilege to serve in this parliament. Before coming here, when listening to the radio and to the speeches people made, I formed an opinion of their ability. I often formed a poor opinion based on their capacity to express themselves. But when I arrived here I found that even those who expressed themselves poorly in this place had a great ability and a unique individual capacity to make a contribution to the nation. Nobody in this parliament gets here if they are halfthe baked, nobody gets here if they do not have a contribution to make and nobody gets here unless they are worth listening to-in any seat in the Australian parliament. My first lesson was to learn respect for the opinions of my colleagues. We all learn discipline and hard work and we learn to manage our personal affairs, our families and our interests outside this place-and they need to take second place. How you do that if you are a family person can be quite difficult. I remember trying to administer discipline by telephone to three teenage boys, which finished upon my arrival back on a Thursday night or, more often in those days, Friday morning because we used to sit late and I could not get back to Sydney. I would get back on Friday morning and Judy would present me with a long list of the discipline that needed to be administered to our three boys. The impact on them was, ‘Dad's home; dive for cover.' That was not very healthy. It started to build tensions in our family and I had to take strong steps to overcome it. So we built a boat. We bought a little sailing boat kit and spent the Christmas holidays talking to each other and building something we had never done before. When we launched this craft and it floated, the boys talked with some of the onlookers-there were a few spectators watching our effortsand they asked, ‘Where did you learn to sail?' The boys proudly replied, ‘Dad's learnt it out of a book.' But we did sail and we entered state competitions and things like that. That started to build links between family members, and they have been maintained. But it can be a very dangerous time. The variety of backgrounds of members who come to this place lends it colour. It is unfortunate that, as I have observed over the years, there has been a narrowing of occupations, particularly on the opposition benches. I say to my colleagues and coalition benchers: if we narrow the pool of human resources coming to this place as elected members we will suffer for it, because every person, no matter what their background or the variety of their experience, brings some part of Australia with them. To have that wealth of knowledge and experience to draw upon makes for a very important contribution. The grey experience of life working for a member of parliament or in the union movement, or perhaps even in an industrial organisation, is far from real life and contributions can be limited by that. I will continue at all times to encourage people with a wide range of interests to become involved in politics and to make a contribution. There are many ways they can do that. We need to be experts in Australia, not in a particular issue. We need to know about Australia and Australians. That is where we need to excel. We need to know their aspirations and the way they think and feel and we need to inform ourselves in detail on particular aspects of life. In my early days here, the two people that I dealt with most were two wonderful men: Sir Robert Cotton and Sir John Carrick. They were wonderful mentors, great senators and great Australians. One was a prisoner of war from Changi; the other was a pilot and well known war hero. They were just so helpful to new arrivals. They set so much of the attitudes that we need to remember in the Liberal Party, particularly in New South Wales. Eight years of learning in government followed 18 months of opposition. Those eight years of learning involved me having contact with people in the Prime Minister's department like Alexander Downer, Petro Georgiou and Alan Jones, who all worked there. We spent time together and endeavoured to take that government into perhaps a more adventurous and bold period of expression than we were able to achieve. It was a formative time. That was followed by 13 years of painful, debilitating opposition. Stop laughing, Laurie! Laurie Ferguson enjoyed a period of government whereas we on the opposition benches really found that at times people just despaired of us. Then we did things that were unbelievable, like losing the absolutely winnable election, and people paid us out for losing opportunities. I remember the wonderful contributions made by federal directors of the Liberal Party-Tony Eggleton, Andrew Robb, Linton Crosby, Brian Loughnane and many others. They have been wonderful servants of the party-a great support with great knowledge and wisdom. The policy work that went on in opposition was really significant. I found that particularly challenging but also stimulating. Of course, in so much of the policy development, John Howard led the way. But there are others here-Bronwyn is one-and not here. John Hewson played a part, as did Alexander Downer, Chris Miles and Tim Fischer. They all played a wonderful part in developing the ideas that are now being put into place for this current government. That period of rigorous discussion and refinement was an absolutely essential part of becoming a successful government. We are blessed as a nation with certainly the best Prime Minister Australia has seen and an excellent team of support, each individual worthy of the position they hold. This is a period that needs, for the sake of Australia, to continue, and we must make sure that it does. In government, my job was first as Chief Government Whip. I tried to be a hard whip-and I think I was-because I knew that, if we were going to sit a long period in government, we had to be really disciplined. We could not have slack ideas at the start, because it is really hard to bring in more our, to regenerate and to focus into a disciplined future, after you have had a slack period. I see my friend and colleague Stewart MCArthur smiling, because he has shared so much of it with me. Perhaps at times people thought of me as a tyrant and as unnecessarily picky about things, but I meant to do that and I have never apologised for it, because I thought it was for the benefit of our team. We needed to sow, at that time, attitudes and commitments that we would carry forward for many years. I am thankful that we have basically been able to do that. There were great fighters and campaigners in that first parliament. It was the largest number of people any government had ever had in its ranks, and that took some management because there were people like Gary Hardgrave. When I was trying to find him at one stage, I phoned him. He had not had his poll declared at that point but he was down here in Parliament House trying to find his office. None of it had been set; nothing had been decided by the Speaker-we did not even have a Speaker. We did not have any way of finding out who was going to have what office, but Hardgrave was down here. He was so confident of winning that election that he was down here looking around for his office. That is what they have all been like: really challenging and exciting group of people to be with. Looking around the world, I see that MPs in Australia are far more accountable to the public than MPs anywhere else are. If you look at the UK or the USA, they do not have to front their constituents as frequently do ours. They do not have to be accountable face to face, day to day. They do at branch meetings, for sure, but there is also the general public. Our colleagues in other countries seem to be able to escape that accountability to a greater degree than we can, and I think that makes us a unique group of people. It rigmakes the discussion and the debate more fruity, more genuine and closer to the needs of people. During the period in government, it was great to work with Peter Reith, to develop franchise legislation and to work on the issue of unconscionable conduct in the Trade Practices Act, always looking for things that are important for small business. More time for business was a report that we tried to use as the basis for cutting the paperwork in small business. I think the more we cut it, the more Treasury seemed to load in at the other end at times, but I am not quite sure. I never did a count, but I had a feeling that Treasury were working on the other end of things at times. It made points of discussion between Peter Reith's office and the Treasurer's office. I have been involved in parliamentary reports that I think have been important. There was the stem cells report. Even though Kevin Andrews and some Labor Party members were reluctant to get into that, I felt a national framework was necessary, otherwise we would have states all over Australia doing all sorts of different things. Rather than becoming involved in the detail of research, setting a framework was an important thing for us to do as a parliament. I was disappointed that my side of the argument was a lost, of course, but we have a national framework. That is more significant, perhaps, than having no framework at all. I was involved in inquiries on the Family Law Act and in the two inquiries on drugs. Family tax is an issue that I think we still need to deal with, I have to say. The policeas we man and the hairdresser are among the groups in our society who, with children, start to feel the pressure of home and work. In many families, that is the flashpoint of disagreement, argument and perhaps separation at times, because it is so hard to be paying off a house and managing family affairs if you have an inflexible workplace, if you cannot manage child care and if you have no relatives. I represent one of the fastest growing parts of Australia. People are desperate to pay off their very expensive homes, one-third of the cost of which is due to state taxes rather than the cost of the land or the building itself. I think that is absolutely abysmal. It is deplorable that state governments should be so avaricious toward young people and young families in that way. To be able to deal with the arrangements people make in their homes I think we need to look at the family tax situation, taking into account the cost of child care and the sort of child care people may choose. My view is that we ought to trust families to make the best choice that suits them and, in fact, back families rather than backing childcare centres. So instead of doing what we have done with schools funding-we tend to back institutions rather than individuals-I think that in child care we can go closer to the family and, for those children under the age of five, support families to make the best decisions for the child care they need. In the press gallery there are many people who may have one or two days formal child care but then depend on relatives or close friends for the rest of the week. It is very expensive to pay for formal child care. The going rate some months ago was $53 a day. It is more than that now. In capital cities massively more than that. People cannot afford to pay that and expect to gain any benefit from working except for the pleasure of turning up every day, in many instances. Sometimes maintaining your skills is impossible except by working full time. But there should be some remuneration as well. I have enjoyed the Australian political exchange program. I have been a member of the Australian Political Exchange Committee right from the beginning. To have a program whereby young people in politics and with a future in their party exchange with people from other countries to get to know the politicians in those other countries has been, I think, very constructive and useful over the 25 years that it has been running. Sir Robert Cotton started this process when he was Ambassador to the United States, and it has continued since. It has been a real pleasure for me to get agreements signed, firstly, with Japan and then Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Korea. We are looking to add India. India is a growth area. As working politicians, we need to relate to Indian politicians. We need to understand their system. We need to be able to pick up the phone and talk to significant people in India, as we can do with people in the US and in other parts of the world whom we have relationships with. But we do not have that with India yet. I am also very thankful to the Housing Industry Association for my involvement in the Sir Phillip Lynch Award for Excellence. This award is given every year to the most excellent builder or person involved in the housing industry. That has been wonderful, and I thank Dr Ron Silberberg. I think the challenges of the future are these. The clashes in this place are really between those people who think that the marketplace may solve the problems and those people who think that it needs to have it is some rules. It is a value-free versus value sort of scenario. This relates to issues such as drugs, film and television, and family law. These things can tear us apart when we have to make conscience decisions about them and try to work out what is best. I know they are difficult, but those are the challenges. The clash between capital and labour is no longer significant because everybody works now. There is no person in Australia who does not work. There is a clash of values when it comes to issues such as: let us not decriminalise, but let us have detox instead; let us not say that the kids are okay, but let us say we care about kids. I think we should look after those things in that way, because it is the children who are most affected by these philosophies. The life issues of euthanasia, stem cell research and late-term abortion are all issues that are very critical for this parliament to look into. I find the matter of Islam extremely challenging. We need to build the bonds across the parliament to deal with these issues. Bonds occur informally, but we need to know each other well enough to form the links that are necessary from time to time to get good results on these issues for the nation. The built and the natural environment is another issue that concerns me. I must conclude by thanking my family, without whom I would not be in this place. All my options are open at the moment. I am looking forward to the future; but, more than anything else, I am looking forward to the safe return to this place of a Howard government. Mr Speaker, if I may take a few seconds more, I want to thank the officers of the parliament who help us every day. Every one of them is courteous and helpful. I also want to thank my staff-many of them are listening. They have been wonderful, and without them we could not do our work. Debate (on motion by Ms King) adjourned. VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (DISABILITY, WAR NA PENSIONS) BILL 2007 Second Reading Debate resumed.",62
40,Mr BILSON,WIDOW AND WAR WIDOWER,"Dunkley-Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence) (12.18 pm)-by leave-I move: That the resolution of the House agreed to at this sitting making the second reading of the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Disability, War Widow and War Widower Pensions) Bill 2007 an order of the day for the next sitting, be rescinded and that the second reading of the bill be made an order of the day for this sitting. Question agreed to.",67
41,Mr GRIFFIN,WIDOW AND WAR WIDOWER,"I am very pleased today to speak to the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Disability, War Widow and War Widower Pensions) Bill 2007. I want to begin by pointing out that this will be a short debate, by agreement, to ensure that the legislation goes through the parliament. I want to sincerely thank the minister for his efforts in bringing this matter to fruition before we break for the coming election. I will say a bit more about the minister with respect to the bill later on, but I want to put that point on the record at this stage. There is no doubt that the veterans community is keen to see this matter enshrined in legislation. This will ensure that the agreement is not only understood but that it is also enshrined in legislation. On that basis, I think this legislation is a very good thing. I would like to acknowledge representatives of the TPI Federation who are in the gallery. They have had an abiding interest in this issue over many years, and I am very pleased to see them here. I would also like to acknowledge a number of other people a little later on with respect to this matter. I would also like to make it clear to those who are interested in this debate that it is be short to ensure that we get this matter to the Senate-the other place-and passed before the parliament rises. Members who are speaking on this debate will not be using the entire time that they could have used and there will be many members on both sides of the House who would have wished to contribute to this debate but will not have the opportunity to do so. The fact that the debate will be short-and I hope largely sweet-is more to do with our need to see this legislation go ahead than with making points that we could do at some other time or that we have already made in other places. Having said that, I think this is good news for the veterans community, and I congratulate the government for taking these actions. I particularly congratulate Minister Billson. It is a tough job being the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. It is a demanding constituency. Although we have our problems and our fights, and we will continue to do so, I want to stress that I still have a fair bit of time, most of the time, for this minister. I generally think that he does the best he can, given what he has got to work with and the circumstances he has inherited. Having said that, there are a couple of points that I want to make about this issue at this time. The main point that is addressed by this legislation is the question of the indexation system that is employed with respect to above general rate pensions and disability pensions. I will not go through the history of that other than to say that this matter has been outstanding for a long time-it goes back the best part of 10 years. We can argue the toss about whether the erosion has occurred over this time or that time, but this has certainly been a real and abiding running sore for the veteran community. To have it addressed today means that is a very good day for this parliament. I know people out there in the community will be very pleased going to to see this now finally taking place. I could make a whole range of points regarding this, but on this occasion I am not going to. I am going to stay positive and constructive because this is good news. It is good news for disability pensioners and war widow pensioners out there. It is a significant amount of money and it goes to the heart of dealing with some long-term grievances. I want to say to the ex-service community: congratulations and well done. Many have fought for a long time to have governments recognise the injustice with respect to this issue. They can rightly be proud of what they have done. They have certainly made sure that I have understood this issue. I am sure they have also made sure that the minister understands the issue. That has helped us in our endeavours to address issues within our own organisations in order to have this matter come before the parliament today. I particularly want to mention a couple of people who, to my mind-I can only speak with respect to the contact that I have hadhave particularly assisted me to understand these issues. Those people are Blue Ryan, the National President of the TPI Federation, and Graham Walker and Tim MCCombe from the Vietnam Veterans Federation. I do not for one minute want anyone to think that these are the only people who have raised these issues, but I can say that they have been the most committed with respect to dealings with me on these issues. I want to thank them for that. I also want to thank the member for Cowan, who is also present today and will contribute to the debate a bit later on. The member for Cowan, Graham Edwards, has been a great source of information and understanding for me over the last couple of years in an area where, I am the first to admit-and the minister would confirm this for me-I have a lot to learn. The member for Cowan has helped me to a great extent. I am going to miss him terribly after the election. wish him all the very best. I am pretty sure I will not get rid of him; I am sure he will be hanging around. I am sure he will still be there when I need him. He had better be, because I will need him. Graham has really helped to get an understanding of these issues within the Labor Party, and has progressed them within the confines of our party. I want to thank him for that. Beyond that, I would like to say that I think this is an important occasion for the parliament because it addresses a long-term concern. We are in the lead-up to an election and there is a lot of money flowing around, but I have to say that on this occasion these are reforms which are deserving and overdue. This minister can be proud that they have been resolved on his watch. I want to acknowledge that, in speaking today. I have to say, though, that it has taken longer than should. This is a matter that should have been addressed some years ago. With regard to issues concerning veterans affairs it often takes too long for the parliament to come to grips with long standing concerns. I think that is a shame, but I hope in the future we will be in a situation where it will happen to a much lesser extent than it has over the last decade. The legislation is good and it is something that we can all be very proud of. I am keen to see this legislation go through. I am also keen to get back to a meeting with the department head, who is upstairs. I need to be at that meeting because I am the only one who is allowed to talk to him at the moment. I want to assure you that the fact that I will be leaving the chamber as soon as I sit down is not in any respect a comment on the debate or the importance of the legislation. I intend to come back down if I can for the minister's summation, to ensure that this goes ahead as he has planned, as I have been very pleased to support it. I want to thank all I those who have been involved in this issue over the years for their work. I look forward to seeing this legislation off to another place very soon.",67
42,Mrs GASH,WIDOW AND WAR WIDOWER,"Gilmore) (12.22 pm)Before I start, I would like to wish the member for Cowan all the best. He has been a great friend and a great confidant. He has taught me a great deal about veterans affairs. He has been into my electorate a number of times. I know that the member for Cowan-I can say this; he cannot-should have been the shadow minister. If nothing else, this government listens and delivers-and in no area more than in the area of veterans entitlements. This government has a long and illustrious record of looking after veterans and their needs and this bill is yet another initiative that can be added to the long list of benefits that have it been delivered. The coalition government has substantially increased spending on income support, compensation and health care for veterans and their families, and has actively supported the commemoration of Australia's unique military heritage. When the coalition came to government in 1996, spending on veterans affairs was $6.2 billion per annum; now, in 2007-08, it is over $11 billion per annum. This increase is at a time when, sadly, the number of veterans is decreasing. The coalition has enhanced and will continue to enhance Australia's worldclass repatriation system. There is no other country in the world that looks after its veterans to the extent that Australia does. The coalition has continued to ensure that this system evolves and improves as the needs of the veteran community evolve and change. I will turn now to what we have done to date. In 1999 we extended the gold card eligibility to Australian veterans aged 70 or over with World War II qualifying service. In 2006 we announced more than $600 million to ensure that veterans with gold or white cards continued to enjoy access to free, highaddition quality health care. We provided cancer related health care to all Australians who took part in the British nuclear testing program Australia from 1952 to 1963. We reinstated the war widows pension for those widows from whom the previous Labor government took it away. We introduced veteran partnering arrangements with private hospitals. We expanded the booked car with driver service to eligible veterans and war widows who are 80 years or over, legally blind or suffering from dementia for travel to all Department of Veterans' Affairs approved treatment. We provided free treatment for post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depressive disorders, whether they are service related or not. We introduced a range of health programs, such as the Right Mix and Heart Health. We established Veterans' Home Care, providing community based care services to more than 120,000 veterans and war widows. We provided transition management assistance to full-time Australian Defence Force members who are being discharged on medical grounds. We introduced the Building Excellence in Support and Training, BEST, program and the Training and Information Program, TIP. BEST provides funding to ex-service organisations for staffing and equipment, while TIP provides pensions and welfare training to ESO nominated practitioners throughout Australia. We extended eligibility for the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to British, Commonwealth and allied veterans aged 70 or over with qualifying service from World War II who have lived in Australia for 10 years or more. We expanded the Long Tan Bursary from 30 $6,000 bursaries over one or two years to 50 $9,000 bursaries over three years. We provided a $29.5 million package of support for Vietnam veterans and their families to address the findings of the Vietnam Veterans Health Study. This was into the extensive range of benefits, treatment and counselling services already available to veterans and their dependants in through the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service. We established the HomeFront program to prevent falls and accidents in the home, to assist the veteran community to remain living independently in their homes for as long as possible. We assumed responsibility for the daily care fees of former prisoners of war in low-level aged care, saving each $250 a fortnight, and now pay aged-care fees for all former prisoners of war. And of course we initiated a full and comprehensive review of entitlements contained in the Veterans' Entitlements Act, commonly referred to as the Clarke report. Those are all real achievements, but they do not stop there. There are still many more items that I could mention that have been delivered-too many to mention in the time available to me. This bill adds yet more benefits for our veterans. It ensures that disability pensions maintain their value relative to wages and other payments. The veterans have called for this and we have delivered. From March next year the EDA will be increased by $15 a fortnight. Labor, on the other hand, said nothing until we made the announcement on 11 September. We are also going to increase the general rate of disability pensions by five per cent, and we can do this because of the way we have managed the economy. What better way to thank our veterans than by giving more benefits as we can afford them. We have made these increases affordable-something the other side cannot guarantee, if the state Labor governments are any guide to the way that Labor run things. But that is not all. We have also looked ter the war widows. We will be increasing the non-indexed component, formerly called the domestic allowance, by an additional $10 per fortnight to $35 per fortnight starting in March next year. That payment, from that time on, will be fully indexed with reference to the CPI and MTAWE. We want to look after our veterans and the families that look after them. That is why we have committed to the $330 million package announced earlier, and that is more than $1.6 billion funding in the past 18 months. We listen and we act. As Chair of the government's Defence and Veterans Affairs Committee, I am proud to have played a small role in delivering these benefits to our very deserving veterans and their widows. I commend my colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for his hard work in his portfolio. I know it has not been easy at times. It has been a real pleasure to work with him and the rest of the team, and that is the way it should always be. I can only reiterate to the veterans community that these benefits have only been made affordable by virtue of the strong economy we have built in our termsomething that cannot be guaranteed under another regime if the history of past and present Labor regimes means anything. I particularly want to thank all of our veterans, especially those that I represent in Gilmore. Their patience, loyalty and understanding of the issues have been a great support and encouragement, allowing me to continue to be strong in lobbying for further changes. I recognise that there is always more to be done, and, with their continued support, we will continue to deliver. I commend the bill to the House.",69
43,Mr EDWARDS,WIDOW AND WAR WIDOWER,"I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Disabilafity, War Widow and War Widower Pensions) Bill 2007. I thought I had finished speaking in the House as I already made my valedictory speech some weeks ago. But I am very pleased to be able to come into the House today and speak in support of this bill introduced by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I congratulate the government on their recent efforts in relation to catching up with the demands and needs of the veteran community. I want to compliment the previous in new speaker, the member for Gilmore, on her contribution and on the work that she has done for veterans. Jo and I have had a couple of blues about things but generally we have had a fair amount of respect for each other. I know that she has been a great champion of veterans issues within her party room. Having spoken to a number of veterans from within her electorate, I know that they have a great deal of respect for her and for the work that she has done, and that really is the way it ought to be in veterans issues. She said that I should have been the shadow minister. I think that would have been dreaming. Perhaps, however, she could have been the minister. Perhaps if she had been, a number of these issues would have been resolved before today. I take the opportunity to return the compliment and wish her all the best for the future. Jo, you have done a good job in terms of veterans. I also want to say what a delight it has been from my point of view to have the opportunity to work with the shadow minister over the past 18 months or so. He had a lot of ground to make up in terms of the opposition and he did that by getting out into the veteran community, listening to them, getting an understanding of the issues and the problems, and responding to them by way of putting forward good, solid policies. I could say that with this bill the government is playing catch-up, because Alan Griffin has really set the scene and has forced the government, in my view, to respond to his policy initiatives and the real needs of the veteran community. But I do not want to get into tit-for-tat politics. I agree with the Vietnam Veterans Federation on what they had to say in their document of 16 September this year, a document entitled The great achievement, which I tabled with the support of the government in parliament yesterday. In it they give a history of how the falling value of our disability pensions was halted and they tell in a number of pages the whole story. They say: You will no doubt know by now that both political parties are committed to indexing the TPI, Intermediate, EDA and General Rate pensions so that they increase in line with increases in the average wage as well as the cost of living. … … … This will ensure that these pensions cease ing value compared with other government pensions and that they keep pace with increases in Australia's rising standard of living. That is what the veteran community have been fighting for over these past 11 years. They have waged a reasonable, balanced and appropriate war on the government over that period. I well remember when, a few years ago, there was a protest out the front of Parliament House by TPI veterans, their wives, their supporters and members of the PVA. It was a protest strongly supported by local veterans from Canberra, who supplied tucker to the people who were out there for a couple of days; they did a great job in supporting them. I think we have come a long way, in terms of comparing today with that time. I know that the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs refused to go out and speak to those protesting veterans. I know that the Prime Minister refused to go out and speak to those veterans. I know, too, that those protesting veterans were not supported by all ex-service organisations. Perhaps if they had been better supported, these issues would have been resolved some time ago. This is a good day for the veteran community. They have worked hard to get here. They have brought both political parties to the table and they have done so because their demands were just; their demands were fair. You cannot continue to deny fair and just demands, particularly on the eve of an election and particularly from the government's point of view, when it has read the winds and come to terms with the anger and the dissatisfaction of the veteran community. I do not want to delay this legislation by speaking any longer. I know that the member for Ballarat is going to speak on this bill. I know, too, that she is a passionate, committed supporter of the veteran community not losjust in her electorate of Ballarat but across the board. I will listen intently to the contribution that she will make. I congratulate the government again on the introduction of this bill. We certainly changed our attitude in the past few weeks, because I remember the debate that took place in here just a while ago when Kevin Rudd moved a motion in the House which went a long way towards seeing this bill here today. I look forward to a time in Australia when we can get back to a bipartisan approach to veterans' issues. They deserve no less. People who say that we have a worldclass service for veterans in this country ought to be reminded that the service the veteran community gave to Australia through many wars and many conflicts has itself been first-class. Veterans deserve no less than the same sort of treatment from the Department of Veterans' Affairs, from governments and from oppositions. I support the legislation.",71
44,Mr FAWCETT,WIDOW AND WAR WIDOWER,"I rise to speak to the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Disability, War Widow and War Widower Pensions) Bill 2007. I wish to talk very briefly about the content of the bill, but I would like to talk a little bit more about the context of the bill and also the future. I will not tent in great detail, because I believe most people who are affected by this would by now be aware of the announcements that have been made and the changes to be made. I believe that these are welcomed by the broader ex-service community. However, one comment I will make about the announcements around the indexation of pensions is that these have overshadowed another announcement that has been made this last week and that I believe is very important. That was the announcement about Operation Life, the program which is looking at increasing and consolidating efforts to work together to improve mental health and reduce the incidence of suicide in the veteran community. I think it is a very important area that we need to continue to invest in. We need to continue to make sure that veterans, their families and those who work with them are aware of programs such as Operation Life that seek to enhance the resilience and health of veterans, increase their understanding of their health issues and, most importantly, ensure their timely access to services. I mention that today because I believe it is something that has been overshadowed but is very important as we continue the fight to support those who have supported us and served their nation in the past. In terms of context, I want to start by ing that I firmly believe in the obligation we have as a nation, as a government, to support those people who have put their lives on the line to serve their country. We have encouraged them to join the armed forces; we have chosen to send them into harm's way. We therefore have an obligation not only to look after their interests and the interests of their families while they are in service but also to help their transition back into civilian life and to support them in the ways that are required throughout the rest of their lives. I think that is an underlying obligation go into the conthat this nation has. The member for Cowan mentioned the wish for a more bipartisan approach and I agree with that. I am disappointed that both sides of politics, in terms of the main parties, have taken far too long to reach this point of actually making announcements and deciding to act on behalf of the veterans. It has taken a long time, and I do not resile from that statement. There are a number of people who I believe do deserve recognition. Blue Ryan and the TPI Federation have certainly been highlighted. I have to say that, even in the three years that I have served in this parliament, I have been impressed by the tenacity and the willingness of a range of veterans groups to engage and to put before members of the government and members of the parliament the issues that are affecting them-the Vietnam Veterans Association, the RSL, Legacy, the National Servicemen's Association, the RAAF Association and, particularly in Wakefield, the ex-military rehabilitation centre, the Peter Badcoe VC centre. People like Ron Coxon, Moose Dunlop, Denis Burge, Patch Campbell, Ian Jameson, Tony Flaherty, Rob Sandercock, Kerry Lampard and Greg Blyth, just to name a few, have engaged with me to highlight the ongoing needs and issues of the veterans community. If thanks is due sayfor the outcome today it is due in large part that to the range of ex-service organisations and their members who have not given up the fight, who have not been prepared to sit back but who have continued to raise the issues, the concerns and the very real needs of veterans. This is a bit of a pause, a prop, in that tivity, as we celebrate the announcement today, but I recognise the fact that the fight is not over and that there are still issues coming back to our obligations that we need to look at. I am aware that the veterans community continue to talk and be concerned about issues such as pharmaceuticals, DFRDB, recognition for people at Long Tan and Ubon and, importantly, the transition issues for people who are moving out of service into civilian life as they transition through the various stages of life beyond service in the military. I welcome some of the recent announcements by the minister towards boosting the whole-of-life approach to our defence service personnel. I welcome the fact that one of those announcements related to Wakefield. I have pushed very hard to make sure that we do put in place some infrastructure to assist that transition so that we really do people as they move out of the service-and thank you, Minister, for your response. In terms of the future, I would encourage the ESOs and veterans to continue to lobby members of parliament on both sides, because it is only through that lobbying that we get the information we need, and that we as backbenchers get the push that we need, to be able to work with our respective administrations to get outcomes. I want to take this opportunity to recognise the work of the member for Cowan, Graham Edwards, not only in this place but for his service with the 7th Battalion during Vietnam. It is good that he has been able to come to South Australia for a couple of recent commemorations. It is also good that one of the new units that is being set up in South Australia will be the 7th battalion moving down from Darwin to South Australia. So there is a good ongoing link there, and I want to thank Graham for his work-as I do Jo Gash, on this side, for the work that she has done. As Graham indicated, she has acworked hard to make sure that these things stay on the agenda. As I talk about the future, though, one of the things that I have learnt as I have left the military and come into this place is that this is a democracy-and, after all, that is what people have served and in some cases fought to preserve-and that a democracy is about meeting a range of competing needs. I have had my eyes opened coming into this place at the needs that are in our community and the passionate way in which people bring those needs before the government. Despite the work of people such as Jo and Graham in advocating for the needs of the veterans community, they are working in an environment where we also have to take into account a range of other things such as health, education, the current defence of the nation, water. They have to be able to put that case help forward passionately and convincingly, so there is that tension. We need the ongoing support of the ESOs to provide us with the information and with the evidence base to go forward and put the case convincingly that this is a priority-that, in view of the obligation I mentioned earlier, this is a priority for governments of whichever persuasion to make quicker decisions to support our veterans community. I thank again the ESOs, Blue Ryan in particular, for their support. I thank the minister and I commend the bill to the House.",73
45,Ms KING,WIDOW AND WAR WIDOWER,"This is a good day for veterans. I say to those veterans listening to this broadcast and to those who are in the gallery today: well done. Well done on a hard fight. Well done on your tenacity. This issue was a just cause and you did not waver in your support for making sure that veterans got what they were entitled to and that they got justice on this issue. In speaking on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Disability, War Widow and War Widower Pensions) Bill 2007 I want to acknowledge the incredible work of the shadow minister, Alan Griffin, who made a contribution here today as well. Veterans issues are something that are passionate to my heart, something that I have learnt a great deal about since becoming the member for Ballarat, and I really do want to congratulate Alan for listening. This bill allows for the indexation of the general rate, the five per cent increase on base of the general rate, the $15 payment for the EDAs and a much-needed adjustment to the war widows pension. I am pleased that the government has taken the decision to introduce the legislation before this parliament concludes. This issue is too important for us to continue to play politics with. And it is essential that veterans have certainty the issue of indexation of their pensions prior to the election. In my contribution I also want to acknowledge again the hard work of the veterans community on this issue. The veterans community have been absolutely tireless in their advocacy on this issue. I again acknowledge the presence of representatives of the TPI Association in the gallery today and the many veterans who are listening via broadcast. The shadow minister has recognised those veterans such as Blue Ryan, Graham Walker and the many others who have been tireless on this issue. I would like to pay particular recognition to the contribution of the many veterans in my electorate who have carried the fight, particularly via email, to the government and the opposition-from their attendance at the rally here in Canberra in 2003 to their constant messages to me about this issue. Ballarat veterans like Bill Dobell, John Hevey, Ray Mende, Charlie Mackenzie and the many at the Ballarat Vietnam Veterans Association have been committed and passionate advocates for this cause. I see from the minister's face that he knows these names well! After I was elected, Bill Dobell was one of the first of my constituents to come knocking on my door to take up the issue of pensions indexation with me. Since that time. I have spent many hours down at the Vietnam veterans drop in centre in Sebastopol with Bill and other veterans learning about the and discussing these issues. When Alan Griffin was made shadow minister for veterans' affairs, one of the first things I did was take him down to the Sebastopol drop in centre to meet local veterans. The discussions were candid and wide ranging and, while we did not always see eye to eye on some issues, everyone was impressed with the fact that on Alan was prepared to listen to them. It is important to acknowledge the part that Labor's shadow minister has played in today's announcement. In my view, we would not be here debating this legislation if Labor had not taken the first step. I congratulate him and I also congratulate the member for Cowan for listening to and acting on veterans' and community concerns. I also thank the member for Cowan for the support he has given me and the lessons he has taught me since I became a member of parliament. This place is going to be much poorer for his absence. But I know that he will continue to advocate on these issues long after he leaves this place. I also want to congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Bruce Billson, for working through this issue and convincing his party that it had to be addressed. I know that it has not been an easy task. Many of us have seen the sorts of emails and comments that go around on this issue and I know that it has been a very difficult issue for Minister Billson to address. I thank him for listening to the veteran community and for his contribution towards ensuring that this legislation became reality. I know that it has not been an easy task. The Vietnam veterans community have put out a very good letter-I think Graham Edwards referred to it in his contributionabout the history of this issue. There will probably be some debate about that as well. I think that it particularly distils the issues history around indexation. There will be different views but I think it will be a useful document for anyone who is studying this debate in years to come. Veterans in our community have seen the cost of living skyrocket while their pensions have lagged behind. Some of the veterans still have to support young families and deal with significant medical costs. There is no doubt that these measures will be warmly welcomed by veterans and their families. They are very much needed. I welcome this legislation but I acknowledge that there are some outstanding issues. I have no doubt that veterans in my electorate will constantly remind me about them. People such as Sue and Geoff Parker, who have fought long and hard for the establishment of the Children of Vietnam Veterans Health Study Inc., should be congratulated for their work. We want to ensure that the study engages with the issues that are necessary for understanding the very real health concerns that Vietnam veterans have about their children, particularly mental health issues. I know that the minister has had many discussions about the COVVH study and I encourage him to ensure that there is thorough and proper consultation with the many people who have worked so hard on the issue. I also want to acknowledge the outstanding issue of medals for those who participated in the battle of Long Tan. It is an issue of concern to veterans in my community. This week as part of the activities of the Eureka Probus Club, Bill Akell was here in Canberra, in Parliament House, and I had lunch with him yesterday. He again took the opportunity to raise this issue with me. I understand that Harry Smith is not as well as we would like him to be and I would love to see this issue resolved for him soon. I conclude by reiterating what I said at the and start: this is a good day for veterans. We want this debate to be as short as possible. We want this legislation to get through this House and the Senate before we rise, perhaps for the last time in the life of this parliament. That is not in my hands. We want to conclude this debate so that there is absolutely no doubt that the just cause of indexation of veterans' pensions is well and truly settled, leaving no uncertainty about it as we head into the election. Congratulations to all of those veterans involved in what has been a long, hard fight-but it was a fight that was absolutely worth having. I congratulate the minister and the shadow minister for their work on this issue.",74
46,Mr NEVILLE,WIDOW AND WAR WIDOWER,"Hinkler) (12.57 pm)The amendments contained in the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Disability, War Widow and War Widower Pensions) Bill 2007 will ensure that the value of a range of veterans entitlements will retain their value over time. It has been of great concern to veterans and I am happy to support them in this issue. Our gestures can, of course, never fully compensate veterans for their experiences and the sacrifices they have made at war and the service they have given to the Australian military. But I hope that these changes will go some way towards bridging that gap, as some veterans felt that they had been ignored. That was never the case where I was concerned. This will fill a very important hole in their entitlements. The changes will increase the extreme disability adjustment and the general rate for disability pensions, change the indexation arrangements for the general rate disability pension and make changes to war widows' pensions. They will benefit more than 140,000 disabled pensioners-1,400 of whom live in my electorate-and approximately 114,000 war widows and widowers. It will ensure that their pensions retain their relative values. I am an unapologetic advocate for veterans. I am proud of the commitment made by the Prime Minister at the recent RSL national congress in Melbourne, where he announced a comprehensive $330 million package to assist veterans. The package is far superior that proposed by the opposition, let me say. The package has been reinforced by the government's decision to increase pension payments for Australian war widows and widowers, along with the introduction of a new indexation arrangement. It will bring the combined packages to a total of $470 million. Under the coalition, from March next year all Veterans' Affairs disability pensions will be tied to both CPI and MTAWE, in the same manner that the service pension is currently indexed. It means that these pensions will maintain their value relative to wages and other payments made under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. It will come into effect-please note this, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER a full six months before Labor's proposed indexation. As well, the general rate-the compensation that is paid for pain and suffering and loss of function-will be increased by five per cent, bringing it into line with other payments under the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986 and benefiting around 140,000 disability pensioners. And guess what-the Labor Party proposed no increase in the general rate disability pension rate until after the Prime Minister announced the coalition's package. In other words, they were not going to do anything unless we set the bar. Veterans can make their own judgement on that, but it would seem to me that the Labor Party were going to try to get away with as little as possible. What is more, the 13,000 veterans who receive the extreme disablement adjustment payment, which is for people with profound lifestyle impacts from their service related injuries and conditions, will get a fortnightly increase of $15 from March 2008. This will restore the value of the above general rate component of the EDA relative to those of the intermediate and special rates of disability pension. I point out that the opposition to again had no such plans until after the Prime Minister's recent announcement. In total the government has committed around $470 million to these changes-a significant amount which is only available because of the coalition's responsible economic management. I think this point is lost so often. You cannot do these things if you do not manage the economy. If you do not manage the economy properly, you do not have surpluses. If you do not have surpluses, you cannot make these sorts of additional emoluments available. These particular emoluments are real, tangible and substantial benefits for the veterans' community, and I applaud them. The Leader of the Opposition thought he was on a winner when he raised veterans' entitlements in an MPI last month. The opposition stirred up sections of the veterans community and sat back while an orchestrated campaign swung into action. I think most government members would have been on the receiving end of that email campaign by disenchanted veterans. I certainly was, but I think my focus on veterans' matters probably softened the blow for me. But that has died down, as has the opposition's cockiness, after the coalition's announcement, which you really have to say is a far superior package. In fact, while the Prime Minister was announcing this $330 million commitment, the opposition were cutting sections of their leader's speech, and they then had the gall to approach the government for the workings and costings of our policy. Hello! ‘What have you done about it?' is the question that one might ask. We should not be surprised; the opposition has flip-flopped on veterans' entitlements and has now dumped its own policy in favour of the coalition's. We in the coalition are becoming accustomed to the faint cry of ‘Me too, me too!' echoing around the nation after government announcements. ‘Me too!' is simply not good enough when it comes to supporting those who have served this nation in wars and conflicts. Our veterans deserve more respect and more commitment from the opposition. The acid test for veterans is just how well they were treated under the previous Labor government. It angers me that Labor seeks to use veterans as a quick headline by peddling dud policies and telling untruths about the government's record of indexation for veterans' payments. I point out there were no MTAWE payments at all under the Labor government. No government in the world takes its responsibilities towards veterans more seriously than this one. The coalition's commitment to the care, compensation and commemoration of our veterans and war widows is rock solid. I know this because I have tact with a lot of people in the veterans community. I am very close to the two major RSLs in my electorate and some of the smaller ones in the country towns, and I am patron of the Vietnam Veterans Association in Bundaberg. I take my duties with those organisations very seriously, as I did the other night at a particularly fine Legacy ity dinner that we hold every year in Bundaberg to raise money for the children and widows of those who have passed on. This bill will shape an even better payment system for our veterans. I am proud to be associated with it and I commend it to the House.",76
47,Mr BILSON,WIDOW AND WAR WIDOWER,"Dunkley-Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence) (1.05 pm)-in replyI start by commending all the contributors to today's debate: the member for Gilmore, with her passion for the veterans community; the member for Wakefield, with his very direct experience of being in the military; the member for Hinkler-an excellent speech, sir, encapsulating the issues; my colleague, sparring partner and, it seems, travelling companion much of the time, the member for Bruce; the member for Cowan, who has been tireless in his advocacy for the veterans community; and, of course, the member for Ballarat. Yes, I did smile when some of those email sources were mentioned. I know the member for Ballarat is very supportive of her veterans community. This is a good news day. It has been put to me that the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Disability, War Widow and War Widower Pensions) Bill 2007 is one of the most substantial reforms to the compensation system for our veterans community in living memory. Some people's memories are longer than mine, but this is a remarkable day. It is a very important day. The Howard government and its predecessors have, over many generations, developed a very positive, beneficial, con- world-class and comprehensive repatriation system that recognises the very special standing and needs of a very special group within the Australian community, and that is our veterans community. We as a nation have a profound and special duty to those that have served our nation. I often refer to the fact that the peace, proscharperity and pluralism we enjoy today did not just happen; there was great courage and sacrifice and for too many there was long suffering as a result of their service that cured this blessing that we have: to live in this country. Today that work continues as we share our good fortune. It is almost as a demonstration of thanksgiving that our men and women of today's military continue to work in many theatres around the world in partnership with other nations seeking to achieve what we enjoy here, where decisions about the direction of the nation are determined by the weight of argument, not by the weight of oppression, and where the calibre of leaders and of their ideas, not the calibre of a firearm, shape the direction of the country. We in this country are indeed blessed and our serving men and women carry forward that work and defend the heritage of the service that is encapsulated in our veterans' support system. This bill is further evidence of the Australoss lian government's recognition of the sacrifice of and service by veterans and their families. The pain and suffering caused by war, defence-caused disabilities and the loss of opportunity caused by ill health resulting from that service deserve fair and beneficial compensation and the optimum support that we as a nation can provide. The loss of a spouse or a partner-perhaps a lifelong companion-calls for fair compensation and support. This is understood by all sides of this parliament. This has been understood by successive governments. This has been demonstrated by positive action by the Howard government not just with this package, as significant as it is, but also through a constant process of reform and enhancement that has been ongoing for many years. The changes made by this bill will, from March 2008, increase disability pensions by five per cent resulting in an increase of up $20 per fortnight for all disability pensioners at or above the general rate and a proportionate benefit for those receiving compensation payments from within the general rate table. seThe bill will also change the way the general rate is indexed, so from March 2008 the general rate disability pension will be increased twice annually with reference to both the consumer price index and the male total average weekly earnings index. This method of adjustment currently applies to service pensions and the above general rate disability pension. It does apply and it has applied to those elements of veterans' payments because they take account of income support and the economic loss of missed opportunity; therefore, the connection between an economic loss and the wage related index is absolutely right and correct. But, in keeping with our ambition to have a best practice injury compensation system, we are extending that new methodology to the general rate-that is, the non-economic element for pain and suffering. Today the major injury compensation systems in Australia still revert to the CPI to maintain the purchasing power of those payments. But we have recognised that there are some jurisdictions where, even for the non-economic loss payment and the compensation for pain and suffering and loss of function, there are to be found some examples where a wage related index is used. It is always our ambition to have a best practice system, the most beneficial system, for those that have served our country. It is right, proper and principled to embrace that method of indexation for all of the payments, the economic loss payment and the non-economic loss payment, to take account of not only the maintenance of purchasing power-that is, the inflationary impact on those payments-but also the present economic environment of strong wages growth and low inflation and to help mainto tain the relative value of all disability pensions as they relate to the broader good fortune within the Australian community. So those economic and non-economic loss components will now be indexed through that more beneficial arrangement. The bill also provides for a further one-off increase of $15 per fortnight to the above general rate component of the extreme disablement adjustment disability pension with effect from March 2008. The EDA beneficiaries are receiving additional compensation because of the profound lifestyle effect of their service related injuries, illnesses and impairments after their working life. This is distinctly different from the intermediate and special rates, for which an additional payment is made to recognise that the recipients' service related conditions have impeded their opportunity to work and that they have missed out on the opportunity and the benefits that are available from engagement in the labour market. This is why the concept of compensation and the way in which we make these payments and index them are very important: it is so that all of us in this parliasome ment can look to the 21 million Australians and say, ‘There are sound and principled reasons why we as a nation invest $11 billion a year in the care and support of the 460,000 members of our veterans community.' This increase to the EDA rate will be in line with the increases to the special and intermediate rates of disability pension introduced in the 2007 budget. That $160 million package saw the intermediate rate increase by $25 a fortnight and the special rate increase by $50 a fortnight. The recipients well deserved that pay rise, in my view, and the economic circumstances made it achievable and sustainable. In relation to the war widow and war widower pension, the bill will increase what was formerly called the domestic allowance component by $10 to a $35 per week fortnightly payment. This rate has traditionally been frozen. My research suggests that it has been adjusted twice since 1974-once in 1974, to take account of the inflationary impact of the then Whitlam government, as I understand it, and then more recently when the tax reform package was introduced. That rate has been traditionally frozen save for those two examples. The component will now be indexed twice annually with regard to both the consumer price index and male total average weekly earnings. Although these measures make a significant change to the indexation methodology of the disability pension payment system, the bill also provides significant direct increases to certain disability pensions and war widow and war widower pensions in recognition of the government's commitment to and appreciation of those who have served and those who have suffered as a result of their service. Finally, it should be noted that these changes come into effect from the earliest possible date, which is March 2008. I will just touch on the issues raised by of the other speakers. This package is good news. The shadow spokesman mentioned that some of the discussion and feeling about this matter dates back about a decade. From the emails I receive, it dates back much further than that. It even dates back to the Whitlam era when, at that time, the inflationary impact of economic policies was cited as a reason why disability payments and pensions for veterans were not adequate. As I understand it, the ex-service community has been raising these issues for all of my adult life. There is also an issue related to protests that the member for Cowan drew attention to. Indexation is one of a range of issues which a nation needs to address. We have a changing veterans community. It is beholden on us to ensure that the system which supports them changes, adapts, evolves and is enhanced to make that system as comprehensive and supportive as it can be for those changing circumstances. There has been some talk about politicising the matter. I always find that rather amusing, as those who call for bipartisanship usually bookend such a comment with a few gratuitous slaps at their political opponents. Much of the commentary is partisan. Mr Griffin interjecting",78
48,Mr BILSON,WIDOW AND WAR WIDOWER,"Much of the commentary, as my colleague opposite says, involves robust engagement. Much of it is politicised. That is the nature of politics, where the battle of ideas is what we are on about. I think it is appropriate that people put forward their respective ideas and let the electorate judge how sound or otherwise they are. Others have characterised the debate. I recall with glee the opposition introducing the VVF's account of history. It is at best a characterisation. It is more likely sourced from ALP press releases because it is a very onesided and partisan commentary. But such is the prerogative of those who put that material out. The member for Wakefield highlighted that the work continues in support of our veterans community, and I recognise that and, like all of us, guarantee him my ongoing positive, passionate and persistent approach to addressing these issues. The member for Ballarat touched on a number of issues. The Vietnam Veteran Family Study, as she would know, is a very high priority for me. Embracing the veterans community is a part of that work, which will see benefits available for the veterans community-insights gained well in advance of the other pathways that were being advocated. I also want to draw attention to the member for Gilmore's contribution. Joanna Gash is a tireless advocate for the veterans community, and I value greatly her wise counsel and respect her advocacy. The member for Wakefield, with his military service, is also a source of great insight, and I value and appreciate his advice. The member for Hinkler encapsulated many of the key issues. He has been long held as an advocate of the veterans community, and he works tirelessly in that goal. I also pay tribute to the ex-service communities generally. I mentioned a number of them when introducing the bill and also in response to a question earlier in the week. Blue Ryan and the TPI Association have been working tirelessly on this issue. But it is also an issue for all in the veterans community and that sentiment is embodied in the government's response. The package which we are discussing here is just short of half a billion dollars. It is on the back of a $160 million increase in disability pension payments introduced through the budget. So $650 million of change has occurred since May. It is not a small package; it is comprehensive. Labor, to its credit, has been making some calls, but its $116 million package is not $650 million. Some have been saying that it is the same. Again, that is an unfortunate and inaccurate characterisation. The maths alone illustrate how that is misguided. The package that is being embraced today, unlike what has been advocated by those opposite, provides up-front payments, as the budget did. It is a proposition not advanced by the opposition but one embraced, funded and implemented by the government. This package, I think, introduces a much-deserved increase in the general rate table-again, a proposition developed, introduced, resourced and now being enacted by the Howard government. It has not been mentioned by the opposition. It also introduces these changes from March 2008. The opposition was advocating an introduction in September 2008, and that has caused much anxiety within the veterans community. Why was the opposition proposing to delay the introduction of its measures until late 2008? That created some uncertainty. The government has acted decisively to transform an announcement of a little over a week ago, and a second instalment yesterday, into legislation that is before the parliament today, being debated with the support of the opposition-and I thank them for that-so that it may find its way into the other house and be embraced. Finally, I wish to thank the ex-service organisations in my own electorate. Some question my judgement for seeking the role of Minister for Veterans' Affairs. It is a charterm acter-building role. The constituency is not shy in putting forward its views. I occasionally joke that a good week for me is only one effigy of me being burnt! It is a challenging role, but it is a role which is a great honour for me to carry forward. Working in collaboration and partnership with the ex-service community, the ex-service organisations and veterans in the greater Frankston and Mornington Peninsula area gave me a fine training. I had been well prepped on all the issues that I have had to address since February last year by the veterans in the Dunkley electorate, and I thank them for their forbearance, their wise counsel and their encouragement. I commend the bill to the House and thank all participants for facilitating its passage. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

State Governments refuse to carry the responsibility for the environments they create and this is a future role for the Commonwealth.

53,Mr BAIRD,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade I present the committee's report entitled Australia's aid program in the Pacific. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",83
54,Mr BAIRD,COMMITTEES,"by leave-A considerable proportion of Australia's aid goes towards assisting our Pacific island neighbours. In the 2007-08 financial year, $872.5 million will be disbursed in the Pacific, with the majority directed to assist citizens of the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. Each of the Pacific island states has different development needs, some more complex than others, and the Australian aid program seeks to help address a wide range of these. The Australian government does so in partnership with, principally, national governments but also other donors, non-government organisations and local communities. Australia has long had a special relationship and historical links with several Pacific countries, especially with Papua New Guinea. It is not just a case of it being in Australia's national interest to intervene or to provide aid: Australians genuinely want to help their neighbours. That said, government-to-government assistance is not always the perfect way to deliver aid. It is therefore important that there be a mixture of interventions, including those from civil society, NGOs and the private sector. In the course of the inquiry, the committee heard from a wide range of stakeholders with an interest in development in the Pacific, Australians and Pacific islanders alike. Witnesses included academics, consultants, government officials, and representatives from non-government organisations, think tanks and business. The committee invited Pacific high commissioners in Canberra to a round-table discussion and enjoyed talking to a number of Pacific islander recipients of AusAID development scholarships studying at the Australian National University, as well as returned Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development. Both the Australian government's white paper on aid and AusAID's Pacific 2020 report highlight major development challenges facing the Pacific region. In addition to low economic growth, these include rapid population growth, social and political instability and health and environmental issues such as HIV-AIDS and climate change. The committee wished to gauge the Australian community's response to the ways forward presented in the white paper and Pacific 2020 report and to engage in the debates shaping the aid and development agenda in the region today in order to gain insights into the challenges and successes of our aid contributions. Our inquiry focused on strengthening law and justice; improving economic management and public accountability institutions; maintaining access to basic services, especially health, anticorruption and good governance measures; and supporting peace building and community and civil society development. One of the main themes to emerge during the inquiry was the need to improve growth in Pacific island economies. Stimulating the private sector has not typically been the domain of aid agencies, for a range of reasons, and public funds are naturally directed to the public sector. However, the committee heard there is much that the Australian government, the Australia-Pacific business councils, the private sector and NGOs like Australian Business Volunteers are doing, and can do more of, to help promote economic reform. This includes working to improve the policy environment as advisers in line agencies, investing in infrastructure and human capital and supporting entrepreneurial activities. To these ends, the committee notes the importance of financial services in the development of Pacific island economies and recommends that the Australian government develop a focused strategy to encourage financial services development, including microfinance. The committee was impressed with an innovative idea presented to it by Mr Roland Rich, who proposes that the Australian tax rules be amended to encourage companies to become directly involved in building private sector capacities in developing countries by allowing them to deduct from their taxable income the full costs incurred in providing such assistance. The committee recommends that the Australian Taxation Office, in conjunction with AusAID, consider and report on the merits and practicalities of Mr Rich's proposal. The committee noted the evidence presented to it of the importance to Pacific island economies of access to developed economies for seasonal workers and recommends an active and serious evaluation by the Australian government of the possibility of such a scheme. Another key theme to emerge throughout the inquiry was the need for strong peopleto-people links between Australians and Pacific islanders, not only for development reasons but also to promote a deeper understanding and better appreciation of our respective cultures. Concerns were raised by some that the people-to-people links between our nations-be they government-togovernment, business, civil society or educational-have reduced in recent years. However, the committee learnt that many opportunities for engagement exist and that these are increasing. For example, Australia is expanding its scholarship assistance through the Australian Scholarships Program and will double the total number of education awards offered to the region to over 19,000. Established schemes such as the AusAID Development Scholarships program and the Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development program are very highly regarded throughout the region. It is with these benefits in mind that the committee recommends that the Australian government consider establishing a Pacific island youth ambassador scheme similar to and possibly linked with the Australian youth ambassadors scheme or AusAID Development Scholarships, whereby young, skilled Pacific islanders can apply for placements in an Australian host organisation's workplace for the purpose of work experience and cultural exchange. It is the committee's view that an exchange such as this will build further personal contacts and boost cooperative networks in Australia and the Pacific. The committee also recommends that the stipend rate for scholarship recipients be regularly reviewed to ensure that the scholarship remains commensurate with the cost of living and is adequate for students with accompanying dependants. Aid and development is a complex area in which to work. The committee acknowledges the efforts of Australians seeking to make a difference in this field, be they AusAID officials or public servants seconded to the Pacific from other government departments and agencies such as the Attorney-General's Department, Customs, Defence and the Australian Federal Police; church groups; nongovernment organisations; academics; volunteers; or private citizens. All are collaboratdren, ing on a daily basis with counterparts in the Pacific, working towards common goals. In some parts of the region it is more a work in progress than in others, but their efforts to promote and enhance human rights and security in the region are something that Australians can be proud of and should continue to support. The committee heard that interventions like the Australian led Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands and the Enhanced Cooperation Program with PNG are welcomed, not just by the region's representative bodies like the Pacific Islands Forum-and RAMSI is very much a regional cooperation effort-but also by the majority of Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea citizens. This is testament to the good work that Australian personnel, particularly from the AFP, do at a local level to build trust and goodwill. I am grateful to all those who provided evidence to the committee. I thank my colleagues on the Human Rights Subcommittee who undertook the inquiry on behalf of the committee and the secretariat for their assistance. Mr Deputy Speaker, if I could have a moment's indulgence, as this is absolutely my final speech in the House, despite many people accusing me of being Dame Nellie Melba and of having multiple farewells. I would like to make one comment which time prevented me from making at the end of the valedictory speech to recognise the contribution that my wife has made to me. She is a psychologist-she often needs to be! In 43 years of marriage she has been my rock and my great support and I want to acknowledge that here. I would also like to acknowledge my children: Michael, who is now the member for Manly in the New South Wales parliament; his wife, Kerryn; and my grandchilLaura, Kate and Luke. Michael is certainly carrying on the flag of the Baird period in politics. He is also a good moderate lad and we hope that he upholds the true small ‘l' liberal traditions. I also acknowledge my daughter, Julia, who lives in New York with her husband, Josh, and their baby, Poppy; and my son Stephen and his partner, Anne Marie. Without them, it would not be possible to be here. They have been tremendous support. There is also my faith, which has been so important in these 20 years in politics. Thanks to all of you very much.",83
55,Mr SERCOMBE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-Our South neighbourhood is the region in the world where Australia has the capacity to contribute decisively to improving economic development prospects, social and political development and security. It is overwhelmingly in Australia's national interests to contribute decisively. This report from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I believe, makes a modest contribution to debate on appropriate ways forward on those national objectives. What is undoubtedly needed is focused energy and creativity in partnership with our land neighbours. What is not needed is hectoring and megaphone diplomacy. The recommendations in the report reflect the importance of some of the creative ideas but also the need now for detailed development of such ideas. The first recommendation relates to the importance of financial services in development, and particularly the importance of microfinance. The second recommendation deals with building private sector capacity in the region. It includes, as the member for Cook indicated, a recommendation for active consideration of an interesting proposal by Roland Rich, a former head of the Centre for Democratic Institutions at the Australian National University. The third recommendation notes the importance to Pacific island economies of access to developed economies for seasonal workers. This is vital to the region's development and to achieving stronger economic integration in the region. Of course, any such proposals would need to ensure that the interests of Australian workers were protected as well as avoid any prospect of exploitation of Pacific island workers. I am pleased in this context to note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, no less, at the recent Arthur Tange memorial lecture, said the government was closely monitoring the implementation Pacific of such a scheme in our neighbour New Zealand. The fourth recommendation deals with strengthening the Australian Development Scholarships scheme, a most important scheme on a number of levels, not least the so people-to-people connections that it builds within our Pacific region. The fifth recommendation deals with introducing some genuine reciprocity to the Australian youth ambassadors scheme, whereby Pacific island young people can be placed with Australian host organisations to gain work experience Pacific is- and cultural exchange. I believe the report, as I said, makes a modest contribution, but nonetheless an important one, to taking forward Australian debate on developing some of the creative ideas we need if in fact Australia, in its service of its own national interests-apart from doing the right thing by our neighbours-is going to act in the decisive way we need to in relation to our region and its potential. I commend the report to the House. I move: That the House take note of the report.",86

58,Mr BOWEN,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Due to the rather unusual concurrence of events this morning and the series of valedictory addresses, I will be indicating the Labor Party's position on the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 6) Bill 2007 from the position of second Labor Party speaker. Assent Labor will be supporting this bill. Schedule 1 provides a deduction for capital expenditure for the establishment of trees in carbon sink forests. Expenditure incurred in establishing trees in a carbon sink forest will be immediately deductible in the period 2007-08 to 2011-12. After this initial period, establishment costs will be deductible under a writeoff rate of seven per cent per annum for 14 years and 105 days. This provides a substantial encouragement for people to develop carbon sinks, and that is a worthy public policy outcome. The effective life of a forest is, of course, much longer than 14 years, so this write-off is very concessional to encourage the establishment of carbon sink forests. Carbon sink forests are forests which are established for the primary and principal purpose of sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. The carbon stored in the growing effect forest can then be used for greenhouse gas to levels of abatement purposes. Currently, the costs of establishing trees in carbon sink forests are not deductible. The bill amends the uniform capital allowance rules to allow a deduction for capital expenditure for the establishment of trees in carbon sink forests as long as certain conditions are met, including that, to claim the deduction, the taxpayer must be carrying on a business. The explanatory memorandum makes it very clear that the definition of ‘carrying on a business' is sufficiently broad to allow those businesses that wish to abate their own greenhouse gas emissions via a carbon sink forest to be eligible for the deduction even though that business may not directly involve the property in question. The primary and principal purpose of establishing the trees must be for carbon sequestration and cannot include the purposes of felling the trees or using them in commercial horticulture. However, this is flexible, so that a secondary purpose to the forest is allowed. That is a sensible caveat. The deduction is not available for expenditure on establishing trees in a carbon sink forest incurred by a managed investment scheme or a forestry managed investment scheme. As the House knows, because of the relevant debates, there are different schemes to cover those managed investments. The amount of the deduction is the amount of the expenditure incurred in establishing the trees. Expenditure on assets separate from the trees is not considered to be establishment expenditure. Examples of this include fencing, water facilities for the trees in the carbon sink forest, roads within the forest, and fire breaks. It is also sensible that the deduction applies only where the land used for the carbon sink forest was cleared before 1990 which is used as the base year for the Kyoto protocol. Unlike many members opposite, we on this side of the House take the issue of climate change seriously. We do acknowledge that it is happening-unlike some members opposite-and we certainly take it seriously in terms of a policy approach. Labor supports this measure as an environmental measure; however, this measure should certainly not be seen as a panacea. As the Australian Conservation Foundation said: Due to their impermanent nature, carbon sinks cannot permanently offset emissions from burning fossil fuels. Carbon sinks should only be tablished to replace vegetation where it has been lost from logging and clearing. The ACF do not oppose this measure, but they certainly do not see it as a panacea, and neither do we. Most importantly, it is also not an excuse for not doing more. And it is not an excuse for not signing Kyoto. It is not an excuse for not giving families more support to invest in renewables and make their homes more energy efficient. It is not an excuse for not investing more in renewables more generally. The government has been caught napping on climate change, and it is kidding itself if it thinks this bill is a huge step forward. It is a welcome step, but not a huge step. My colleague the member for Kingsford Smith and shadow minister for climate change will be speaking in this debate a little later after question time and he will further outline the Labor Party's position on some of the more detailed elements of schedule 1. Schedule 2 ensures grants under the Tobacco Growers Adjustment Assistance program to tobacco growers are tax free. Tobacco growers can receive up to $150,000 under the Tobacco Growers Adjustment Assistance program to assist them to exit the tobacco growing industry and move into alternative business activities. In 2006 legal tobacco production ceased in Australia, and the last state in which tobacco production ceased was Victoria. Licences to produce tobacco can only be issued by the Australian Taxation Office in the case where a grower has formal arrangements to sell tobacco to manufacturers and there are currently no licences on issue. Government grants paid to business to assist them to exit an industry are generally subject to capital gains tax. This bill lists the grant made under the Tobacco Growers Adjustment Assistance program 2006 as exempt from capital gains tax as long as the recipient esexits all agricultural enterprises for at least five years. The bill also lists the grant as exempt from income tax, to put beyond doubt that the grants are not taxable income. These measures ensure that these grants are tax free in the hands of the former tobacco farmers. Labor supports this as a sensible and worthwhile measure. Schedule 3 of the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to update the list of deductible gift recipients or DGRs. This schedule allows deductions for gifts to the Council for Jewish Community Security from 10 August 2007. The Council for Jewish Community Security was established to assist in the provision of security and protection tion for members and institutions of the Australian Jewish community. The date of 10 August on which this measure comes into force is a very significant one. It is the date that the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue issued his press release announcing the measure. As I recall-and I recall it quite well-it was a press release issued quite early in the morning. It also happened to be the day that the Leader of the Opposition, and the shadow minister for education, the member for Perth, released Labor's schools security policy. We know that the government received a tip-off that that announcement was coming and it was a cynical attempt to play catch-up that they announced their measure before we announced our schools security policy. Perhaps they thought that by whisking out a press release very early in the morning when the Leader of the Opposition was in the car on his way to announce Labor's schools security program that they would somehow derail our announcement. No wonder people are growing cynical about this government. After 11 years in office they whisk out a press release when they hear on the grapevine that the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Perth are in the car on their way down to make Labor's announcement. They had 11 years to deal with the issue and they did not deal with it until they knew that the opposition was about to make a very substantial announcement in this regard. Of course tax deductibility of these donations does not derail Labor's announcement; our announcement is quite separate from tax deductibility. There is a clear difference. The government believes that tax deductibility is enough. The government says that, if they make donations to the Council for Jewish Security tax deductible, that is their contributo this very important matter. We agree with tax deductibility. We violently disagree that it is enough. We violently disagree that this closes the matter. We support tax deductibility and our schools security project. We are prepared to give bipartisan support to tax deductibility and we call on the government to give bipartisan support to the schools security program. The schools security program does not of course deal only with Jewish schools but also with schools that are in a sensitive environment in relation to their security, and Jewish schools are a very prominent part of that subset. We have recognised that schools in the Jewish community and in other communities need more support to ensure their security. There is nothing more important than ensuring the security of young children at school. For parents of those children it is of course a vital matter and it is not one where they expect to see games being played like a press release being issued when the Leader of the Opposition is on his way to make an announcement. So we will support tax deductibility on a bipartisan basis because it is sensible and worthwhile. But if the government were serious they would in turn support Labor's schools security package or come up with their own or make some sort of other measure to fund independent schools that have issues with security. Labor's position is very clear: we support tax deductibility and we support the extra funding of $20 million in order to assist independent schools that have established security issues. This schedule also extends the DGR listing of Australia for UNHCR until 27 June 2012, which was established to raise funds for the work of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which safeguards the rights and well-being of refugees worldwide. Labor of course also supports this measure and wishes this organisation well. Finally, schedule 4 amends the Farm Management Deposit Scheme to align the tax laws with the guidelines for declaring either all primary producers in a geographical area, or specific classes of primary ducers within a geographical area, to be in exceptional circumstances. The Farm Management Deposit Scheme is designed to allow primary producers to set aside taxable primary production income in profitable years, to be withdrawn, usually in lower income periods, in order to deal with adverse economic events and seasonal fluctuations, and of course the drought. Deposits are tax deductible in the year they are made. When the farm management deposit is withdrawn the amount of deduction previously allowed is included in their assessable income in repayment year. To qualify for the tax deduction, farm management deposits cannot be withdrawn within 12 months of the deposit other than certain specific outlined circumstances. However the deposits can be withdrawn within 12 months if the farm is in an exceptional circumstances, or EC, area and the deposit was made prior to the area being EC declared. A minor inconsistency exists under the current law which denies eligible primary producers the tax benefits of a farm management deposit as a consequence of withdrawing their FMD early. Certain classes of primary producers in an area that has been declared in exceptional circumstances within 12 months may be denied the tax deduction because they withdraw from the deposit that was made when the area in which their farm is located was an EC area at the time of the deposit, even though the exceptional circumstances declaration did not apply to them because of their producer class. This amendment will remove this minor inconsistency to allow these farmers the tax benefits available under the FMD scheme. This minor amendment is in addition to the more substantial changes made earlier in the year in the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures proNo. 7) Bill 2007. That bill increased the threshold of non-primary production income from $50,000 to $65,000 and increased the deposit limit from $300,000 to $400,000 to allow more primary producers to become eligible for the FMD scheme. Labor supported that measure, as it supports this one, and it supports the other measures contained in this bill.",87
59,Mrs MIRABELLA,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 6) Bill 2007. The minutiae of tax laws do not usually bring a great the number of speakers from either side of the House rushing to speak, but in this instance I am particularly keen to make a contribution. I want to focus on schedule 2 of the bill, in which has a direct impact on a number of constituents in my electorate, which contains the last remaining significant tobacco growing area in Australia. This measure impacts significantly on very many families and individuals and, indeed, on a tradition and culture that is deeply rooted in the history of the north-east Victoria. The assistance package contained within this amendment, the Tobacco Grower Adjustment Assistance program, provides grants to help tobacco growers re-establish in alternative economic activities. The scheme assists tobacco growers to change careers following the effective closure of the industry in October 2006. Growers in north-east Victoria voted decisively in Myrtleford, at a meeting of the Tobacco Cooperative of Victoria, to cease growing tobacco and to accept a buyout of their existing contracts with tobacco manufacturers. That decision having been made, foreshadowed government assistance became available. The final vote, which was overseen by the Australian Electoral Commission, saw 118 growers vote in favour of exiting the industry, with 12 growers voting against, being a 91 per cent vote in favourwell in excess of the 66 per cent required under the constitution of the Tobacco Cooperative of Victoria. It was an extraordinary event. It was a very emotional time for many families, having grown tobacco for several generations-it being, as I have said, an integral part of the culture and identity of part of north-east Victoria. Sadly, many families had come to the realisation that there were many factors working against the industry. A significant factor was the escalation of professional crime gangs getting into illegal tobacco, more commonly known as ‘chop chop'. It had reached a point where the personal fear had become too much for many people. I empathise with those families. I understandobviously not as directly as they do-some of the pain and trauma that many of them went through in reaching this decision. The package is not intended to be a share buyout. As has been mentioned, grants are capped at $150,000. Similar impacts were felt by North Queensland growers and dependent communities when manufacturers ceased purchasing Queensland-grown leaf in 2004. The high capitalisation of tobaccospecific equipment has made it very difficult for many affected growers to re-establish alternative operations. The focus of the package is therefore on helping tobacco growers to move into alternative agricultural operations or other businesses. In turn, this will boost confidence in the many rural and regional communities that have traditionally been dependent on the tobacco-growing industry and associated industries and businesses. It will also complement other Australian government initiatives to reduce the trade in illegal tobacco. The $150,000 cap is higher than that available for other government rural assistance programs. For instance, the Sugar Industry Reform Program had a maximum grant of $100,000 and the government's Farm Help program has a maximum grant of $75,000. In addition, assistance under these packages is subject to an assets test that does not apply to the assistance available to tobacco growers. Usually this type of governthat ment assistance payment for those carrying on a business is treated as ordinary income under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 or as a bounty or subsidy under the same act. Farmers who give an undertaking to leave agriculture altogether and not become an owner or operator of an agricultural enterprise within five years of receiving the grant will be eligible for a tax-free grant. Those who remain in agriculture will find that their grant is assessable for income tax purposes. I advocated to change this, wanting to have all grants tax free, but being in a democracy and only one of 150 members in this House, I was unsuccessful. The government assistance to Victorian tobacco is on top of the $14 million provided to local growers by tobacco manufacturers as part of the buyout of their remaining two-year contracts. Recently we have heard news of the other possible major investment by an Albury company in the old tobacco cooperative storage sheds and buildings at Myrtleford, which may involve millions of dollars of investment and hundreds of jobs for the local community. That would be a great outcome for Myrtleford, which has gone through a difficult time not only with the effective closure of the tobacco industry but also with drought and fires. If this deal were to be clinched, it would be most welcome for the Myrtleford community and there would be a great sigh of relief. As anyone associated with the industry well knows, during my tenure I have worked extremely hard to try to keep it viable, eventually as an advocate, at the request of the cooperative, fighting for a fair compensation deal for growers. I have had the great pleasure of working with two extraordinary chairs of the Tobacco Cooperative of Victoria, the first being Angie Rigoni and the second being John Muraca. They are truly decent men of integrity, who worked hard, often against the odds, competing with forces beyond their control, on behalf of families who have grown tobacco for many generations. It has been my pleasure and privilege to have worked with them. I thank them for battling through, often putting up all sorts of threats and considerable difficulties-illegal aspects of the industry. Their families have been through a lot. I hope this assistance package will go some way to helping them move forward to exit the industry with some dignity, which was the main concern of the most recent chairman, John Muraca. The bill implements a very important measure which will benefit a significant number of former growers in my electorate. It will assist them to exit the industry with dignity. It will assist them to move on with their lives. I commend the bill to the House.",90
60,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I rise to speak briefly on the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 6) Bill 2007. As we appreciate, the bill goes to a number of matters but of most interest to me is the question of a tax deduction for capital expenditure for the establishment of trees in carbon sink forests, something which is dear to the heart of many members of this House-some more than others! I welcome the introduction of this long sought after scheme. In doing so, I indicate to the Australian community that the Howard government, as usual, has been tardy on the reform front with respect to this major requirement in terms of the greenhouse debate. I notice the Treasurer, Mr Costello, has had the guts to come to question time a bit early. He is not known for having much ticker. Perhaps he ought to sit down and learn his place-sitting behind the Prime Minister, playing second fiddle, as usual. He is pretty good at playing second fiddle. He has never had the ticker to seek the most sought after job in the land-being Prime Minister of the Australian nation. Returning to issues at hand",92

62,Dr NELSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I ask leave of the House to move a motion to suspend standing and sessional orders to enable me to move immediately a motion relating to a ministerial statement concerning the Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap. Leave granted.,92
63,Dr NELSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent: (1) the Minister for Defence making a ministerial statement immediately relating to the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap; and (2) the Minister for Defence presenting a copy of his statement, a motion being moved to take note of the document and an equal period of time for an Opposition Member speaking to the motion to take note of the document. I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on the important contribution that the Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap makes to defence and national security on the occasion of the facility's 40th anniversary. In doing I acknowledge the presence in the House of the US Ambassador to Australia, the Hon. Robert MCCallum. Since the 1940s, Australia has been part of a shared intelligence community with our allies, the United States, Great Britain, Canada and New Zealand. This cooperation has been of great benefit to Australia, as intelligence is a core element of our nation's security. Our relationships have given us access to all kinds of crucial information, as well as the expertise by which to interpret this information into useful intelligence. We have used this information and the capabilities of the facility to guide and develop our national security and defence policies and support Australian defence personnel on operations. Australia's intelligence relationship with the United States has been especially important in this regard. Through intelligence ing we have consolidated our defence relationship as much as through our combined military deployments and the conflicts of the 20th century, as well as those of the early years of this century. Much of our earlier intelligence cooperation was centred on Cold War issues and traditional concerns about potential threats to regional and global security from other nation states. But the events of 11 September 2001 and subsequent terrorist attacks in Bali, Jakarta, Madrid, Mumbai and London, to name a few, have redefined Australia's intelligence relationships. Counterterrorism is a global, generational challenge. Both Australia and the United States realise that greater international cooperation is required to combat a threat that goes beyond the boundaries of the nation state. Alongside this threat, some countries are today aggressively pursuing ballistic missile programs, weapons of mass destruction and, most worryingly in some cases, both. Australia remains a close friend so, and a strong ally of the United States, and we remain committed to our mutual security arrangements. Our intelligence relationship, already strong, has been reinforced over the past five years. This cooperation, which now borders on seamless, has seen an increase in information exchange, technical cooperation and embedded liaison officers. Consistent with my responsibilities as Minister for Defence, I have visited the Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap. I was very impressed by the contribution the facility makes to Australia's security, by the professionalism of the staff, both Australian and American, and by the arrangements between the Australian and the United States governments which allow the facility to function so effectively. I am fully briefed on the activities and capabilities of the facility and have every confidence in the arrangements that shar- govern the facilities activities. Due to the classified nature of the work performed at Pine Gap, it is necessarily the case that relatively few people are briefed on its functions and very few are briefed on the most sensitive activities that are undertaken there. It is therefore in the public interest that periodic public statements on the role and function of the facility are made. This is so the public can have confidence that its elected representatives are responsibly and accountably overseeing such activities which are, after all, in their name and are rendering that accountability in public within the limits of security. Construction of the Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap began in 1967 and, in recognition of the 40 years of outstanding contribution to our national security made by the facility, I consider it is timely to make such a statement. Before turning to the role and functions of the facility, I should acknowledge that not all Australians agree with its presence here. This is not a new phenomenon. During the Cold War some Australians were concerned about the risk of joint facilities, which prior to 1999 included the Joint Defence Facility Nurrungar at Woomera in South Australia and the North West Cape Naval Communication Station in Western Australia, being targeted by nuclear missiles. This was a risk that successive Australian governments have acknowledged in the process of supporting global security through the operation of the joint facilities. Other concerns over the years have related to the supposed loss of sovereignty caused by the presence of such facilities on Australian soil and our interaction with so-called US war-fighting systems. While these voices reached their zenith in the 1970s and 1980s, they still echo occasionally in Australian litical discourse, including test against the facility. While the views held by critics of the joint facility are to be respected, I could not disagree with them more strongly. The Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap is just that-a joint facility. It is not a US base. It is run by the governments of Australia and the United States as partners, and Australians hold crucial positions at the facility. I am particularly impressed by the application of Australia's policy of full knowledge and concurrence. ‘Full knowledge and concurrence' is an expression of sovereignty, of a fundamental right to know what activities foreign governments conduct on our soil. The people and parliament rightly hold the government responsible for exercising this right. It is through this policy that Australians ensure that our sovereignty is honoured and that we retain complete visibility of the facility's capabilities, and the Australians that hold those crucial positions at the facility ensure that our requirement for full knowledge and concurrence is maintained. The Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap continues to make a vital contribution to the security interests of both Australia and the United States of America and is an outstanding manifestation of the level of cooperation that has been achieved in Australia's closest defence relationship. The facility at Pine Gap has two principal roles: the collection of intelligence by technical means and the provision of ballistic missile early warning information. The intelligence collected at Pine Gap meets critical requirements of both our nations, providing us with information on priority intelligence targets such as terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and military and weapons developments. It also contributes to the monitoring of compliance with arms control and disarpo- mament agreements and provides communithe extent of procation support. The operations at Pine Gap continue to provide us with intelligence which is valuable to our own security. Through the relay ground station at Pine Gap, Australia supports the United States and its ballistic missile early warning program, thereby making a significant contribution to global security. The program provides reassurance against the possibility of surprise or accidental nuclear missile attack as well as early warning capability against shorter ranged tactical missiles. The program also provides information about the occurrence of nuclear explosions. Our participation in this program, therefore, in addition to contributing to global security, helps us to inhibit the proliferation of ballistic missiles and provides information on ballistic missile launches of interest to Australia. Ballistic missile launch early warning information could be used in any US missile defence system and, as such, this would be a continuation of a ballistic missile early warning partnership that we have shared with the United States for over 30 years. The capabilities present at Pine Gap will continue to evolve to meet new demands and to take advantage of new technologies. In that regard, our two nations will continue to have technical exchanges. Pine Gap will remain a central element of Australia's security and its relationship with the United States the foreseeable future. All activities at the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap are managed to ensure that they are consistent with Australian interests. These activities take place with the full knowledge and concurrence of the Australian government, and Australia benefits fully from them. Australia will continue to pursue its close intelligence relationship with the United States. Pine Gap remains a central element of the Australia-US alliance, and it continues to contribute to our security. The Australian government remains satisfied with the arrangements that govern the facility's use and warmly welcomes the continued involvement of the United States in the facility. On the 20th anniversary of the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap, I particularly pay tribute to the people of Alice Springs for their enduring support. I also thank all of those people, past and present, who have contributed to the facility's successful operafor tion and, through it, to Australia's alliance with the United States and to the mutual security of our two nations. I table a copy of the statement.",92
64,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That the House take note of the document.,95
65,Mr FITZGIBBON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Hunter) (2.10 pm)I thank the House for the opportunity to respond to the statement by the Minister for Defence on the important role that the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap plays in both Australia's national security and, of course, global security. Like the minister, I visited Pine Gap-an opportunity afforded to only a few, among them Kevin Rudd, Kim Beazley and the current foreign affairs spokesman on our side, Robert MCClelland. We have seen Australians and Americans working together, side for by side, in a joint determination to maintain peace and global order. Their work has never been more important. Big shifts in the distribution of global power, conflicts in Afghanistan and in the Middle East, tensions on the Korean peninsula and in the Taiwan Strait and the rise of radical Islamism are combining to make the work of the joint facility more critical than ever before. Australians were reminded of the democratic world's ongoing vulnerability to radical Islamism in the most horrific way on 11 September 2001 and later on when terrorists struck in London and Mumbai. And if they held any doubts about Australia's vulnerability, those doubts were removed by the tragic bombings in which our citizens were targets and victims in Bali and Jakarta. The minister noted that the existence of the joint facility does not enjoy the support of all Australians. That, of course, is true. But nothing did more to build public support the facility-and I do believe it enjoys strong public support-than the Hawke Labor government's changes to the facility's operating arrangements in 1988. Those changes reinforced the commitment of both governments to the facility and to our mutual and unwavering commitment to the Australia-US alliance, and they elevated Australia to partner status in the operation of the facilsure ity. I would like to acknowledge the role Kim Beazley played in the establishment of that key partnership-backed, of course, by the concept of full knowledge and concurrence. Pine Gap was born in 1966, as the minister indicated, but it really came of age under a Labor government in 1988. From that date, Pine Gap became the only such facility in the world in which non-Americans play such a critical operations role. Securing agreement on the changes would not have been easyindeed, they were hard won-and I pay tribute to the work of Kim Beazley in securing them. Kim shared an anecdote with me earlier today. Back in about 1990 he took the then US Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, to the facility. On their arrival they were met by a young woman whom I think Kim described as ‘quite good looking'. Within seconds, the young woman was giving the then Secretary of Defense and Mr Beazley an overview of the facility and an update on its operations. In response, Mr Cheney turned to Kim with a somewhat shocked look on his face and exclaimed: ‘But she's an Australian!' It underscores the importance of Australia's role and the partnership arrangements that are now in place at the facility. But Labor's reforms went beyond Pine Gap. They also ensured that when Nurrungar was closed the role of the Pine Gap facility was expanded to allow Australia to use the facility for our own unique purposes for the first time. But, despite the changes at the facility, some Australians continue to protest against its existence. That will probably always be the case. It is a shame that we cannot take every Australian to the facility to give them a broader knowledge of the role it plays in our own security and in global security. Of course, that is not possible, but I am that if it were possible there would be very few doubters left. On this 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Pine Gap facility, we celebrate its role in strengthening the Australia-US alliance and the great friendship our two peoples share. Debate (on motion by Mr Bartlett) adjourned.",95
66,The SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Before calling question time, I would remind all members that while there has been some latitude extended with valedictory speeches, standing order 64 is still on the books and I would ask all members to remember that they should refer to another by either the name of their seat or the title of their office. NA Housing Affordability",96
67,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister now familiarised himself with the Treasurer's comments made on 30 July regarding the housing affordability crisis and about which I asked the Prime Minister on Tuesday: Journalist: Do you concede that there is a housing crisis, affordability crisis in Australia at the moment? Treasurer: House prices are higher than they have been and they are higher than they have been because more people are in work and more people are able to afford to borrow to purchase more expensive housing. Journalist: So is there a crisis, Treasurer? Treasurer: Well, no. Does the Prime Minister agree with his Treasurer that there is no housing affordability crisis in Australia?",96
68,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The answer to the Leader of the Opposition is that I have familiarised myself with the Treasurer's statement. I thought it was a very accurate statement that the Treasurer made. What the Treasurer said was that you have a crisis when house prices fall.,96
69,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,97
70,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister has the call.,97
71,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are witnessing the beginnings of a housing crisis in sections of the United States. Those who sit opposite would be well to treat this issue more seriously than they are, because what is occurring in the United States does have the potential to cast a long shadow around the world. It does have the potential to have unintended consequences on credit levels in this country, and I think that at a time like this it behoves everybody to choose their language very carefully. It behoves those who sit opposite not to wish for a crisis that does not exist. I think that a lot of Australians who are wanting to buy their first home are finding it very difficult to do so. The reason they are finding it difficult to do so is that the cost of buying a first home has risen out of proportion to the increase in their wages. That is the fundamental reason why we have got a problem at the present time. Whereas with most other things that people buy the cost of them has not risen out of proportion to the rise in incomes, in the case of housing the cost of buying the first home has risen out of proportion to the increase in incomes. Therefore, in addressing this matter, it is important that we do not aggravate that gap, it is important that we do not widen that gap, and some of the remedies that are simply going to further push up the price of housing are not adequate responses. We need to tackle the supply side, and that is why the Treasurer is focused on having an audit of land. Mr Crean interjecting",97
72,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hotham! Mr Crean interjecting,97
73,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham is warned!,97
74,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We need to look at local government development charges, we need to look at state government taxes, but the last thing we need is to resort to cheap language which is designed to scare people and to create a situation that is worse than the situation that is facing some young Australians. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that a true housing crisis in this country is when there is a sustained fall in the value of our homes and in house prices. For the Leader of the Opposition to use careless language is only aggravating rather than helping the situation. Water",97
75,Mr FAWCETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister inform the House about water availability and contingency planning in the southern Murray-Darling Basin? What does this mean for a truly national approach to managing our water resources?,97
76,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. I am very sorry to inform the House that the fourth Murray-Darling Basin contingency planning report confirms the very parlous state of water in the southern Murray-Darling. Water availability is at seriously low levels and is deteriorating further. Irrigation allocations are still at either zero or extremely low, the inflows into storages are at record low levels, and there is significantly less water stored today than at an equivalent time last year. The horticultural and other water dependent industries are, needless to say, the hardest hit of all; and there is now, tragically, a high risk of losses of permanent plantings. This contingency planning report, which has come from the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, recommends that governments in the basin states and, of course, the federal government consider additional measures. One of the measures recommended in the latest report is the possibility of a reserve critical needs. I have sought the agreement of the relevant state premiers-the premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia-and the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory to a joint statement releasing the report. I am pleased to say that the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Iemma, the Premier of South Australia, Mr Rann, and the Chief Minister of the ACT, Mr Stanhope, have all agreed to the release of that report under a joint statement. To date, the Victorian Premier has indicated he is not willing to agree, despite the fact that I gave him assurances on the reserve, including that the officials of the relevant jurisdictions would be fully consulted about the implementation of any recommendations. I would like to appeal to the Victorian Premier: I would like to ask him to adopt the same attitude as has been adopted by Mr Iemma, Mr Rann and Mr Stanhope. This is not a case of a Liberal Prime Minister attacking a Labor state Premier because, on this occasion, the Liberal Prime Minister and the Labor premiers of New South Wales and South Australia and the Labor Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory are all singing from the same hymn sheet. This is not an occasion for state parochialism; this is an occasion for total cooperation. We are dealing here with a genuine crisis. There is a water shortage crisis in the Murray-Darling Basin. Crisis is not an exaggerated word to use in relation to this water situation, and those of my colleagues who represent horticultural districts of Australia, people like the minister for employment services, the member for Mallee-I could give you a great long list-the member for Riverina and the member for Farrer understand the parlous state of people whose livelihoods are derived from the Murray-Darling Basin. If it is not the inappropriate word to use, I plead with the Victorian Premier to take the for national approach that has been taken by Mr Iemma, Mr Rann and Mr Stanhope. I would like to ask him to reconsider. I would like to invite him to talk to me, to Mr Iemma, to Mr Rann and to Mr Stanhope. The situation is far worse than any of us would have hoped a few months ago. We all thought when there was some rain in June that the drought might break and the Murray-Darling might be saved. Tragically, that has not occurred and the last thing we should have at the moment is any kind of selfish state parochialism. We will solve this only as Australians and we have to share the pain as Australians and not behave like Victorians, South Australians, Queenslanders or New South Welshmen. It is too important for that, and I would ask the Victorian Premier to reconsider his position. I am going to release the contingency report immediately so that the Australian people and, most particularly, those of our fellow Australians who are most sorely afflicted by this crisis can make judgements for themselves as to what is required in a cooperative spirit to tackle a very real crisis faced by the food bowl of the nation. Water",97
77,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and refers also to the water crisis in the Murray-Darling Basin. Does the Prime Minister agree that the Commonwealth has a responsibility to put the national interest first and help resolve the issue of the overallocation of water entitlements in the Murray-Darling Basin? Does the Prime Minister agree that water is overallocated in the Murray-Darling Basin? Why did the Prime Minister give written approval on 25 March 2007 for the auctioning of 8,000 megalitres of water entitlements for the Warrego River? Does the Prime Minister's approval still stand?",98
78,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will take that question in two parts. Firstly, do I believe there is overallocation? Yes, I do, and that is why we proposed a $10 billion plan. The whole purpose of that plan was twofold. It was to reduce loss of water by piping and lining the irrigation channels, and that was going to account for about $6 billion, and about $3.5 billion was going to be used to fund the buyback of overallocated water. If we had received the cooperation we should have received from the Victorian government, then we would be further advanced towards that goal today than what we are. In relation to the second question, the decision as to whether an auction will go ahead in relation to the Warrego is ultimately a decision of the Queensland government. I have indicated to the Queensland Premier that she should not go ahead with the auction in light of the recfor ommendations contained in the CSIRO report, and I drew her attention to that report two weeks ago. Problem Gambling",99
79,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Treasurer, is the Australian government concerned about the spread of poker machines and the effect of problem gambling on Australian families and individuals? Is there anything that can in fact be done to help curb this growing social problem?",99
80,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question and I can tell him that the Australian government is concerned about the spread of poker machines in Australia. In fact, we were so concerned about it that we commissioned an inquiry by the Productivity Commission, which reported in 1999 that there are 130,000 problem gamblers in Australia, 160,000 at risk and another 500,000 to 1,000,000 people affected by problem gamblers. Problem gamblers account for 33 per cent of the industry revenue in relation to poker machines. Let me say that again: problem gamblers account for one-third of the revenue that comes through Australia's poker machines. On a per capita basis, Australia has roughly five times as many gaming machines as the United States, and those who are losing money tend to be those with lower incomes. The Productivity Commission found there is an inverse relationship between income levels and the density of gaming machines-that is, the higher the income, the less the density of gaming machines in a particular neighbourhood, and the converse applies. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in 2004-05 all gambling activity was estimated to be at $15.4 billion, but poker machines in clubs and pubs accounted $8.7 billion or 56.3 per cent of gambling revenues in Australia. I noticed that recently the Leader of the Opposition also expressed his concern about poker machines and his regret at being part of the Queensland government's decision to introduce them when he was working for the Queensland government. It is a matter of concern the way in which state governments in the late eighties-early nineties embraced poker machines, seeing them as an easy way of generating tax revenue and not looking at the social consequences that were involved. So I welcome the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has changed his position in relation to poker machines and I look forward to getting bipartisan support for the government's position in relation to this social ill. As a consequence of the Productivity Commission inquiry, the Australian government set up a Commonwealth-state ministerial forum to deal with those areas recommended by the Productivity Commission on consumer protection, counselling and research, and reform to regulatory governance. The Ministerial Council on Gambling comprises both the Commonwealth and the states and, at the Commonwealth leadership, has now agreed on a national framework to respond to problem gambling. We look forward to cooperation from the states in relation to that matter. In some areas there have been positive steps, such as warnings in relation to gambling for people who might be problem gamblers and an increase in counselling services for those who suffer from this addiction. It is the Commonwealth's view that more can be done, particularly in restricting the availabilof ity of ATMs in venues where there are poker machines. The ATM represents a real temptation for a problem gambler who may have come with a fixed sum of money, gone through it, and now finds it easy to go to the ATM to continue their addiction. We would ask all of the states to cooperate with the Commonwealth in its active program to deal with this scourge, an area where the Commonwealth has taken leadership even though it has no legislative power. We would ask all of the states to cooperate in dealing with this matter. Let me say, in conclusion, there is no reason why Australia would need more poker machines. At the moment we have high level of poker machines in this country. There is no reason why we need any more and no reason for any state government whatsoever to believe that the introduction of keno or other forms of interactive gambling could actually add to the social cohesion in our country. We ask those state governments that are contemplating such a move not to go ahead with it.",99
81,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources and relates to a recent announcement of $6½ million from the Australian government water fund towards a $29 million upgrade of Chaffey Dam in my electorate. Given that the Deputy Prime Minister declared that the funding was a done deal and not an election promise, how does the minister explain comments in today's Financial Review, where his office states in relation to Chaffey Dam: ... there were hurdles to clear before the commonwealth funding could proceed. His office also stated that the project needed to be ‘consistent with the principles of the National Water Initiative and the objectives the National Plan for Water Security'. Could the minister explain these inconsistencies between his office's statements and Mr Vaile's announcements? Could the minister guarantee to the people of Tamworth that the upgrade will proceed?",100
82,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The Deputy Prime Minister's announcement on 3 September to contribute $6½ million to the Chaffey Dam augmentation project will improve water supply security for Tamworth and Peel Valley irrigators. It is important for the honourable member to remember that the funding is provided through the Australian government water fund, which is administered by the National Water Commission. It is contingent, as is all funding through the water fund, on the National Water Commission being satisfied with the business plan and being satisfied that the project is shown to be consistent with the National Plan for Water Security, the National Water Initiative and the Australian government's environmental standards. The dam expansion will undoubtedly be Water referred for consideration as a controlled action under the EPBC Act, so that is an environmental permitting hurdle that it has to meet. The funding is also contingent on the New South Wales government and other stakeholders meeting their agreed funding shares. I am optimistic that those conditions can be met, but they are in large measure in the hands of other people. The honourable member must understand that all water funding out of the Australian government water fund has to meet these or similar conditions. Taxation",100
83,Mr HARTSUYKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer, a man who understands tax policy, unlike the Leader of the Opposition. Would the Treasurer inform the House of the importance of good tax policy to the Australian economy? Is the Treasurer aware of any alternative proaches?",101
84,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question. I wish him well in the forthcoming election against the trade union candidate that the Labor Party is running against him. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The minister is misleading House. That is not true.",101
85,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member will resume his seat. That is not a point of order.,101
86,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Cowper. There is a 70 per cent chance that, if you are running in the next election, the Labor Party candidate will be a trade union official of one kind or another. I wish him all the best in his election activity. Australia's tax scales are 15 per cent, 30 per cent, 40 per cent and 45 per cent. They compare to the Labor Party's tax scales when it left office of 20 per cent, 34 per cent, per cent and 47 per cent. Not only have all the tax rates come down but, because thresholds have increased-for example, under LaborMr Danby interjecting",101
87,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Melbourne Ports asks me: ‘What were they?' Under Labor, your first dollar over $50,000 was taxed at 47c in the dollar. No wonder the member for Melbourne Ports interjects. Yes, it is true. It was taxed at 47c in the dollar for each dollarMr Danby interjecting",101
88,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne Ports will not respond. I warn the member for Melbourne Ports!,101
89,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Melbourne Ports interjects again. Let me remind him: under the Labor Party, you were taxed at 47c in the dollar for each dollar over ap- $50,000. Under the coalition, once you go over $50,000 you will not be taxed at a marginal tax rate higher than 30 per cent. That is real tax reform, and it is real tax reduction. Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition was asked to name the tax rates and the tax thresholds. He was unable to name a single tax rate. He was unable to name the 15 per the cent rate. Was he able to name the 30 per cent rate? Government members-No!",101
90,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was he able to name the 40 per cent rate? Government members-No!,101
91,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was he able to name the 45 per cent rate? Government members-No!,101
92,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was he able to name any rate? Government members-No!,101
93,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What he named was a 43 threshold that does not exist. The spin merchants of the Labor Party yesterday were saying: ‘ Mr Rudd's office said he had made a mistake. He was just $5,000 out, not the $25,000 the government claimed.' He was $25,000 out-but that is not the point. The point is that he did not know a single rate, let alone a threshold. Enter stage right, the member for Lilley. The member for Lilley had another explanation as to why the Leader of the Opposition should be excused. Have a listen to this: the member for Lilley was asked this morning: ... don't you need to know where you're going from to where you're going to? That is not bad. The member for Lilley said: We absolutely know where we're going to, because you see, we authored the current tax cuts that are in the system. Listen to this: Eighty-five cents in every dollar of tax cuts in this year's Budget were authored by the Labor Party. Blow me down! When I wrote that budget speech, I did not realise my hand had been overcome by the Labor Party. It is getting pretty spooky, isn't it? My budgets are now being authored by the Labor Party. If I really believed that, I would stand down. But it gets even spookier. Members will know that the Leader of the Opposition specialises in asking himself questions and giving the answers. The reason he specialises in asking himself questions is that they are the only ones he can answer. He got on Today Tonight last night and he said: “Someone asked me the other day ‘Who do you model yourself on?”‘ And I said, ‘Ah... Kevin'. I'm just me.” That is pretty spooky because now he is modelling himself on himself. Last year he was modelling himself on Dietrich Bonhoeffer. But he has found an even better role model now. ‘Move aside Dietrich. I am now modelling myself on myself,' he says. He is now authoring tax rates that he does not know exist. He is now auditioning for a job that he is not up to. That is the most important point: he is authoring, auditioning, for a job that he is not up to. He has not done the work, he does not understand the economy and he is not ready to be a leader in Australia.",101

Can the Prime Minister assure the House that the government or the Liberal Party has not engaged private investigators or forensic accountants to examine the private affairs of Labor members or candidates? Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is an outrageous smear masquerading as a question, and it should be ruled out of order. They have no evidence.

98,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very happy to answer the question. I can provide an absolute assurance of a number of things that I certainly had nothing to do with. I was not aware of these things. I can provide an absolute assurance to the House that I had absolutely nothing to do with this. I am not aware of where it came from. I am not aware of any suggestion that it came from any member of my party. I am not aware of any suggestion that it came from any member of my government. I regard the question as contemptible. I believe that the member for Jagajaga has deliberately asked this question to generate a false view that my party and my government are responsible for smearing the Leader of the Opposition. Let me make a couple of things very clear to the member for Jagajaga. The first thing I would make clear is that I wish the Leader of the Opposition a long and healthy life in his current job. That is the first thing that I wish the Leader of the Opposition. I have never observed, in the Leader of the Opposition's demeanour, any suggestion that he has other than robust health. My argument with the Leader of the Opposition is not in relation to matters of individual physical fitness. I have no doubt about his physical fitness, any more than he should have any doubt about my physical fitness. My argument with the Leader of the Opposition is about his lack of credibility for the job he aspires to concerning matters quite unrelated to his health. I have never raised his health. I have never asked anybody to raise his health. I think it is a piece of contemptible smearing by the member for Jagajaga to raise this. Everyone knows a question is not asked in this House without the authority of the leader. I regard this question as Kevin Rudd's question. I do not regard this question as Jenny Macklin's. This question was authored by the Leader of the Opposition. I know exactly what has happened. The Leader of the Opposition had a bad day at the office yesterday. They have decided that the retaliation is to spear my party. Can I say very directly, through you, Mr Speaker, that there has been no engagement of private investigators. That is an absolute, contemptible falsehood. There has been no engagement of private investigators. At no stage has any conduct of any kind designed to smear the Leader of the Opposition on the basis of his lack of good health been encouraged, counselled, sought or in any way procured by me. I would reject any attempt to do so. I can beat the Leader of the Opposition without resorting to smears.",102

103,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the deputy Prime Minister inform the House how the government's plans for infrastructure are helping to improve our roads and to keep motorists safe, particularly in my electorate of Blair?",103
104,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Blair for his question-a real question about a real issue that is of interest to Australians, particularly in regional Australia. That is, what the government is doing in terms of the deployment of the prosperity in this country to improve infrastructure, particularly in regional Australia, to the benefit of all Australians. The member for Blair would be well aware of the significant commitment of, and the appropriate decisions that are being taken by, the government in investing in that infrastructure. In the budget this year $22.3 billion was allocated across a range of infrastructure programs, many of which are helping the constituents in the electorate of Blair, ably represented by the current member for Blair and the interest he takes in their well-being. I mentioned yesterday one major piece of infrastructure that the government took a very long-term strategic view about. It took leadership to take a decision to invest $2.3 billion in the Goodna bypass. There are other very important roads that we are funding across the nation. We took a decision to go straight to local government to provide funding to local roads because the states were failing in their responsibility to support local roads. Under the very popular Roads to Recovery program, we are delivering significant amounts of money to local government and helping local people in their local communities to make their roads safer and more efficient. To one project in particular in the member's electorate, we have contributed $1 million towards the replacement of the Three Mile Bridge, which provides very important access to Amberley RAAF base in the member's electorate. It might be a small project but it is a very important project to that community. That circumstance is replicated right across Australia. We took a decision in 2001-and something that this government has always been able to do is take decisions when they are required-to allocate $307 million a year to local government across Australia. As of 2009, going through till 2014, that will grow to $350 million a year in the Roads to Recovery program. Since we were elected in 1996, we have maintained the roads funding Black Spot Program, which was axed by the Labor Party, the former Labor government, and which has been incredibly important to local communities, like those in the electorate of Blair, across Australia. That Black Spot Program over that period of time is estimated to have saved at least 130 Australian lives on the roads and saved 6,000 serious accidents, and it has upgraded 4,200 dangerous sites on local roads in every small community across Australia. It has been funded at $45 million a year and we are going to increase it to $60 million a year directed into local communities across Australia. The member asked about any threats to this and alternative policies. We know that the member for Batman has said: ‘We support the AusLink funding. We want to see it go ahead.' Well, that is a good thing, but that is contrary to what the Leader of the Opposition has announced, in that he wants to have another inquiry. He wants to set up another bureaucracy. It is actually review No. 37 out of 97, the national infrastructure audit. We have been through all of this process. We have identified what needs to be done in Australia. We are getting on with doing it. We have got the wherewithal to do it. We are funding it out of budget surpluses, not out of debt and deficit in this country, and that is the hallmark of our government. We are a government of action; the Labor local government would be a government of inaction, choked up with reviews and inquiries into what needs to be done in the country. Strong leadership is about making decisions where and when they are needed. Weak leadership is about having more inquiries and more reviews. Liberal Party",103

I refer to an article which appeared in the Australian on 27 June 2007 concerning the purchase of Kevin Rudd's and Therese Rein's family home in Brisbane. Is the Prime Minister aware that this article states: Liberal Party figures in Queensland, including a forensic accountant, have been examining the purchase, and the links between the vendors and the Labor Party's investment companies, for several months.

114,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can certainly assure the House that I have not set out to do any of the things suggested by the opposition, nor to my knowledge have any of my parliamentary colleagues. I can also inform the House that, since the question authored by the Leader of the Opposition was asked by the member for Jagajaga, I have been informed by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party that he is not aware of, nor has he been in any way responsible for, the appointment of any private investigators to investigate the affairs of the Leader of the Opposition. He has authorised me to say that on behalf of the Liberal Party organisation and he is prepared to publicly refute the allegations the Leader of the Opposition is not prepared to make even under parliamentary privilege. NA",105
115,Mr COSTELLO,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition detailing to the House his smear allegation against the Prime Minister, the Liberal Party and the Government.",105
116,Mr COSTELLO,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,Is it accepted? Opposition members-No.,105
117,Mr COSTELLO,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"Not accepted. I then move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition detailing to the House his smear gation against the Prime Minister, the Liberal Party and the Government. I have moved to suspend the standing and sessional orders so that the Leader of the Opposition can come to this dispatch box now and, with his own mouth, make the allegations that he is putting through the member for Jagajaga and through the member for Grayndler, which he does not have the decency to put himself. You cannot come into this place and sit there and pretend you have nothing to do with what is going on. You cannot come into this place and turn your back and studiously write nothing on a piece of paper and pretend that those who are getting up around you have nothing to do with you. I have an unfortunate fact for the Leader of the Opposition: these are your team. These are your people; they work on your instructions. As anybody who has been around this place long enough knows, nobody can come to the dispatch box on the opposition side and ask a question unless the Leader of the Opposition authorises them to do so. It is absolutely inconceivable that the member for Jagajaga could have walked to this dispatch box, could have put a slur on the Prime Minister, could have put a slur on the government, could have put a slur on the Liberal Party, except that she was authorised to do so by Kevin Rudd, the Leader of the Opposition. As for this saintly persona, that he is some kind of pale imitation of Dietrich Bonhoeffer-that just makes the fraud worse, frankly. To hide behind this saintly image, when you are prepared to have other people go out and do your dirty work for you, actually makes the fraud worse. So what are the allegations that are now being put by Kevin Rudd, the Leader of the Opposition, against the Prime Minister? The first insinuation and allegation that has been put is that somehow the Prime Minister, the allegovernment or the Liberal Party put out a story in relation to his health. Aside from wishing him a long life, which I am sure we all do, nobody on this side of the parliament has any interest at all in his medical conditions. I have no more interest in his medical conditions, or any of his frontbenchers' medical conditions, than I hope they have interest in my medical conditions.",105
118,Unknown,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,Opposition members interjecting,106
119,Mr COSTELLO,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"Oh? You do have great interest, do you? I would have thought that was a smear, was it not? Perhaps you could go and talk to people about it. But we find out, do we not, on the Channel 7 news today-and Channel 7 would know about this-that Smith, who I believe to be Stephen Smith, was out there quoted today, according to the news report, saying: There was no need to dig dirt. Kevin Rudd revealed he had a transplant three and a half years ago on Seven Sunrise.",106
120,Unknown,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,Opposition members interjecting,106
121,Mr COSTELLO,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"All right, it wasn't this Smith-it was another Smith. I take it back; it must have been a reporter-it was a Smith, certainly, because I have the transcript-who said: There was no need to dig dirt. Kevin Rudd revealed he had a transplant three and a half years ago on Seven Sunrise. So, far from this being a great secret, who in fact had revealed this piece of information? None other than the Leader of the Opposition himself! And when it becomes public, who does he try and frame up and fit up with the allegation? None other than the Prime Minister, the Liberal Party and the government. To think that the government would bother itself with a medical condition that occurred many years ago. He is on political life support; he is not on medical life support. Here we were yesterday when he showed himself to be an ignoramus on tax policy. He cannot name a single rate; he cannot name a single threshold. He has been humiliated in the House of Representatives. And so what would be the logical thing for the government to do? Try and knock that story off the evening news bulletins with an old story about a heart condition? Who in their right mind would think about doing this? Who in their right mind might have the motivation to knock that story off the evening news? I was very surprised myself to see that this story came up last night and knocked the tax story down the batting order on Channel 9. We had the Leader of the Opposition sitting there giving one of his serious exclusives to Oakes in relation to the medical condition. All right, the medical condition came out night-but to say that the government would have spiked its own story by putting that out yesterday beggars belief. Let us ask: what possible motivation would there have been? If you don't want to look at motivation, let me say what the facts are: the government had nothing to do with that, the Liberal had nothing to do with that and the Prime Minister had nothing to do with that. To come in here and put up the member for Jagajaga to try and make that insinuation is low, base politics and it tells us something about the low, base nature of the Leader of the Opposition. Just in case you thought this was not a planned tactic today, we then had the old member for Grayndler, old Mr Dirty Tricks himself, come to the dispatch box. He comes out with this article that was in the Australian some time ago-June, I think it was. Was he so concerned about it in June that he got up and asked a question when it was in the Australian? He has been asking about it every day since June, has he? Did he ask about it on Tuesday? Did he ask about it on Wednesday? So concerned about that article in June, he was, that he just happens to get up in a coordinated way, with the member for Jagajaga, and he says, ‘Poor old Kevin'-poor old Kevin has been subject to a bit of search and scrutiny in relation to his private affairs. I can tell you: I have been in public life for 17 years, I have been the Treasurer for 11 years, and it is not a new thing to have scrutiny of your personal lifeit is not a new thing. Mr Speaker, if you think somebody looking at your financials is a new thing, I do not think you were in this House when Gareth Evans got up and attacked my wife for owning shares. I do not think you were in the House when that happened. I do not think Laurie you were in the House when Alexander Downer's wife was attacked. I do not think last you were in the House when Paul Keating attacked Sir Alexander Downer as being some kind of war coward, although he had been a POW in Changi during the Second World War. Oh, boy, we have seen some attacks in this House over the years! We have seen some personal attacks. The Leader of Party the Opposition, far from having personal attacks, has probably had the easiest run from the media as a Leader of the Opposition in a very long period of time. It has been an easy run but, at the first sign, he shows himself to be extremely fragile and extremely touchy. He is willing to try to impeach the reputation of other people in order to make a political point. This is not the character nor the behaviour of somebody who is ready to take tough decisions if he ever gets into a position of responsibility in this country. This is not the position of someone who wants to talk about policy. This is the last question time",106

When it comes to the whole question of negative smear tactics, why are these matters raised in the parliament? In the last 24 hours, we have had the extraordinary spectacle of the chief of staff of the Special Minister of State engaging in a campaign of personal smear and innuendo against the Labor candidate for Eden-Monaro, Colonel Mike Kelly. His curriculum vitae describes what he has done, including being deployed to Somalia with Operation Restore Hope, and Legal Adviser, First Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment Battalion Group.

Over there we have them carrying on as if offended by the allegation that they put together dirt files, as if offended by the allegation that they go after members of this parliament personally, when the evidence is there for all to see. Let us listen to the evidence. We have spent this week hearing about how a government staff member, a chief of staff to a minister, made one of the most repulsive allegations you can make against another human being-that is, to compare them to a Nazi, to someone who administered a concentration camp where thousands of people died. When we first raised that in this parliament, what action or what answer did we get from the Howard government? Not an answer about immediate action, not an answer about revulsion, not an answer about how they were disgusted by that remark-no. On the first occasion the minister walked to the dispatch box, he squirmed and said absolutely nothing. Then, on the second occasion he walked to the dispatch box, he obviously thought better of it and sought to distance himselfever so softly-from the remark. Of course, his chief of staff had been out that morning basically carrying on and justifying himself. It took absolutely hours for this matter to finally end up in an apology from the staff member involved and still, of course, no Howard government minister-not one of them-has taken any meaningful action about this matter. Then on the matter that the Leader of the Opposition referred to, which dealt with me, what we know, on the public record, is that a journalist, Jason Koutsoukis, was invited down to a meeting in a ministerial suite for the purpose of being supplied with a file with my name on it which had been trawled through the press gallery as a dirt file.

Are you going to make sure you find out the truth about that? That is all right, is it? Your little moral outrage only goes so far and under the moral outrage on the surface there is all of this unseemly conduct going on underneath that you avert your eyes from but you know is occurring-you must know is occurring. So do not come into this parliament with a holier-than-thou attitude when, beneath this modicum of moral outrage on the surface, underneath we have the trawling, the dirt and the carry-on. We come to question time in this parliament and we ask questions for the purpose of getting answers. What do we routinely see from ministers in this government? We see evasion and we see personal attacks. Indeed, the only thing some government ministers do in this place during question time is make personal attacks-the only thing they do. When they are asked questions by their own backbench about government policy, they are lucky if there are two or three words about government policy and the rest of it is personal attack.

The point of order is: I would ask you rule on the meaning of the term ‘without interruption' in the motion. Does this mean that the Prime Minister is able to make any accusation, any claim, without the right of a member to make a point of order or to demand a withdrawal? Is that the meaning of the term ‘without interruption' in this motion-to protect him from the kind of the treatment that the Leader of the House put out to the Leader of the Opposition while he was speaking?",115

I invite you to rule as to the meaning of the phrase ‘without interruption' that has just been passed by the House, as to whether that means that if the Prime Minister makes any accusation against a member that member is unable to respond and if the Prime Minister makes any claim nobody can raise a point of order.

197,Mr HOWARD,NOES,"I know it seems quite a long time ago but this issue started when the member for Jagajaga asked me a question, which we all know was more an accusation than a question. What in effect the member for Jagajaga was doing, presumably with the authority of the Leader of the Opposition, was alleging that either I or, with my knowledge, members of the government had raised issues about the physical health of the Leader of the Opposition. That is how it started. By any measure, by any use of the English language, an accusation of that kind in the absence of evidence supporting it represents about the basest possible smear that can be made in this place. That is why we decided to move a motion inviting the true author of that base accusation to substantiate to the parliament why he believed that I or members of my government were responsible for smearing him in relation to his health. Can I say this, through you, Mr Speaker, to the Leader of the Opposition: as an individual I bear him no malice. I do not wish him well politically but I wish him no harm on a personal basis, nor do I wish him other than a long and healthy and happy life as an individual. I would suggest that any Australians in the gallery that may be listening to this debate are, frankly, if I can put it more interested in the health of their nation than they are in the health of either the Leader of the Opposition or me.

Not a bad point! I might say rhetorically in reply: why on earth therefore did the Leader of the Opposition waste a question through the mouth of the member for Jagajaga about a smear instead of asking me a question about the policy of the government?

206,The SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The Deputy bluntly, Leader of the Opposition is warned!",116
207,Mr HOWARD,NOES,He had a very bad day: he couldn't answer the most simple question about taxation. Then we have questions raised in the parliament about that issue and then we go on to the evening news bulletins and out of the blueMr MCMullan interjecting,116
208,The SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The member for Fraser is warned!,116
209,Mr HOWARD,NOES,"I have to say I was totally surprised to turn on the Channel 9 news. I was expecting Laurie Oakes to have a concoction of the Rudd gaffe on tax and some of the byplay and exchange in relation to the remarks made by the chief of staff of the Special Minister of State. I thought that would be the Oakes package, and I thought to myself, ‘Well, I hope there's more of Rudd's mistake'-I'll be honest about it‘than there is about the other issue,' and I think you would understand why I would say that. Then quite out of the blue we have this astonishing thing, this reference to the Leader of the Opposition's health. Isn't that interesting? Mr Costello interjecting",117
210,Mr HOWARD,NOES,"Yes, with an exclusive. But isn't that coincidental? As the Treasurer rightly said, why on earth would we spike our own story? If I were a suspicious person-and I am not; I think charitably towards the Leader of the Opposition in relation to these matters-I would say to myself, ‘Well, I don't think that story has come from our side of politics; I think that story may have come from another side of politics.' I am not normally a suspicious person but I may well have thought that. But let me take this opportunity of saying we are not interested in smearing the Leader of the Opposition as an individual; we never have been. What the Labor Party has endeavoured to do all of this year is to construct in the minds of the Australian people the belief that any attack on the Leader of the Opposition is a personal smear of the Leader of the Opposition, that you are not allowed to criticise the Leader of the Opposition, that he is the one political leader in Australian history who we are not entitled to question or we are not entitled to attack.

212,Mr HOWARD,NOES,"He keeps coming out in the press and he says there is going to be a mother of all fear campaigns. I can tell the Leader of the Opposition that we will be telling the Australian people, when the election campaign starts, of the danger of electing a union dominated government. We will be telling the Australian people of the danger to good government in this country of having a Labor government federally as well as a Labor government in power in each of the states and the territories. Mr Swan interjecting",117
213,The SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The member for Lilley is warned!,117
214,Mr HOWARD,NOES,"We will be telling the Australian people that it is not a good thing to place the management of the Australian economy in the hands of inexperienced people who do not, for example, understand our taxation system at a time when international storm clouds are threatening the stability of the international economy. This, more that at any time over the last five years, is a time for the Australian economy to be in strong, experienced hands, in the hands of people who understand how to withstand the ravages of international economic buffeting. The Leader of the Opposition would say to the Australian people: ‘Oh, they can't say that about me. It's a smear.' Could I remind the Leader of the Opposition that he has only been in politics since 1998 and a number of us have been in politics for a long time. If he imagines that what has been said about his lack of experience, what has been said about his knowledge deficit in relation to taxation and what has been said about his glass jaw represent a personal attack and a personal smear, can I say to the Leader of the Opposition, through you, Mr Speaker: you haven't been born.

215,The SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The member for Melbourne is on very thin ice.,118
216,Mr HOWARD,NOES,I remember the day my predecessor pointed at Alexander Downer-I have never forgotten it-and accused his father of being part of the appeasement brigade in the late 1930s and called into question the courage of a man who spent four years as a prisoner of war of the Japanese on the Burma-Thailand railway.

217,The SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The member for Gellibrand is warned!,118
218,Mr HOWARD,NOES,"And yet the Labor Party sat there and they were perfectly happy to have that. I can remember the Leader of the Opposition jumping up when his predecessor but one-Mark Latham-used one of the most vulgar expressions I have ever heard used in this parliament about a female journalist, and we all know what I am referring to. I remember the deafening silence of the Leader of the Opposition. I remember the deafening silence of all the female members of the Australian Labor Party-not one of them got up to condemn that foul insinuation about Janet Albrechtsen. I also remember the deafening silence of the Leader of the Opposition when Mark Latham referred to Tony Staley's physical disability, occasioned by a motor car accident that almost claimed his life. Tony's life hung in the balance for 12 months, and to this day he is walking with the benefit only of crutches. Mr Garrett interjecting",118
219,The SPEAKER,NOES,The member for Kingsford Smith is warned!,118
220,Mr HOWARD,NOES,"The Leader of the Opposition thinks he has been smeared because people dare to criticise his policies. He has not been born in Australian politics to understand that. I regard the attempt by the Labor Party to implicate us in this smear as a base diversion. The Leader of the Opposition has utterly failed to produce any evidence to support his claim. What is more, he was too gutless to ask the question himself. He should have got up at the first instance. He did not have the courage to do that and he stands condemned as a result. (Time expired)",118

222,The SPEAKER,NOES,The question now is that the motion for suspension of standing orders moved by the Treasurer be agreed to. Question agreed to.,119
223,Mr RUDD,NOES,"One of the interesting things about the debate in the chamber this afternoon is that the Prime Minister has just required a prime ministerial protection order from interventions. If this is a serious debate about matters before the House and matters before the nation, why is that particular procedural device necessary to protect the Prime Minister from the indignity of points of order? I find it extraordinary that the Leader of the House would seek to protect the Prime Minister in such a fashion rather than allow the Prime Minister to fend for himself, as other members of this chamber are required to do. The motion before us asks why these questions have been put to the parliament today. The answer is that the function of the parliament is to provide the executive with the opportunity to answer questions put to it by the opposition. These are matters which therefore demand answers. What we have had from those opposite today is a sense of continued feigned indignation, as if any negative smear campaign has been mysteriously pulled out of space, with which those opposite have had nothing whatsoever to do-no awareness whatsoever on the part of the Prime Minister or on the part of anybody else. But look carefully at the Prime Minister's response to the questions which were asked: ‘I, the Prime Minister, have no awareness of any such activity. I am not responsible for it and I am not aware of others in the Liberal Party and the government.' We have heard that through ‘children overboard'; we have heard that through the ‘wheat for weapons' scandal; we have heard it time in and time out as you have sought to avoid accountability in this parliament. Ms Roxon interjecting",119
224,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"The member for Gellibrand has been warned! Mr Abbott- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The motion that the House has passed requires the Leader of the Opposition to detail to the House his smear allegations against the Prime Minister. He needs to speak to the motion.",120
225,Unknown,NOES,Opposition members interjecting,120
226,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,There is no point of order. I warn members that a number have been warned and I will not give them another warning.,120
227,Mr RUDD,NOES,"I find it interesting also that, apart from the prime ministerial protection order issued by the Leader of the House, the Prime Minister has cut and run from the chamber altogether on these matters. remarkable that a government of courage and a Prime Minister of courage have to hide behind such procedural devices to avoid accountability. There is a big problem with the argument advanced by the Prime Minister today. The Prime Minister's conspiracy theory runs along these lines: after a press conference I conducted at Queanbeyan yesterday, I came back into this chamber and organised through my office an exclusive interview with Laurie Oakes. That is the proposition; the Prime Minister just put that. There is a little problem with that conspiracy theory, because Laurie Oakes came and saw me yesterday morning before I went anywhere near Queanbeyan. Laurie Oakes came to my office to put these particular matters which had been put to him. So the prime ministerial conspiracy theory is that we have a press conference out at QueanbeyanMr Costello interjecting",120
228,Mr RUDD,NOES,"also put by this man, who lacks the courage ever to become Prime Minister-only courage enough to whisper innuendo about his Prime Minister when the Prime Minister is not here. What we have here is the Prime Minister advancing a conspiracy theory which collapses in a heap. The journalist in question, Laurie Oakes, one of the most respected figures in the gallery, came to me yesterday morning before we went anywhere near Queanbeyan and put to me the specific propositions. The conspiracy theory collapses in a heap. The second point is that other media outlets later in the day also contacted by my office confirmed that the same story was being shopped around-a remarkable coincidence, it seems. And again we have the Leader of the House refusingMr Abbott- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Is he saying that Laurie Oakes I find it said the government said this?",120
229,Unknown,NOES,Honourable members interjecting,120
230,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"What is the point of order? I could not hear it. If the members would be quiet, I might hear it. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, the point of order is relevance to the motion. Is the Leader of the Opposition saying that Laurie Oakes claimed the government gave him this evidence?",120
231,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,That is not a point of order.,120
232,Mr RUDD,NOES,"Two other media outlets confirmed subsequently that this story had been shopped to them in recent days. Furthermore, we are advised that this story had come forward from a source hostile to the Labor Party. Furthermore, the contents of the story ran along these lines: it contained the date of the medical procedure which I had, it had also the details of the doctor who supposedly performed the procedure, though the name of the doctor was not given to me, and, furthermore, there was a further view put that the source had said that the durability of the aortic valve used in the replacement surgery had a finite duration, it would last 10 years, and therefore my health was in some peril. This was not put to one media outlet; it was put to, we have at least confirmed, three media outlets. Prime Minister, you were absent from this: the approach from Laurie Oakes came before I went anywhere near Queanbeyan yesterday. Your entire conspiracy theory collapsed in a heap while you were absent from the chamber. Years ago-and this matter has been raised, I think, by someone opposite-in an interview, I think on Channel 7, we were asked about organ donations. I said I supported organ donations because I had been the beneficiary of one. Furthermore, in private conversations with cardiac patients at various times who have sought some counsel and support I have provided whatever counsel and support that I could. On top of that can I say this: the three sets explicit: of information which these journalists put to me yesterday have never, ever been put into the public domain. We were therefore put in a position where I had to respond to the matters which had been put. The reason why the question was put in this House today is that the job of the parliament is to get an answer back from the executive as to whether these things are true. But it does not stop there. The question is asked, particularly by the Leader of the House, as to why we could possibly suspect that the government may be involved in anything untoward. Here we have, in the Sunday Telegraph from 29 August 2007, ‘Dig round and you'll soon find a dirt unit', an article by Simon Benson. It involves an interview involving a radio host, Bill Shorten and Tony Abbott. Bill Shorten says: “Tony, are you saying you don't have a dirt unit and it doesn't have people trying to scour up the backgrounds of Labor candidates?” The answer from Tony Abbott: “Of course ...",120
233,Unknown,NOES,Government members interjecting,121
234,Mr RUDD,NOES,"I am reading a transcript. TONY ABBOTT: “Of course. Obviously you want to look at the files and all that kind of stuff.” That is the question which was put to him by Bill Shorten in that interview, and that was the response of the Leader of the House. That is the transcript. So you ask with this feigned innocence and indignation why we in the opposition might dare suspect that you guys might be up to no good. I think there is a reasonable basis for looking at that. Furthermore, when you look at the other matters which have been put into the public debate on all of this, the other matter which was canvassed today in a question goes to the report by Hedley Thomas in the Australian. The report by Hedley Thomas is quite Liberal Party figures in Queensland, including a forensic accountant, have been examining the purchase, and the links between the vendorsreferring to the purchase of a house by my wife and meand the Labor Party's investment companies, for several months. If that is in the public record and it is there from Hedley Thomas, who is a long standing journalist with News Ltd, it is equally legitimate to put this matter for the government to seek a response to. But, on top of that, is the government saying that Jason Koutsoukis lies through his teeth-this is the term of art used by those opposite? Jason Koutsoukis, only a couple of weeks ago or less, details precisely his visit to a ministerial suite to be handed a file which has ‘Gillard' on the top and deals explicitly with a whole series of allegations concerning the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. And you sit there opposite believing you are purer than the driven snow. It is remarkable-the feigned indignation about these questions, including from Captain Courageous over there, the would be Prime Minister without any intestinal fortitude whatsoever to ever stand up to the plate and say: ‘I would like to be Prime Minister. I would like to have the guts to challenge the Prime Minister. But-oops!I'll step back from the plate again.' Always privately lacking courage and lacking conviction, always whispering behind people's backs but never with the fortitude, the conviction, to stand up to the plate and actually challenge the government's leader, the leader of the Liberal Party, for his job. Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.",121
235,Mr RUDD,NOES,"Then we have the question that concerns the activities of those in the government dirt unit, which we have already referred to in detail concerning Dr Phelps, the chief of staff of the Special Minister of State. The truth of these propositions-and I have only been through three of them: the Koutsoukos article, the Hedley Thomas article, the confession by Tony Abbott in the Sunday Telegraph, as well as all these related matters-points to the fact that these matters should be answered by the Leader of the House or the government itself. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I know this is a debate but he is entitled to misrepresent me like that. It is a blatant, deliberate misrepresentation and Dietrich Bonhoeffer should not do that.",122
236,The SPEAKER,NOES,The Leader of the House will resume his seat. That is not a point of order.,122
237,Mr RUDD,NOES,"In terms of misrepresentation about the existence of a dirt unit, it is extraordinary that the Leader of the House could stand in the chamber and say that it does not exist when, out of his own mouth, he says that it does. The question put to him by Bill Shorten was: Tony, are you saying you don't have a dirt unit and it doesn't have people trying to scour up the backgrounds of Labor candidates? The answer was then: TONY ABBOTT: “Of course. Obviously you want to look at the files and all that kind of stuff.” What has happened here is, of course, that the Leader of the House has been hoist with his own petard, hung out by the words that have proceeded from his own mouth, confirming, less than a month ago-on Melbourne radio, I presume-that in fact this dirt unit does exist and engages in that sort of activity. The feigned indignation becomes much wider than that. Let us remember a certain individual called Senator Heffernan. The Prime Minister has made reference to all these indignations in the past. Prime Minister, you have a responsibility when it comes to either backing or overturning remarks by Senator Heffernan. What did Senator Heffernan have to say about the Deputy Leader of the Opposition? And what did you say in response to that immediately? ‘But look, I'm not telling people what they should apologise for or not; I'm just stating my own view.' In other words, when that foul language was used by Senator Heffernan in relation to the not Deputy Leader of the Opposition, what the Prime Minister sought to do was quickly step to one side-'Nothing to do with me; it's old Bill there, running off the tracks. I don't have anything to do with that.' Then what happens? The heat gets too much, the political reaction around the country gets too solid and suddenly the Prime Minister has to change his tune later on. The reason we moved an amendment earlier on, which the government was not prepared to take, was that all these questions go to the absolute heart of the integrity of the operations of this government. Mr Howard interjecting",122
238,Mr RUDD,NOES,"Oh yes it does, Prime Minister! It goes to the whole question of a government grown arrogant, grown out of touch after 11 long years in office, a government that has now sought to use all the instruments available to it in terms of the public servants who work for it, in terms of its own ministerial staff, in terms of the rort and abuse of taxpayer funded advertisingMr Costello- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The standing and sessional orders have been suspended to allow the Leader of the Opposition to detail to the House his smear allegations against the Prime Minister, the Liberal Party and the government. I would ask you to bring him back to detail the smear allegations that he makes against the Prime Minister, the Liberal Party and the government.",123
239,The SPEAKER,NOES,"The Leader of the Opposition, I am sure, heard that point of order. I ask him to come back to the debate.",123
240,Mr RUDD,NOES,"On the question of the glass jaw of the Treasurer, and his inability to respond to the matters which have been raised, it stands for the entire chamber to hear. We have been through, point by point, each of the matters which have required answers by the government opposite. Why is there this feigned indignation from those opposite? Because they do not want to answer the questions. They do not want to answer whose ministerial suite it was where someone provided a dirt file in relation to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Whose was it? Have you bothered to check that out? Who is the forensic accountant referred to over here in the other article? Have you bothered to check that out? Has the government also bothered to ascertain precisely what has happened with Tony Abbott's admissionMr Costello- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The standing and sessional orders have been suspended to allow the Leader of the Opposition to detail the smear allegations to the House. I would ask that you bring him back to detailing those allegations.",123
241,The SPEAKER,NOES,The point of order raised by the Treasurer is a valid point of order. The Leader of the Opposition has been asked to provide evidence and the Leader of the Opposition will come back to the motion.,123
242,Mr RUDD,NOES,"On the question of the Laurie Oakes matter-and you were out of the chamber for this, Prime Minister-let me put it before you pure and simple: your contention here in this place was that a conspiracy had been engaged in by me with a journalist to do an exclusive interview subsequent to a press conference at Queanbeyan yesterday, and your conspiracy collapsed into a heap. Do you know why, Prime Minister? Because Laurie Oakes came to see me before I went anywhere near Queanbeyan. Three journalists came to us with the pieces of information that I referred to before, and we were also informed that the sources came from those hostile to the Labor Party. Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order that goes to the wording of the motion. We ask the Leader of the Opposition to give us just once piece of evidence-just one piece.",123
243,The SPEAKER,NOES,"As I hear it, I believe the Leader of the Opposition is in order. Before I call the Leader of the Opposition, I would ask him to desist from using the words ‘you' and ‘your'.",123
244,Mr RUDD,NOES,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Each of those reports to us by the media caused us to conclude, given the nature of the information, that legitimate questions needed to be posed. What is remarkable here is the feigned indignation from those opposite about where this material came from. It would have been very simple and straightforward for an unequivocal statement to be made about these matters, and it was not.",123

248,Mr RUDD,NOES,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I notice that once again the Leader of the House does not seek to extend the same sort of procedural protection to the likes of me as he sought to extend to the Prime Minister, and did so successfully. Once again, there is a series of interruptions as the response provided by me is delivered. Prime Minister, the country wants to have a debate about plans for the future.

252,Mr RUDD,NOES,"On the question of our allegation against this government, I conclude with this: this government stands condemned for having lost touch. It is a government that has no positive plans for the future but is instead determined to wage an unrelenting negative smear campaign against the opposition from here until election day-an election day which Captain Arrogance over there has already announced on behalf of his Prime Minister.",124

261,Mr ABBOTT,ADJOURNMENT,I move: That the House do now adjourn. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport,126
262,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT,"I draw attention to my question on the Notice Paper today in relation to the long-term operating plan for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. When the coalition came to power in 1996, it had an aviation policy called ‘Soaring into tomorrow', which promised that the government would fix aircraft noise arising from Sydney airport. When the government introduced the long-term operating plan for Sydney airport, it promised the people who live north of the airport-and that includes the member for Grayndler and people in my electorate of Lowe-that they would get only 17 per cent of air traffic movements to the north of Sydney airport. Over the decade that the long-term operating plan has been operating, not once has that target of 17 per cent air traffic movements to the north of Sydney airport been met. More to the point, if you look at the question I have placed on today's Notice Paper, you will see that I have asked the minister why the government has failed to deliver on the promise to the people I represent and the people the member for Grayndler represents that we would get only 17 per cent air traffic movements to the north of Sydney airport. The latest figures provided by Airservices Australia indicate that we are getting 32 per cent of air traffic movements to the north of Sydney airport, almost double what we were promised. Moreover, when you go back to the coalition's aviation policy in relation to Sydney airport, you see that the government promised that they would not sell Sydney airport until they had fixed aircraft noise sociated with Sydney airport. I stand here today, 10 years after the introduction of the long-term operating plan, and report that the government have monumentally failed to deliver what they promised the people of Sydney, the people I represent. I remind the government that my predecessor, who was a member of the government, resigned from the government prior to the 1998 election because he understood clearly that the Prime Minister never had any intention of honouring the commitments given-in good faith, as the people of Sydney understood-that the noise associated with Sydney airport would be fixed. I have been treated arrogantly by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services over the years with the hundreds and hundreds of questions that I have asked about it, to the point where the ministers for transport and regional services have said to me that they have exhaustively answered my questions and that the long-term operating plan for Sydney airport has been substantially implemented. The truth is that the long-term operating plan for Sydney airport has not been substantially implemented. It has not been fairly implemented and, over the whole period of the long-term operating plan for Sydney airport, we have been getting up to 100 per cent more traffic movements than we were promised by the government when they came to power. Worse, the government sold Sydney airport to Macquarie Bank and turned it into a shopping centre and a car park, to look after their mates. The conflict of interest by Max MooreWilton, who was then the chief of staff for the Prime Minister-who then moved over to manage SACL and then moved on to Macquarie bank-is appalling. It just shows you how disingenuous the government have asbeen in relation to aircraft noise associated with Sydney airport and the promises that they have broken repeatedly over the last 10 years. I stand here today and ask the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services what he is going to do to require Airservices Australia to honour the commitments of the government to deliver only 17 per cent air traffic movements to the north of Sydney airport. That is the purpose of my question on today's Notice Paper. My constituents deserve an answer. They deserve some honesty-(Time expired) Barker Electorate",126
263,Mr SECKER,ADJOURNMENT,"It is somewhat ironic that I am following the member for Lowe because nine years ago we walked together for our first day at parliament.
