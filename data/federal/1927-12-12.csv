15,Mr JACKSON,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"I think I am speaktitude ing for the majority of honourable, memturers bers, if not all of them, when I say the extravagant language he used",15
16,Mr SPEAKER,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,Order ! The honourable member must not proceed m that strain. He has asked the indulgence of the House while he makes an explanation preliminary to the asking of a question. He may not debate the matter.,15

20,Mr BRENNAN,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,That would not be fair to other honourable members. Leave refused.,15
21,Mr MCGRATH,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"I rise to a question of privilege in connection with the remarks of the honourable member for Angas. Mr SPEAKER,-Does the honourable member propose to conclude with a motion ?",15
22,Mr MCGRATH,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"I shall do so with pleasure. I read in the daily press a report of the honourable member's remarks, and I was astounded that any member of this Parliament should suggest that Tammany methods and corruption were being practised in Canberra. I bitterly reoem his remarks. I well remember that during the last tariff discussion in Melbourne honourable member for Angas devoted of his remarks to abuse of Australian manufacturers, and in the course of them dramatically tore up Austrauuu and ask that it be withdrawn.",15
23,Mr SPEAKER,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,If the honourable member has been misrepresented he will have au opportunity later to make a per,15
24,Mr MCGRATH,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"I remember his attowards Australian riiai,ufacon that occasion - If the honourable that member has any time to spare, and desires to do a service to Australia",15
25,Mr GREGORY,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,What is the question of privilege that the honourable member is raising?,15
26,Mr SPEAKER,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,The honourable member has intimated that he intends to submit a motion. So far he has referred only to the remarks of the honourable member for Angas. I am waiting to hear him mention the particular privilege that he alleges has been invaded.,16
27,Mr WATT,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"Do I understand, Mr. Speaker, that you rule that the honourable member must conclude by submitting a motion?",16
28,Mr SPEAKER,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"It is usual for an honourable member to submit a motion if a privilege of the House has been abused, and on more than one previous occasion the Speaker has intimated that the practice of the House is for an honourable member when raising a matter of privilege, to conclude with a motion in order to place a specific question before' the House. I am waiting for the honourable member for Ballarat to say what particular privilege he thinks has been invaded.",16
29,Mr MCGRATH,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"I was proceeding do so, when rudely interrupted by right honourable member for Balaclava, who, as an ex-speaker, ought to have known better. With his perfrom mission, I shall continue marks. If the honourable member for Angas has any spare time, I advise him to devote his attention to the Town Angas and Country Union, an organization of improper importers that seeks, by any method it tralian can adopt, to bring about what is termed tariff reform. The most startling alleI gations have been made in the last twelve months as to the methods it adopted induce honourable members to reverse their votes. As an Australian, ancl having number of manufacturers in my electorhe ate, I welcome their coming to me when a tariff debate is in progress. Members can obtain no information from the Tariff Board. The members of that body cannot be interviewed by them. Theresentations fore, the men engaged in the manufacCanberra turing industries, which keep Australia going, should not be boycotted from the House, or prevented from having access to honourable members. If the honourable member for Angas interviews them, will find that they are good Australians, and he will bitterly regret having charged tliem. with bribery ancl corruption. strongly resent his objectionable insinuations. I am here to do nry best to help Australia to. produce to the best of her capacity. If manufacturers see fit to send their agents or representatives to Canberra to make known their wishes in tariff niatters, I , as a member of this House, will gladly welcome their representations. The motion that I intend to submit",16
30,Mr FENTON,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"There is no need for a motion. A motion is needed only in regard to a newspaper article. Mr SPEAKER,-An honourable member is entitled uncier the Standing Orders to raise a question of-privilege forthwith. A motion should be submitted if it is desired that the matter shall be debated by honourable members generally. If the honourable member merely wishes to raise a question of privilege, he may do so, but the usual practice laid down in this House is to conclude with a motion. As to regards statements in newspapers, a the specific motion must be submitted.",16
31,Mr MCGRATH,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"I began by quoting a newspaper, and I intended to submy remit a motion. I now move That, in the opinion of this House, the remarks made by the honourable member for on Friday last, in respect to the alleged influence used in this House by Ausmanufacturers, are unwarranted and without justification. asked you, Mr Speaker, at the beginning of the sitting, if the honourable mem plied you with particulars of the abuses a alleged by him, and the answer was that had not done so. That, to my mind, is clear proof that he had no such particulars to give. Honourable members with a number of years' experience of parliamentary life will agree that fewer reprehave been made to them in in connection with the present tariff than were made in Melbourne with previous tariffs. I challenge the honourable member for Angas to prove that we are being unduly worried, or that Tainhe many methods are being introduced by Australian manufacturers in pursuing their legitimate quest for tariff benefits. I Does the honourable member know that 40,000 Australians are out of employment today-that 40,000 families will have no Christmas dinner? Because the manufacturers are anxious to obtain tariff adjustments that will enable them to keep their workmen fully employed, and are trying to keep the factories of Australia busy, it ill becomes the honourable member to reflect upon them in the way he has done. I hope the motion will be carried, and that the honourable member will be shown that many honourable members on both sides of the House bitterly resent his statement. Mr THEODOBE. :- I second the motion. The honourable member for Angas surely overstepped the rules of propriety by his sweeping allegation against the representatives of manufacturers - Is there anything evil in manufacturers, either directly or through their agents, interviewing members of Parliament or placing their views before them? In making representations to the Tariff Board, they inust go there as principals or send their agents. Is there anything improper in that? There is not, and there can be nothing improper in their visiting Canberra and making representations either to Ministers or to other honourable members. On Friday the honourable member for Angas cast an aspersion on reputable manufacturers. If there be Tammany methods in operation in business in Australia, the greater number of cases will be found to arise from the influence of the importers and not of the Australian manufacturers.",16
32,Mr MAXWELL,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,It is unnecessary the honourable member to say that.,17
33,Mr RODGERS,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,Why reflect upou any body of persons ?,17
34,Mr THEODORE,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"- I do not wish to do so. Tammary methods are supposed to be the almost inevitable concomitant "" b i g "" business, but I resent the suggestion that the Australian manufacturers as a class or individually come to this Parliament for the purpose of unduly inon fluencing it or to import improper sence methods into the transaction of their ness. The honourable member for Ballasaid rat is to be congratulated upon his timely action in upholding the right of honourable members to have representations made to them in ,the interests of the manufacturers.",17
35,Mr SPEAKER,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"I suggested that the honourable member for Ballarat should specifically indicate the particular privilege which, in his opinion, had been invaded by the remarks of the honourable member for Angas-whethe r it was a collective privilege enjoyed by honourable members generally or some individual privilege. The motion directs attention to "" alleged improper influence used in this House,"" and the honourable member would be in order if he could show that something that had happened within the precincts of Parliament had interfered* in in any way with some privilege of an individual member. It is not my desire to rule the motion out of order, and I suggest to the honourable member that,* as he has made his protest against the remarks of the honourable member for Angas, he might see fit not to proceed with it.",17
36,Mr MCGRATH,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"I thought it desirable, under cover of privilege, to take the earliest occasion that presented itself to indicate my strong disapproval of the remarks of the honourable member for Angas, and I assumed that other honourable members would welcome this opportunity to show what they thought of the honourable member. I also remind you, sir, that you intimated to me, when I rose to speak, that I must conclude with a motion. In my opinion the aspersions cast upon honourable members generally for by the honourable member for Angas on Friday last certainly constituted a breach of privilege.. The honour of this House was assailed I by the honourable member for Angas, by the implication that honourable members, in permitting representatives of manufacturers to interview them with regard to the new tariff duties were allowof ing Tammany methods to be applied here.",17
37,Mr SPEAKER,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"I gathered from, ^he speech of the honourable member for Angas Friday last that he objected to the preof tariff agents within the precincts busiof this building. To my mind, what he amounted to a complaint against officials of the House to whom certain instructions bad been given, and, therefore, I informed him that to the best of my knowledge those officials were complying with the instructions which had been given to them. I have made it my business to institute special inquiries, and I find nothing to justify the remarks of the honourable member for Angas. I did not understand him to make any reflection upon honourable members or to suggest that they had been influenced by the presence of representatives of manufacturers. What he desired, apparently was to protect honourable members from being pestered.",17
38,Mr GREGORY,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,E n the lobbies.,18
39,Mr SPEAKER,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"Yes . I am satisfied ihat the officials keep all strangers out of the corridors on each side of the chamber, and that, honourable members need not any person against their desire. stituents and the public generally are, howev.e.r, entitled to attend at Parliament House to seek interviews with sentatives, and opportunities are provided for them to see honourable members if members wish to see them. Mr MoGRATH - You invited me just now, Mr Speaker, to state specifically particular privilege which, in my opinion, had been invaded by the honourable memout of order. ber for Angas. I am unable to quote the Hansard report of his speech, as it has not yet been issued; but I quote from a reputable newspaper in Melbourne, if there is one-the Sun Pictorial - whic h statesThis man who prates protection for all are prepared  honourable member for Ballarat may not speak a second time on his motion.",18
40,Mr SPEAKER,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"Order . I have suggested to the honourable member for Ballarat that his purpose has probably been served by the speech which he has made, and that it Defence may not. be necessary to persist with motion. - M.r. WATT - I submit, Mr Speaker, that the motion of the honourable member for Ballarat is not in order. He informed you that he rose to discuss a question of privilege, and you advised him that i \ would be necessary for him to conclude with a motion. You have since somewhat modified your pronouncement on that point. No motion of privilege is in order unless it declares that the act complained of is a breach of the privilege of honourable members of the House. The motion of the honourable member for Ballarat does not do that. I submit, therefore, that it is not in order.",18
41,Mr SPEAKER,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"I have already advised the honourable member for Ballarat to withdraw his motion, and if he persists with it I shall have to rule it out of order. I suggest again to the honourable member for Ballarat that it is desirable not to proceed with it.",18
42,Mr MCGRATH,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"I shall not be long, Mr Speaker. You invited me to state see the reasons for my belief that the re' Conmarks of the honourable member for Angas constituted a breach of privilege, and informed .me that I should have to their repreconclude with a motion.",18
43,Mr SPEAKER,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"Order ! The honourable member has submitted his motion, and may not at this stage speak again. In my opinion the motion is out of order, the and as the honourable member is net withdrawing it, I shall have to declare it",18
44,Mr COLEMAN,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,On what grounds?,18
45,Mr SPEAKER,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,The honourable member for Ballarat .has not specifically stated in his motion that the action comwho plained of constitutes a breach of privilege of this House.,18
46,Mr MCGRATH,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"Then I take it, Mr. Speaker, that you do not wish me to proceed further. POINT COOK AERODROME.",18
47,Mr LISTER,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"I ask the Minister for if he has information as to comhis plaints made by mechanics and other men employed at the Laverton Aircraft Depot, and at Point Cook, and if so, what steps are being taken to remedy them ?",18
48,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"I have no knowledge of any complaints. I understand that the mechanics are satisfied with existing conditions, but I shall have inquiries made, and inform the honourable member at an early date. INVALIDAND OLD-AGE PENSIONS.",18
49,Mr COLEMAN,STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT,"I remind the honourable the Prime Minister that many months ago, in reply to requests made by a deputation of old-age pensioners in Queensland, he stated that he would obtain a report from the Commissioner of Pensions in regard to certain anomalies in the administration of the Invali d and Old-Age Pensions Act. A few weeks ago I was informed that he would call for that report again. I like to know if the report has been received, and what action will be taken?",19

Will he inform the House if he has ever superimposed a similar inquiry upon any other industry appearing before the Tariff Board asking for increased duties?  follow:1. A copy of the correspondence referred to will be laid on the table of the Library. 2. No. The Tariff Board had the services or two qualified accountants from the Customs Department, but their investigations were on quite different lines from those made later. The Tariff Board makes recommendations only and the responsibility for the action taken rests upon the Government. The Minister administering the tariff is bound to analyse and weigh the board's report, and it was to assist him in this direction that the further analysis of the facts was made. 3.

How many amending tariff schedules providing for increased customs duties have been introduced by the present Government since it assumed office in February, 1923? i 2. On what dates were such schedules introduced ? I am now able to f u r n is h to the honourable member the following in for m at i o n : 1. Eight (8). 2. 3rd April, 1924; 2nd September, 1925; 3rd March, 1926 (this schedule incorporated the schedule tabled on 2nd September, 1925); 8th July, 1926'; 11th August, 1926; 23rd March, 1927; 28th September, 1927; 24th November, 1927 (this schedule incorporated the schedules tabled on 11th August, 1926, 23rd March, 1927, and 28th September, 1927). NA BOARD. A USXRAJ-IAN TEADE .  ber the honourable member for M a r i by r  questions:1. Has his attention been drawn to a cable from the United State's of America on the 6th instant, stating that the United States Shipping Board makes bitter reference to the decision of the Australian Tariff Board which favours the Canadian and Australian Shipping Lines by requiring that the cost of transport from the point of origin to the port of export must be added to the value of the goods imported in determining the amount of Australian import duty? 2. Is it a fact, as stated, that the American Shipping Board has unsuccessively approached the Australian Government with reference to the inatter? 3. Will the Minister inform the House aa to the operation of the departmental regulations in regard to this matter? I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following information :1. Yes. 2. The United States Consul-General has so approached the Australian Government. 8. This is not a matter of gulations, but one that has been provided for by the Customs Act ever since 1001. Section 154 (1) (u) of the . act prescribes that all charges payable or ordinarily payable for placing the goods free on board at the port of export shall be included in the value for duty. The port of export of goods the produce of the United States of America shipped via Vancouver to Australia is the border town where the goods cross into Canada. The cost of conveying the goods to the border town only is includible in the value for duty whereas if the goods were shipped via' San Francisco the whole of the inland freight from the factory to San Francisco would be includible in the value for duty. The same position arises in regard to Canadian goods originating inland and shipped at New York or Montreal. For instance, if the goods are forwarded to New York for shipment, duty is paid on the cost of inland freight to the border town only, whilst if the goods are shipped at Montreal the whole cost of the inland freight to Montreal is included in the value for duty.

NA FOOD SHIPMENTS.",22
66,Sir NJSVILLE HOWSE,INSPECTION OF OVERSEAS,"On the 27th October the honourable member .for Herbert (Dr Not t ) asked the Minister for Health the following question':Giving evidence recently before the Royal Commission on the Constitution of the Commonwealth, Dr Cumpston, the Commonwealth Director-General of Health, said that the inspection of imported food is not a function of the Health Department, and so far as that duty was performed it was carried out by the Customs Department. I desire to know what are the qualifications of the inspectors who are permitted to make examinations of food on behalf of the Customs Department? The position in regard to the examination of imported foods is as follows: The commerce (imports) regulations imported foodstuffs to be marked with a ""trade description"" showing (inter alia) a true description of the goods. In addition the name of any preservative or deleterious substance contained in the article must be clearly shown in such trade description. These trade descriptions are inspected by the customs examining officers when making other customs inspections, and samples are from time to time submitted for examination to the Federal analyst or the customs analysts in the various States. The technical officers of the analyst's branches mentioned are all qualified analysts. Standards are fixed by the regulations mentioned for the following articles of food:-Bakin g powder, infant's food, pepper, and cocoa. CITIZEN FORCES. PHYSIC AL STANDARDS.",22
67,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,INSPECTION OF OVERSEAS,"On the 9th December the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr D . Cameron) asked the following questions:1. What was the annual percentage of who were rejected as medically unfit for admission to the Citizen Forces in the years 1914 to 1927 inclusive? 2. Were the height and chest standards increased; if sn, did such higher standards account for the increased number of rejections, and, if so, to what degree? 3. What WHS the annual percentage of cadets, aged fourteen years, who were considered medically u n f it ' for Swedish exercises and drill prescribed by regulations, since lf>14 to date? 4. Can the Minister offer any explanation lor the increased number of such youths declared medically unfit since 1914? [ am now in a position to in for m honourable member as f o l l o w s : 1. 1914, 29.4; 1915. 25.2: 1916, 22.5; 1917, 20.(i8; 1918, 17.97; 1919, 15.27; 1920, 14.6; 1921. 14.05: 1922. 13.76; 1923, 14.47; 1924, 17.02 ; 1925, 32.36; 1926, 33.6; 1927, 30.5. 2. The decreased percentage of unfit for Citizen Force service for the years 1918 to 1924. both inclusive, was mainly caused by the reduction in the minimum height standard from 5 f t . 4 in. (conditionally f it , 5 f t . 3 in.) to 5 f t . 2 in. in 1018. The minimum height and chest measurement standards were increased to 5 f t . 4 in. and 3 3 i inches respectively in 1924, and the discretionary power exercised by examining medical officers before that year was withdrawn. centage of unfit increased accordingly for the years ""1925, 1926, and 1927 as shown in (1 ). No record exists of rejections in respect of the height standard (only) for any year prior to 1927, but the percentage rejected for this reason in that year is 7.14. 3. 1914, 18.9; 1915. 11.3: 1916, 10.6: 1917, 10.2; 1918, 8.99; 1919, 9.25: 1920, 8.24; 1921. 7.30; 1922, - : 1923, - ; 1924, 9.36; 1925, - : 1920, 25.4; 1927, 26.3. No examinations for senior cadet service were carried out in the years 1922 and 1923 owing to the reduction of senior cadet training to two quotas as from 1st July, 1922. No examinations were conducted in 1925 owing to the further restriction of senior cadet training to one quota as from 1st July, 1925. Any consequent examinations held in 1924 were of persons ""who reached the age of sixteen years in that year, whilst tliose carried out in 1926 and 1927 were of i>crsoii8 who reached the age of seventeen in those years.

The only material increase of rejects for senior cadet service occurred in the years 1926 and 1927. The main reasons for this were:(a) Senior cadets were not examined until they reached the age of seventeen years; (b) The withdrawal of the discretionary powers of medical officers referred to in (2) ; and (c) The issue of instructions to medical officers that no person who was not likely to reach the prescribed standard for the Citizen Forces in the following year, was to be the passed for senior cadet training.

This bill is to approve an agreement between the Commonwealth and the Commissioners of the Victorian State Savings Bank, pursuant to the War Service Homes Act. This agreement was entered into tentatively, and in anticipation of approval by this Parliament and the Parliament of Victoria. Since July, 1922, the Victorian State Savings Bank has been acting as agent for the War Service Homes Commissioner in the provision of homes in Victoria, and the agreement now proposed does not differ very much from that in existence, except that at present the bank acts as agent for the commission, whilst under this bill the bank will be established as the principal, the Commonwealth's responsibility bill being to provide the bank with funds to beenable it to make loans to persons eligible under the War Service Homes Act, and for to pay the bank certain remuneration for so doing. The bank's responsibility, in the main, is to repay the total of the funds advanced as repaid by the applithe total amount outstanding being repayable by the bank at the end of twenty years. The number of homes which will be taken over under this agreeadministration ment by the Victorian - State Savings Bank is as follows, the figures complete up to the 30th November last:WOBK COMPLETED. Homes completed 3,045 Homes purchased . . 204 Mortgages discharged .. 35 Homes enlarged .. 1 ""WOBK INHAND . Mouses in course of construction .. 163 Contracts let, but work not yet started . Tenders called but not finally dealt with 35 The total expenditure incurred on these homes by the State Savings Bank since July, 1922, is £2,412,196, the receipts during that period have been £501,771, and the total amount outstanding, including interest and arrears by applicants is £2,331,118. The total Arrears by applicants at the present date amount to only £4,136. Homes purchased or built prior to the bank taking over in July, 1922, number 3,266. These were built by the commission quite independently of the bank, and will be administered by the War Services Homes Department.",22
68,Mr RODGEKS,WAR SEEVICE HOMES,"It is proposed to have two controlling bodies, then?",26
69,Mr HILL,WAR SEEVICE HOMES,"The War Service Homes Department will administer all the homes built by it independently of the bank. The whole of the arrears in Victoria on war service homes, at the present time, amount to only .57 per cent., while the percentage for the whole Commonwealth is .89 per cent. It is only within the last year or two that the figures have been reduced to this amount; before that it stood at something like 6 per cent. Members will have an opportunity in committee to discuss the agreement which is embodied in the schedule to the bill.",26
70,Mr CHARLTON,WAR SEEVICE HOMES,The Minister has not explained whether any extra cost will be incurred.,26
71,Mr HILL,WAR SEEVICE HOMES,"The charges made for under the old agreement were 15s. per cent.; under the new agreebeing ment they will be 13s. per cent. Debate (on motion by Mr Charlton) adjourned. INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL . In Gommittee (Consideration of 3,285 Senate's amendment). Clause 16Section twenty-six of the principal act is repealed and the following section inserted in its stead:"" (2) In addition to any deductionwhich may be made under the. last preceding subsection in respect of any loss, a taxpayer shall 198 be entitled to a deduction of any similar loss, or of part of any similar loss, incurred 3,483 by him in any of the four years next preceding the year in which the income was derived, if no deduction of that loss, or (as the case may be) of that part of that loss, is allowable, under this section, in assessments for financial years preceding that for which the assessment is made: Provided that(b) no deduction shall be allowed of any amount of loss which would have been allowable as a deduction in an assessment for any financial year preceding the financial year commencing on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-seven, if the provisions of this section had been in force for the purposes of assessments for all financial years subsequent to the financial year commencing on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-two, and had applied only to losses incurred and income derived on or after that date, or on or after the commencement of the accounting period substituted for the financial year commencing on that date under sub-section (3) of section thirty-two of this act. Section proposed to be amended26. Where a taxpayer makes a loss in any year in carrying on a business either alone or as a partner with other persons, he shall be entitled to deduct the loss from any assessable income derived by him in that year from other sources. The loss shall be deducted in the first place from any income from personal exertion of the taxpayer, but if that income does not amount to the loss to be deducted, the difference shall be deducted from the taxpayer's income, if any, derived from property in tlm year mentioned. Senate's Amendment - At the end of subsection 2 (b) add- "" and no amount of loss, incurred prior to the first day of July One thousand nine hundred and twenty-six or prior to the commencement of any accounting period substituted under sub-section 3 of section thirty-two of this aet for the financial year commencing on that date, shall be. taken into account under sub-section 8 of section thirteen of this act in ascertaining the excess of allowable deductions for the year in which the loss was incurred, which would not have been allowable as a deduction in the assessment of income derived (prior to that date or that commencement) in any financial year or accounting period subsequent to the year or period in which the loss was incurred, if the provisions of this section had been so in force and had so applied.""",26
72,Dr EARLE PAGE,WAR SEEVICE HOMES,"Cowper-Trea surer) [3.51] - I move That the amendment be agreed to. When the bill was before another place the officers of the Taxation Department worked out a number of actual examples of incomes, when it was found that the amendment of clause 16 was drafted in such a way that a double deduction of losses from profits was in certain cases possible. As that was not the intention of the Government or the committee, this amendment has been made in another place to give effect to what is really intended.",27
73,Mr THEODORE,WAR SEEVICE HOMES,Who was responsible for the faulty drafting of the bill in the first place?,27
74,Dr EARLE PAGE,WAR SEEVICE HOMES,"The clause was drafted by the officers of the Taxation Department and of the Crown Law Department, and it was not until actual examples were fully worked out that it was found that the provision did not give effect to what the committee intended. As the amendment is somewhat complicated, I may state that it is to achieve the same result in regard to losses incurred prior to 1st July, 1926, as the proviso to sub-section 1 achieves in regard to losses incurred on or after 1st July, 1926, namely, to prevent the losses from being brought into account twice in ascertaining the average income by reference to which the rate of tax is to be calculated. As the provision stands there will be a double deduction, in ascertaining such average income for the purposes of assessments for the financial years 1927-28 to 1930-31, of so much of any loss incurred prior to 1st July, 1926, as is deductable under sub-section 2 of the new section in the assessments for those years. This position, which will be rectified by the amendment, did not become apparent until the new section had been applied, by way of test, to a number of specific cases. The explanation of the position is .as follows:-Sectio n 13 (S) provides that the excess of allowable deductions over the assessable income of any year shall be taken into account in calculating the average income. If a taxpayer makes a business loss in a year in which he has no income from other sources the amount to be taken into account as the section 13 (S) excess for that year in calculating the average income of the next four years will be, leaving out of consideration the statutory exemption, the amount of that loss. Under sub-clause 2 of new section 26 as it stands, however, the amount of that loss will be carried forward as a deduction in ascertaining the taxable income of the next year, or of the next two, three or four years as the case may require. As deductions in ascertaining taxable income are also deductions in arriving at the average income, it follows that, unless the case is provided for, there will be two deductions in respect of one loss in arriving at the average income, namely, the deduction of the "" Section 13 (8) ""excess "" for the year of loss and the deduction consequential upon carrying forward that excess as an allowance from the taxable income of the succeeding year or years. The proviso to sub-section (1) of new section 26 was inserted to obviate this duplication of deductions, but as the new section is to apply for the first time in assessments of income derived in the year 1926-27, that proviso is limited to losses incurred after the 1st July, 1926, and hence is ineffective to prevent a double deduction of losses incurred prior to that date, some of which losses will, in certain circumstances, be carried forward under subsection (2) as deductions in ascertaining the taxable incomes of the years 1926-27, 1927-28, 1928-29, and 1929-30. The following example will illustrate the position:- A taxpayer, who comvision menced business during the year 1925-26, made a loss of £5,000 in that year and a profit of £10,000 in the year 1926-27. As the provision stands his average income for 1926-27 will be calculated as follows :- Income. Loss. Taxable Income. S. £ £ 1926-26 6,000 1926-27 10,000 10,000 - 6,000 Average Income = NU » Nil. Hence there is no rate to apply to the taxable income of £5,000. words, although the taxpayer's net income for the two years is .£5,000, he will entirely escape tax. Under the proposed amendment the average income would be calculated as follows:- Income. Loss. Taxable Income. £ £ £ 1925-26 5,000 1920-27 10,000 5,000 Average income for 1926-27 =5,000 = £2,500. A taxpayer would be assessed on £5,000 at the rate applicable to £2,500. It is not every loss incurred in the four years prior to the 1st July, 1926, that is deductible in assessments of income derived in the years 1926-27 to 1929-30, and where a deduction is allowable in those assessments in respect of any such loss, it. is not necessarily the whole of the loss that is deductible. The proposed amendment aims at the elimination from the ""Section 13(S) excess"" of the year of loss of that part only of the loss which is allowable as a deduction in those assessments. That is to say, a taxpayer, who commenced business in 1924-25, made a loss of £5,000 in that year, a profit of £1,000 in 1925-26, and a profit Dr Earle Page. of £10,000 in 1926-27. Under the proas it stands his average income for 1926-27 would be calculated as follows:Incoma for - Income. Loss. Taxable Income. averaging purposes. £ 1924-25 £ £ £ -5,00 0 5,000 1925-26 1,000 "" 1,000 1,000 1926-27 10,000 10,000 - (5,000 - 6,000 Income for 1,000) = 6,000 averaging purposes. (New sub-sec. 2 proviso (ft) ) £ Net Total 2,000 -5,000 +5,000 = 5,000 Average Income £^=£666: Net Total Nil The taxpayer would be assessed on £6,000 at the rate applicable to £666. Under 2 the proposed amendment the income for 1926-27 for averaging purposes would be:In other 1924-25 - £1,000 1925-26 + £1,000 1926-27 + £6,000 Net Total £6,000 6,000 Average income = £2,000. Income for 3 averaging The taxpayer would, therefore, be purposes. assessed on £6,000 at the rate applicable £ to £2,000. The £5,000 loss of 1924-29 beNil comes £1,000, because £4,000 of that loss 5,000 is deductible under new sub-section (2) Net Total £5,000 proviso b from the 1926-27 income. Honourable members will now appreciate how difficult it was to ascertain exactly 2 the effect of the amendment until a case had been worked out. The Taxation Department, and I am sure honourable members generally, desire the amendment to be applicable not merely to the future but also to the past, and I am assured, that the proposal which I am now submitting will prove to be satisfactory.",27
75,Mr SCULLIN,WAR SEEVICE HOMES,"Yarra) [4.1] - I looked very carefully at this clause in the original bill, and read it, I suppose, a dozen times. I then came to the conclusion that it would do what it was intended to do. When the amendment was first proposed I also read it very carefully. I have now come to the conclusion that we must take the word of 'the draftsman that our wishes are being expressed. The situation is extremely involved. I do not say that the amendment could have been drafted more clearly, but it is a pity that we cannot declare our intentions in simpler language. Such light as I had on the subject has been dimmed by the Treasurer's explanation, and speaking on behalf of* the Opposition, all I can say is that we must leave the Treasurer to it .

Clause SSection 35 of the principal act is repealed, and the following sections are inserted in its stead:- "" 35K. The savings bank shall be managed , by a commission composed of a Chief Commissioner and two other commissioners. Senate's Amendment - At the end of proposed new section 35E add the following proviso:"" Provided that, until the appointment of the commission(a) the Savings Bank shall be managed by the board of the Bank; and (6) for the purposes of this Part, and of the Commonwealth Housing Act 1927, the Governor shall have all the powers and functions of the Chief Commissioner, and the board shall have all the powers and func- have arisen. tions of the commission; and (c) all references in this Part (excepting in sections 35F to 3ON inclusive) and in the Commonwealth Housing Act 1927 to the Chief Commissioner or to the commission shall be read as references to the Governor or the board as the case may be.""",28
76,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Cowper-Treas urer) [ 4 . 4 ] - I move That the amendment be agreed to. The object of this amendment is to alter the method of controlling the Commonwealth Savings Bank business, but to maintain the separation of that branch from the central and general branch of the Commonwealth Bank. It enables the board of directors and governor of the bank to exercise all the powers and functions of the proposed commission and chief commissioner respectively u n t i l these are appointed, which may be an indefinite period. It also provides that all references in certain clauses of the Commonwealth Housing Bill to the chief commissioner or to the commission shall be read as references to the governor or the board as the case may be. I made a statement on this subject on the 16th November, when I said that the Government had that morning had an interview with the chairman, the governor and two other directors of the Commonwealth Bank, in regard to the Commonwealth housing scheme, and that they had represented that although I had freely consulted with them on the principles of this bill and the Commonwealth Housing Bill , they had not appreciated the exact intentions of the legislation as to the carrying out of the housing functions, and that on further consideration they were of the opinion that they could continue to administer the savings bank and in addition, the proposed housing scheme. It is due to the committee that I should explain how I came unwittingly to mislead it in some degree, and to show that I did so quite unintentionally. I think my explanation will indicate that it was natural that I should have assumed that the position was as I thought it to be. Had there been no changes in the office of secretary to the Treasury and governor of the Commonwealth Bank during the period when these negotiations were in progress the misunderstanding possibly would not During the discussion on the motion for the second reading of this bill I stated that immediately after the last election the Government sought the aid of the Commonwealth Bank directorate to formulate a housing scheme in fulfilment of its promise to the electors.",29
77,Mr THEODOBE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,What scheme was placed before the directorate.,29
78,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"No scheme at all. Our object was to obtain the advice and assistance of the board in formulating a scheme. A f t e r considering the matter the board of directors of the bank resolved, during July, 1926That this board feels that to accept the responsibility of the administration of the Federal Government housing scheme as part of the functions of the savings bank department would be overweighting the work falling upon the institution; and further that such functions are in no way related to the general banking business or to that of a note issue bank or a reserve bank and the board is therefore of the opinion that, under the circumstances, it would be wiser to accept the proposal of the Government to separate the savings bank department from the bank for the purpose of enabling the carrying out of the housing scheme. It is better in the interests of the bank as a whole that the Government should take the necessary steps to bring about the separation proposed, and the board will l)o glad to assist and advise the Government to the best of its ability as to the method of effecting the changes necessary to carry this out. I read that resolution to the House in my reply in the debate on the second reading of the bill. The Government accepted it as an expression of the desire of the board- a desire which it still has-to separate the savings bank from the other branches of the bank so that the savings bank could administer the housing scheme independently. The Government had occasion during the preparation of both the Commonwealth Housing Bill and the Commonwealth Bank Savings Bank Bill to discuss the principles of both measures with the directors of the bank. The negotiations were mostly conducted personally. It was and still is the desire of the Government to interfere as little as possible with State housing activities. In December, 1926, nearly six months after the bank carried the resolution which I have rend, we discussed our housing scheme with the Victorian Savings Bank Commissioners. At that discussion suggestions were made that there were possibilities along the following lines:Power to be given to the director? to 'invest vernment proposed. the funds of the Bank, inter alia, in advancing money for buying and building homes, and for discharging mortgages on existing homes, and for the erection of warehouses intended for the warehousing of primary products. Power to be given to the directors to enter into any arrangements with any bank, or corporation, or authority established under the laws of a State, for carrying out the business of the savings bank in respect of advances for homes and warehouses. In the discussions that took place we discussed the personnel would control the savings bank, and various suggestions in that regard were put forward, and ultimately incorporated in the Commonwealth Bank Savings Bank Bill, which was then drafted. In July I took the bill, as drafted, to Sydney, and placed it before' executive omcers of the bank for their consideration. I think it was the deputy-governor who examined it, and I take it that he discussed the matter with the governor. Later, in Dr Earle Page. September, an arrangement was made whereby while I was in Sydney I was able to discxiss with the Commissioner of the State Savings Bank of New South Wales the actual 'method of operation now proposed in the Housing Bill for the investment of funds. Arrangements for that discussion were made by the Governor qf the Commonwealth Bank, and one of the directors of the bank was present at the discussion.",29
79,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Was that subsequent to the drafting of the bill? - Dr EARLE PAGE - That was after the bill had been prepared in its present form. I want to make it clear that when the Savings Bank Bill was before the officers of the Commonwealth Bank for their perusal, the Housing Bill had not been drafted, but was in course of preparation. The discussion with the New South Wales State Savings Bank authorities took place after the Housing Bill had been drafted. As no representations had been made by the directors of the Commonwealth Bank in reference to the control of the Savings Bank, and as the Secretary to the Treasury, who had a considerable share in the drafting of the Savings* Bank Bill, was also a member of the Commonwealth Bank Board, I took it for granted that the executive omcers of the board were thoroughly seized of the position, and satisfied with what the GoI was still under that impression when I moved the second reading of the bill. It was not until after the board had perused the Commonwealth Bank Savings Bank Bill and its complementary measure, the Housing Bill, and had considered the debates that took place here, that the chairman of the board intimated to the Prime Minister that he would like to discuss the matter with the Governthat ment. He. then stated that, although the board still approved of the separation of the savings bank, as it had always done, it thought that, under the special arrangements by which practically the whole of the administration of the detail work of housing was to be carried out by the State authorities, it would be able to deal successfully with the administration and control of the savings bank, and consequently it was willing to accept that responsibility. The Government has always been ready to f all in with any suggestion made by the bank, and was perfectly willin g to adopt this suggestion. I came down to the House, therefore, and intimated that we intended to have this amendment moved in another place.",30
80,Mr THEODOBE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"When the honourable member says that the directors of the bank were agreeable to the separation of the savings bank, did they mean that they were willin g to have it under separate control from the main bank?",31
81,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Yes ; and they meant it at that time, because they discussed with me the personnel of the commission to control the savings bank. But what is really brought about by the present amendment is best set out in a report of the National Bank of Australasia, which appears in a circular issued during the time the Commonwealth Bank Savings Bank Bill was under discussion in this House. This report says The present proposals provide that the savings bank business now attached to the bank should be kept distinct aud separate from the other departments of the bank, and be managed by a commission, which is to include otic member - of the bank board, thus maintaining co-operation with the general banking department. It does seem desirable that the two main sections of the bank's business should be operated separately, but the question arises whether this could not be done by setting up different managements under the control of the bank's board, which could, if necessary, be strengthened by the appointment of additional members. That is what is being done, and what has now been suggested by the Commonwealth Bank Board of Directors. The amendment, now before honourable members provides that the Bank Board shall retain control of the savings bank.' I regret that I should have unwittingly misled honourable members in the slightest degree as to the board's intentions. The b i mains unchanged in so far as it relates to the separation of the savings batik from the main bank, but as regards the savings bank branch the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank is willin g to administer it as in the past. The Government is falling into line with that suggestion.",31
82,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Hunter ) [4.16] The amendment to which we are asked to agree will come as a surprise to honordirectors able members who recollect how much, time was taken up here in discussing whether the savings bank should be separated from the Commonwealth Bank. The Treasurer stated that that was really the only point i u the bill.",31
83,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,And he gave specific reasons for having a separate control of the savings bauk.,31
84,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Yes . I think the discussion on the point occupied a couple of sittings. Honourable members of the Opposition advocated no interference with the Commonwealth Bank as it is at present constituted. We thought that it was quite unnecessary to have a separate savings bank, in view of the fact that none of the detail work in connection' with housing would f all on those in control of the savings bank. We realized that the operations of the savings bank would be confined to the lending of money to various authorities in the States who would be charged with the responsibility of carrying out the work of housing, and in consequence of this we vigorously opposed the Commonwealth Bank Savings Bank Bill . Recent events have justified our attitude. The bill had scarcely left this House when we saw a change in the attitude of the Government, and before the measure reached another place the Government had climbed down. In order to justify the attitude taken up by honourable members of the Opposition, I shall briefly recall some of the statements made during the discussion of the bill in this chamber. Speaking on the second reading of the bill, the Treasurer saidThe board advised that its operations would probably be overburdened if it were loaded with the housing scheme. It represented to the Government that, as it was the custodian of about £140,000,000 worth of assets, it could not very well give its attention to this proposed new phase of the Government's activil l reties, and suggested that some other means should be adopted. These overtures took place in July of last year, and then the board passed the following resolution, which I should like to read for the information of honourable members :That is' the resolution which the Treasurer has just read. The board said that it could not accept the responsibility for the administration of a Savings Bank Act because of the great additional work that would be incurred, but when the board of had had the privilege of reading the debate that took place here they began to realise that they had been placed in a very difficult position. They began to think that the public would not expect men capable of administering a Commonwealth Bank to ask the Commonwealth Treasurer to relieve them of the responsibilit y of advancing money to other authorities to build homes for their clients. Finding themselves i u. a false position, they stated their objection direct to the Prime Minister. If the Treasurer was correct when he said that this bill was submitted to the directors in July, 1926, what has been responsible for their change of attitude? To my mind, it is obvious that they had no knowledge of the responsibilities that would be placed'upon them by this measure; they were under the impression that they would be required to carry out all the details of a genuine house construction policy, and they came to the conclusion that that was too great a responsibility; but when the debate in Parliament disclosed that the bank would merely be asked to finance building operations by the State authorities, they rea-"" lized that they had been misinformed. Honourable - members on this side of the chamber believe that an injustice was , done to the bank directors by the Treasurer. We could not conceive that men of their high qualifications would take up such an attitude towards the housing scheme and the Commonwealth Bank unless they were under a misapprehension. In order to clarify the matter, the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) moved that the bill be referred to a select committee to ascertain the views of the directors of the bank on the proposals contained in the measure. The Treasurer strenuously urged the rejection of the amendment, and said that the one principle which the bill contained was the separation of the savings bank administration from that of the Commonwealth Bank. Many honourable members, including some on the ministerial side, were not convinced that that policy was r i g h t ; but, influenced by the Treasurer's statement that the bill was in accord with the views expressed by the directors, they loyally supported him. While the Treasurer was speaking on the 26th October, the honourable member for Bourke (Mr . Anstey) asked this questionWill the Treasurer answer the question raised by the honourable member for Dalley, Mr Charlton. who asked what housing scheme was suggested to the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank?",31
85,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It was practically the same as that which the House recently discussed. The scheme has been modified in a minor way as the result of discussions with the savings bank commissioners in the States; but in principle it remains the same. Subsequent developments conclusively showed that had the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dalley been adopted, much time and trouble would have been saved. In fact, there would have been no need for the bill now before the committee; all that would have been required was authority for the Commonwealth Bank directors to advance money to the State home-building authorities. Either because the directors felt that tlieir good name was at stake, or for some other reason, they took a very firm stand against the Treasurer. I quote the Daily Guardian of the 17th NovemberBACK DOWN BY PAGE ! AMAZING CHANGE IN BANK POLIOS'. No Divided Control. Canberra, Wednesday - After forcing a bill through the Kepresentatives, to divide the Commonwealth Bank control, Federal Treasurer Page has somersaulted in an amazing way. Friction, which has existed for eighteen months between the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank and Federal Treasurer Page culminated in an open clash today. The bank directors won. They have humiliated the Treasurer politically, forced the Government to reverse its policy on the Commonwealth Bank and Housing Bills, and have caused murmurings against the Treasurer among the rank and file of Federal Nationalists. In an eleven days' debate on these measures, all Government supporters, prompted by Dr Page, urged that the only business like proposal was to separate the savings bank from the general bank, and place the two branches under separate control by creating. commissioners to administer the savings branch and ration the £20,000,000 to the States for the housing scheme. Labour argued that divided control was impracticable. Directors' Ultimatum. To-day Mr E. C. Riddle, Sir Robert Gibson and two other directors of the bank visited Canberra, and in an interview told the Treasurer they would not tolerate divided control of the bank. Dr Page capitulated. Though the bills have passed the Representatives he has drafted an amendment on, which the directorshave approved, for introduction in the Senate, restoring full control of the whole bank to the directors. In his own defence Dr Page claims to-night that he freely consulted the directors and mitted drafts of the bills to them. proved of the legislation, but at the last moment have changed their minds. It is known, however, that for months the bank directors disapproved and resisted the Commonwealth's incursion into the State banks' field of building homes for the people. The directors deny that their attitude has changed in the matter, and retort that Dr Page brought down legislation that differed from the drafts he submitted to them. Apparently the directors have declared that the d r a f t measure submitted to them was not the bill introduced into this House. ""When they asked to be relieved of all responsibility in connection with the housing scheme, they were under the i m pression that very heavy obligations were involved. Later they learnt the actual nature of the Government's proposals, and, as the result of an urgent conference with the Prime Minister and Treasurer, an amendment was made in another place. On the 17th I November I asked this question of the TreasurerHas the attention of the Treasurer been drawn to a paragraph in the Daily Guardian of today to the effect that the directors of the Commonwealth Bank deny that their attitude to the Commonwealth Bank Savings Bank Bill has changed, and assert that the Treasurer introduced legislation that differed from the d r a f t submitted to them? W i Treasurer inform the House whether that statement is correct? Dr T3ARLE PAGE-On Monday the Prime Minister in the course of a telephone conversation with Sir Robert Gibson, Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board, ascertained that apparently there was a slight misunderstanding between the board and the Government in regard to the Savings Bank B i l i . At the request of the Prime Minister the chairman and other directors came to Canberra yesterday, and conferred with the Government. They expressed agreement with the bill, which is now, before another place, but said that in view of the contents of that measure and the Housing Bill the board would like the opportunity to administer the housing scheme. An amendment to permit that to be done has been introduced in another place. The inference to be drawn fro m that statement by the Treasurer is tiiat when they found that the housi .ng scheme would merely involve the advancing of money by the savings branch of the Commonwealth Bank, the directors expressed their willingness and desire to control those operations. The amendment made by the Government in another place was sub- to insert the following proviso at the end They apof proposed new section 3 5 F : Provided that, until the appointment of the commission(a) the savings bank shall be managed by the board of the bank; and (6) for the purposes of this part, and of the Commonwealth Housing Act 1927, the Governor shali have all the powers and functions of the Chief Commissioner, and the board shall have all the powers and functions of the commission; and (c) all references in this part (excepting in sections 35F to 35N inclusive) and the Commonwealth Housing Act 1927 to the Chief Commissioner or to the commission shall be read as references to the Governor or the board as the case may be. It is obvious that the Government has adopted this method to get itself out of a difficult position. The Treasurer has said that this is merely a suspension of the proposals for the appointment of a separate board to manage the savings bank. But does any honourable member believe that any Government would, in the near future, propose the creation of a second board? Such a proposal would be resented from one end of Austialia to the other. Already there are too many boards, committees, and commissions doing the work that should be done by l l the Ministers and departments; the Government appoints these bodies at the average rate of one a week, and no fresh appointment of the kind would meet with the approval of the press or the public. One week of the time of honourable members was wasted in debating this proposed separation of the savings bank branch from the general branch of the Commonwealth Bank, while more important business remained in abeyance. Now, in stead of f r a n k ly admitting its mistake, and withdrawing the measui*-, the Government has introduced an amendment to suspend the operation of powers which it knows it dare not exercise.",32
86,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It is a case of "" As you were.""",33
87,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Yes ; but much time was wasted on the proposal that has been abandoned, because the Treasurer persisted with it in the face of the protests of all honourable members on this side of the House and some on the Ministerial side. H a d honourable members known that the Commonwealth Bank directors had not seen this bill, and had not expressed themselves in favour of it, it would never have been passed by this committee. Having seen its mistake, and realized that every word said in criticism of the measure was true, the Government would have been wiser to withdraw the bill and not endeavour to save its credit by a subterfuge of this character. Honourable members on this side of the chamber, assisted by some of our opponents, may at least take credit for having placed the position of the bank in a true light before the public, and for having enabled the Commonwealth Bank directors to vindicate themselves. can understand the Treasurer's desire to let himself down as lightly as possible, but the fact is inescapable tha' this amendment involves a complete reversal of what he has declared to be a vital policy. Our statement that there was no justification for the attempt to separate the savings bank from the Commonwealth Bank has been proved, and the need for careful scrutiny of the Government's legislative proposals has been demonstrated by this unqualified backdown. ""We pointed out that the creation of a' separate board to administer the savings bank branch would mean extra cost and corresponding reductions in the total profits of the bank. We said that this scheme could be administered by the existing Board of Directors, aud they have confirmed our contention. wonders why the Government introduced these proposals without having ascertained the attitude of the Commonwealth Bank directors. I believe that the Commonwealth Bank should carry out the original intention of its founders; that it should be a bank 01 issue, deposit, and reserve, and should engage in all forms of I am pleased that the discussion on the bill has aroused the directors. When they realized how they had been deceived they came to Canberra and saw the Government, with the result that Ministers had this amendment inserted in the other branch of the legislature. It is a complete vindication of the action taken by members of the Opposition when the bill was previously before the committee. Party discipline should not have operated so strictly as it did, when supporters of Mr Charlton. the Government, many of whom were convinced that a wrong action was being taken, were compelled to vote for the separation of the Savings Bank department from the general bank. A week of our time was then wasted, and now we are almost where we were when the' measure was introduced.",33
88,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The amendment does not bring us back to that point.,34
89,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It would have done so were it not for the fact that the Government wished to save its face. It should have candidly admitted that a mistake had been made, and that the One directors of the bank had never favoured the separation of the Savings Bank department. Instead of adopting that honourable course, the Government leaves the matter in suspense so that at any time it chooses it may appoint a separate board without seeking parliamentary sanction. The bill should never have been introduced. Owing to the action of the Government much valuable time, during the last week of the session, will be occupied in the consideration of this amendment, when urgent business awaits our attention. It is clear that the members of the board felt their position keenly in being forced to accept the proposed change. They were under the im- « pression that additional duties would be thrust upon them, and they pointed out that they could not accept them. When One they found that the proposal simply meant handing money over a counter, they came post-haste to the Treasurer, who had the amendment inserted in another place. I should be out of order in moving that the clause be repealed. Since it has been passed by the committee, we must decide for or against the amendment, and I do not see my way banking. clear to oppose it. Mr Tir.EonoKE - Why proceed with the bill? Let the Government drop it.",34
90,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Perhaps that could be done; but it contains certain provisions dealing with another matter, which I think are necessary. If the rejection of the amendment would mean the defeat of the bill, I should be willing to oppose it. If the committee rejects the amendment, and the Senate accepts the bill as it stands, the Government will be forced to appoint the Commissioners. If I can do anything to restore the status quo ante. I should gladly do it. The Government has cut a very sorry figure in this matter. Probably in future proceedings in committee, members sitting behind the Government will take a closer interest in the effect of bills than they did when this measure was going through, and resent being forced, by party discipline, into doing what is not in the best interests of the country.",34
91,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Yarra) [4.45] - Our experience in connection with this bill should make us careful in future in accepting official statements by Ministers. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Theodore) moved for the appointment of a select committe to ascertain the nature of the scheme submitted to the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank, and honourable members supporting the Government expressed surprise at his action. I remember that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro  "" Do you dotibt the statement by the Treasurer?"" Members of the Opposition unanimously pointed out that we did not doubt the authenticity of the resolution of the board of directors; but we questioned whether it had been passed with a full knowledge of the facts then before us. The honourable member for Dalley wished to know the nature of the proposal placed before the board when they decided that they could not shoulder the burden that would be imposed on them by the separation of the savings bank department from the main bank, and that an additional board should be appointed.",35
92,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,On the face of it that was absurd.,35
93,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"So absurd was it that the Opposition challenged the statement. We said that no self-respecting board would write itself down as being inefficient. When the Treasurer was questioned as to the nature of the scheme placed before the board, he replied thit it was practically the same as that embodied in the housing bill. That answer is to be found in Hansard. To-day he tells us that the housing bill was. never placed before the board, and that the only measure submitted to it was the banking bill. But the board carried its resolution with respect to the housing scheme, and the Treasurer said that it was practically the same proposal as that embodied in the housing bill, with some modifications. How could there be any modification of a scheme that had not the been presented to the board ? The Treasurer said that a verbal discussion took place between the chairman and members of the board of directors, and on that they framed their resolution; but we were told previously that the scheme put before them was practically the same as that embodied in the housing bill. The Treasurer informs us today that when he came down with the banking and housing bills, he took it that the mind of the board on the latter measure was the same as on a scheme previously alleged to have been placed before it. When the motion was before us for the appointment of a select committee, the Attorney-General remarked that the only principle involved in the banking bill was the matter of separate control. The point, he said, had been already decided by the House. What more was there to inquire into? Yet, we find that that one principle is not accepted by the board. Under this amendment the Government does not withdraw its proposal, so far as the separation of the savings bank department is concerned, but it will be like Mahomet's coffin, suspended in mid-air. The Treasurer gave the Opposition no credit for sincerity or a desire to ascertain the facts. He took up the attitude that we wished to delay the coming into operation of the housing scheme. We answered his objection by pointing out that a select committee could make the necessary inquiries from the board, and a report could be furnished to Parliament during the following week. The honourable member  gested that our proposal was in the nature of a week-end conspiracy by the Opposition to delay the passage of the Housing Bill, so that when next we appeared before the electors we should be able to point to the fact that the Government's housing proposals had not been given effect. All that our amendment would have meant would have been a delay of three or four days. I remind honourable members that the debate in this House took place on the 2Sth October. It is now six weeks since the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) submitted his amendment for the appointment of a select committee; and, as I have said, the charge then made was that we were seeking to delay the measure in the hope that the Government's failure to pass the legislation would be used as political propaganda. Now we have the Treasurer coming down with an amendment, the object of which is to suspend the operation of a vital principle of the bill. All that has transpired since we raised our objection to the proposed separation of .the savings bank branch from the general branch of the bank has proved us to be absolutely right. Our intuitions on that occasion were correct. ""We'could see the absurdity of the statement that the board had confessed its inability to administer the housing scheme when, as a matter of fact, all that would be required of it would be to raise money and lend it to certain State authorities.",35
94,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,That principle is in the bill now.,36
95,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It will be suspended as the result of this amendment. action has been taken simply because the Government does not wish to acknowledge its mistake and back down. Does any honourable member imagine that the board would represent to the Government that it could not administer the housing scheme? What representations were made to the Treasurer to force him to make such a humiliating statement shortly after the bill had been passed by this House? We can only guess at what was said by members of the board; but it is evident that they told the Treasurer plainly that there was no need to separate the savings bank branch from the ordinary business of the Commonwealth Bank, and that they had been misrepresented by his statement that they had recommended that course.",36
96,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Eve n under this scheme the board will raise money for rival institutions to spend.,36
97,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The honourable member for Lang has said that the same principle remains in the bill. I say that the Government has made a complete backdown, and now proposes to suspend the operation of that principle. To be frank, the Treasurer should strike out* the provision permanently-no t merely suspend it.",36
98,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I think the honourable member misunderstood the purport of my interjection. I said that even now the bank will raise money for rival financial institutions to spend.,36
99,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,What rival institutions has the honourable member in mind ? Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON? - The State housing authorities.,36
100,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The principle I had in mind was the proposed separation of the savings bank branch from the ordinary business of the Commonwealth Bank. That, according to the interpretation of the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) was the only principle involved. We challenged the accuracy of the Treasurer's statement that the board had recommended the course outlined in the bill. What we said then has been borne out by subsequent events. The Treasurer told us that he had discussed the proposal with members of the board in relation to the housing scheme. Certainly he gave This honourable members the impression that he had submitted an. outline of that scheme to the board. If , as he said, the scheme submitted to the directors was practically the same' as that contained in the bill, and if the board had'recommended the separation of the savings bank branch from the general business of the bank why was it necessary for them to come to Canberra for a conference with the right honourable the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, and why was it necessary to have this amendment inserted in another place? The honourable member for Eden-Monaro declared' at the time that the attitude of the board had been wrongly stated by honourable members on this side, and suggested that 'in the absence of any comments by the board, we should accept the Treasurer's statement. Unfortunately for the honourable member, he spoke too soon. It is obvious that the directors resented the Treasurer's implication in his second-reading speech and in the committee stages of the bill, that the burden imposed upon the boardin connection with the .housing scheme would be too great in addition to the ordinary administrative work of the bank. Even the Treasurer now admits that he was wrong. If the Minister would make the amende honourable, frankly, and fairly; if he would admit that he misled honourable members concerning the attitude of the board, he would do much to redeem hislost prestige and to restore the confidence of members in any future official declarations by ministerial heads of departments. The board has shown that there is no need to dismember the Commonwealth Bank in the manner suggested originally. It would be better, therefore, if the Treasurer with- It drew entirely the proposal to separate the savings bank branch from the Commonwealth Bank. In effect, the Treasurer is doing that now. Actually he is doing everything possible, short of repealing it, to render this recent legislation nugatory. The principle complained of is to be suspended indefinitely. It would have been better if the Government had backed down in a frank and honourable way.",36
101,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"East Sydney) [4.59] The original proposal to separate the savings bank branch from the general business of the bank was strongly condemned by honourable members on this side, because the savings bank business may be regarded as the financial heart of the institution. If the proposal had been carried out, the liquid assets of the bank would have been seriously interfered with. The Government's proposal would have meant the appointment of additional commissioners to administer the housing scheme. This, of course, is not necessary since the only additional duties required of the board will be the raising of £20,000,000 for housing purposes and handing it over to other authorities which will be responsible for any actual work done under the scheme. The general opinion outside is that enough commissions and boards have been appointed already, and that the Government would be hard put to it to find any more' of its friends in search of appointments such as these. On this occasion the Senate has been used to correct a stupid mistake made by the Government in relation to the internal administration of the Commonwealth Bank. The manner in which the Treasurer misled honourable members is highly descreditable. I am satisfied that, had the proposal to separate the [110] savingsbank branch from the general business of the bank been considered outside of party lines it would have been defeated. The Senate has sent the bill back with an amendment and the Government has been placed in a very humiliating position. It is unfair to expect members to be in a position to consider fully intricate legislative measures such as have come before us lately in sessions lasting from 11 o'clock in the morning to 11 o'clock at night and sometimes later. is apparent that many honourable members did not understand the main principle of this bill. This Government, before introducing the bill, should have given more consideration to the proposal to separate the savings bank from the main Commonwealth Bank. It should have sought the advice of financial experts, especially the directors of the Commonwealth Bank. It was certainly unwise to introduce it before consulting those who were to be directly affected by the change. When the bill was passed honourable members had been given to understand by the Government that the directors of the - Commonwealth Bank were agreeable to the change, but it has since transpired that they were not consulted by the Government, and have serious objections to the separation of the savings bank. As a result the Government has used its influence in another chamber to amend the bill as passed in this chamber, so that the Savings bank may be carried on as at present, but with a possibility of the separation taking place later. When that takes place it will mean the destruction of the functions of the Commonwealth Bank, and that is the ultimate object of this Government, so that private banking institutions may benefit. If any amendment is moved to prevent the savings bank from being separated from the main bank, I shall certainly cast my vote in favour"" of it. This country is carrying a heavy burden of debt, and although we are facing a serious financial crisis, the Government is still indulging in reckless expenditure. There are already eight directors of the Commonwealth Bank, and yet this Government proposes to appoint a commission consisting of three gentlemen, including a bank director, to control the operations of the savings bank - The Senate should not be able to interfere with financial legislation. The House of Representatives represents the people, while the Senate represents the States, and its principal duty is to safeguard their sovereign rights. The Government has been guilty of political dishonesty in bringing influence to bear upon its members in the Senate to amend the bill. The separation of the savings bank will certainly undermine the stability of the Commonwealth Bank. It is proposed to spend £20,000,000 on housing and to place a commission in control of the scheme. In five years we expended £10,000,000 in settling returned soldiers on the land, and there is little prospect of a return. This Government is more and more placing the control of finance in the hands of outside and semi-oflicial bodies, and I maintain that this Parliament should shoulder its financial responsibilities, ancl that all expenditure should be subject to the searching inquiry of the Commonwealth Auditor General. I enter my emphatic protest against the separation of the Commonwealth Savings Bank from the main bank, but I fear that it will have little effect, since the Government has a majority, and will therefore force this amendment through the committee.",37
102,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Perth) [5.12] - If the Senate's amendment is accepted by the committee the bill will be left in an unsatisfactory condition. As originally drafted it provided for the separation of the savings bank from the main bank, and was eventually carried in this chamber on the understanding that the directors of jthe bank were in favour of the change. It has since transpired that that apparently is not the case, and the Government has now given an assurance that it does not intend t.o insist at present on that portion of the bill that provides for this change. If the amendment is accepted the separation will not take place until the commission is appointed. It has been suggested, meanwhile, that the commission will not be appointed, so that the separation will not take place. It would be very unsatisfactory to place such a bill on the statute-book, and it is unfair to ask honourable members to vote for it. Mr J. FBANCIS - Does the honourable member intend to vote against it?",38
103,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,That will depend upon the information given to honourable members. It is not necessarily a sin to vote against the Government ,38
104,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Ver y often it is a virtue.,38
105,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"If this legislation is placed on the statute-book in the form now proposed, we have, the assurance of the Government that it will not be given effect. I am quite prepared to accept that assurance; but we must remember that this Government will not always be in po.wer. It will be possible for a future Government to appoint the commission and bring the act into force. If it is the opinion of honourable members that the savings bank should not be separated from the main bank, then the Government should make it impossible for that to be done. The Treasurer has now implied that the separation is undesirable.",38
106,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Onl y because the board does not consider the separation necessary for the carrying out of the housing scheme.,38
107,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The Government gave no guarantee that it would not make the change at some later date.,38
108,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The Government has admitted that, in connection with this bill, the savings bank should not be separated from the main bank, but the change may take place at some future date by an order in council for the appointment of the commission. Honourable members have been placed in a peculiar position. If we vote against the amendment, what action will the Government take? Will it give effect to the bill as it now stands, or withdraw it? If we vote for the amendment, we place upon the statute book legislation which we think is unsatisfactory. It would be preferable to withdraw from the bill altogether the provisions relating to the separation of the savings bank. The Government is not treating the committee fairly. It has given honourable members to understand that it is not in favour of this change being made.",38
109,Mr HUNTER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Not at the the presenttime.,38
110,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Why not legislate for this change when it is found to be necessary?,39
111,Mr HUNTER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Othe r portions of the bill would be effective if these provisions were withdrawn.,39
112,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,They could be withdrawn without sacrificing the otljer portions of the bill.,39
113,Mr HUNTER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The savings bank is to ' be separated from the main bank, but - the board, and not the proposed commission, is to be in control.",39
114,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"In reality there will be no separation because the savings bank, although under the control of a separate officer, will still be within the control of the board of directors. There is to be no change in the control of the bank. Mr .BRENNAN - What effect would the dropping of the bill have on the provision of funds under the housing scheme?",39
115,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I do not say that the whole bill should be dropped. As the honourable'member knows, I am opposed to the housingscheme, and therefore I should not worry if the bill were withdrawn altogether. I am not - looking at the matter from that point of view, however. The House as a whole has approved of the housing Scheme, but it has objected to the separation of the functions of the bank. The Government has now agreed that such a separation shall not take place, but this amendment still leaves it open to a future Government to have a commission appointed, ancl to bring about the very state .of affairs to which we now object.",39
116,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Dalley) [5.22] The point raised by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) is important, but is not fatal to the argument that the bill should be dropped. honourable member for Batman raised the question whether the Housing Bill makes f u ll provision for the creation of a fund from which the housing scheme is to be financed. The position is set out clearly in clause 7, and the succeeding clauses. Clause 7 makes provision for the creation of a fund, and states how the fund will be administered. Clause 8 relates to the conditions of advances, and clause 10 provides power for the commission to borrow money up to £20,000,000 to advance to the building authorities. The Housing Bill would not be affected if the Commonwealth Savings Bank Bil l were withdrawn entirely. It might be necessary to make certain amendments to the Housing Bill.",39
117,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Are not certain portions incorporated by reference?,39
118,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"There is a reference to the commission. As the Housing Bill has not yet become law, and is still before the Senate, it would be quite easy to make those relevant alterations there. The Savings Bank Billj as we have it now with the proposed amendment, consists of ten clauses and the schedule. The essential provision is clause 8, which supplements section 35 of the present Commonwealth Bank Act by incorporating new sections numbered from 35A down to 35w. That is the clause which provides the machinery for the creation of the commission. As it is no longer proposed to set up such a commission, there is no longer any need for such machinery. I ask the Treasurer to point out what there is in the Commonwealth Savings Bank Bill which will be necessary when the housing scheme is administered by the present Commonwealth Bank authorities. It is true that there are somewhat extended powers granted in relation to the investment of funds. Reference to these powers is contained in the new sub-section 35w Tyhich provides that the savings bank may invest money held by it in certain classes of advances and investments specifically set out. . It cannot be contended that the Government or the Commonwealth Bank directorate has not power at the present time to do all that was contemplated in that clause, or uncier the bill as amended by the Senate. The bill does not confer any additional authoThe ity; in one instance it restricts the authority now held. It does not confer any more power; it does not facilitate the making of advances for house building. It does nothing but save the face of the Treasurer. The most logical thing to do would be to withdraw the bill altogether, and if the Treasurer were frank he would admit it. He has already admitted that the statements which he made when the bill was introduced regarding the attitude of the directors did not convey the actual position 4 He said he took it for granted that the directors approved of the proposed alteration in the bank's constitution. During the second-reading stage of the bill he was very definite on that point. In reply to the question whether the bank authorities agreed to the alteration, he said:-""I have given the House definite information regarding the actual position."" Well, this afternoon, he disclosed that he had not given the House such definite information as revealed the actual position. We now know that the Commonwealth Bank authorities did not agree to the proposals, and the present amendment has been inserted in the Senate to meet their objection. The amendment we are now considering vitiates the whole of the bill, and renders it unnecessary. The Government should drop the bill altogether, and if it thinks some alteration to the Commonwealth Bank Act is necessary in order fully to effectuate the housing scheme, it can be made by means of a simple amendment. Let me take the Treasurer back over this bill which it is supposed to modify here. Clause 6 provides for the making of a combined statement of accounts by the two branches of the bank; but there will be no need for that now, as the statement as at present issued will meet the situation. Clause 8 is really the essence of the bill, and provides for the setting up of a commission. That is no longer necessary if the Government and bank directors are to administer the affairs of the Savings Bank. There is no need - for a new name for an institution now in operation. There is no need for the setting up of a commission nor any need to make reference to the agreement between the Commonwealth Bank and the States, because they will have their full effect as at the time when they were made; there will be no alteration. There is no need to make provision for a deputy commissioner, or for the behaviour of commissioners, or for declarations of fidelity and secrecy, or for any of those machinery matters. There is no need, in my opinion, to provide for any different way of dealing with the profits of the Savings Bank, or the investment of funds; but. if there is, it can be done more appropriately by means of a separate amendment to the Mr Theodore. Commonwealth Bank Act. I urge the Treasurer to reject the amendment, and enable the bill to be laid aside. If necessary, he can introduce a small amending bill to the Commonwealth Bank Act. The position has been fully traversed this afternoon, and the situation more frankly faced by the Treasurer and the comcommitiee than when the bill was previously before the House. I hope the Treasurer will act on the new experience that has been gained.",39
119,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Swan) [5.36] - I opposed this bill when it was introduced because I did not see any need for it. I thought it was something quite beyond the provisions of our Constitution. The sooner we learn to mind our own business the better. However, we have passed the Housing Bill, and now we have this amendment dealing with the proposed appointment of a commission, and embodying the suggestion of the Government to allow the present directors to control the operations of the savings bank. As honourable members have pointed out, we have left the door wide open ""for another Ministry, or for this Ministry at a later date, to appoint a commission. As the function of the savings bank under this bill will be merely to lend money in large sums to the State or local authorities, it is clear that there is no need for taking that power away from the board of directors. I do not want to destroy the bill, because the majority of this committee desires that it should become law, and that facilities should be provided for furnishing the money, but I do not think that the door should be left open for the appointment of a commission while the operations of the bank remain as at present. The responsibility would be there, of course, but not to the same extent as if the commission were actually charged with the building of the homes. In the circumstances, I think it ought to be made clear that there should be no interference by this or any other Ministry in the control of the savings bank. To that end I move the following amendment :That after the word "" commission"" first occurring the following words he inserted:""which shall only be appointed upon a resolution passed by both Houses of the Parliament approving such appointment."" If there is a desire later to appoint commissioners, a joint resolution passed by ""the Houses of Parliament should confirm the alteration. It is. clear that there is no need for the appointment of a commission at the present time, because the objects sought can be attained under ths present system of control. '",40
120,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Cowper-Trea surer) [5.35] - I Avish to reply to some of the arguments used this afternoon, especially as some are based on wrong premises. I pointed out earlier that the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank still recommends a separation of the Commonwealth Savings Bank from the central bank. They are, however, prepared to control the section of the savings bank if it merely provides funds for a housing scheme of the nature proposed. I wish that to be clearly understood, because it has been suggested quite recently that a separation was only suggested because of the necessity of controlling a housing scheme. The original resolution of the board on this point reads-. . . . that such functions are in way related to the general banking business or to that of a note issue bank or bank, and the board is, therefore, of the opinion that, uncier the circumstances, it would be wiser to accept the proposal ment to separate the savings, bank department from the bank for the purpose of enabling carrying out of the housing scheme. Subsequently I read a statement by Sir ErnestfHarvey in regard to the Commonwealth Savings Bank's association with the central bank, and its recognition by other central banks, in which he said it was of advantage from a central banking point of view for the two institutions to be separated as is proposed. of the Housing Bill, which has already been passed by both branches of the legislature, readsThis act shall be incorporated and read as one with the Commonwealth Bank Act 1911-27. The effect of the Housing Bill is to limit the power of the Commonwealth Savings Bank to lend money for housing purposes, so if the Commonwealth Savings Bank Bil l were destroyed-to use the words of some honourable members-ther e would be no act to which the Housing Bill would apply. If the Commonwealth Bank Act were amended, as suggested by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore), a position which the Commonwealth Bank directors said they could not work under would arise, as the Commonwealth Savings Bank could then deal directly with details of housing schemes. Apart from the appointment of a commission this bill does other things. Clause 8 provides for the status of the Commonwealth Savings Bank to be altered. In proposed section 35w, the manner in which the Commonwealth Savings Bank may invest money is stated. It specifically sets out;35w - (1). The Savings Bank may invest, any moneys held by it (a) in any Government security approved by the Treasurer; (&) on loan on the security of land; (c) in advancing money, in accordance with the Commonwealth Housing Act 1927, for the purchase or erection of dwelling-houses, and for the discharge of mortgages on dwelling-houses;",41
121,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Canno t the Commonwealth Bank do that?,41
122,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"This provides a definite limitation. The savings bank no cannot deal with housing in a general way until regulations have been framed, and a reserve approved by the Treasurer.",41
123,Mr THEODOBE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,There would be no of the Governdifficulty about that.,41
124,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"But under this the bill a definite instruction to the Bank in . . . regard to advances for housing is provided. Paragraph d of the proposed sub-section 35w (1) provides for advancing moneys for the erection of warehouses and storage facilities. Only on Friday I received a letter from the Premier of South Australia (Mr. Butler), in which he said that the State Clause 3 Ministers of Agriculture were satisfied with the clause in the bill covering the points they had raised. Honourable members may recall that I mentioned the point during the discussion of the bill, and the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) also moved an amendment in that connection, the purport of which is incorporated in the measureThe new section provides new methods under which the savings bank may invest money, all of which will be rendered nugatory if effect is given, to the present suggestion of the honourable member. The acceptanceof such a proposal would involve - a complete redrafting of the housing scheme and the introduction and discus-sion of another measure in both chambers. The majority in both Houses is - satisfied with the housing scheme being undertaken through the agency of State instrumentalities, or authorities already - engaged in that work, or authorities established by the Commonwealth Government.",41
125,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,What is the objection to eliminating the particular provision in the measure under which separation of control is provided for ?,42
126,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,This looks like endorsing the principle of separation.,42
127,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The board - favours the separation of the savings - bank from the Commonwealth Bank, but :asserts that the housing scheme provided ""for in the Housing Bill can be carried - out by it. If later it is found by ""the board that it cannot do the work, it will have to make representations to the ""Government. The Government is prepared to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Swan (Mr. - Gregory), which provides that the commission shall not be appointed until a ""motion approving if its appointment is passed by both Houses of Parliament. That will make the appointment of the - commission a matter of Government - policy.",42
128,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,That means that effect - cannot be given to the principle of separation ?,42
129,Mr BEUCE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Effec t will be given to the separation of the Commonwealth Savings Bank and the Commonwealth Bank; but not to the separation of the control of those institutions. Amendment of Senate's amendment {(Mr GREGORYS) agreed to.,42
130,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Dalley) [5.35] There is a good deal in what the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell) hinted that, by agreeing to ihe amendment we are approving of the separation of the savings bank from the Commonwealth Bank. The principle underlying the whole bill is the separation of the savings bank from the Commonwealth Bank. It is true that one of its clauses seems to give the bank additional power to make advances for rural purposes, and to provide certain other powers concerning the nature of the investments which may be made. Such powers, however, could be embodied in a short bill which could be passed in one day. Only today a measure relating to war service homes, founded on a message, was introduced and carried to the second reading stage, aud could have been passed within an hour if necessary. An amending Commonwealth Bank Bill, enabling the Government to carry out-its policy, which is now embodied in - the housing bill, could be handled in the same way and would not meet with any opposition. I do not know why the Government should be so obstinate as to persist with this bill, which consists of ten unnecessary clauses, unless it is merely trying to save its face. It seems that no good purpose can be served by so doing. Can any one say that there is any necessity for setting up this elaborate machiuery for the appointment of a commission, when it is not intended to appoint a commission at present. As the amendmeut of the honourable member for Swan has . been adopted, the commission cannot be appointed until both Houses of Parliament approve. Should it be considered necessary to appoint a commission later a short measure could be introduced for the purpose. Under Standing Order 191 I intend to move an amendment, if not now, at a later stage, to the effect that the Senate's amendment as amended be rejected on the ground that as the bill is no longer necessary to give effect to the Government's policy relating to housing, it should be laid aside.",42
131,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The honourable member wants to secure a majority in the country.,42
132,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"No ; I am anxious to get an instruction from the committee to lay the bill aside. I do not wish the Senate's amendment merely to be rejected and then a message to be sent to another place to that effect, when the Seriate may insist on passing the bill.",42
133,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The honourable member wishes the measure to be repealed.',42
134,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It is not yet a measure. Some honourable members seem to think it is necessary to amend a statute. The bill is not a statute, and the Government could drop it. It would be better to drop this bill and introduce another measure when necessary rather than proceed with what is now only a hotch-potch. I do not know whether this is the proper time to move an amendment such as I have indicated, or whether it should be done at the report stage. If you, Mr Bayley, rule'that such an amendment is in order, I shall move it now.",42
135,The CHAIBMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Mr Bayley) The Senate's amendment has already been amended by the committee, and there- fore it would not be in order for the hon- liament. orable member to move as he has suggested. I point out that he could attain his end by voting against the amendment as amended.",43
136,Mr THEODOBE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I should not attain the same end, sir, as I desire that the bill should be laid aside. I shall raise the point again when progress is reported.",43
137,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The only solution to the difficulty seems to be for the surer to report progress and allow the House to deal with the matter.,43
138,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"My desire would not be met by the mere rejection of the amendment, for then the bill would remain effective. I believe that there is machinery provided in the Standing Orders for the House or the committee to take action which would prevent the bill from proceeding any further.",43
139,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"If the honourable member desires to achieve that end he' may move- "" That the 'Chairman do now leave the chair."" If such a motion were carried it would be the end of the measure.",43
140,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Yarra) [5.52] - The Government should meet the committee frankly. It has accepted the amendment of the honourable member for Swan f Mr Gregory) to the effect that the proposed commission shall not be appointed until after both Houses of Parliament have passed a motion approving of its appointment. If the Government desires to retain any portion of this bill, apart from the provisions in it which sever the savings from the other departments of the bank, it should seek permission to introduce a new measure with the severance clauses eliminated. That would be meetin the situation in a direct, instead of in a roundabout, way. This Parliament surely has to maintain its dignity. It would be ridiculous for us to place upon the statute-book a measure which provides for the severance of the control pf the savings bank departments from the other bank, and the setting up of a separate body of commissioners to control it, but not permit the commissioners to be appointed except by a further resolution of both Houses of Par",43
141,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Why not drop the bill?,43
142,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It appears to me that the measure has not been worth anything like the time that we have been obliged to spend upon it. We were told from the beginning of otir discussion of it that the one vital principle in it was the separation of the savings bank department from the bank. I remind the Treasurer that when the honourable Treamember for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) was speaking during the second-reading debate on the measure, I made the statement that there was to be a complete separation of the savings bank from the Commonwealth Bank, he replied"" No, only a separation of control."" and charged me with misrepresenting him. Separation of control could under the original bill be effected by administration, and need uot involve the passage of any further legislation through Parliament. Now there are provisions inserted that prevent administrative action. ,",43
143,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Then these sections would become meaningless.,43
144,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"That is so. We shall now have one provision which says that the savings bank shall be controlled by a specially appointed commission, and another which says that the commission shall not be appointed, but that the present board of directors of the bank shall retain control of the savings bank. The commission is not to be appointed except by resolution of Parliament. If the board of directors of the bank should find that the dreadful burden of borrowing a few million pounds and lending it in lump sums is too much for it, the Treasurer could introduce an amendment of the act just as easily as he could a motion to provide for the appointment of the proposed commission. I trust that the Prime Minister will allow this matter to be dealt with in a rational way. As the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) has said, if the amended amendment is agreed to a number of provisions in the bill must become meaningless, for one provision destroys the others. I suggest that progress should be reported to allow the Treasurer to eliminate from the bill the provisions which effect the severance of control. It could then be claimed that at least the bill was intelligently drafted.",43
145,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) ![5.57] - A certain amount of confusion has arisen in the committee. The separation of the savings bank branch from the general or central bank involves two major principles, one of which has regard to the housing proposals of the Government, and the other to the functioning of the institution as a true central or reserve bank. The housing policy of the Government was announced at the last election and almost immediately after it was endorsed by the people the Government took up with ""-the Commonwealth Bank directors the formulating of a scheme. The Treasurer has pointed out that the directors definitely declared that they did not desire to be associated with a Government housing policy on the ground that it was not one of the functions of a central or reserve bank, although conceivably it might be a function of a savings bank. After the discussions had taken place the bank directors adopted a resolution, with the.terms of which honourable members are acquainted, to the effect that a satisfactory method of conducting a Commonwealth housing scheme would be to place it under the control of the savings bank and to separate that branch of the bank from the central or general reserve bank. That view, it is only fair to point out, was based upon the idea that the savings bank itself would make advances to the individuals who desired to acquire homes under the scheme. All our discussions with the bank directors were based upon the mutual understanding that the bank should be permitted to fulfil the true functions of a central or reserve bank, which' would' cause it to become the keystone of the financial structure of the Commonwealth. The directors made it quite clear that they considered that if they' participated in a housing scheme it would be difficult for the bank to fulfil its major function of a reserve bank. As the ideas of the Government on the subject crystallized the idea of the Commonwealth Bank making advances direct to persons requiring homes lapsed, and the proposition that it should merely loan mOneys to State instrumentalities and other bodies which would in turn lend to applicants for homes was adopted; but in view of the definitely adverse view which the bank directors had expressed respecting participation in a housing policy it did not occur to us that such an alteration in the basis of the proposal would lead to an alteration in the views of the directors of the bank. The position today is that the directors do not at all agree that the central or reserve bank should be associated in any way with a housing scheme; but only that the savings bank should participate in it . The point which the Government failed to grasp was that, in view of the fact that the amount of detail work involved had been reduced to a minimum, the board r felt that if a separation of the activities of the savings branch from the other branch of the bank were effected it could control both the activities' of the central bank and those of the savings bank. This involves a separation of the two branches of the bank, although both will be controlled, by .the one directorate.",44
146,Mr THEODOBE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Then in what sense will the separation 'take place ?,44
147,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It is provided in the bill that in future the accounts of the two branches shall be kept separate, and it is even contemplated that when an officer of the general bank is detached from it for service in the savings bank certain provisions shall be made respecting his transfer and the maintenance of his rights.",44
148,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The bill is based upon } the assumption that a separate corporation would be set up, but that has all been destroyed.",44
149,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"When the honourable member for Swan moved his amendment the Government agreed to accept it on the clear understanding that if the management of the two instrumentalities hy the one hoard did not prove to be effective it would cause a motion to be passed by both Houses of Parliament approving of the appointment of the proposed board of commissioners. As the savings and the general branches of the .bank would have been separated in accordance with the provisions of this measure that course offers no difficulties. A number of honourable members have discussed whether or not a separation of the savings from the general branch of the CommonAvealth Bank was desirable; but I point out that, irrespective of the Government housing scheme the type of Avork which falls within the province of a central or reserve bank Would make it necessary to separate the tAvo branches. Such a step is vital to the welfare of the bank if it is to be mitted to fulfil its true functions. Only Avhen it becomes a reserve bank will it really be the keystone of the financial structure of the CommonAvealth. .",44
150,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Will the bill as amended effect any change in the status quo ante"" . 1",45
151,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Naturall y there will be a direct recognition of the separation the functions of the savings bank from about ? those of a central or reserve bank. Mr Scullin,-They have always been separated.",45
152,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"No . I can see th^t say there is an impression in the minds of many honourable members that there is no distinction between the status quo ante referred to by the honourable member for Fawkner and the position created by this bill. To get clearly into our minds how very different the position is, Ave have to pany has been managing. concentrate more or less on the objective of making the Commonwealth Bank t8rs really a central bank or bank of reserve. Sir Ernest Harvey, who came to Austrathe lia at the request of the directors of Commonwealth Bank, to advise them hoAV best the Commonwealth Bank could carry out the functions of a central rethe other a central or serve bank, said that it was not custombank, ary or usual to have an activity like savings bank directly connected - with central bank, and he expressed the opinion, already quoted, that there should be a separation, if it Avere practicable, the savings bank and the central bank functions of the bank. The directors of the bank have during the last twelve ; months, been actively negotiating to bring all the Australian banks into line in recognizing the Commonwealth Bank as a central bank for the deposit of their gold reserves. In other words, they have been? negotiating to bring about a general reorganization of the banking system of Australia and provide something which Australia has always needed. It has been very difficult to do this, but I believe that the directors of the Commonwealth Bank are very close to the point at which thisvery much desired arrangement will beachieved. It is unquestionable that theassociation of the savings bank with thegeneral operations of the CommonwealthBank has been a factor rendering that, perachievement more difficult. The bill provides for that separation which is necessary. Although the two branches of activities will be under the same control, there Avill be a definite separation of the two.",45
153,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"At the present time the two funds are separately administered, and the savings bank offices are distinct from the general bank offices. of What other change Avill this bill bring",45
154,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Le t me draw an analogy for the honourable member. If he has a business which has two sides to it he can quite frankly that it is all one business, and that there is no separation. But after a Avhile he may come to the conclusion that it is desirable to .separate the two sides, and, in order to do so, he may establish separate companies', each to take over one'half of the business the old comHe would probably appoint the same board of directo control the two companies, but he would have succeeded in separating two activities. In the case of the the Commonwealth Bank, Ave provide by act of Parliament for tAvo entities, one the CommonAvealth Savings Bank and reserve - but,- as in the case . of thea business undertaking which has been the divided, both kept under the one board; of directors. The Government has suggested that, for the time being, the conr-. of trolling authority of the savings, bank and the controlling authority of the central bank should be the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank. The gentlemen in control of the two entities ivill be the same, but the entities will be definitely separated. In. a time of crisis, it is the hope of the Government to have the Commonwealth Bank recognized as a central bank by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Bank of America. We want to be in a position to say definitely, "" This is a central reserve bank."" But before we can do that we shall have topoint out that it has no longer a savings bank associated with it. If this bill is put through we can say that' definitely. We can say that by act of Parliament the Commonwealth Savings Bank has been separated from the central, reserve bank. Surely that is different from having our bank a savings bank, a reserye bank and a central bank; all one entity.",45
155,Mr FOSTEB,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Would not the same be achieved by making them two departin ments ?,46
156,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,If they were two departments we should be hampered claim to have the Commonwealth Bank recognized as. a reserve bank like Bank of England or the Federal Reserve Bank of America.,46
157,Mr SQUIXIN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,- So it is.,46
158,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Yes ; but that is the ; pointwe are trying to. establish. I cauthe - not understand the opposition of honorreserve - orable members, to a proposal, that seeksquite to achieve the object which the founders of the Commonwealth Bank:had in view-. If we merely separate the bank into-two departments as suggested, by the honorpense able member for Wakefield, when we are discussing the position with one of the great central reserve banks of the world and claiming that we have fulfilled the conditions recognized as appertainit ing to a proper central reserve, bank, we government may suddenly - cannot say that our bank, has truly - complied with those conditions. But. if we separate the two entities of the Commonwealth Bank by the the method proposed in this hill, we can certainly say that it-is properly a central reserve bank. Andthe fact that, the savings banks is run by the same board' of directors twill not affect the position-incepted the slightest degree.",46
159,Mr GKEGOBY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,To no greater extent than does the fact that the Commonwealth Bank also controls the Rural. Credits Branch.,46
160,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Exactly . That is the point I want to make clear. The bill before the committee gives effect to a deliberate policy. Apart from the needs of a . housing scheme it is advisable to have a separation between the Commonwealth Reserve Bank and' the Commonwealth Savings Bank; but in view of the fact that the small amount of additional work the Housing Bill would throw on those in control of. the savings bauk business) the Government recognizes that it is not necessary, at the present time at any rate, to create a separate authority to undertake that work. Had the Government not misunderstood the position of the bank or believed that the bank directorate would not be prepared to undertake this end savings bank work, we should have been the beginning quite prepared to get it to do. the work.",46
161,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"-We are coming, backiu our to that position now.",46
162,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Exactly . The board thenow says that it is prepared to carry out this work, and the Government, is agreeable to an abandonment of the idea that the. control' of the two sides of the bank's activitiessavings bank side and the central or bank side-mus t be separated. I see the force of the arguments-put forward by. the honourable member fhrSwan (Mr Gregory.). He says, "" Whilewe have-agreed that, on the ground of exand on the ground of the amount' of work involved it is not necessary to create this commission and involve the bank, and the country in additional all expense, even with this amendment as comes from another place; any plunge the country into all this expense, whether Parliament thinks it necessary or not."" To meetthat situation honourable member: has moved an. amendment providing that this cannot be done at the whim:or will of any government, but only by a resolution of this Parliament.. The Government has acthat - amendment and thus ensured that a commission which today many honourable members think unnecessary, cannot be created at the whim of any government, but may only be appointed to take over the functions of the savings bank by a resolution of both Houses of Parliament.",46
163,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Will this bill effect in everything but the matter of control, the separation desired by the Government?",47
164,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Yes. It carries out the intention of the Government, except that for the time being, instead of commissioners controlling the savings bank, the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank will do so. * Mr MAXWELL - I quite understand that, but in every other respect separation will be effected?",47
165,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Exactly . The control will remain with the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank until such time as by resolution of both Houses it is determined to create a commission.,47
166,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Hunter) [6.16] Every time this matter is discussed the more fogged we become. The Prime Minister's speech has not enlightened us at all. He has claimed that there are two major principles involved, the housing provisions of the bill and the separa- There tion of the savings bank from the central bank. But it is rather strange that we should have that view introduced at this stage, because previously it was urged all through our discussions that the object of the bill was to remove from the Commonwealth Bank all matters relating to housing and the financing of a housing scheme. It was only after the Commonwealth Bank Board took exception to what had been done, and stated that further consideration should be given to the matter, that an amendment was submitted by the Government in another place to practically suspend the whole of the provisions of the Commonwealth Bank (Savings Bank) Bill. Now the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) has moved a further amendment providing that no Government shall have power to appoint a separate commission to control the Savings Bank without the authority of Parliament. The Government has accepted that amendment, and asks honourable members to agree to both proposals, which, in effect, mean the shelving of all its proposals in this regard. The Government could nav. adopted a very much better .course i i trying to get. out of the difficulty in whicl it found itself as the result of a ver obvious mistake. Instead of acting in. & straightforward way, and admitting fte mistake, instead of saying, "" There has been some misunderstanding;""the directors! of the Commonwealth Bank are prepared) to manage the Savings Bank business) and consequently we are now prepared to allow this legislation to go by the board,"" the Government has brought forward a proposal which can be regarded as nothing but a subterfuge. It could easily have inserted some clauses in the Housing Bill to cover the whole position; but I submit that it was not even necessary to do that. The Commonwealth Bank already has sumcient power to advance money on any acceptable security. No harm would have been done if the Commonwealth Bank (Sav-. ings Bank) Bill had been dropped; or, in view of the work to be done we adjourn, if it had been allowed to stand over. That would have been a more sensible course than the one we are now following. Where is the urgency for this bill?: is certainly need to get money to lend for housing schemes. There is little chance of borrowing money either in Australia or abroad at reasonable rates within the next few months; we shall have difficulty .enough in getting the money that is required for existing needs.. That being so, this measure is by no means urgent. Very few honourable members are satisfied with the turn that, events have taken in regard to this legis-, lation. They realise that a big mistake, has been made, and the simplest course for the Government to pursue would be' to put the bill aside for the time being,. or to admit frankly that there is no needi for it. The bill is almost entirely a» ; machinery measure to give effect to> the-, Government's' proposal to establish a' separate savings bank with a separate-, board. It has now decided that a new' board is unnecessary. In those circum-.. , stances, why persist with this bill ? The- Treasurer said that clause 8 was of importance, but it does nothing that cannot be done equally well without ' it' Nothing in existing legislation - pre'venls"" the Commonwealth Bank from'a&Vah&rhg\° money to local authorities for housing; ithe hank will advance money to anybody who offers adequate security. The Treasurer emphasized the importance of the provision enabling the bank to advance anoney for the erection of warehouses. 'The bank can advance money for any purpose without this special legislation. It is quite clear that this special power - was put in this bill only because the savings bank business and the loans for housing were to be removed from the control of the Commonwealth Bank. The Prime Minister said that this legislation is sary to make known abroad the fact that Australia has a central bank. Einanciers abroad already know that the Commonwealth Bank is the chief institution of its kind in Australia, and has comjplete power in regard to banking. . What *does it matter to the world if we set up another bank to be called the savings bank, or continue the savings bank business under the authority of the general bank, if in either event the same authority will control the business? The mere separation of the savings bank from the general bank would not raise the status of the Commonwealth Bank abroad. In deed, it would have the opposite effect, because the total profits of the bank would be reduced. T never heard the Prime Minister at a greater disadvantage than he was when trying to defend this bill.",47
167,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The savings bank business is kept separate from the general ""business today.",48
168,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"That is so, and the Commonwealth Bank Act requires that their accounts and balance-sheets shall be separate.",48
169,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The honourable member has been endeavouring to demonstrate the unwisdom of separating the two.,48
170,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"My argument applied to the setting up of an additional controlling authority. I say that both branches of the Commonwealth Bank should be under the one directorate. Although they are under the one directorate now, their accounts are kept separately, and this amendment will make no change in that regard.",48
171,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Will the honourable member say what injury the amendment will do to this institution or to any one of its clients ? * Mr Charlton - I have been showing that the Commonwealth Bank will suffer in prestige if it is shorn of some of its business. I am convinced that this legislation represents an endeavour by the Treasurer to give effect to the recommendations of Sir Ernest Harvey regarding the establishment of a central bank which would not engage in savings bank business.,48
172,Unknown,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 7.4-5 p.n,48
173,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I have pointed necesout that Sir Ernest Harvey recommended that the Commonwealth Bank should be placed in the same position as the Bank of England. It was not entirely . i matter of making it a central bank, but that it should be a bank of reserve. The Prime Minister argued that that was what the Opposition advocated. Of course, it is well known that the Labour party considers that the bank should have the fullest latitude in regard to finance. I do not desire to delay the committee by prolonging this discussion. When the bill was introduced it was urged that it was necessary because the board of directors was not prepared to carry out the duties that the housing scheme involved. Now it has been clearly shown that themembers of the present board are prepared to carry out the additional work. They did not understand in the first place that it merely involved the lending of money. Consequently the Government has accepted the amendment inserted in the Senate. This amounts to a complete backdown from the position that it originally assumed. It would have been much better, in view of the decision of the board of directors, if the Government had abandoned the bill, and sought to achieve its object in some other way. I submit that at the present time the bank has power to grant the money required for the housing scheme, which is all that is provided for under the bill. A further backdown on the part of the Government is shown by its acceptance of the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory).",48
174,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Not at all.,48
175,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Undoubtedly ; because it puts it beyond doubt that the Government cannot appoint a new board without the sanction of Parliament. I am not so much, afraid of future governments as the present Government, because it has shown a desire to appoint this board. The amount of time spent in the discussion of this proposal is evidence of that. We have to thank the present board of directors for extricating Parliament from a difficulty. Had they not intimated their willingness to undertake this work the amendment would not have been inserted in the bill in the Senate; but now that the Government recognizes that many honourable members even on its own side are opposed to what was originally proposed, it willingly accepts the amendment. If ever a government has been humiliated in connection with a measure introduced by it, this Ministry has on this occasion. Its aotion has completely vindicated the attitude adopted by the Opposition when the bill was originally before us. There I leave the matter.",48
176,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Batman) [8.50] The - consideration of this bill and the present amendment has obviously caused so much heart burning in governmental circles that one cannot believe that the Government, in accepting this proposal, is taking what it considers to be the best course in the circumstances, and the only natural one to adopt. The Labour party opposed the bill in the first place on a vital matter of principle-the proposed separation of the functions of the savings department from those of the general bank, so as to create a second and entirely nqw bank. We opposed that vigorously, if I may say so, as one who took a minor part in the good work, and although we did not realise it at the moment, we opposed it successfully. We took the somewhat unusual course, in speaking to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore), of inviting the directors of the bank to refer to our deliberations, and the speeches we had made from this side, directed to showing that if the present directors were not able ' to handle this new - function we should be driven reluctantly to the conclusion that they were not fitted for the important work that they were called upon to discharge. And so the Treasurer makes the amende, whether it is the amende honourable, or the amende hesir tante, I am not quite sure; but I am prepared to accept it in good faith. The amazing fact about it is that, scarcely had the amendment been proposed, after most profound deliberation and heart-burning in governmental circles, than a further amendment was moved from the rank and file of the Ministerial party, vitally affecting the amendment before the committee. This was to the effect that the position created by the Senate's amendment should not be varied except by a further decision of the Parliament. That proposal the Treasurer accepted without hesitation and without debate, other than the recommendation of the honourable member who submitted it. It is at this stage that the Prime Minister enters the lists. He asks us not to reject the bill altogether, because he says that, even with the amendment, it makes provision for the separation of the two functions of the bank. Well, with the amendment carried, the Savings Bank Bill remains, and will, I grant, establish a separate savings bank. It will create that strange paradox, a corporation without a body. We shall have a corporation known as the savings bank, with managers who, after all, will be the managers of the whole concern, just as they were before either of these bills was contemplated. I cannot help thinking that the amende is not so wholehearted and frank as it might have been. I feel that there is in this persistent determination of the Government to pass the bill something more than the mere desire to retain what is in the bill. I think that there is a desire to save the faces of the members of the Ministry, and very little else. But there is another aspect of it, and that is that members of the Opposition are not too sure of the whole-heartedness of the Government and its supporters with regard to the Housing Bill. We know that the proposal came somewhat late in the day. A wide hiatus occurred between the election promise of the Housing Bill and its fulfilment. I am one of those who are sufficiently suspicious of the Government to believe that, if the bill were now rejected, it would not be beyond the Government to drop the housing proposals altogether. I do not want any such excuse as that to arise. I am prepared, with my Leader, to rest upon the fact that the Labour party in this matter did a very useful p.ublic service. Indirectly it conveyed a message to the directors of the Commonwealth Bank that was appreciated by them, and they in turn conveyed to the Government a message of a kind that it was not prepared to accept when it was tendered to the Government across the table by members of the Opposition. Without unduly glorifying ourselves for our success, we are entitled to offer ourselves, a little congratulation. I , like the honourable member for Dalley, would prefer that the whole bill should be scrapped, and that the Government should take the obvious course of dealing with the housing scheme, as it well could, through the existing savings ba.nk legislation, or with any necessary amendments of a machinery character that might be thought necessary. But I am not too sure of the whole-heartedness of the Government in that regard, and, therefore; I am prepared to have the large amount of dead wood that we shall have in this bill put by in the legislative wood-shed in the shape of useless legislation, so long as we get the kernel in the for m of the housing scheme, and the Commonwealth Bank will not be rent asunder. Question resolved in the affirmative. Senate's amendment, as agreed to. Resolution reported; report adopted. - TARIFF. CUSTOMS TARIF F. In committee of Ways and Means. Consideration resumed from 6th December (vide page 2707) (on motion by  That the schedule to the Customs Tariff be amended. Item 27By omitting the whole item and inserting in its stead the following item:27. Glucose, per cwt - British , 12s.; mediate, 15s.: general, 15s. Mr Fenton. (Maribyrnong) [7.59] I hope that, in the consideration of the tariff schedule every honourable member, even the Minister for Trade and Customs himself, will refrain from making it a party matter. I do not know whether I am right or wrong in saying so, but I understand that all parties are agreed that requests for increases or reductions in the tariff-should be permissible without any suggestion being made that party issues have been raised. I hope that the debate will be conducted in that spirit. Naturally I do not expect to get all that I am asking for , but I am anticipating that I shall be able to obtain fro m the Minister some concessions in regard to certain items.",49
177,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The trouble is that the raising of duties is regarded by some honourable members as a non-party question, and the lowering of duties as a party issue.",50
178,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"What I mean is that if the Minister definitely ranges himself on one side with regard to the amount of duties that should be levied, there is no reason why members of his own party should support hi m absolutely. I thoroughly endorse this statement made by the Minister wheri introducing the amended tariff scheduleWe in Australia possess wonderful natural resources in the way of raw materials, and we realise that the foundation of our security lies in the control and development of those raw materials. And againThe welfare of its industries is the chief interest of the nation, and nature offers no security for nations which live by the industries of others. The first matter to which I refer is the amended, duties on glucose.",50
179,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Where is the glucose factory?,50
180,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I thought all honourable members knew that it is situated on the banks of the Maribyrnong River, in Victoria. I remind honourable members also that a number of industries in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, depend largely upon the activities of the Maize Products Proprietary Limited .",50
181,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I presume that the brewers would be glad to get cheaper glucose.,50
182,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I do not wish to enter inter- into a lengthy discussion on this item, but I hope that before I resume my seat I shall be assured of some measure of support at all events, from even the honourable member for Swan .(Mr. Gregory), who claims to represent primary producers. Although there may not be much maize-growing in his constituency, nevertheless as a representative of country interests, he should be prepared to do whatever is possible to help primary producers. If the requirements of Australia in regard to glucose were met .wholly by the local manufactures, our maize-growers would have in this respect alone a market for 600,000 bushels a year, worth in round figures about £160,000 per annum. Maize is used for the manufacture of starch, glucose, cornflour, and one of the by-products is an excellent food for cattle and sheep. The glucose factory pays in wages and salaries about £60,000 per annum. It also is of considerable assistance to the timber industry, because of the demand set up for casks for the transportation of the glucose to the several cities in Australia where it is required as the raw material for other, industries. The manufacture of these casks- I understand that the Maize Products Company requires from 20,000 to 25,000 casks a year-give s employment to about 40 or 45 men, and this industry in turn gives employment to between 45 and 50 bush timber workers. Imported glucose, of course, is landed in foreignmade casks and in no way i-.ontributes to the employment of Australian workmen as is the case with the Maize Products Proprietary Limited. All who believe ih decentralization should support my request for increased assistance to the company in question, which is endeavouring to meet the Australian demand for glucose. Last year Australia' imported, from the United States of America and Belgium, 1,270 tons of glucose, representing 17 per cent, of our total requirements."" If the whole of our needs last year had been met by the local manufacturers it' would have meant the' consumption of an additional 106,000 bushels of maize; representing in value about £35,000; 4,000 casks, representing about' £6,000 ; and the payment in Wages to Australian workmen of about £6,000, as well as about £3,000 for cartage, or a total of about-£60,000. I think I have said enough to show that representatives of the primary producers should be in sympathy with my proposal. A great deal of maize is grown at Orbost and Bairnsdale in the constituency of the Minister' for Markets and Migration (Mr. Paterson), and large quantities are grown also in the northern portion of New South Wales and in Queensland. I am not aware if. much is. grown in. Western Aus--. tralia at present. Maize-growers; as' a rule, receive on an average from 5s. to 6s. a bushel for maize. Last year the price rose to as high as 6s. Id. In the United States of America the glucose manufacturers are able to buy the raw material at from 3s. to 4s. a bushel so that they have a distinct advantage over the glucose manufacturers in Australia.",50
183,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The maize growers in America must be having' a bad time if that is all they get for their corn. Mi'. PENTON - Any responsibility for low. prices in that country must rest upon the Government of the United States of America. We have already done something in Australia to protect our maize growers, I presume at the instigation of members of the Country party, including the Minister for Markets and Migration. I do not suggest that the Minister used undue influence. He has a perfect right to look after the interests of his own constituents. All I know is that the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Pratten) sawfit""some time ago to impose a duty of 3s. 6d. per central on maize, ostensibly to meet South African competition. I am making no complaint about that. The maize-grower has every right to seek protection from what he may believe to be unfair competition. After all that is the natural sequence of events in connection with' tariff duties. If we impose substantial duties for the protection of maize; it follows that further protection will be necessary for themanufacturer's of glucose. I wish to make it clear, however, that' increased duties in this item will not mean an increase in the cost of the' glucose to Other' industries-. 1 It is largely used by manufacturers of confectionery, by tanners; brewer's, manuf acturingchemists, biscuit manuf acturer's and bakers. The extent to Which it is used by manufacturing chemists is surprising. I anticipate that the Minister will say that he cannot agree to an increase in the duties, but I should like to make clear to him and to honourable'member's generally that I am not now speaking only on behalf of the manufacturers. Members of the Manufacturing Grocers' Union, an important federated body, have appealed to me' through their secretary, to support a request for an increase in the duties.. I . trust, therefore that. the. Min; 1 ister will deal out even-handed justice. That is all that I am asking shall he done in this case. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) the other day, when speaking to the land tax proposals of-the Government, made it plain that his one object was to ensure even-handed justice being meted out to all sections of the community. I confess that my personal predilections are in favour of doing what is possible to assist the worker. It is my desire that he should be assured remunerative employment so that he may keep his wife and family in reasonable comfort. Unfortunately, owing to severe competition from the United States of America, there is reason to fear that unless additional protection is given to manufacturers of glucose, the industry will go out of existence. On this point the Tariff Board's report statesWere it not for the fact that the leading confectionery manufacturers in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane are shareholders in the Maize Products Company, it is quite likely that the competition from overseas would have succeeded in extinguishing the local industry.",51
184,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The honourable member should read further from that report.,52
185,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The quotation I have read seems to sum up the conclusions of the board. Its members appear to be favourable to further protection being granted to the manufacturers of glucose.,52
186,Mr GBEGOBT,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"""Why not mention the watering of stock?",52
187,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I admit that this company, like many other companies, has watered its stock to a certain extent, but I point out that it has also challenged an analysis of its books. Since its inception its average annual profit has not been more than 13 per cent, on the original share issue, and out of that certain charges have had to be met. Taking into account the - increased capitalwhich some would call watered capitalthe profit would not be anything like 13 per cent. The company is quite prepared to allow the Minister to send one of his officers to examine its books.",52
188,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Is not a profit of 13 per cent., quite sufficient?",52
189,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It is a fair proposition. I plead with the Minister to give this industry some additional assistance, and not to crack the party whip. I hope that he will allow a vote to be taken on this item, to ascer tain the feeling of the committee, and if it is against increasing the duty to the extent that I advocate, then to come to a sensible compromise. The duty proposed in the schedule is 12s. per cwt. British preferential, 15s. intermediate, and 15s. general tariff.",52
190,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,No glucose is imported from Great Britain; most of it comes from America.,52
191,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Some glucose comes from Belgium, but most of it is imported from the United States of America. An impetus has been given to the manufacture of glucose in the United States of America because prohibition has compelled the brewers to engage in the manufacture of commodities other than alcoholic liquors, and among those is glucose. That has caused a certain amount of competition with us in the growing of maize, and today, unfortunately, there exists in the United States of America a combine whose operations are likely to cause the cessation of the manufacture of glucose in Australia. It is, indeed, peculiar that when dealing with the tariff, a firivate member has to move for a reduction in an item in order to obtain an increase in it . It is, therefore, necessary for me to move that this item be reduced by Is. in order to suggest an increased duty of 15s. per cwt. British preferential, 18s. intermediate, and 18s. general tariff. It is unfortunate that we have little time in which to discuss the tariff or any measures that will be introduced before the adjournment of Parliament at the end of this week. I , therefore, do not propose to take up the time of the committee unduly, but since the employment of workmen and workwomen is at stake, I shall fight to my utmost for them. The Minister has sufficient power to protect this industry. Had it not been for the fact that large manufacturers in Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne are shareholders in Maize Products' Proprietary Ltd., its factory would have been closed ere this. Recently I directed to the Minister a question relating to complaints that are being made ih the United States of America regarding the methods of the Customs Department here and the duties - upou glucose. His reply Was very satis1 factory to me, because I was looking for information in the interests of an Australian industry, and the Minister supplied it. Last year we imported from the United States of America £41,000,000 worth of goods, the hulk of which comprised ""petrol and motor cars. country is fast overtaking our trade with Great Britain, and at the present rate of increase in two years'- time we shall be receiving more imports from the United States of America than from the British Isles. The following article appeared in the Harbor, issued in December, 1927:Gold to the value of £2,000,000 was shipped by two steamers which left Sydney for San Francisco during October. A consignment worth £1,000,000 was taken by the RMS. Makura. Almost half of this shipment was made up. of refined gold won in New Guinea. The American mail steamer Sonoma took a further consignment worth £1,000,000. The shipments were made by the Commonwealth Bank in order to adjust bank balances owing to the imports being so much above the value of exports. During the past financial year the Commonwealth Bank shipped to San Francisco gold to the value of £11,000,000, of which approximately £4,000,000 represented new gold. The shipments last week were the first to be made in the present financial year. Australian workmen, enterprise, and capital produce gold within the Commonwealth and its dependencies, only to have it shipped to the United States of America to pay for our excessive .imports. In the item before us, we have an opportunity to limit to some extent the shipping of gold from Australia. We cannot send sumcient goods. borrowing on the American money market, and the American manufacturers are doing their utmost to expand their trade with Australia. Some of them are establishing factories in Australia, and I believe that the tariff will encourage others to come here. Qur imports from the United States of America exceed our exports to that country by £28,000,000. We receive £50,000 worth of glucose from the United States of America, and by increasing the item as I have suggested that money would be saved to the people of Australia, - and a measure of assistance would be given to primary production. Maize is a primary product, and I , therefore, look for assistance from those who claim to. represent the primary producers. I am always prepared to assist rural industries. I should be prepared to support a proposal to. increase the duty on butter from 3d. to 7d. per lb., and on potatoes from Is. to 2s. 6d. I am an honest and consistent protectionist. In this case we are using our own raw materia] and manufacturing the finished That article, and that is one of the finest things that we can do to bring about the proper development of Australia. I ask the Minister not to throw cold water on my proposal, but to give it a trial, and, if it reacts against the interests of Australia, I shall not oppose its withdrawal. I ask the committee to agree to the further increase in duty, which I have suggested in order to safeguard an Australian industry and provide employment for our own workmen.",52
192,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Mr Bayley) I do not wish honourable members to be under a misapprehension regarding the discussion on the tariff schedule. The honourable member for Maribyrnong. has signified his desire to move an amendment.,53
193,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Provide d that the Minister is favourable to an increase in duty, I shall leave in his hands the moving of the necessary amendment.",53
194,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I wish honourable members to understand that, if a motion for a reduction in an item is moved as an instruction to the Government to increase the duty, it does not follow that, if it is agreed to, an increase will subsequently be given. The question as put We are from the Chair will be merely that the item be reduced.",53
195,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I rise to a point of 'order. When the committee is dealing with deferred duties, will it be in order ; for an honourable member to move for the omission of certain words?",53
196,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Not if such a motion involves an increase in the customs revenue.,53
197,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I think it would be well to clear the air in respect of the tariff schedule before we proceed further with the debate. I believe that the Standing Orders provide that a motion may be moved, provided that it does not increase the rate of duty, and, therefore, a motion such as that indicated by the honourable member for Ballarat-to impose a duty at an earlier date than that provided under the schedule-woul d be in order.. I do not think that such ,a motion would corae under the ban of your ruling, Mr. Chairman, because there is no reference to an increase in the appropriation, since there is not one, nor to any indirect result. However, it would, perhaps, be as well to postpone a ruling upon the point raised by the honourable member for Ballarat until we reach the items relating to deferred duties.",53
198,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The Chair can deal only with points of order that have reference to the item under discussion.  Trade and Customs) [8.30] - I think it. is quite obvious that when tariff lutions lie upon the table for some weeks they beget, all sorts of representations, and in some cases it may b'e possible to find out one or two Weak spots in them. At all events it gives honourable members an opportunity to fairly consider what has ' been proposed by the Government. I listened very carefully to the remarks of the honourable member for Maribyrnong upon the subject of glucose, and to the arguments which he put forward for increased protection. The duty has already been increased in the foreign schedule from £12 to £15 a ton, and' I see no reason, as a result' of the representations which have been made to me, both here and elsewhere, to hesitate' at allih recommending the proposals of the Government to the committee. Perhaps it will-clarify the position if' I give honourable members all the information I haye regarding the posi-1 tion. Maize products manufactures of. any sort are of very great benefit to the maize growers, and I realise to the full the importance of such industries. The company engaged in making glucose pays from £60,000 to £70,000 a year in wages to 280 employees;-and uses, in the course of its business, about half a million bushels of maize a year. Such an industry is of the very greatest importance to the primary industry of maize growing, and should receive generous assistance from Parliament. Let us see whether or not the proposals of the Government are fair and reasonable. The : importation of glucose for 1925-26 amounted approximately to 25,000 cwts., valued at £25,000. In 1926-27 the importations showed a very slight decrease; .but were still approximately 25,000 cwts., valued at slightly over £22,000. The Australian production in 1925-26 was 148,000 cwts., as compared with an importation of 25,000 cwts., and in 1926-27 the Australian production was 144,000 cwts. These are the figures of trade and manufacture under the duty of £12a ton, and in. addition totliat duty there is also a duty amounting to £1 10s. per' ton of glucose imported on the casks in which it is packed. Therefore, even under the old tariff, there was a protectionof £13 10s. a ton on imported glucose, and that has been raised to £16 10s. a ton in this schedule. I am reso- giving these figures to show that the proposal of the Government is sound and reasonable, and, may I say^ somewhat generous. In fairness to the Maize Products Company I should say that the price of maize has a very important bearing upon the position; nevertheless, on present figures it seems to me that the Government's proposal covers all the appeals to the generosity of the committee that were made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong on behalf of the maize-growers. I hope that the item will b'e passed as it stands.  - I rise to support the motion for an increase in . duty, and appeal to the Minister to give consideration to the request. It may be said that the honourable member for Maribyrnong is' interested ih this matter because the glucose factory is in his electorate. The same thirig might be said about myself, for maize, from which glucose is made; is grown extensively irt my electorate. Maize-growing; however, is not limited to my area. It is a national industry' and other honourable members also are interested in it. The Minister has made out a case which Would justify a refusal to increase the duty at all equally as well as a proposal to increase it by' the amount proposed by the Government. In 1926, the Tariff Board recommended ah increase of 3s. per cwt. in the duty, but, subsequent happenings have made a higher duty necessary. We are driven into the position of asking for an-increase. The Government has increased the tariff toprotect the secondary industries;and the primary' producers are called upon to bear the burden. people on the land who were free traders in the past have been compelled to ask the Ministry for duties to protect primary products, such as butter, cheese, and timber. We have been driven to see that some consideration is given to the farmers, graziei'8, and other primary producers. The Tariff Board made its recommendations on the evidence before it at the time of the inquiry; but much water has flowed under the bridge since then. The price of maize has fallen in America, and that has a direct effect upon the growers here. The industry is not in so prosperous a condition now as it was, and there is less land under maize than in previous years. In my electorate land which was selling for over £100 an acre can now be bought for a good deal less. Ir, bus been said that this company has watered its shares, and that it has distributed dividends of 134 per cent. One would think from those figures that the company must he in a flourishing condition, yet it is possible to buy £1 shares f u l ly paid-up for 12s. These increases are not asked for so that we may capture rl.ie American trade, but that, we may maintain the Australian industry. Minister.has admitted that 280 people are employed in this industry, but I think there are a good many more. A great many casks are used for packing the glucose, aud. the cutting of the timber used for. those casks is a primary industry: Men are employed in the bush cutting the timber, and other men are employed in the cooperages making it up into casks. I should think that at least -10Q men are employed in subsidiary-industries. That, however, is to adopt a protectionist argument, and I do not propose-to build my case on that. I think the industry is entitled to an increase in duty, and if it was fair that it should receive an increase of 3s. a cwt. in 1926, it is, I think, entitled now to one of os.",54
199,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The honourable member is asking for protection against the protectionists?  cally what it amounts to. The people are being driven off the land because of high wages and increased costs, and it is time they asked for a little for themselves. That is particularly applicable to the Many dairying industry, and it also applies in this case. Except for the importations from abroad, another 160,000 bushels of Australian maize would have been used in the manufacture of glucose, and that would have given a great impetus to maize-growing.",55
200,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Does the honourable member suggest that the glucose manufacturers would have imported maize if - they could have got it here?  have been imported more cheaply. The Minister has granted increased protection on cornflour, which is a product similar to glucose.  2s. 6d. a central on maize.  maize products.",55
201,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"How can the. honourable member say that cornflour and glucose are the same thing?  at any rate, and are made from the same grain.",55
202,Mr MASK,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The honourable member might as well say that boots are the same The tiling as leather.  and glucose are very closely connected. They both concern the growers of maize. If the Minister would grant the extra increase asked for it would leave the industry in practically the same position as it would have been if the recommendations of the Tariff Board had b.een given effect to at the time they were made. Taking into consideration the reduced price of maize in America, and the extra cost of production, due to such things as the reduction of working hours as the result of legislation passed in New South Wales since the report was prepared, and the institution of compulsory insurance in that State, an increase of os. now would just about equal the 3s. recommended by the board in 1926. Neither the Tariff Board nor the Minister is to blame for the late presentation of the report which is now before us for conf o r the first time. The board has made certain recommendations which most honourable members have not had an opportunity to study. If they had noticed that the report is dated February, 1926, they would realise that the whole position has altered, and if the board, instead of this committee, had to consider the question to-night, would have no hesitation in recommendturers ing that the duty on glucose should be creased by 5s. per cwt. I have many other figures which I could submit support of a higher duty, but have no wish to repeat what the honourable ber for Maribyrnong (Mr Eenton) already said. I earnestly appeal to Minister to be as generous in this case he has been in connection with the duties on butter and cheese. He certainly not been as generous in the mathave ter of an increased duty on maize products as I should have liked him to be.",55
203,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Swan) [8.47] - We ought to be very thankful that the Tariff Board submitted its reports year. If , as the honourable member carry  the legislation since passed by the Labour Government in New South Wales and the conditions appertaining to industry manufactured in Australia. generally were taken into account, - would be necessary to increase the duties from other countries. on every article imported into Australia. If the Commonwealth and States Parliai ments legislate in such a way that the - cost of production is increased, it necesin sarily means that customs duties be increased accordingly. If that were done, I do not think it would be very difficult to determine the position we should occupy at the end of a few years. The honourable member for Maribyrnong turers did.

I do not think, however, that the honorRegistrar's able member gave any special reason why the duty should be increased. He only - said how necessary it was to encourage the production of Australian maize, schedule which, incidentally, would provide work for coopers, who, of course, gave work shares to timber-getters; but he quite forgot those employed' in the manufacture ""hoop iron used on the casks and one two other essentials! In dealing with - propositions of this kind, we have to - consider the future of Australia, the that extent to which the cost of production and cost of livin g are being, increased, and it the likelihood of Australian manufacbeing able to compete with other in - countries. . The honourable member for Maribyrnong, in speaking of our trade in with the United States of America, did not suggest the possibility of Australian memmanufacturers being able to compete has abroad with other countries in the manuthe facture of glucose, cornflour and other as commodities. Are we in the position that we must never dream of exporting the has products of our secondary industries? I read the T a r i ff Board's report, and cannot understand what induced it to agree to an increased duty. If the board considered that a higher duty was necessary it should have shown that the company, which is employing a large numlast ber of men, was failing , and could not on in face of the competition from foreign manufacturers. According to the figures quoted by the Minister, nearly the whole quantity of glucose used here is There is it only a very small proportion coming Is that small quantity affecting the local industry, and f so, in what way? The whole difficulty is that with these small imports coming the company cannot increase the price must as it would like to do.",56

The 1924 reports showed the company registered with 600,002 subscribed and £2 in cash. The number of shares in the fully paid-up, otherwise than in cash, is over 500,000, and there were a number of (about 63,400) issued partly paid-up to 14s.

I am informed thatThe local company has enjoyed a protection of £12 a ton on glucose and £1 6s. on barrels, making a total duty of £13 6s. a ton, which equivalent to 145 per cent, on American home consumption value. Imagine protection of 145 per cent, on the American home consumption value! Not being satisfied with that, the duty has been increased by £3 a ton, thus bringing the protection up to 168 per cent, over the home consumption value in the United States of America. Surely a higher duty is not needed. The manufacturers of products from maize in the United States are competing with the manufacturers in the other parts of the world, and are providing good conditions and pay wages as high as we do. I intend to move for a reduction in this duty which is too much to give to one company. Unless we have some competition from outside, we shall be dependent solely upon Australian supplies.",57

I cannot understand why some honourable members should be in favour of increasing the price of the working man's beer and the cost of sweets to youngsters. The price paid today for lollies is so high that one gets only about six chocolates for 2s. I should like to have a firm option over a number of these shares at 12s.",57

Has this company been subjected to any intense competition? The Minister's figures show thai it has not. I was pleased when I first heard that a maize products company was being established; I thought it would assist persons engaged in the production of maize, and that possibly there would be a surplus which it would be able to export. Is it essential, however, that Parliament should be asked to impose a duty up to 168 per cent, whenever a person says that I he is going to start an industry? It is monstrous. I have never advocated absolute free trade, and I would not be opposed. to the duties which were first imposed under our protective policy, which were usually from 10 to 20 per We should not, however, be asked to protect industries for all time. honourable member for Maribyrnong said that if the duty is increased it will be the means of assisting other industries which he enumerated.",57

The Minister for Trade and Customs is empowered by act of Parliament to i m pose an extra duty on goods which are' being dumped here,'and, so far as I aware, he has administered the measure effectively. He has not suggested that glucose is being dumped here, although the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) has done so.

An inquiry along those lines in this case is enlightening. The report of the under Tariff Board on glucose gives quite a lot r of information of a kind that is not It states, for instance, that Maize Products n Proprietary Limited commenced operations in 1913 with a nominal capital of £50,000, of which £34,000 was taken into cash, but by 1924 the stock had been and watered to such an extent that the nomto inal capital had been increased to",58

222,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Nevertheles s that is a remarkable development in eleven years.

The honourable member for  shares were on sale at 12s., but the Tariff am Board has pointed out that some of the shares are only paid up to 14s. .On this point the following paragraph in the board's report is interestingEven though Maize Products Proprietary sales had fallen off slightly during the past twelve months) their turnover had increased, and through the company having such monopoly their shares are unprocurable, nor can any record lie found of sales having taken place. The dividends are evidently too good to part with the shares. In the light of that statement how can i be argued that this company is suffering severely from competition abroad? I have often heard protectionists say that they favour the imposition of duties only until an industry becomes properly estabpeople lished. ""What does that mean? The late Major Oakley, as chairman of the Tariff Board, made the statement on one occaitems sion that when a company had secured fair proportion of the local market i should cease to require special protection. This company has secured 87 per cent, the Australasian market. Mi . CORSER - It . is the maize-growers 1 who want this protection.",58

225,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Now we have it. The honourable member for' Herbert (Dr Nott) declares himself to be a proagain hibitionist. He would eliminate all petition.

I am amazed that increased duties are being imposed by this amended schedule on no less than eight of food. Seeing that our economic a conditions are unsatisfactory, and that t there is much unemployment, and distress in the community, we should not be putof ting extra duties on foodstuffs.",59
226,Mr COOK,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Is it a time for us to export gold to pay for goods we import ? Mr MANN. Why not? The honourable up member gives no reason why we should the not. We have heard a great deal quesaboiit the price of maize and the a effect this, duty is likely to have on the maize-r'gi'ower. We have been asked to impose this duty for his per sake. But has not the maize-grower been given, a duty? Has not his case, already the been favourably considered by the Government?

228,Mr COESER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The honorableimember is in missing all the points.,59
229,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Late r on the honourable member can make all the points: I am - giving himplenty of material to make a: speech; It is evident that the honourable member recognizes the cogency of my argument. But this is not the time to consider the maize-grower; this item has nothing to do with him. He is already afforded heavy protection, and the honourable member for ""Wide Bay has no right to bring him into the discussion of a duty intended to protect the glucose manufacturer. I have already pointed out that, from the glucose standpoint, the duty on maize represents £5 5s. per ton, and if to that is added the extra duty of £3 per ton now proposed for glucose, it gives to . the glucose manufacturer total extra protection of £S 5s. a ton. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) has said the manufacturers of ""glucose have guaranteed that if this extra duty is imposed they will not increase their price. What authority has the honourable member to give such a guarantee ? We had a similar statement in regard to the steel manufacturers. gave an undertaking to the Minister for Trade and Customs, and I believe that they kept it, but we have heard nothing from them in regard to the new duty: : That, however, is another question. do not know that the honourable member for Maribyrnong can give any guarantee that the manufacturers of glucose will not raise their price. But even if the guarantee he has given be reliable, I want to ask why we cannot sometimes have a guarantee to reduce the price. Why haye we always to consider living at present prices? We are now assailed by competition from countries that are reducing their cost of production. are surrounded by countries, who either by working harder or by employing better methods, can produce more cheaply than Australia. Yet we are apparently to main in our isolated position with prices going up or maintained at their present, high level. As a matter of fact, we are having these increased duties not because the manufacturers are doing badly-the records show that they are not-but for an entirely different reason. World prices are rapidly diminishing, and the people of Australia will not be content to maintain costs of living owing to the high taxation they have to pay. The Australian manufacturers realise that presently there will be so much competition from outside Mr Mann. that their prices will have to be brought down, and the only way to prevent it from happening and prevent the public from having a moderate and sensible cost of living is to impose higher duties. In a word, the purpose of this tariff is as much to prevent prices' from coming down, just as they are coming down in other parts of the world, as it is to send them up. The effect of these duties will be either, to maintain prices or to prevent them from falling. The duty on glucose has no relation whatever to the duty on maize, and should not be considered in a the light of affording protection to the maize-grower, who is already covered by another item in the tariff. No industry is entitled to come here and ask for a concession because already a concession has been given in another direction. Mr J . FRANCIS - This duty is to afford protection to a by-product of maize. They Mr MANN - In giving protection to one industry we must always be careful that we are not increasing the cost of production in another direction. By increasing the duty on glucose we are bound I to cause a rise in the cost of the raw material used in certain industries which are dependent on glucose, and thereby we shall be raising the cost of living. I have read the reports of the Tariff Board carefully, and I do not think that any of them discloses a clearer case against increased duties than is given in their report on .glucose.",59
230,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The Tariff Board has recommended this duty. We Mr MANN - I know that the Tariff Board has recommended this duty, but if we are bound to accept its reports we might as well shut up Parliament and re- give the Tariff Board the task of imposing duties. Cannot we exercise any discretion in the matter?",60
231,Dr NOTT,COMMONWEALTH BANK,No ; let us take the advice . of theorists!,60
232,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The honourable member evidently wants us to take his advice, because the protectionist who is all the time trying to argue against the accumulated facts which are demonstrating the failure of his system is a pure theorist. The old duty on glucose was equivalent to 127 per cent. The duty was £12 a ton under all three headings, plus a duty of £1 9s. Gd. on casks. As far as I can gather this duty on casks is confined to glucose and wine casks. Why, I do not know.",60
233,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I am told that the casks can be sold for 9s. each.,61
234,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Accordin g to the Tariff Board glucose casks are worth 3s. each, but in most cases they are simply broken up.",61

With the new duty the total protection will be 145 per cent.",61
237,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"There is already a duty of 250 per cent, on maize, which is the raw material, but I am not complaining of that.",61
238,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"We have already a tremendous duty on maize. Does the honourable member claim that because we have increased the duty on maize'we must increase the duty on every commodity into which maize enters ? If so he is drawing attention to the tragedy of this system of protection. It is all right when it is applied to one or two commodities, but if applied all around the position becomes absolutely hopeless. If it is applied to the basic material and must be applied at every stage in the manufacture of that material, the cost of each manufactured article in the series gets higher and higher until it eventually reaches a height of cost almost beyond contemplation. And then honourable members talk about diminishing unemployment. It seems to me that their idea is to make everybody prosperous by making everybody poor. Unemployment increases the moment we diminish the purchasing power of the community. The imposition of duties and the subsequent higher cost of living make drains on the wage fund that it will not stand. Yet honourable members continue this policy by which more and more men are thrown out of work. The unemployment that it is said we have today is the result of the handiwork of those who will not recognize economic truths and persist, against their better judgment and in spite of the facts brought home to them, in the imposition of higher and higher duties. The blame for the present unemployment rests upon them. The unemployment of today is bound to be increased by the imposition of this schedule of duties.  proposed duty on glucose would not afford any protection to the primary producer.",61
239,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It would protect the industry that provides a market for him. Mr J. FBANCIS - The maize-growers say that it would be a protection to them.  impose a duty higher than the value of the maize itself- a duty that would be more than equivalent to supplying the industry with maize free of cost. This protection cannot be given except by penalizing the children and increasing the cost of living. Surely the present adverse trade balance and unemployment are finger-posts warning us that we are moving in the wrong direction. Instead of continuing in that direction at an accelerated pace, we should call a halt; yet honourable members are continually contending for a higher tariff, which will only make the position of the Australian producer more difficult. The interest on the national debt cannot be paid by secondary production; the only articles we can export are primary products, and the country is dependent upon the oversea sale of them to pay the annual interest bill. The primary producer is being asked to carry too great a burden.",61
240,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Ballarat) [9.33] - As an Australian and a protectionist, I desire that the schedule shall be adopted as speedily as possible, subject to such amendments as will make the protective policy more effective. But I have long ceased to believe that either protection or free trade will make poverty impossible. It amuses me to hear the free traders talking of free trade as a solution of the problems of unemployment and poverty. Great Britain is a free trade and low-wage country, and today over 1,000,000 of its people are out of work. When, during the great war, there was a possibility of this country being isolated from other parts of the world, the conviction was driven home to me that Australia should be self-contained, as far as possible, and produce all its own requirements. Looking to the future, I wish to obviate the possibility of our people being again dependent upon any other country in the event of another great war. The glucose manufacturers have done good work in the production of by-products from maize. I know that they are not guiltless.; they made huge profits during the war, and they have since watered their stock. But they are not alone in those faults. If , through the wasting of their profits, the shareholders are not prosperous today, I will not deny them the measure of protection that is necessary to enable them to carry on. I am sorry to say I know of many instances of the watering of stock; but that practice is not peculiar to Australian manufacturers - it is world-wide. My view as a protectionist is that, if there is to be a poly I would sooner that it were in Australia, so that we might have some chance to control it. MACRobertson, who is a large shareholder in the glucose company, has done wonderful work for Australia. Any one who has travelled the world will appreciate the fact that, largely owing to his persistence and enterprise, Australian chocolates and confections eminent, and the imported sweets cannot compete with them. We should be proud of that great Australian industry. If the proposal of the honourable member for Maribyrnong is not adopted, those who imported 1,270 tons of glucose last year at very low prices, will find it profitable to continue importing an increasing quantity from year to year, in the hope of crushing out the Australian industry. Whilst the consumers might temporarily enjoy the benefit of cheaper confectionery, as a result of this competition, they would eventually pay dearly for this luxury if the Australian industry were destroyed. I want to see Australia become a big nation, and in respect of commodities of which our manufacturers can produce the requisite quantity and quality I would not bother with a tariff; I would adopt simple prohibition. The manufacture of glucose is giving employment to a large number of farmers Mr MCGRATH. in Victoria, and I shall be surprised if the Minister for Markets and Migration  quest for an increased duty in order to help the maize growers in the Bairnsdale district, who are largely dependent upon the manufacture of glucose. The potato growers - also may find themselves beholden to this secondary industry. One company is being formed in Victoria for the production of glucose, starch, and other by-products from potatoes. If this industry succeeds it will help to stabilize the potato market. Instead of potatoes being sent long distances to a glutted market, they will be bought by the factories at prices which will be profitable to the growers. I hope that the Minister will be true to his protectionist principles, for which even honourable members of the Opposition at times are impelled to cheer him, and will grant the request made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong. If an increased mono- duty is imposed, and the glucose manufacturers take advantage of it to exploit the people, a future Parliament will be able to deal with them. Our first consideration, however, must be to preserve the factories that have been established, and enable .them to compete against imports from abroad.",61
241,Dr NOTT,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Herbert) [9.40] - I supare preport the request for an increased duty on glucose. I have always considered it a cardinal postulate of economics that a nation should be as far as possible self-contained. I regard the policy of protection as an economic expression of patriotism; therefore I have no difficulty in supporting the schedule introduced by the Minister, and, unless good reason to the contrary be shown, I shall even go so far as to support the request made by the honourable member for. Maribyrnong. I have listened to the speeches of the free trade trinity from Western Australia-the honourable members for .Forrest, Swan, and Perth-wh o are so definitely linked with the past that they remind me of the platypus. The policy they advocate, if applied to Australia, would have no beneficial effect upon employment, and would not solve any of the great economic problems that now confront us. The spiritual home of the free trader, England, is a striking example of what free trade cannot do for a country. The honourable member for Perth (Mr. Mann) always speaks thoughtfully, and ticle prepares his speeches carefully; thereMost or at all . events fore 1 was surprised to hear him that the suggested increase of the on glucose would be of no benefit to maize-grower.",62
242,Mr MANTT,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I did not say that. said that this duty did not concern the maize-grower, because be was already dealt with very liberally.",63
243,Dr NOTT,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I accept the honourable member's correction; but, lest he should harbour the idea I have attributed to 1 assure him that the proposed increase article. would be of considerable assistance the maize producer. According to the Tariff Board's report, 'not less than 500,000 bushels of maize was used last year in the production of glucose. Honan orable members will recognize that the secondary industry already provides a considerable market for the maizegrower. Some honourable members have suggested that the maize-grower amply protected by the duty of 3s. 6d. per central on maize; but I remind them that that duty was imposed for the specific purpose of protectt.o ing Australian maize-growers against the unfair competition of the black-grown maize of South Africa. Not only was the South African maize produced by coloured labour earning very small but the export of it was helped by vernment subsidy. In those circumcompany's stances it would be presumptuous to say that that duty alone is ample propany tection for Australian maize-growers against competition from South Africa. I have never swerved from my advocacy of a complete embargo upon products grown by black or Oriental labour when they come into direct competition Australian-grown products.",63
244,Mr MAIW,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I do not think that the that honourable member appreciates my arguthe ment.,63
245,Dr NOTT,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It seems to me that the honourable member himself is not fully conversant with the conditions in the dustry. It is admitted that 87 per cent, of the Australian market is at present supplied by this company, but it will unable to retain that business if the American product is allowed to enter Australia without a sufficient impost to keep the production of the imported arupon a competitive basis. a very say considerable portion of the maize duty used in America is produced by the black labour. The second largest competitor is Belgium, and in both those I countries-in Belgium above all placesthe agricutural labourer receives notoriously low wages. This is reflected in the price of maize in those, countries. Therefore, the 87. per cent, of the trade that the company controls at the present time cannot be retained unless a sufficiently high him, impost is placed upon the imported The Tariff Board reports to that in view of the competition from abroad and the cost of production, the industry is in need of further protection. That opinion was formed as a result of unbiased view of the whole position, and I have no hesitation in making my views coincident with those of the board.",63
246,Mr GEEGOKY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,What about the finanis cial position of the company?,63
247,Dr NOTT,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I have not had time to review the whole of the evidence presented the board; but I notice that there has been a watering of the company's stock. A dividend of 12-£ per cent, has been paid - actuall y 4 per cent, on the watered stock - r-but, in view of the conditions in wages, the industry, that fact gives no a Goground for undue optimism as to the future, unless it receives adequate protection. I notice that the comshows no reserves. I do not pretend to be familiar with all the circumstances controlling the activities of the company, but the facts that it has no reserves and that many shareholders are important persons in the confectionery with trade seem to me to be significant. The honourable member for Perth suggested that the fact they were shareholders in company indicated that there was a motive behind the request for additional protection; but let me point out that if these confectioners were not shareholders, inin all probability the industry would not now be in existence. By supporting the industry the shareholders connected with be a kindred trade have enabled the company to continue in operation. Without that support there would be no glucose industry in Australia. I am not unduly alarmed even by the sentimental aspect presented by the honourable member for Forrest and the honourable member for Perth, who spoke qf the damaging effect from a dietetic point of view of such a tariff upon children. When - we examine the reports regarding the physique of school children, we find that it is not so much the food, or the cost of the food, that has lowered their physical powers of resistance, as the unsuitableness of the food given to them. Those foods that for the most part contribute to their health are not unduly dear, provided they are supplied at the right time and in the right quantity. I further venture to suggest that if the company whose operations are under consideration made glucose out of wheat, the honourable member for Forrest would be found to be an ardent supporter of its request. ",63
248,Dr NOTT,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"But as the company uses maize and not wheat, he cannot dissociate himself from his free trade convictions. I hope that the committee will not take up the free trade cry too seriously. I have great pleasure in supporting the proposed duty.",64
249,Mr COOK,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Indi) [9.52] - I intend to support the item, because it means that relief will be given to a section of the primary producers, and, indirectly, to an industry in which the whole community is interested. The honourable member for Perth favours sending gold to the United States of America to pay for the 1,270 tons of glucose imported year. Is it reasonable to export gold to America to bring to Australia products that we can grow ourselves, and grow in abundance, if the producers receive fair treatment? The imports of glucose last year amounted to the equivalent of 500,000 bushels of maize and from the United States of America alone the imports amounted in value to about £40,000. The Australian producer has to contend with the Navigation Act, the Arbitration Court, customs duties and profiteers. No wonder people are leaving the land. I am surprised at any honourable member uttering one word against the proposed duty on imports from a foreign country on goods that we can supply in abundance ourselves. Maize is produced in America and South Africa under such cheap labour conditions that we cannot compete under our Australian conditions. Although the industry is in its infancy in Australia, I believe that it has a great future. I agree with honourable members opposite that it is far better to have combines in Australia than abroad. If the manufacturers treat the public unfairly, it will «be competent for this, or some future Parliament, to deal with them. I support the item as it stands, feeling confident that a substantial increase is warranted. Mr J. FRANCIS (Moreton) [9.56] I support the increase in duty on glucose from 12s. British preference, 13s. intermediate and 12s. general tariff, to 12s. British preferential, 15s. intermediate, and los. general tariff, as proposed by the Minister, and strongly oppose the reduction asked for by the honourable member for Swan. The Tariff Board was specially appointed by Parliament to examine requests for increased duties from every possible angle. As a result of years of experience, the members of the board have become specialists, and members would be well-advised to be guided by their expert opinion rather than enter into an unholy free trade alliance with the honourable members for Swan, Perth and Forrest. After thorough investigation the Tariff Board has recommended this increase, the recommendation has been reviewed by the Minister and the Cabinet, and I last hope that the committee will accept the duties brought down by the Minister. The board took into consideration the cost of manufacture and the cost of corn and glucose, both here and in foreign countries such as America and Belgium. The industry can only be carried on in Australia because the sweet manufacturers are the main shareholders of the glucose manufacturing industry, and always secure from this company the glucose required for the manufacture of confectionery. The industry provides work and wages for over 250' persons, and four times' that number are indirectly engaged in the industry. From 20,000 to 25,000 containers, made from wood grown in our own forests, are used in the industry, and wages to the extent of £60,000 a year are paid. If the tariff is not increased, the industry cannot continue. Tens of thousands of maize producers are entitled to the protection that they will indirectly receive under this proposal. The Minister was good enough recently to bring down a tariff that gave the producer a direct protection of 3s. 6d. per central on maize, and an embargo on black-grown maize from South Africa was also imposed. Now the whole of that protection is undermined by the importation of a by-product of maize in the form of glucose. I maintain that a reasonable proportion of Australian market should be kept open to Australian maize-growers. The primary producer is entitled to have the home market secured to him by this measure of protection. Australia imports 1,270 tons of glucose, representing 106,520 bushels of maize, from' the United States of America. This importation is likely to be increased. The more maize is imported into 'Australia the more our home market is reduced to our own product. I hope the committee will support the proposal. I had intended to discuss this question at greater length, but since speakers have addressed themselves to the subject, I shall not detain the committee longer. No case has been made out by the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory), the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann), or the honourable  reduction in the duties from 12s. British, 15s. intermediate, and 15s. general, to 10s. British, 10s. intermediate, and 12s. general. I am not a believer in the antiquated and universally rejected principle of free trade. On these grounds I strongly support the proposed increased duties and oppose the amendment to reduce the tariff.",64
250,Mr SEABROOK,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Franklin) [10.2] As far as I can see this is not a question of free trade or protection. The schedule proposes to raise high duties to a higher level, and the suggested amendment seeks to reduce the duties in the general tariff to the level of last year. Mr J. FRANCIS - No ; much below that level.",65
251,Mr SEABROOK,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"No one can accuse me of being a free trader. I believe in protection, but under certain conditions. This is a proposal to increase the duties on glucose from 125 per cent, to 145 per cent. That, in my opinion, is too high. ""We should not forget that glucose is the raw material for a number of other important industries in the Commonwealth. It is largely used in the manufacture of biscuits and confectionery.",65
252,Mr FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,And beer.,65
253,Mr SEABROOK,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"For the time being I shall leave beer out of consideration, and the confine my attenton to the effect of these duties on the manufacturer of biscuits and confectionery. Thousands of men, women, boys and girls are employed in those industries. One of the largest manufacturing confectioners in the Commonwealth is established in my electoral division. The products of Cadbury, Fry, and Pascall, which are manufactured in my electorate, are admitted to be as good as any in the world. I am advised that it will be impossible for that firm' and other manufacturers of confectionery to pass on the duties. Consequently, they will fall directly upon those manufacturing conmany cerns. There is a possibility that these increased duties to benefit the Maize Products Company may have the effect of closing a number of confectionery and biscuit factories. The report of the Tariff Board, to which reference, has been made by other honourable members, statesThe price of maize in Australia during the last five years has not varied more than 3d. per bushel on the mean average. In 1921 actual sales made for milling maize were from 4s. 3d. to 6s. per bushel; in 1922, 4s. 10d. to 5s.; 1923, 5s. to 5s. 10d.; 1924, 3s. lOd. to 6s.; 1925, 4s. 3d. to 5s. lOd.; the mean average prices for these years being 5s. l^d., 5s. 2}d., 5s. 5d., 4s. l i d . , and 5s. o|d., indicating that the last two years have been the lowest years in maize. Apparently _ the price this year will be much lower than in former years, because there has been a splendid season in Queensland and in parts of New South Wales. If there is over-production, naturally prices will come down. It follows then that if extra duties are imposed, and if, as is anticipated, prices for maize decline, the Maize Products Company and not the grower, will secure all the benefit. Honourable members should consider the effect of thp, increased duties on other industries. Apparently higher rates will benefit only the manufacturers of glucose.. I notice also in the report of the Tariff Boarc a statement that when it was not 1 possible for manufacturers to obtain glucose from America, the Maize Products Company immediately raised its price, and when imports of glucose were again on the market, the company dropped its charges. It is evident from what has happened in the past that if increased duties have the effect of checking importations, the price of the local product will rise.",65
254,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,My information is that the company raised its priceby 30s. as soon as the new schedule was laid on the table.,66
255,Mr SEABROOK,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"That is one of the dangers that we have to face. I understand that the only two manufacturers of confectionery in South Australia are shareholders in the Maize Products Company, and that they informed the Tariff Board that they did not desire increased duties on glucose. The manufacturers in Tasmania are in the same position. There is every probability, therefore, that increased duties on this article will seriously penalize manufacturers of confectionery and biscuits. Any industry that is protected by 100 per cent, duties, and requires additional duties to enable it to carry on, should cease operations. I shall support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory).",66
256,Mr KILLEN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Riverina) [10.11] - I was rather surprised to hear the arguments from this side of the committee in favour of an increased duty on glucose. It has been, said that the duty would benefit the maize-growers, but I contend that they have sufficient protection already, if not too much. I am a primary producer, and the industry with which I am connected receives no protection. We are not asking for protection, but I submit that, where necessary, the primary producers have as much right to be protected as persons engaged in secondary industries. Unfortunately, it is impossible to protect some primary industries. Although those engaged in rural industries are producing 73 per cent, of the wealth of Australia and 96 per cent. of our exports, they are receiving little benefit, indeed, from our policy of pro* tection. The duty on glucose is already high enough, if not iOo high. It has been said by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann), that the duty will amount to 148 per cent. My estimate is SO per cent.",66
257,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The honourable member is not taking the natural protection into account.,66
258,Mr KILLEN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I admit that. The industry is now receiving a protection of 60 per cent., and the natural protection would increase it to 80 per cent, or 90 per cent. That is quite sufficient, if not too much, protection for any industry. I have always favoured a reasonable protection of industry against foreign imports manufactured by cheap labour. This duty certainly goes further than that. Generally speaking, the maximum protection should not be. more than 35 per cent, or 40 per cent. It has been calculated that natural protection to an industry is from 25 per cent, to 41 per cent. That has been given in evidence before the Tariff Board, and I think is not questioned.",66
259,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The percentage varies with different classes of goods.,66
260,Mr KILLEN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Wit h light goods it is less than with heavy goods. The average is about 30 per cent. Any industry that is protected to that extent, and cannot progress, does not deserve encouragement. In 1923-24 the total value of all industries iii Australia was £348,577,583, the salaries ancl wages paid in these industries being £77,278,265. In 1925-26 the total value of the output of all industries in Australia was £449,157,000, the salaries and wages paid amounting to £81,616,221. In 1923-24 the percentage of wages paid to the total output was 22.14, and in 1925-26, 18.11. that means that under a 35 per cent, duty the manufacturers here would have an advantage over overseas manufacturers of 15 per cent., without taking into account labour and landing charges which the foreign manufacturers have to pay. That certainly is ample protection. It is time that we called a halt in our policy of extreme protection, because it is benefiting no one. It is simply raising the cost of production and living, and particularly the nominal wage of the workers without increasing the effective wage to any appreciable extent. As soon as an .increased duty is imposed the workers rightly ask for an increased"" wage because of the increased cost of living. They get it, and the facturers ask for increased protection because of the higher rate of wages that they have to pay, and they get it. So the vicious circle goes on. If our duties were reasonable, about one-half of what they are today, we should probably be able to manufacture for export, but there is no prospect of our doing so at present. A few days ago the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley) compared the position of Victoria under* protection with that of New South Wales under free trade, before federation took place. lowed his remarks closely, and I agree with what he said. At the time he referred to, I was living near the border of New South Wales, and I quite realise that under protection Victoria benefited to a much greater extent than New South Wales in population, production, and employment. But the honourable member did not mention that the tariff under which Victoria progressed so well, was low, indeed, compared with the tariff of today. The late Mr Alfred Deakin would turn in his grave if he knew that we were imposing such heavy duties. ' In his time a duty of 40 per cent, was considered high.",66
261,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Mr Bayley) Does the honourable member for Riverina propose to connect his remarks with glucose, which is the item under discussion ?",67
262,Mr KILLEN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I was endeavouring to show that the proposed duty is unreasonably high when compared with the duties under which Victoria prospered in pre-federation days. Some of the duties in operation today are four or five times liigher than they were at that time. It is now proposed to increase some duties to the extent of from 80 per cent, to 100 per cent., and as I am absolutely opposed to such an increase, I intend to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory).",67
263,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Wide Bay) [10.21] - I was r.ather astonished to hear the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen) suggest that the duty on any locally produced commodity should not exceed 35 per cent. I should like to inform the honourable member that on hops which were once imported from Kent, England, - at 5£d. per lb., there is now a duty of about 9d.; and on currants and raisins, manu- from Southern Europe, which were landed at l&d. and 2£d. respectively, a - duty of 3d. A duty of 3d. per lb. it imposed also upon apples, and a duty of 4d. on pears. In supporting a higher duty on glucose, I am thinking more particularly of the maize-grower and also of those engaged in the manufacture of glucose. For the year ending the 30th June, 1927, 1,270 tons of glucose were imported. Why should we not use our own maize to produce that quantity? We can assist the production of I folmaize and glucose in Australia only by imposing a sufficiently high duty to prevent supplies coming from America which enter into competition with that produced in the Commonwealth. It is our duty to see that the interests of the primary producers are safeguarded, and that a market is found for the maize produced in Australia. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) claims that he wants to assist the primary producers; but he has a peculiar way of assisting them when, as in this case, he submits an amendment to reduce the duty on a commodity which they produce. Since the Tariff Board's recommendation was made about twelve months ago, there has been a marked difference in the cost of the glucose imported from.America. The Tariff Board states that It was proved that whilst the Australian manufacturers' cost of production was £33 6s. 4d. a'ton, American glucose was sold on the Australian market at £33 Is., or 5s. per ton under the Australian manufactured cost. Since the inquiry by the board has been completed, importations from America and Belgium have been quoted at £31 10s., or 36s. 4d. under the Australian cost of production. Are we to destroy the Australian maize-growing industry aud to tell our farmers, who have to face adversity in the form of droughts and the difficulties of transporting stock in dry seasons, that we do not think they need any further assistance ? The only way to assist them in. this instance is to increase the duties and thus prevent American producers from sending their surplus glucose to Australia at a price at which, we cannot produce it in Australia. The 1,270 tons of glucose imported from America at the end of June, 1927, represented 106,520 bushels of maize for which the Australian producer lost a market. I cannot understand honourable members saying that they are acting in the interests of the primary producers when they are assisting to destroy the home market for this commodity. As the Tariff Board has submitted a report favourable to the maize-grower, it is the duty of honourable members to assist them by supporting the Government's proposals. Rice producers are protected to the extent of 90 per cent., but the honourable member for Riverina, who says that a duty of 35 per cent, is sumcient for any product, does not object to that impost but actually advocates it. Some honourable members believe in high duties when they protect industries in their own constituencies, but they oppose .others that will benefit producers in every part of the Commonwealth. I trust that the Minister will realise that the state of affairs in the glucose industry is different now from what it was when the Tariff Board submitted its report, so that there is a greater reason for higher protection.",67
264,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Darling) [10.31] I support the request of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) for an increase in the duty on glucose, and I hope that the Minister will reconsider his decision on the matter. I am persuaded that the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) has moved his amendment, not primarily for the purpose of securing a reduction in the"" duty on this commodity, but as part of an insidious free trade campaign which he is afraid to carry on openly. His action is, if I may use the term without offence, hypocritical. The honourable member does not believe in a duty on either glucose, maize, or anything else.",68
265,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I did not say so.,68
266,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The honourable in member does not believe in a duty on thing that can be imported into Australia is glucose. for sale at a lower price than that for which it can be produced here.,68
267,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"If the honourable memmember ber for Darling proposes to talk about honesty, he should use my exact words, and be fair te me.",68
268,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I believe that the honourable member and his small coterie of anti-Australians in this chamber are honest in their belief that the way out of our economic difficulties is to buy in the cheapest market; they would be acting more honourably if , in that belief, they were to resist the imposition of all duties. The honourable member aud his friends, who comprise our few remaining followers of Henry George, have made a couple of converts this evening in the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) and the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen) ; but before the debate on the tariff schedule is"" concluded I am quite satisfied that those two honourable gentlemen will provide us with a somewhat surprising display of fiscal gymnastics. They cannot consistently advocate free trade for one primary industry and its by-products without doing so for others.",68
269,Mr KILLEN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I have not advocated free trade, but only the imposition of a fair duty.",68
270,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I am afraid that the honourable member for Swan will find that the honourable member for Riverina will fall from grace when rice is under discussion, and that the honourable member for Franklin will go toboganning to fiscal perdition when the timber duties are being considered. The latter will doubtless be a whole-souled prohibitionist in his desire to protect the products of our Australian forests. I am not a fiscal prohibitionist. My object is to try to make Australia a self-contained nation, for I believe that in that way only shall we ensure the salvation of this great continent. All the primary and secondary industries which are necessary to the development of Australia should be protected.",68
271,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Mr Bayley) I must ask the honourable member not to continue in that strain. He may speak general terms in-order to illustrate a anypoint; but the item under consideration,68
272,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I am illustrating a point, Mr Chairman. The honourable for Franklin and the honourable member for Riverina may be willing to ' join the die-hards of the Henry George tribe and follow them into the fiscal wilderness when such a matter as the duty on glucose is under consideration; but I am convinced that when certain, other items are being considered their attitude will be very different. It is because of the natural advantages of Australia that we are able to produce wheat and wool without protection; but I am satisfied that if those commodities were threatened with serious competition from Asia or other low-wage countries, we should find the honourable member for  tection for the product of his farm, and the honourable member for Eiverina calling out for protection for the product of his flocks and herds.",68
273,Mr KILLEN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I am not asking for a duty on wool.,69
274,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Onl y because the natural advantages of Australia make it impossible for other countries to compete with us in the production of merino and other wools, which are sent all over the world after each wool sale. The honourable member should place himself in the position of those who have competitors in low-wage countries overseas. If in the Argentine or the pastoral States of America, or even Asia, the production of the fine wools we have in Australia were possible, what would be the attitude of the honourable member?",69
275,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Order , order!",69
276,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Surely in the development of an argument I am permitted to point out the inconsistency of those against whom I am arguing.,69
277,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The honourable member is proceeding along lines which would have been permissible in the general debate; but that debate has now closed.,69
278,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I am the first honourable member you, sir, have pulled up to-night. There is not one honourable member who has not at some stage been generalizing.",69
279,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The honourable member must not reflect upon the Chair. There is ample opportunity for the honourable member to discuss the duty on glucose in all its details without generalizing to the extent that he was doing.,69
280,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I have no desire to reflect on the Chair. If the wool industry were imperilled the honourable [111] member for Riverina would be one of the first to come to this Parliament, and particularly to. honourable members of the Labour party, to ask for their assistance only for his industry, and because the Labour party is a protectionist party he would not ask in vain. Things are coming to a pretty pass when the Labour party has to appeal to representatives of the primary producers to protect primary producers. One of the points raised by those who seek a reduction of the duty on glucose is that the maize-growers of Australia are already protected; but, according to the Commonwealth Statistician, they are not, even at the present rate of duty. The latest figures in the Commonwealth Year-Booh relating to maize are for 1925-26. The last financial year ended five months ago; but the figures we have before us to enlighten ourselves on maize are seventeen months old. It is a shame that we in this Parliament, and the people of Australia, cannot get in the Year-Booh figures that are not more than six or seven months old.",69
281,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I do not think that the Statistician is to blame. I think the blame must rest with the department that does not give him sumcient funds to do his job.,69
282,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I have been fortunate enough to secure figures from the Customs Department dealing with the year 1926-27. I shall quote the net importation of maize. In some years there are exports and in others there are imports. For 1921-22 the net import was 8,746 bushels, worth £708. The Customs Department deals in centals and the Commonwealth Statistician in bushels. That is an anomaly. Honourable members should at least he able to get information in standard measures or weights. In 1922-23 we imported 1,190,000 bushels of maize worth £202,000. In 1923-24 we imported 2,534,000 bushels, \yorth £505,000. In 1924-25 we exported 2,500,000 bushels, worth £511,000. In 1925-26, the last year for which the figures are available, we imported 1,507,000 bushols, worth £308,000. These figures show that the maize industry is not protected to the extent some honourable members would have us believe. It is certainly possible to import glucose at a cheap price, but if we are to buy in the cheapest market the logical thing to do is to cut out the manufacture of glucose and follow the advice of our free trade friends in the corner hy taking off the ' duty on maize because we can buy maize cheaper overseas than we can grow it. We could also cut out our textile industries and go the whole hog, cutting out all the manufacture of goods in Australia and buying from cheap, foreign, low-wage countries all those things with which we are now supplying ourselves.",69
283,Mr KILLEN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Non e of us want that.,70
284,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The honourable member wants to do it in regard to glucose, but he would not do it in the case of rice. Mr C. EILEY - O r butter or cheese. .",70
285,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"No ; I am waiting to see the fiscal gymnastics of the honourable member for Eiverina in regard to many of our primary products. In most instances I think the duties in this schedule are too low, and I am supporting the honourable member for Maribyrnong in his desire to help the glucose industry. Many of our friends who have been complaining about the watering of stock would be the last to give any assistance' in this Parliament to the passage of a Commonwealth company law which would prevent the watering of stock. Honourable members of the Labour party have been continually asking the Government to take action against companies who do this and impose prices which will enable them to pay dividends on fictitious stock. Those honourable members who protest against this kind of thing would very likely be. the first to endeavour to protect the interests of those people who water their stock.",70
286,Mr GKEGOEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Anothe r little insinuation ! i,70
287,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The honourable member for Swan is not always foremost in attacking vested interests in that regard. I support the honourable member for Maribyrnong, not only because of my desire to establish the glucose industry and keep it going, but also as a protest against the free trade amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan.",70
288,Mr MACKAY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Lilley) [10.50] There is a wide divergence between the views of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) and those of the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory). The former desires to increase the duty on glucose to £18 a ton, and the honourable member for Swan wishes to reduce it to £10 a ton. I personally do not support either extreme. The glucose industry is of value to the community, and we must adopt a reasonable attitude towards it. I have no fault to find with the Tariff Board's recommendation. The members of the board made a very carefuly study of the evidence submitted to them, and conscientiously recommended to the Minister what they considered best in the interests of the industry and the country. The glucose industry is not of very great importance; its production in 1925 was worth only £283,000; but I am interested in it because of its relation to the primary producer. In 1925 it purchased 7,400 tons of maize, and I understand that 76 bushels of maize is required to produce one ton of glucose. This is a market of considerable importance to the maize-grower. Maize has frequently sold at the trifling price of 2s. 6d. to 3s. a bushel. We cannot hope to keep men on the land if that is to be the reward of their labour. I am not an extreme protectionist, but every industry must be given a 'chance. When it is given that chance it is the duty of the management to show some appreciation of the protection afforded it by doing all that is possible to supply, the consumer at a reasonable price. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) had a great deal to say about confectionery, but I notice this paragraph in the Tariff Board's reportWere it not for the fact that the leading confectionery manufacturers in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane are shareholders in the Maize Products Company, it is quite likely that the competition from overseas would have succeeded in extinguishing the local industry. That is a convincing reply to the objections of the honourable member for Franklin. During the last two years this company used approximately 1,000,000 Dnshels of maize, of which only 37,000 bushels were imported. Those figures show at a glance that the company is of substantial value to the primary producer.",70
289,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,What is the total maize production of Australia?,70
290,Mr MAOKAY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It varies greatly, according to seasonal conditions. Fortunately the whole of Australia does - not experience a dry season at the one time, and there is always some maize-growing district which is able to supply a considerable proportion of the requirements of the glucose manufapturers. that the good sense of the committee will prevail, and that no consideration will be given to the proposal to reduce the duty to a ridiculous amount. The Tariff Board has adopted the right principle in proposing that the duty should be increased from £12 to £15 per ton. With that protection the Maize Products Proprietary Limited wil l be assisted, and from it the maize-grower will derive great encouragement to remain on their farms. Mr G. FEANCIS (Kennedy) [10.55]. - Every honourable member, whether he be a free trader or protectionist, or merely a. "" fr'eetectionist,"" will agree that it is is desirable, and indeed nescessary, to develop our secondary industries, mor<> particularly those which utilize the primary products of this country. Minister, when introducing the tariff, pointed out that "" reductions in prices to the consumer have followed the establishment of efficient industries in the Commonwealth."" The Tariff Board in its report said that in regard to quality, the difference between Australian glucose and the imported article is not perceptible. It went on to sayTlie increase in duties was not requested order to put the price up, because if the price were raised too much, sugar would be converted and used as a substitute. The Minister pointed out that the policy of protection has developed at the expense of the importer and of the foreigner, and not at the expense of our own population. The honourable member for Perth alleged that the proposed increase of duty would tremendously increase the cost of production and the selling price of glucose in Australia, but, as the Minister stated:Keeping in view the need for developing our industries rendered necessary by our isolation from world centres, and also bearing in mind that some of these industries are basic and vital for tlfe purpose of defence, it is remembering that this policy of protection is costing the people of Australia probably less than Is. per head per week. Even this sum is being used to help pay for the legacy of war. Therefore,- if protection does involve some slight increase in .the selling price of a commodity, it is not such as the people of Australia would boggle at. The Tariff Board pointed outThe applicant company is now faced with the position of intense competition from manuI hope facturers in the United States of America . . Were it not for the fact that the leading confectionery' manufacturers in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane are shareholders in the Maize Products Company, it is quite likely that the competition from overseas would have succeeded in extinguishing the local industry. Whatever"" was done by the company in regard to the issue of bonus shares, the fact is that it is now in a very bad position, and unable to compete with glucose from abroad. The Tariff Board concluded with this terse recommendationIn view of these circumstances, as well as of the receding prices, and increasing importations of American glucose, the Tariff Board considers that the Australian industry is in need of further protection and accordingly recommends the present duty of £12 per ton to be increased to £15 per ton. The duty proposed by the Minister is in accordance with that recommendation. The We have to consider not only the secondary industries, but also the growers of maize. I have not heard any previous speaker refer to the fact recorded in the Year-Booh for 1927 thatThe cultivation of maize has decreased in Australia by more than 20,000 acres during the past decennium. Increases in area were recorded in both Queensland and Victoria, but the decline of more than 30,000 acres in Jfew South Wales was responsible for the reduction in in the total for Australia. The maximum area sown to maize was 414,914 acres as far back as 1910-11, this acreage being considerably in excess of the average planted during the last ten years, which amounted to 315,948 acres The maximum production of maize in Australia was recorded in 1910-11, when the harvest exceeded 13,000,000 bushels. No approach to this figure was made in recent years, until a superabundant crop in Queensland during 1924 brought the total to nearly 12,500,000 bushels, but the average for the past decade was only 8,000,000 bushels. Moreover, the falling off in the demand coupled with the low market price for the grain adversely affected the industry, particularly in Queensland, and the harvest during 1925-20 was only 7,500,000 bushels. These facts are of vital importance. Not worth only the manufacture of glucose but also the production of maize is being i m perilled. The fact has been urged that the Parliament gave protection to the maize growers when it imposed a duty on black-grown maize ' from South Africa; but all that was done was to bring up to date a trade agreement made in 1904. Since then conditions have, changed. The costs of primary production have been increased by various circumstances, and it has become necessary not merely to stimulate and help the glucose industry, but also to secure a constant and stable market for the primary product, maize.",71
291,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,What is the cost of sending maize from Cairns to Melfrom bourne ? Mr G. FRANCIS - That is another consideration with which I do not pose to deal at this juncture.,72
292,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,What is the cost of sending it down?,72
293,Mr FRANCIS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Thos e conditions are not brought about either by the manufacterested ? turers of glucose or the growers of maize. We are faced by the disturbing fact that the rate of importation has increased from S per cent, to 14 per cent., and is a possibility of a further increase. must be noted that much of the maize used in America for the production of glucose is grown in the Argentine and treated on the American littoral. A though subject to the payment of import duties, there is a rebate of the whole the duty on so much of the maize as used for export manufacturing purposes. That enables the growers in the United States of America to compete on rather more than fair terms with the Australian industry. Considering that primary duction is necessary to open up the counmy try, that the maize-growers are producing less and placing less land under cultivatries. tion than formerly, and that the manufacturers are having a bad time, I should have been prepared to go a little further than the Minister did in this matter. Therefore, I cordially support the creased duty.",72
294,Mr DUNCAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"HUGHES (Boothby"") [11.2] - When the Tariff was before last year honourable members, including myself, spoke at great length on the subduty ject, and I see no reason to alter the I then expressed. I am not greatly incent, terested in the subject of profits from maize or the by-products of My interest in this matter, as in other matters, is in the consumer, and I agree with the honourable member for then Franklin (Mr Seabrook). I notice that mosjt of the persons who are applicants for the increase are connected with one particular company. Six witnesses appeared before the Tariff Board in favour of the application, and five of them are associated with Maize Products Proprietary # Limited. The sixth witness was the secretary of the. Manufacturing Grocers' Employees' Union. Four of the six witnesses who opposed the application were Sydney, Tasmania, Melbourne and Adelaide respectively, and the other two were agents for Corn Proproducts Company of New York. It will be seen that the interests of the opponents of the duty cover a wider range than those of the witnesses in favour of it.",72
295,Mr SCTJLLIIT,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Are they not equally in,72
296,Mr DUNCAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"HUGHES - That may be; but the interests of the opponents are more widely spread, and that concerns there the consumers. If honourable members. It look through the report of the board they will find that this industry has already been favoured by a high protective tariff, under the influence of which it has gone l - ahead by leaps and bounds. This is the first tariff item on which an opportunity of has been presented for members to cast is their vote. The view I have already expressed in this chamber, whether popular or not, is that our tariff is already high enough, if not too high. I propose to support the amendment moved by the prohonorable member for Swan to indicate general view on the tariff, but in saying that I except key or vital indus and Customs-Martin ) [11.5] - Fa r be it from me that I should intervene too inoften in connection with the long discussion that we must have and that we hope will end this week, but, in view of some of the statements that have been us made, I cannot allow this occasion to pass without mentioning a few facts. The is a high one, but certainly not 148 views per cent. It is something like 75 per or 80 per cent; but it should particularly appeal to those who represent maize. the man on the land We know what the position is in regard to corn growing in the United States of America. Would our maize-growers be satisfied to continue to produce maize for the price received in America for making glucose? So far as the cost of raw material is concerned as between the American and the Australian manufacturer, at least half of the duty goes into the pockets of the local maize-growers owing to the higher price they receive under Australian conditions. Therefore the maize-grower will receive roughly half the duty and the manufacturer the rest. That seems to be a fair and reasonable proposal, and I hope that the committee will support it.",72
297,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Maribyrnong) [11,7]. - I cannot agree with those honourable members in the Corner who say that the company, which has met with abuse from certain quarters, has only maintained its majority sales in Australia because it has from time to time reduced the cost of its products. In my opinion it is now manufacturing at a loss, and I am very much afraid that the majority of honourable members will not be prepared to give the industry a fair chance. At the same time. I am not afraid that the amendment by the honourable member for Swan will be carried. Within a few years the price of glucose has fallen from £45 to £33 10s. a ton.",73
298,Mr KILLEN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Ye t the company pays 12i per cent.,73
299,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It does not return that dividend on its watered stock. On that it only pays 4 per cent. I yielded 13 per cent, practically since 1913 on its' original capital.",73
300,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Does the honourable member wish to give the company increased protection so that it may pay handsome dividends on its watered stock ?,73
301,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Not at all. I am not a defender of concerns that hide their real position by watering their stock. This company is prepared to allow its books to be examined by auditors from the Customs Department. I understand that the average profit paid on its original capital is not more than 13 per cent. I remind the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) that Cadbury, Fry and Pascall, the big confectionery manufacturers at Hobart, at times obtain their glucose from the Maize Products Company, and I believe they are satisfied with both the quality and the price. I am advised that, although the price of glucose has fallen from £45 to £33 a ton, the retail price of a 3-oz. block of chocolate has remained the same throughout the Commonwealth.",73
302,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Has not the size of the block been increased?,73
303,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I believe that some manufacturers have done that. However, I shall not further delay the committee. I was hoping that I would have a more favourable reply from the Minister (Mr. Pratten). In closing, I express the hope that if the industry is injured by the dumping in Australia of the United States product, the Government and Parliament will step in and save it. from utter extinction.",73
304,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Swan) [11.40] - If the debate on this item may be taken as an indication of what is likely to happen in connection with the discussion on other items in the schedule, all I can say is that honourable members who are supporting these higher duties present a pitiable spectacle as the defenders of local monopolies. I protest, also, against their tactics in drawing a red herring across the trail by endeavouring to persuade honourable members that the maize growers are going to benefit by the imp'osition of these duties. Notwithstanding that there is already a heavy duty on maize, our importations last year totalled 37,000 tons. An increase in these duties t has will further strengthen the monopoly and enable the company to continue paying high dividends on its watered stock. It has been urged also that my amendment is a move in the direction of free trade. Do honourable members realise that this alleged free trade move represents a duty of £12 a ton ? Why then do they persist with such stupid arguments? Other unfair insinuations have also been made in the course of the dabate as to the reasons which actuate those who have spoken in opposition to the proposed increase in the duties. The suggestion that the maize-growers will benefit is absurd. We have heard the same argument before. On a former occasion we were told that increased duties on strawboard would mean an increased demand for straw. The representatives of manufacturers actually came into the party room, and said that if only they could get an increased duty on strawboard, they would be able, to purchase large quantities of the raw material from farmers, and so build up a good industry in Australia. But what happened. Very shortly afterwards, we learned that owing to the cost, they could not supply the local market.
