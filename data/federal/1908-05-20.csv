1,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether he has seen the report of a speech made at Brisbane yesterday, by Mr J. M . Paxton, President of, the ""Associated Chambers of Commerce of Australia, in which he stated that. I do not know how the various Customhouses, other than Sydney, are manned; but, with an intimate.knowledge of the state of affairs in the Sydney Custom-house, I say, without the smallest hesitation, that it is grossly undermanned, and that, in consequence, the public have to submit to delays which are anything, but creditable to the public service, to say nothing of resulting losses. Can the Minister say whether the condition of affairs in the Customs House at Sydney is as stated? If it is, will he immediately rectify it so that the commercial community of Sydney-the great trading centre bf the Commonwealth-wil l have less occasion' to complain ? Furthermore, I desire. to know whether there is similar reason for complaint in respect of the Department in the other States, and whether the Minister considers that his staff is inefficient or the service undermanned ?",14
2,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"So far as I know the Department is not undermanned, and, certainly, it _ is not inefficient. The employment of additional' hand' rests to. a certain extent with the Publi. Service Commissioner. Very few complain*"" have been made lo my knowledge, and notwithstanding that the Department' is charged with theadministration of the new Tariff, and has to deal with many difficulties due to the preference provisions, everything has been working smoothly. Honourable members will recognise that when heavy consignments come to hand at any port, some delay and trouble is bound to ensue. Every trader wishes to have his consignments dealt, with immediately; buti t would be impossible to employ a staff capable of meeting every emergency. I shall be glad to loot into the representations made and to removas far as possible any cause of complair.tThe desire of the Department and the C* vernment is to work as amicably as possibltwith the merchants with whom they have business relations.",14
3,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"Following upon the question asked by the honourable member for Dalley,.! desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs, who stated that he was not aware pf any complaints as to the undermanning of his Department, whether he does not know that the Chamber of Commerce at West Maitland-on e of the most important commercial communities in the Commonwealth-mad e a complaint that its members were considerably inconvenienced - by the undermanning of the office at Morpeth? Is it not a fact that an urgent request was made, for favourable consideration of this complaint, and that the Minister failed to give it that consideration?",15
4,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I took it that the honourable member for. Dalley's question related more particularly to the Customs House, Sydney. I am aware that some complaint was made by a Chamber of Commerce at an important centre in the honourable member's electorate. The honourable member himself took special care that ' I should give that complaint every consideration, but I regret that the report which I obtained from my officers was such that I was unable to comply with the request which the honourable .member so warmly endorsed. ELECTORAL ROLLS.",15
5,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Affairs.a question'relating to the compilation of the rolls. In one part of my elecFederal torate I recently saw a man delivering forms of application for enrolment, and I wish know whether the Department has deterelections? mined to adopt that method of compiling the rolls, and, if so, whether the Minister thinks that such a crude system is likely be effective?",15
6,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"I should imagine that it was a State official whom the honour the able member saw. I know of no Common-, wealth officer so employed, but will have quiries made and furnish the honourable member with an answer tomorrow.",15
7,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Is the Minister presenting the Minister of Home Affairs able to give any information as to when new compilation of the rolls is to be made In the electorate which I represent, within the adoption of that procedure. the last six or seven months, upwards 700 men have gathered at a place where a rush has occurred, and no one can say whether or not their names appear on the roll for the electorate. At a number of other mining centres in my electorate large bodies of men have gathered within the last twelve or eighteen months, and the position is the same in regard to them. Without desiring to debate the matter, t should like to point out that many of these men are sure to make additional applications for enrolment if steps - be - not taken without delay to compile a new roll, and that the result will be that we shall not know whether there are 20,000 or 30,000 electors in the electorate. Will the Minister take the matter into consideration and have an early compilation made?",15
8,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"My recollection of the facts is that provision is being made for the compilation of a new general roll early next year. As to the other matters mentioned by the honourable member, he must be aware that any person entitled to vote can be enrolled at any time, and that polling places may be declared wherever there are new aggregations of population.. There is nothing to prevent a man being placed on the roll whenever he desires. We are endeavouring, as far as. possible, to work in conjunction with the States in the compilation of the rolls, and their co-operation is being sought in every case. I shall have inquiries made, and inform the honourable member of the result.",15
9,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Can the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs state what progress is 'being made with the Home negotiations between, the Commonwealth .and the States for the joint compilation of and State rolls, or, in other words, for the preparation wherever possible of a to joint roll for Commonwealth and State In South Australia, within a week, two elections-on e in connection with the State Parliament, and the other in conto nexion with a vacancy in this House-ar e being held in the same district. It seems extraordinary that in respect of same voters it should be necessary to have two sets of rolls and to employ two indistinct sets of electoral machinery'.",15
10,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"As the honourable member must be aware, the CommonwealthreAct provides for the Commonwealth and the States working conjointly in the coma pilation of rolls. As far as possible, our ? officers have made every advance towards I said of some time ago in this House that all the States, with the exception of Tasmania and South Australia, .had agreed to this arrangement, and I believe that every State has now practically complied with our request. As I am merely acting for the Minister of Home Affairs I - cannot be expected to be familiar with all the details; but I have inquiries made.",15
11,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I give notice ' question for tomorrow. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Is the Minaware ister representing the Minister of Home fairs aware that 972 names have been struck off the roll for the electorate of win ? The returning officer states that he his residence. waited twenty days for replies to notices of objection which he sent out, and that, not do that. failing to obtain anj, the names wexe moved from the rolls. It is well known that working men, and particularly miners, rarely reply to letters. Will the Minister have inquiries made into this matter?",16
12,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"The practice is issue notices of objection to those who. thought to be disentitled to be on the If a man receives such a notice, not think it. worthwhile to reply, the Department can hardly be blamed if his be struck off. Where the omcers charged with the work of compiling the rolls and keeping them pure have reason to believe that a man is not entitled to be enrolled, they are justified iii taking action.",16
13,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I desire to ask the ister representing the Minister of Home fairs whether notices have been sent out the metropolitan electorates similar to which have been sent out in the Darwin of the Act'. electorate, and, if so, whether Revision Courts have been held for the purpose of striking off the roll the names of persons to whom objection.has been urged? I wish to know whether it is the intention the Department to issue a new roll, brought up-to-date""?",16
14,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"No Revision Courts are held in .connection with the Federal electoral rolls. the other point raised by member, I wish to say that.if he will give notice of a question, I will have inquiries made.",16
15,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I wish to know whether a returning officer . own sweet will to remove from the electoral roll the name of any elector, or, whether he. of it. is not bound to show cause why such action should be taken Before the elector's name is struck off ?",16
16,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"I am afraid that the honourable member will have to put question to the .Attorney-General. I not able to answer the legal point involved,",16
17,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,I wish to ask the Minister whether any special notices have purpose? been issued to the returning officers pf the shall Commonwealth requesting them to notify ali persons whose names they consider of my ought not to appear upon the rolls ?,16
18,Mr HUME CQOK,Unknown,Not that I am of. If an elector residing in one Afdivision removes to another he should apply to have his name transferred to the Darelectoral division in which he has taken up,16
19,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Ver y often he does re- . Mr HUME COOK - In order to ascert'ain the truth of the claim which he makes, notice of it must be sent to the division from which hje hasremoved. The Department is bound to take that action to to prevent one man's name from appearing are upon the roll half-a-dozen times. I know roll, of no special notices having been sent to and does returning officers ",16
20,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I dfcsire to ask name the Minister whether he will see that returning officers are instructed not to strike off the electoral roll the name of any person unless they have previously filed the grounds upon which such action is taken ?,16
21,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"The matter menMintioned by the. honourable member will be A f -, brought under the notice of the Minister in of Home Affairs, and nothing will be done those which is not in accord with the provisions Mr KING O'MALLEY - In view of the fact' that an elector is entitled to vote in any division-so lorig as his name apalso pears upon the electoral roll-wil l the of Minister see that the practice of striking names off the roll is discontinujed ? Mr - HUME COOK - I should cerJY say that nb elector's name will be ainl illegally struck off the roll. The names of Regarding -9se who are entitled to be on the roll th the honourable will be kept there.",16
22,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,I wish to ask the Minister whether it is a fact that instruc. tions have been issued to returning officers to hold themselves in. readiness for a has. power at his general election ? HUME COOK - I am notT'aware,16
23,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister whether he will request the Minister of Home Affairs to impress upon the electoral, officials that the Commonthat wealth pays a large sum for the purpose am of insuring that the name of every person who has a right to vote, shall appear upon the electoral roll, and not for an' opposite",16
24,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,Certainly . TRANSFERRED OFFICERS' HICH COURT DECISION J,16
25,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"H as thfc Attorney General any further information than appears in the press today, in reference to the decision given by the High Court, sitting in Sydney, yesterday, in the case of New South Wales versus the Commonwealth? According to the press reports the Court held that the rate of compensation payable t'o a man namjed Heffernan, who was transferred from the State to the Commonwealth service, was prescribed by the State Act at the time of transfer, and not under the Commonwealth. Act; the Attorney-General any further information as to the scope of that decision, and 'more particularly its effect as interpreting section 84 of the Constitution dealing with accrued and accruing rights?",17
26,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I received last riight a brief telegraphic message, stating that the Commonwealth had been successful in its contention that the Governor General and not the Governor of the State, had the 'power to fix the rate of compensation. I cannot say what is the exact scope and effect of the judgment until I obtain the full text of it', but as it is of considerable 'importance, I shall - secure immediately a complete report, and make it available to honourable members. NA REGRADING OF POSTMASTERS-POSTA L ACCOMMODATION AT GOODWOOD.",17
27,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether the work of regrading postmasters and other officials in his Department has been completed, and - if so, when the regrading will be gazetted?",17
28,Mr MAUGER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The regrading of postmasters will be gazetted, on Saturday next.",17
29,Mr HUTCHISON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Will the Postmaster-General cause further and fuller information to be obtained in regard to the postal accommodation at Goodwood before the work of altering the present building is commenced ?,17
30,Mr MAUGER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member - was good enough to give me notice of his intention to ask this question, and I have - given instructions that the matter is not to .be completed until there is an opportunity to review it in the light of the most recent information. MISSING STEAMER "" ORION."" RIGHTS. Mr KING OMALLEY - Will the Prime Minister have ,an investigation made as to the truth of the rumour that when the Orion left Tasmania she was overloaded?",17
31,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I presume that, it will be necessary to make inquiries'of a State official. I know of no Commonwealth official from whom we can obtain the information desired. CLOSE OF SESSION.",17
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he can tell the House when the session, now extending conHas siderably over nine ""months, is likely to come to an end. Statements appear from time to time in the press as to the intentions of the Government; but whether or not those reports are correct I clo not know. The newspapers appear to be able to obtain information ""that we cannot secure. Is the Prime Minister able to say what business he contemplates taking before the close of the session, or whether the close of the session is to be co-terminous with the close of this Parliament? I think it is time.that the Prime Minister told the House what is likely to happen ""during the remainder of this session.",17
33,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"W it h the Tariff still undisposed of, .it would be premature to make a definite statement. I think, however, that I can undertake to say that next DEPARTMENT. week a definite statement will be made as to the proposals of the Government. I assume that by that time we shall have had a further, message frpm the Senate in respect of its requests, and shall have finally disposed of them.",17
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Do I understand that the Prime Minister is unable to say, before the Tariff is dealt with, what business the Government contemplate tak. ing 'this session; or is the business to be taken this session dependent on some other contingency ?",17
35,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I understood the honourable member's question to relate to the date when the session would close.,17
36,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,He also asked what business would be taken.,17
37,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I said that any estimate formed today would be too general to be of service, but that next week, when we had disposed of the Tariff, I should be able to state, not only what business we proposed to deal with this session, but when the session would close. DEFENCE: FIELD ARTILLERY.",17
38,Mr CROUCH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I wish to ask the Minister of Defence whether he noticed in the cables published today a statement in reference to the new territorial army in England, to the effect that Viscount Wolseley and other military leaders declare that the training of the field' artillery there is insufficient, and that if that branch of the serfinished ? vice were called upon to face a disciplined Continental army, it would be more likely to disable its friends than the enemy ? In view of his knowledge that uncler the territorial army scheme the members of the partially-paid field artillery in England are required to undergo a longer period of training than are the Australian Field Artil lery, does he not think it necessary for us . to have a small permanent force to instruct its members and to form a nucleus of a larger permanent force?",18
39,Mr EWING,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Government is perfectly aware of the urgent necessity of proper training in connection with the field lery. What the honourable member suggests, however, in connection with such training, might perhaps lie found to be illegal uncler the Defence Act in its present form. Suggestions to the Cabinet will be made We are in agreement with Viscount Wolseley's views. ADVERTISING AUSTRALIA.",18
40,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I observe that a new journal has just been published, which is edited by a gentleman known to politicsMr Randolph Bedford. I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether any payment has been made to him out of the vote for advertising Australia in connection with the issue of the Clarion, and, if so, will he lay the papers relating to it upon the table of the House ?",18
41,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No payment has been made to Mr Bedford in connection with the current issue of the Clarion, but some time ago after that gentleman had paid a visit to Papua, a special number of a journal bearing the same name was published.",18
42,Mr CROUCH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,This is a different journal altogether.,18
43,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am under that impres- lowsion. But some time ago there was issued a newspaper about the size of Australia ToDay, very largely illustrated. ticular number to which I refer contained some pages relating to Papua, with illustrations. My recollection is that some - copies of that number were purchased for - circulation, but I shall be pleased to supply all particulars. BUILDING OF TRAWLER .",18
44,Mr ATKINSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs whether he can inform the House if the contract for the construction of the Commonwealth trawler is being proceeded with, and when the vessel is likely to be",18
45,Mr HUME COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"About aweek ago I made inquiries in respect of this matter, and I found that nearly the whole of the parts were ready for assembling, and that probably by the beginning of next year the trawler will be ready for. use. PIA NO INDUSTRY .",18
46,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he will lay upon the table of the. library the papers mentioned last night in reference to a number artil- of persons coming to Australia under contract in connection with a certain industry?,18
47,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I understand the honourable member's question to refer to the piano industry. I shall have pleasure in laying those papers upon the library table. SECRET DRUGS, CURES, AND FOODS. MR. BEALE'S REPORT.",18
48,Mr LIDDELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"the Prime Minister, ufon notice I. Have not reports of Commissions and other inquiring bodies on matters similar to those contained in the revised Report of Mr O. C. Beale on Secret Drugs, Foods, & c , been issued in Australia and elsewhere without any necessity for special protective legislation? 2. What is there in the revised Report of Mr. O. C - Beale on Secret Drugs, & c , that special legislation is required before it can be circulated?",18
49,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l1. Not that I am aware of. The par-' 2. Legislative protection is required for reports of various kinds. In Great Britain, an Act of Parliament, 3 and 4 Vic., c. 9, exists to protect the publication of reports and papers published under the authority of either House of Parliament. No similar law is in force here. It is proposed to proceed with this B i ll on this subject in the paper as soon as public business will permit. > NA In Committee of Sup-ply (Consideration resumed from 19th May, vide page 11216) THE PARLIAMENT. Division 3 (Parliamentary Staff), £450. Sir WILLIAM LYNE . (Humer-TreaI surer) [2.59] - I promised last night that, before I proceeded further with the mates,- I would make a general statement and I anticipate that I shall be in order in making it now. The vided for in these Estimates is, ^571,028. I know that some honourable members regard that sum as a very considerable dition to the Estimates-in-Chief, which passed at the beginning of last April.",18
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Does not the surer himself so regard it? ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE - No doubt. On the 7th of April I gave a very long list figures in regard to the items contained these Estimates which was published Hansard of that date. I do not propose again traverse those figures, but before suming my seat, I may have occasion refer to them incidentally once or twice. An honourable member has interjected that ' the amount asked for is large, and' no doubt it is ; and, as Treasurer, I do for one moment say that the expenditure in at least one of the large Departments not be absolutely required. But, in view one or two questions, which have been asked today in regard to the undermanning of the Customs Department, it would appear that, in the opinion of honourable members, the expenditure is not large enough that is a matter for consideration amination.",19
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,As to whether there is undermanning or undermanaging.,19
52,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"That is other question, to which I do not desire refer more than incidentally.",19
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,The Treasurer hav|e to refer to it !,19
54,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I do not know that I shall; but I ask honourable members, if they will be kind enough, to place themselves im my position as Treasurer-specu latively, at any rate-so that they may realise my feelings' in regard to the extra sum of money required this year. I have been accused by some of my colleagues and honourable members, and public outside of being an extravagant . individual; and while I may admit that' say that he has' really anticipated the ex I am extravagant with my own money, am not so with public money. Any man in the position of Treasurer has to guard : the financial interests of the Commonwealth very jealously; and T must say. that I was rather astounded at the abReporting normal, increase in the expenditure this year. I was placed in the position that had to husband to 'the fullest' extent the Treasurer's Advance, in: order to meet only Estia portion of the demand made upon it . ' Mr THOMAS BROWN - Why did the Treasurer not ask for an increased sum in total amount protbe original Estimates?",19
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"As I shall adshow presently, I did ask for a very conwe siderably increased sum in the original Estimates; and I have had practically to exhaust the Treasurer's Advance. When I Treamade my previous financial statement, I informed honourable members that the Treasurer's Advance was even then practically of exhausted. There is one position in which in a Treasurer does not like to be placed, in and that' is where he is open to a charge to of having allowed the expenditure to exretravagantly increase. My desire is.to guard to myself, and show that I have used every possible exertion, almost to shutting down the l i d of the Treasury chest, to keep the expenditure not only within the sums voted, not but witliin the Treasurer's Advance. I recognise, of course, that, for some reason or other, may a large amount of money is required more of than has been expended in previous years. I am not called on at this stage to go into details as to the why or wherefore, but there is the f a c t ; and it is also a fact, as I have already said, that I havte done all in ^ and my power fo keep the expenditure within and exwhat appeared to my mind reasonable bounds. However, the expenditure has so risen that these Additional Estimates are required, and I must ask the Committee to anpass them without any undue delay. I h t'o view of the Additional Estimates having been submitted, heavy demands are bewill ginning to be made on the Treasurer's Advance. ' Sir JOHN FORREST - How much of the money asked for in these Estimates has been spent ?",19
56,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"A good deal; - but I do not know exactly how much. At any rate, claims are coming in , and the reason given is that the Additional Esti-. also by the mates are on the table.",19
57,Mr WILKS,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,The Treasurer means to r I penditure under these Estimates.,19
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,I have been compelled to anticipate some portion. M.r. WILKS - This is worse than Supplv Bills!,20
59,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"The honourable member will admit that I have tried to keep down the expenditure; but, at the same time, I have to find the money for works which have been entered upon.",20
60,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,The Treasurer is really asking for an indemnity ?,20
61,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"If the Committee do not pass these Estimates, then, I suppose, - I should be dealt with in some way or other; but I have an idea that, if fault be found with me, it will be rather for not asking for money enough. I am asked not only to carry out the works comprised within these Estimates, but also to authorize the invitation of tenders for about £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth to be constructed next year.",20
62,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Ne w works?',20
63,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Ne w works; and the provision is in addition to the money which is being spent this year.,20
64,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,The under these Estimates cannot be spent this year.,20
65,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"The honourable member is quite right, but that is a matter with which I shall deal presently.. As I say, I am asked to authorize the invitation of tenders for works in the Post and Telegraph Department or in the Department of Home Affairs, whichever it may be, but I desire it to be clearly understood that the calling of the tenders and making every preparation, does not give consent to the expenditure of the money. relieve myself of the responsibility of saying that the works should be carried out in anticipation of what Parliament may decide next year.",20
66,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,The Treasurer desires to have a parliamentary vote before sanctioning the expenditure?,20
67,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Yes ; and I provided last year? shall bring the matter before Parliament. I do not feel at all disposed as Treasurer to take the responsibility of agreeing to such expenditure? an expenditure without the consent of Paryear liament.,20
68,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"How could Treasurer spend more moneywithout authority ? Out of the Treasurer's Adby .£60,000 or £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 . vance ? '",20
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Yes ; that is the way in which the Treasurer's Advance has been very nearly swamped.,20
70,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Why did the Treasurer allow it? Sir . WILLIAM LYNE - I have been blamed for not'finding money for a variety of purposes.,20
71,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"But the. Treasurer's advance is only',£200,000.",20
72,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"That is so. Now we have before us the Additional Estimates, which will probably replace all the expenditure made out of the Treasurer's Advance, and thus enable me to use the amount of Treasurer's advance again. The late Treasurer knows exactly the circumstances under which; such expenditure is made. ""A Treasurer has to be extremely cautious to see that he is not left in the position-of having no money to the credit of the Treasurer's Advance, if any emergency arises; but that is the position I have been in two or three times.",20
73,Mr THOMAS BROWN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,That is one great reason why the regular expenditure should be provided for in a regular way.,20
74,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I quite admit that, but i l was not possible to do'more than has been done this vear. Of course, money if we were to carry - every thing out in a strictly technical way, the Appropriation Bill would be passed at the earliest moment after the meeting of Parliament, so that the money might be voted before it was expended. Under such circumstances, a Treasurer would not be called upon, as I have been during the last eight or nine rribnths, to find money out of his Advance Account.",20
75,Mr THOMAS BROWN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,The complaint is that a lot of J:his money should have been piovided in the Estimates-in-Chief last I desire to year.,20
76,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I shall read the figures in a moment, and show the increased expenditure this year as compared with last year.",20
77,Mr THOMAS BROWN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Then , according to the Treasurer, sufficient money was not",20
78,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"So it seems; but who is to foretell the expansion of the The amount provided last was so great that my predecessor, who prepared the Estimates,- thought there was the more money than would be required, and before I took charge reduced the amount The right honourable member for Swan,- as Treasurer, called the attention of the heads of Departments to the large claims, and begged them to reduce their Estimates. This they did to the extent of about £30,000, and then the right honourable member further reduced them, as I have already stated, to* the extent of £60,000 or £70,000.",20
79,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,I told the heads of the Departments that they could have the money afterwards if it were really necessary.,21
80,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Well, t h thought the money was necessary, and gave me a lot of trouble in providing it. I have been blamed for not having found considerable sums of money for the provision of. temporary hands in the Public Service. When I could find the money I did so, but I had to keep a.close-eye on the Treasurer's Advance. These demands come on the Treasurer at the last moment,' and if the advance account would bear the strain, well and good; but my opinion is that a Treasurer is called upon to criticise any expenditure beyond the sums voted on the Estimates. I never criticise any item voted by the Committee, but I . do hold that if a Treasurer is not to criticise any expenditure beyond the ordinary votes, it is hard to see what he and the Auditor-General are in their positions for. That is all I have done during the whole of the troublesome financial times. In reference' to the payment of temporary hands, and also permanent hands, all I have raised my voice against has been the expenditure of money not voted on the Estimates. In the year 1906-7 the ordinary expenditure amounted to £4,514,520, and it was estimated that for this year-19078 - it would be .£5,148,118. The ordinary expenditure under the Additional Estimates £i59>74<5, together with £2,438 expenditure under the Officers' Compensation Act,"" makes a total of £5,310,302 - In 1906-7 the total expenditure was £4>9 7>3 > ,£472,781 was for new works, and this year the expenditure on new works under the Estimates-in-Chief, was estimated at £686,824, and under the Additional Estimates, £411,282.",21
81,Mr FISHER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Why does the honourable member ask for'£250,000 for harbour' and coastal defences? Sir WILLIAM LYNE;-In connection with the Defence scheme.",21
82,Mr FISHER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,The money is being asked for before the scheme has been adopted.,21

Sir. WILLIAM LYNE - Quite so. If in addition to the amount required during the' current financial year, large sums are to be expended next year they should be voted early during that year. I do not say that a very large sum is notrequired for the expansion of the Post Office, of the Deare the Go- fence Department, and of practically every Department connected with this great continent.

It is not a small island like the United Kingdom. It is an immense continent, possessing an area as large as that of the United States, and we have oniy commenced to develop it. Our first requirement is good communication by means of telegraphs and telephones, and our next good railway accommodation - With the last-named, of course, we have at present nothing to do. It is ini connection with these services that a large expenditure will be required. I do not think that it is right to undertake these works only in the centres of population.

I wish to make only one or two remarks concerning the latter portion of the Treasurer's speech. I refer more particularly to the rough outlook that he gave us of the probable requirements of the Commonwealth during the next ten years. _ He began by saying that he anticipated a f all in the revenue of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 during the year after next. May I remind him honourable that the States will suffer as well as the Commonwealth as the result of any shortage that may be experienced in our revenue ? If , during the year after next, we are short by .£2,000,000, it will mean that under the present arrangement the States will be returned £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 less than have received. The Treasurer, however, spoke as if the Commonwealth alone, would suffer from any decrease in our revenue. say that the States and the Commonwealth alike will suffer when that unfortunate time comes. That there ' will be some shrinkage in our Customs revenue will dispute. It is inevitable. We may Mr Frazer earnestly hope, however, that we shall not experience such a large shrinkage as has in been foreshadowed by the officials and the Treasurer.",25
166,Mr THOMAS BROWN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"If the honourable member could carry out his free-trade policy, would there not be a larger shrinkan age?",26
167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"That is a very interesting academic problem which has little to do with the point under discusStates, sion.",26
168,Mr THOMAS BROWN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"It does not necessarily follow that because there is a deresult crease in the . Customs revenue, bad tions will prevail in the States.",26
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I am dealing with the statement of the Treasurer that, during the year after next, there will be shrinkage of Customs revenue amounting .£2,000,000 in connection with the present Tariff. I am pointing out that if his pretinues diction be realized, the States will be the vised. chief sufferers. Of course, the Commonwealth will suffer with them, but only the extent of one-fourth of the total loss. I venture to say that the statement of the Treasurer as to the probable Federal rewould quirements of the future will bring some degree of comfort to the State Treasurers. The honourable gentleman has foreshadowed an increase in our expenditure which I venthe ture to say is not a very alarming one-a n occasion. increase from JPfi,500,000 to £ 9 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 during the next ten years. At Conference the States Premiers expressed themselves as being perfectly willing to cept three-fifths of the total Customs resuccess. venue in lieu of the three-fourths which they now receive. Having regard to the the probable increase in our Federal income during the next decade, I venture to say that the possibility of making a fair arthe rangement with the States without occasionlargely ing either body much suffering is well .in our reach. If the figures of the.Treataken surer show one thing more than another, they show that which I have just indicated.",26
170,Mr FRAZER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"How ' does the honourable 'member reconcile a possible increase of they revenue with the Treasurer's statement that there will be a decrease of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ? Mr JOSE'PH COOK - That decrease is I only in the year after next.. I hope the honourable member is not anticipating that during the next ten years we are to have no more population, or no more industries nobody started in the meantime. - I should say that the Tariff will result in considerable decrease the revenue if it is effectively protective.",26
171,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Eve n that does not follow. If the Tariff results, as foretold by protectionists,. in a large increase in industrial occupations, .and, therefore, increase in population, these will more than counterbalance any loss of revenue i h the other direction. .

I have, all through, the view that the Tariff, is not suitable for the requirements of Australia, even from the protective point of view; it has been wrongly conceived, and the result will ' manifest itself as time goes on. I say once more that the statement made by the Treathis surer will show to the States Treasurers that they may look forward to some reasonfind able adjustment of the finances as between the States and the Commonwealth, without either being reduced to a condition beggardom. Judging from the tone Treasurer, one would imagine that whether the times be bad or good-eve n in the.worse times-w e must necessarily go on piling the Commonwealth expenditure, while States are driven to curtail theirs.

181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I think you are right, sir, tempting as the subject is. 1 said before, the statement made by Treasurer is most interesting, and ought bring a grain of comfort to the States surers. The honourable gentleman began saying that the amount asked for seemed large as compared with the sum voted in the previous year. The Treasurer has gone about the country for a long to be the meanest Government with' which he was ever associated; and yet we that the Commonwealth expenditure has doubled itself in the last five or six years. This year the expenditure is to be nearly of £1,600,000 more than last year, an inof the crease of over 30 per cent.",27
182,Mr THOMAS BROWN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,The honourable up member does not say that there has. been .the any extravagant expenditure?,27
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I say there has been a very large expenditure up to the present. I am afraid the honourable member on for Calare has only one view of the very serious problem which he has in his mind; poshe has only'one idea, and that is to spend more money on the Departments. I tell honourable member candidly that I haye is another idea. I do not think it is so much a question of the Departments being underdemanned as a question of their being undermanaged ; and ' that - is one reason why I support the appointment of an inin dependent Commission of inquiry, with the object of placing the services on a business The figures of the Treasurer show some grave managerial laxity somewhere or other. Take the Department of the Postmaster-General, 'for instance, and on the preliminary page the unevenness of the figures show that there is something wrong the management. If that be not so, how we account 'for a proposed additional expenditure of £56,000 in New South of Wales, as against only £21,000 in Victoria, .£12,000 in Queensland, and £4,000 of the Northin South Australia? the THOMAS BROWN:-We must remembig expansions in the business of the Wales Post and Telegraph busi",27
184,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"But relatively has been the same expansion in the to other States, which have all shared in the of the recent boom period. The idea I have just expressed is more forcibly on our minds when we look at the details. I see that in. the Postal Department of New South Wales £20,000 is required for temporary assistance, as against As only £5,000 in Victoria. Why the differthe ence? There are other anomalies which to seem to tell the same tale. In the happy TreaState of Queensland, no amount is proby vided for temporary assistance; and there would seem to be singular freedom from all those troubles which are indicated unerringly throughout the Estimates in regard time declaring to the other States.",27
185,Mr TUDOR,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Does the honourable member think that this shows that the Queensland Department is overmanned in normal times ?,28
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I am not suggesting anything of the kind, but. merely that the unevenness of the figures requires some explanation.",28
187,Mr TUDOR,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"If it is not necessary to day. provide for temporary hands in the Queensenjoy land Department, it'shows that in normal times there must be overmanning.",28
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Not necessarily-; itself. it may mean that the Estimates have been properly prepared, and that ordinary and adequate foresight has been exercised estimating the year's requirements. We must remember that these are additional Estimates, introduced at the end of the year, and.that they represent expenditure over and above the ordinary expenditure, which itself is a large increase on that last year.",28
189,Mr THOMAS BROWN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,The complaint is that in the case of New South Wales the the Treasurer - disregarded the recommendations of of his responsible officers.,28
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"That may acdefence count for the present position; not a serious accusation against some branch of 'the Public Service control ? In the case of the Post Office, the expenditure Treasurer has told us that the expenditure this year is increased by over £500,000. while the increase in the revenue is reprenow sented by only £167,000.",28
191,Mr WH IRVINE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,It is only fair to state that that expenditure includes new works.,28
192,Mr JOSEPH CQOK,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"The expenditure includes little more of new works than the expenditure last year; there are new works'every year, and the Estimates for new works this year are much about the same as those of last year. Of course, trouble is that a great deal of the money voted is not, and cannot be, spent within the year, so that the Estimates are not a very reliable guide as to the actual requireevenness ments of the year. The Committee might, I think, with advantage, cut a huge slice off this item, and so try to compel the spending of the money within the year. I honourable members will cast their minds back five or six years they will find that the case of not much more than half of items of this kind has the money been actually spent within the year in which it voted.",28
193,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"That is because there is only about half-a-year in which to motions. spend the money, owing to the late period at which the Estimates are passed.",28
194,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"That is so, and the position all arises from our working on Supply Bills, which, again, are referable to the absence of the control of the business of Parliament by the Government of the We have no ordinary sessions, but a sort of perpetual motion; and while that goes on there must be disorganization in the Departments as well as in Parliament What would act as a tonic throughout the Public Service would be a restoration of the responsible control in of this House on the part of Ministers. While we drift on from day to day, Ministers are in the unhappy position of having tolook for a political existence a week ahead, or, sometimes, a day, with the minatoryfingerof the leader of the Labour Party of pointed at them, as it was last night. They act from day to day with the shadow of death constantly ahead of them. It is said that - threatened people live long, and Ministers afford another illustration the truth of the adage. I wish to know whether the large expenditure proposed for is in addition to that provided for but is that in the Estimates-in-Chief. Mr HU ME COOK - No ; the defence was, removed from the Estimates-in-Chief to these Estimates.",28
195,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"The amount asked for is somewhat larger than that which appeared on the Estimates-in-Chief. I hope that the Minister will not spend the money while the defence scheme is still in the air. No concrete scheme has been sub' mitted to Parliament; we have merely the did speech made by the Prime Minister, which has since been revised almost weekly. I the do not think that we should be asked to vote huge sums in anticipation of the apthe proval of a concrete defence scheme. Throughout these Estimates, especially in the Post and Telegraph Department, anomalies are. observable which-indicate unof control, although it was expected that, fairly equal control would be the result of Federal administration. I find for example that twenty-three new telephone f monitors, who are to be appointed in' New South Wales, are to cost £1,138, or in £ 4 9 ios. each; while seventeen to be apthe pointed in Victoria are to cost £1,320, o r £ 7 7 3 - each. These figures require I S was an explanation. Are these new appointments, or are they promotions?",28
196,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,They are pro,28
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Similar anomalies abound, sKowing a lack of proper control and management, the result of which no doubt is, that the labour for which we pay is not employed to the best advantage. Those connected with the Department may be doing what they are told to do, and yet may not be doing the best work for the public, the fault being, not theirs,, but due to fective administration. A business-like investigation of the affairs of the Department' might show that efficiency can be obtained by re-arrangement and better management, with the appointmenc of very few additional hands. In the meantime, I accept the Minister's statement that the additional assistance asked for is required. In New South VVales this year .£20,000 is to be spent .on temporary assistance, and no doubt other increases on the expenditure of last year will bring the amount up to more than ,£50,000, showing a strange lack of foresight on the part of those responsible for estimating the requirements of . the year. The sooner we have an inquiry the better, though, as Ministers do not like the subject, I shall not deal with it further now. I suspect, however, that we are not getting value for our expenditure, which this year is to be increased by £ 5 3 0 , 0 0 0 , while extra revenue amounts to .only £ 1 6 7 , 0 0 0 .",29
198,Mr MAUGER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,A large part of the increase is for public works.,29
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"The expenditure on public works is proportionately not much larger than that of last year. ' The figures show that there has been bad administration. I do not suggest that the officials are overpaid. I know that many are underpaid, and that; sweating takes place; mismanagement must be responsible for the conditions we deplore. If a larger expenditure is necessary, Parliament, will not begrudge any money needed to obtain efficiency, and to give-proper conditions to its officials.; but we should know how the anomalies have arisen, and, if possible, remove them.",29
200,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Perhaps they began in New South Wales about 1894.,29
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Thing s began to be right in that year. Whatever may have happened in the other States, it is a matter of history that the administration of the Departments in New South Wales has been a record of shocking mismanagement whenever 'it has fallen into the hands of the honourable member and his friends. I urge that before large additional expenditure is undertaken, an independent investigation shall be made, so that matters may be set right. The public believes that the Department is not as efficiently managed as it should be, in view of the expenditure upon it.",29
202,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"North Sydney) [4.28].'- I shall not reply to, or de- criticise, those portions of the Treasurer's speech which .dealt with proposals to be embodied in the Surplus Revenue Bill , and shall endeavour to avoid repeating what has been said by the honourable member for Parramatta; but it is time to emphasize the fact that the reputation, not merely of Ministers, but' also of Parliament and of individual members will be involved, if excessive expenditure is to obtain now, and to continue in the future. Generally speaking, the expenditure of the Commonwealth has not been, in the past, reckless or extravagant. Most of our Treasurers have recognised their responsibility to the people, and have' stood firm, observing the proper critical attitude towards proposals for expenditure, notwithstanding the temptation to obtain popularity for their Governments by a lavish outlay throughout the constituencies. To my mind, the facts disclose the in these and the Estimates-in-Chief, unfortunately, a lack of that care which should insure the preparation of fairly accurate Estimates, and a want of that prudence which should cause large increases of expenditure to be checked. What is the position? The Estimates-in-Chief prepared nearly twelve months ago, showedan increased expenditure of nearly £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 as compared with that of the previous year. I am not going to say that some part of that increase was not justifiable. Portion of it was incurred under Statutes, and, therefore, had to be provided for, no matter who held office as Treasurer. For instance, there was an increase of £ 2 9 4 , 5 0 0 in respect of the sugar bounty. That increase arose under an Act of Parliament, and the Treasurer could not be held responsible for it . Then, again, there was an increase of £ 6 , 0 0 0 in ' respect of salaries of Justices; £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 in connection with bounties, and ,£15,000 for the Western Australian railway survey; or a total of ,£340,500 arising under Acts of Parliament. Next we come to an increase ot £ 1 7 8 , 0 0 0 in respect of works and buildings, an increase of £ 6 1 , 0 0 0 in our defence expenditure in connection with the present defence system, which is so unsatisfactory in its results, and an increase of £ 1 6 6 , 0 0 0 in connection with new defence works. That last expenditure is to be incurred before we have settled upon the defence policy of the Commonwealth. The Estimates-in-Chief for 1907-8 also provided for an increased expenditure of £ 6 1 , 0 0 0 in the Postmaster's-General's Department, £ 2 0 , in the expenditure of the Department of External Affairs, £ 3 , 0 0 0 in the Attorney General's Department, £ 2 1 , 0 0 0 in the Department of HomeAffairs, £ 7 , 0 0 0 in the Department of the Treasury, and £ 3 5 , 0 0 0 in the Department of Trade and Customs, making a total increase, in round figures, of £ 9 5 0 , 0 0 0 . Notwithstanding that extraordinary increase-ou t of all proportion to the increases of other years-w e are now told at practically the end of the financial year, that there have been under-estimates, and the Government ask us today to make additional appropriations amounting to £571,000. Surely that is a remarkable state of affairs. Let us briefly examine the directions in which these increases occur. It-is noteworthy that they relate, not merely to special, but to the. ordinary routine expenditure of Departments. What would be the position of a Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain if he created such a situation as that with which Ave are now confronted ? I have no hesitation in saying that he would be swept from, office. It would mean that he had proposed-at a time when there was no war or any great disaster to suddenly call for increased expenditure-a n increase of £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 or of £28,000,00 0 on the previous year's expenditure of about £130,000,00 0 or £140,000,000. It would mean, further, that after proposing that increase he requested, at the end of the year, appropriations in respect of a further increase of from ,£12,000,000 to £14,000,00 0 on the ground that he and the officers of his Department had under-estimated the expenditure for the year, and that the immense increase for which he had originally asked, and which had been reluctantly granted to him, must be supplemented by a further grant of the amount named. The illustration has only to be mentioned to enable honourable members to say, without a moment's hesitation, would be the result if ' such a proposal as this were made in the House of Commons. We ought to take stock of our position - Are we going to agree, to these large increases without being thoroughly .'satisfied, not only that they are necessary, but that they could not have been foreseen when the Estimates-in-Chief were being framed ? When the ordinary Estimates were under consideration I pointed out that they showed an increase in the routine as well as the special expenditure of every Department. I showed that, in respect of 0 0 0 such items as postage and telegrams, printing, travelling expenses, office requisites, incidental and petty cash, there' was an increase of about £ 1 4 , 0 0 0 in the ordinary Estimates as compared with, those for the previous financial year. What do we - find in these Additional Estimates? We find that in respect of the' same class of expenditure, which surely could have been correctly estimated at the beginning of the year, a further sum of £ 1 1 , 0 0 0 is demanded. It would seem that the Departments are getting out of hand; that Ministers are being run by the Departments instead of the Departments being controlled by Ministers.",29
203,Mr JOHNSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Telegram s are often sent when letters would serve the purpose.,30
204,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"When the Estimates-in-Chief were under consideration, I drew attention to that fact.",30
205,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Most of those matters have been investigated, and it has been found that there is nothing in the allegations.",30
206,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I am pointing out that these increases relate not only to special expenditure-o r that which is over ancl above the ordinary maintenance of the Departments-bu t to the .routine management of the Departments, and apart altogether from new offices. It is high time, not merely for the Government and the Treasurer, but for honourable members generally, to look to their reputation in respect of the financing of the Commonwealth. If this state of affairs is permitted to continue, the reputation of the Parliament as the custodian of the finances of the Commonwealth will experience a heavy f all , and the people must become dissatisfied. Then there is other heavily increased expenditure which wholly outstrips the increased revenue. I recognise that, as population increases, our exwhat penditure must go up, and that increased expenditure must be incurred in the collection of additional revenue. The Treasurer has told us that these increases will not be confined to what has been described as a "" b o o m "" year, but that further increases will be proposed next year.",30
207,Mr MAHON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"At the same time, he anticipates a decreasing revenue.",30
208,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,That is tion so .,31
209,Mr BAMFORD,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Onl y in the case of the Customs revenue.,31
210,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,The Customs Department is our great source of revenue.,31
211,Mr BAMFORD,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,But as compared with others it is not a great spending Department.,31
212,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"It is not,; but the expenditure ih connection with the routine work of the Department of Trade and Customs shows an increase.",31
213,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"There must necessarily be a large increase whilst Parliament is passing a Tariff. For instance, an enormous expenditure must be incurred in sending telegrams all over' the Commonwealth in respect of everv Tariff change.",31
214,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"It is only reasonable to assume that '.the new Tariff must involve increased expenditure, and the increased expenditure of the Department of Trade and Customs is to some extent justified by its increased revenue. On the other hand, the increased expenditure of some of the Departments bears no relation to their increased revenue or the work done in connection with them. In such cases Ministers should see that the expenditure is not increased unless good reason can be given. On the original Estimates, as compared with those for the previous year, we were asked to grant an increase amounting to 20 per cent. We did so, and now we have submitted to us Additional Estimates providing for a further expenditure of £571,000, or practically a further increase of 10 per cent. We ought to take steps to prevent these abnormal and, what threaten to be, continuous increases. Then, again, we. are asked to vote-and I think, that there is an ulterior object in view in respect of some of these increases-certai n sums, such as that for works and buildings, which cannot possibly be incurred this year. It is also proposed to appropriate £280,000 for defence purposes under a scheme of which we have not yet approved. I do not think that we ought to vote those amounts. I recognise that there may be an ulterior object in view, but it seems to me that our expenditure is so abnormal that if we can reasonably reduce the amount appropriated we ought to do so. If in the Postal Department we could point tq any equally exceptional "" jump"" in the revenue there might be good reason for approving without objecthe increased expenditure proposed. We know perfectlywell that in a Department such as. the Post Office a certain proportion of increased revenue must go in expenditure. But when in one year we are asked to authorize such an enormous increase in the expenditure-leavin g out of consideration the works and buildings connected with the Department-that it far outstrips the revenue-notwithstandin g that the increased expenditure ought to be less than the increased revenue",31
215,Mr MAUGER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,So it is over a period of five years. Mr D UGALD THOMSON - But I am dealing with the expenditure for one year.,31
216,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"If the Department obtained 10,000 rfew telephone subscribers and the work of connecting them with the various exchanges cost five times the amount of their annual subscription, would the honourable member refuse to connect them because the telephone revenue would not immediately respond to the outlay.",31
217,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I quite recognise that that might occur. But I hold that the expenditure ought to increase in a less ratio than the revenue. It seems to me that we cannot possibly justify the enormous increase in the 'expenditure during the past two years-that is, if the Department was previously 'conducted upon anything approaching proper lines.",31
218,Mr WATSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,The Department has been seriouslv undermanned.',31
219,Mr DTJGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,No doubt. But considering that the members of the service got through their work,31
220,Mr MAUGER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"As a matter of fact they did not, because-work has been accumulating for years.",31
221,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"At any rate, they did their work nearly as well as they are doing it this year.",31
222,Mr MAUGER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Thes e Estimates provide for construction works which have remained in abeyance for want of hands to carry them on.,31
223,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,If the Postmaster-General will separate that construction work from these Estimates he will find that a tremendous increase has taken place in the ordinary departmental expenditure. It may be necessary to employ an army to clean' the .place up,31
224,Mr MAUGER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"It is not a question of cleaning up, but of construction.",31
225,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,I am alluding to expenditure other than upon construction works. This tremendous increase of expenditure occurred during one year. That fact seems to - argue that in the past there must have been a lack of provision the work which had then to be done.,31
226,Mr MAUGER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,I admit that.,32
227,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Conse - electorate, quently there was mismanagement. Under normal circumstances there ought not to this enormously and suddenly increased expenditure. I am not reflecting upon the Postmaster-General, nor upon any of individual predecessors - But the Commonwealth Government must accept sponsibility for having created this situation. The enormously increased expendiexpended ture for one year cannot be'justified out admitting mismanagement in past . Mr Mauger - As a matter of fact, it dates back ten or twelve years.",32
228,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"The fact vance remains that routine work is not merely taken. costing more than it did in the Estimatesin-Chief for the current year, but are now asked to authorize the expendiexpenditure ture of considerable additional sums for such work. In short, we are bringing Commonwealth finance into a position which is not creditable to those conducting it, and which will not be satisfactory the people of the States. I do hope some effort will be made by Ministers and by the Parliament to re-establish our credit-as regards financial managementwith the people of Australia. If we continue to allow our expenditure to increase how ? - no t merely in reference to special items, but also in reference to routine work-w e must bring ourselves and our financial management into disrepute.",32
229,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Swan) [4.53] I clo not think that any good purpose will be served by debating these' Estimates at length, because, of the total sum. approStates, priated, the amount which will be expended purpose. depends entirely upon the passing of a Bill with which we shall be asked to deal later. Of the £ 5 7 1 , 0 2 8 proposed expended under these Estimates, £ 4 1 1 , 2 8 2 represents additions, new works and buildings, including ,£284,050 for proposed defence expenditure. I should be glad to know whether the Treasurer thinks it likely that the amounts which is proposed to appropriate in connection with the various Departments will be expended during the current financial year? For instance, under the Department of Home Affairs, an penditure of £ 6 3 , 8 2 2 is proposed. From my experience of that Department, there is not the slightest possibility of that money being expended before the 30th June next. for We know perfectly' well that after works have been authorized many months elapse before they are commenced. In my own the erection of two post offices has been sanctioned, but work is only now be being commenced, although we are almost at the close of the financial year. Then, in the Postmaster-General's Department, it his is proposed to expend £ 6 3 , 4 1 0 .",32
230,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,I am informed that remost of that money has been spent.,32
231,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,How can it be ? The Department could not have withcommenced works unless money had been years. appropriated for the purpose ,32
232,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,I know that I have supplied money out of the Treasurer's AdAccount to enable works to be under,32
233,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Then , in conwe nexion with the Defence Department, an of £ 2 8 4 , 0 5 0 is proposed. That, I contend, will not be spent before the close of the financial year. In fact, these amounts appear to have been placed upon the Estimates only for one purposeto in order that the expenditure having been that authorized by Parliament, they may .be transferred to a trust account and be available for expenditure at some future time.",32
234,Mr TILLEY BROWN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,To be spent any,32
235,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"The bulk of the £ 6 3 , 4 1 0 which .it is proposed to appropriate in connection with the Postal Department has been paid from the Treasurer's Advance Account, and the total estimated savings on the whole Estimates, which amount to ' £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 , are included in the £ 4 2 7 , 0 0 0 which, - will be repaid to the if it is not reserved for some other",32

239,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,I suppose that the erection of post offices is in this amount?,33
240,Mr MAUGER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"It covers the cost of undergrounding telegraph and telephone wires, the establishment of exchanges, and this year. the installation of switchboards.",33
241,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I quite agree with the Treasurer that it is necessary keep a very strict watch over expenditure spent. of the Postal Department. It appears to me that those in authority are not comsurer petent to spend all' this money in view the knowledge which they possess. Most them have never travelled very far from where their offices are situated. The of the Post and Telegraph Department has, I believe, never been in Western Aushave tralia",33

243,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I should like him to travel over Australia. I do not want him to travel all over the world, cept to get knowledge. The immense debe mands made on the Treasury during the last year in connection with the Post and Telegraph Department certainly deserve desire to institute a new the careful scrutiny of honourable bers ; and the sooner we have a Royal mission, or anj inquiry by a competent authority, the better for the country. am certainly not satisfied with the present control of the expenditure of these immense sums of money. ' I do not say anything of the Minister, because he is to the office, and it would be unreasonable expect him-to closely supervise every act administration all over the continent. The honourable gentleman has not time to visit every place, even if it were riecessary to clo so, owing, to a system of circumlocution which requires his attention to innumerable petty details. I hope, however, that the Postmaster-General will take steps to lieve himself of this unnecessary detail work, and be left free to devote himself the larger questions which confront him. The Treasurer knows that I do not desire to be unfriendly, politically or otherwise, but I say, again, that the object he has in view, in asking for these two large sums of £63,000 and £284,000 is to place thatmoney aside under some power which he hopes to have given him, so that he may deal with it at some future time, in such manner as Parliament may apmoney prove, andkeep it back from distribution among the States as intended by the Conwithin stitution.",33
244,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"That does not not included apply to the £63,000. - Sir JOHN. FORREST - I am sure that if this .£63,000 is intended for buildings, the Treasurer will not be able to spend it",33

246,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"If the Trealooks into the matter, he will find of that the money voted for works and buildof ings in the Estimates-in-Chief, the Supplementary Estimates, and the Estimates head now before us, cannot by any 'means be spent, simply because many of the works not yet been begun, including several in my own State. The Treasurer has told us that last year the Commonwealth returned to the States not only three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, but, in addition, ,£805,000, whereas this year exonly the three-fourths of the revenue is to returned - I deeply regret that, almost at the end of the ten years period-the Braddon provision-the Government should system. memWhatever may be the legal view of Comthe question-and I - believe it will be found to be against the action proposed by I the Government-ther e can - be no doubt whatever as to the moral view, or as to the intention of those who framed the Constitution. However, Mr Chairman, you new have ruled that we must not now deal with to the proposed Surplus Revenue Bill ; and I of shall have something to say on the matter at the proper time. I altogether disapprove of passing votes of large sums of money which there is no likelihood or intention of spending. All that we ought to do is to vote such sums as are likely to be expended during the financial year, and I submit that rethe proposal in regard to the ,£284,000 for defence material is as irregular as it is to unprecedented, ini the whole course of unparliamentary experience, I have never heard of a Government, in the eleventh month in the year, asking Parliament to vote a sum like this. It would be far better for the Government to embody such a proposal in the schedule of the Surplus Revenue Bill, or, in some other way, seek the approval of Parliament for placing the to a trust account. The Audit Act p:ovides that if any money be not spent the financial .year, the vote shall lapse, and a re-vote be necessary; and I hope, therefore, that the Committee will not approve of this vote of £ 2 8 4 , 0 0 0 being placed to a trust account. that, - even now, the Treasurer will realise that the course he proposes is, as I have said, unprecedented and irregular.

282,Mr THOMAS BROWN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Calare) [5.32]. - The honourable member for Robertson has complained that the Treasurer has not sat as firmly on the Treasury chest as he ought to have done. I can only conclude that the honourable member's electorate has been more favoured than has mine, for in that part of New South Wales which I represent, there has been a great outcry regarding the delay more particularly in the extension of postal and telegraphic facilities tu isolated districts. The denial of those facilities has caused people to complain with good reason that the Treasurer has sat too firmly on the Treasury chest. I sympathize with him in his desire to keep down expenditure, and shall always be prepared to assist him in preventing anything in the nature of extravagance. I would remind him, however, that a. cheeseparing policy invariably leads, in the end, to extravagance, and to the disorganization of Departments. One reason why the Department of the Postmaster-General is in an unsatisfactory condition is. that, at the beginmade ning of the year, provision was not made for the expenditure necessary to enable its functions to be extended in directions to which the Postmaster-General had given his sanction. That is not the sole ground, but it is one of the chief causes for the complaint made against the Department. To my mind the administration itself is at fault. A great deal, of the difficulty that has arisen in connection with the Post and Telegraph Department has been caused by bad management. For that reason, amongst others, I have been urging on the Govern[401]- 2 ment the appointment of a Commission to investigate the working of the Department, and to place before the House such a plain unbiased statement of facts as will enable it to determine where the trouble really lies. I should not be within my rights in giving, at this stage, a detailed statement of my reasons for believing that the Department is mismanaged, but I do not wish to do an injustice to any one in making that assertion. My inquiries lead me to believe that the heads of the Depart-. ; ment' in New South Wales are free from responsibility for mismanagement. The mismanagement, to my mind, is due largely to the fact that from the inception of Federation the Government have centralized in Melbourne most of their functions, and that the central administra tion here is not fully seized with the needs of the outlying parts of the Commonwealth. These Additional Estimates ampiy bear out the contention as to the tendency of the Treasurer to starve the expenditure cf rhe Departments. .The only reason he has given for his action is that he does not want to be known hereafter as "" the spendthrift Treasurer.""",36
283,Mr HUTCHISON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Has he not also said that the confusion in the Post and Telegraph Department has given rise to much ot the trouble which exists in connection with it?,36
284,Mr THOMAS BROWN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"He has helped to create that confusion by refusing LO provide the Department with the money necessary to enable it to efficiently carry oh its work. The Treasurer says that he does not wish to lay himself open to-a charge of extravagance. Whilst it is certainly desirable that he should not do so, it is equally desirable that he should be known as an efficient administrator--as an administrator capable of looking ahead and providing for the legitimate needs' of the several Departments. The gravamen of the charge against him is that he has denied to departmental heads the funds necessary to enable them to carry, on their work effectively, and in that way has prevented the electors of the Commonwealth from obtaining the facilities to which they are entitled. If the money so saved were kept within the control of the Commonwealth there might be some excuse for the position taken up by the Treasurer. But he seems to have been endeavouring to effect savings merely to provide increased amounts for the Treasurers of the States to expend. Whilst the control of expenditure exercised by - some of the States Treasurers has been - exemplary, that cannot be said of the administration of the-States Treasurers generally. The more extravagant a Treasurer - is the more he wants' to expend, and the -'honourable gentleman will find the most - vigorous complaints coming from those States Treasurers who have been most improvident. That being so, his policy is - not likely to commend itself to the electors. The complaints in regard to the cutting . down of expenditure have centred chiefly round the Post and Telegraph Department, which has a most important bearing upon the electors of the Commonwealth. What is the position in New South Wales? We find that for.many months important works and mail services, as well as telephone and telegraphic extensions, recommended by the Deputy Postmaster-General of that .State, and approved by the Ministerial head of the Department, have been held up. It must not be forgotten that such extensions are not sanctioned until careful inquiry shows that' there is a prospect of an immediate return of revenue, and of their ultimately becoming payable concerns. Despite those safeguards, works that were recommended and approved some months ago have not yet been carried out. Those interested in them have been inquiring the reason for the delay, and have had to be informed by ""the postal authorities in Sydney that it has been owing to the failure to provide the necessary funds. The Treasurer has endeavoured in some cases to meet the difficulty by means of advances from the Treasurer's Advance Account. I contend, however, that such expenditure should not be provided for out of that account. It ""is expenditure that can be foreseen and proVision should have been made for it in the - Estimates-in-Chief. Had that been done - the trouble which the Government have experienced would have been avoided,- and there would not - have been complaints as to the denial of facilities which should have been granted some time'ago.",36
285,Mr MATHEWS,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"It is evident that some of the States rights party do not desire the Federal Government to spend money in these directions; theywant the money to be handed over to the States Governments to expend. ' Mr THOMASBROWN - I shall not discuss that question now. Every one familiar with the conditions which the Post and Telegraph Department has been endeavouring to carry on will recognise that they are not in the interests of the Commonwealth nor of the people primarily concerned. Such a - policy should be terminated as speedily as possible. Listening to some of the statements from the Opposition side of the House as to the extravagance of the Treasurer, one would imagine that the chief complaint against the honourable gentleman is that he is asking for an appropriation of ,£284,000 in respect of defence expenditure which cannot be incurred during the present financial year. I wish to tell the Committee that the chief complaint against the Treasurer is that he cut clown the expenditure of the Departments when the Estimates-in-Chief were being framed, and that he has left them in a starved condition. The consequence is that many people in isolated parts of the Commonwealth have been denied postal and telegraphic facilities which they should have enjoyed whilst the earning capacity of that Department has been considerably limited. Whilst' the States have benefited under the Treasurer's policy members of the States Parliaments are complaining of the disadvantages under which the electors are suffering because of his curtailment of legitimate expenditure. Representatives of State electorates comprised in the Federal' constituency of Calare have written to me on the subject. I hold in my hand a communication bearing upon this matter, which is typical of hundreds of others. It appears that early last, year the Government approved of the establishment of a telephone exchange in the town of Molong. A sufficient number of subscribers was forthcoming, and all preparations were made for carrying out the work. So far, however, the undertaking has been "" hung up,"" owing to the refusal of the Treasurer to make the necessary funds available. A few days ago I received. the following letter from the gentleman who represents that district in the New South Wales ParliamentDear Sir,-Will you shake the Postal Department up re our Molong town telephonic exchange. I paid £ 4 in November or December last with my application for connection, and I believe that several others did likewise, but up to now not a step has been taken to erect the poles and instal the system. The Department has had mv £ 4 for six months or more. How can our Postal administration be satisfactory when such conditions obtain? under Nevertheless, I think that if we put all the blame upon the . Postmaster-General we s'hall be saddling the wrong individual with responsibility. In my opinion, the Treasurer is responsible for this condition of affairs. The Postmaster-General has done his best to secure telephonic facilities for the citizens of Molong, but his hands haye been tied, because the Treasurer has iefused to supply the money requisite to carry out this revenue-producing work. Is it any wonder that the Commonwealth is getting into disrepute amongst the citizens of the States?",37
286,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Does the honourable member think that by turning a handle I can produce sovereigns or notes ?,38
287,Mr THOMAS BROWN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"The Treasurer should have made proper provision for these works in the Estimates-in-Chief, and thus have obviated the necessity for submitting Additional Estimates.",38
288,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Of my own volition I should have practically doubled the expenditure at the beginning of the yearf The honourable member is talking nonsense.,38
289,Mr THOMASBROWN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I presume that the Treasurer was informed by the Postmaster-General that these works had been approved, and that provision should be made for them.",38
290,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,At the commencement of the year I was not so informed.,38
291,Mr THOMAS BROWN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Then I must saddle the Postal Department with the responsibility in this connection. cism on the part.of the States Treasurers can so effectually discredit Commonwealth administration as the sort of thing to which I have alluded. The state of affairs'which obtains in country districts is a disgrace to those who are responsible for it , and the sooner we ascertain who is responsible the better. I do not wish to traverse the statement made by the Treasurer at length, but I consider that he is making a fatal mistake in attempting to build up a reputation as an economic administrator by starving the - Departments, and by refusing to supply the necessary funds to enable urgent public works to be undertaken. He ought, rather, to watch the legitimate expenditure of the Departments, ancl to make provision for it.",38
292,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"If I were to do what the honourable member suggests, I should not have half enough money.",38
293,Mr THOMASBROWN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I do not ask' for any special concession. I contend it is the Treasurer's duty to provide money for works which have already been apwhat proved. Yet the carrying out. of these works is frequently deferred for months, owing to his refusal to make the requisite financial provision - Under the preventing extravagant expenditure I shall not countenance starving the Departments and denying to the public reasonable facilities to which they are entitled.",38
294,Mr FRAZER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Kalgoorlie) [5.55] - It appears to me rather unusual that we should be asked to. authorize the expenditure of more than £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 in the form ot Additional Estimates. It evidences one of two things : either that we are now making an extraordinary effort to redeem ourselves from the charge of having starved the various Departments, or we are becoming extremely reckless at the close of the current financial year. The case cited by the honourable member for Calare is not one which is peculiar to his own constituency. As a matter of fact, many important public works have been "" hung up "" owing to insufficient money being provided upon the Estimates-in-Chief, despite the fact that their remunerative character has been amply demonstrated. In this connection, I might instance the erection of a telephone line between Coolgardie and Norseman. Whilst the Government have deliberately refused to proceed with that work, the Western Australian Government have deemed the prospects of Norseman to be sufficiently encouraging to justify them in constructing a No criti- railway between those two centres.",38
295,Mr JOHNSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,I cannot get an expenditure of £ 1 5 incurred to enable a post-office to be painted.,38
296,Mr FRAZER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I think that I am citing an instance of departmental parsimony which is even more convincing. So impressed are the Government of Western Australia with the prospects of Norsemen that they have actually constructed a line of railway half the distance between that centre and Coolgardie, and the balance will be completed as soon as possible.",38
297,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,I suppose that that railway is being built out of borrowed money ?,38
298,Mr FRAZER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,I believe that a loan was raised for the purpose. Does the Treasurer think that an unusual course in Australia?,38
299,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,But the Commonthat wealth does not borrow.,38
300,Mr FRAZER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,I should like to know bearing that fact has upon the refusal of the Government to erect a telephone line between Coolgardie and Norseman?,38
301,Mr TILLEY BROWN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"How much is the guise of railway costing per mile? . Mr Frazer - Probably £^1,400, and there are about 100 miles to bo traversed. The telephone connection would cost a few hundreds. But the Go : vernment willingly grant telephonic communication between Melbourne and Sydney without asking for any guarantee in connection with that undertaking. I do not favour reckless extravagance, and the Treasurer may rely on my assistance in the investigation of the merits of any case submitted. It appears to me, however, that the great cities, in the matter of postal, telegraphic and telephonic facilities, are given consideration which is denied to the outlying portions of Australia; and in the future I hope there will be no differentiation in this connection. The people ouf-back are doing service of considerable value in the maintenance of the cities; and it is to be hoped that the latter will not forget the fact. I shall not now refer, in detail to the items in the Estimates before us, but merely point out that the States which can reasonably claim to be the most necessitous in the way of postal and similar facilities, appear to be left out in the cold. Whereas the sum proposed to be expended under the control of the Postmaster-General for. new works is £21,000 in New South £3,800 in Victoria, £2,000 in Queensland, 'and £9,000 in South Australia, there is noprovision whatever made in the case of Western Australia; and it is this disregard of the interests of the public, and also of the omcers of the Department, that led me to support the proposal of the honourable member for Gwydir for an investigation. I do not.think that the proposed expenditure, even at the. eleventh hour, will remove'the necessity there is for a thorough inquiry into the whole administration of the Post and Telegraph Department. On a previous occasion I referred to what is, in my opinion, the unfair treatment of the postal ofncials who are stationed in districts in Western Australia where the climatic and other conditions are far from satisfactory. When this Department was taken over by the Commonwealth there was a considerable reduction in the allowances paid to officers in the outlying portions of that State. The basis on which the allowances were computed was that Perth stands to Western Australia as Melbourne does to Victoria, and, therefore, no special consideration was given in the case of officers stationed in Perth and immediate neighbourhood. After some agitation on about the part of the officers, who demonstrated that the cost of living in Perth is 5 per cent, above that of living in 'Melbourne, the Public Service Commissioner granted them an allowance in that proportion. The officers on the gold-fields now say that, as their allowance was computed on the basis that Perth stands in relation to Western Australia as Melbourne does to Victoria, they are now entitled to extra considerationthat is, to a proportionate increase in their allowance. Sir WILLIAM ' LYNE - In one or two cases it is as high as 50 per cent.",38
302,Mr FRAZER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Then these must be cases of messengers, and so forth, at £ 4 0 a year. The whole details can be ascertained on referring to the classification of officers as set forth in the report of the Public Service Commissioner; and on salaries of £200, the allowance is, I think, 15 per cent, on the first £100, and 5 per cent, on all over that amount. The ""great bulk, however, are men receiving from £140 to £ 1 6 0 a year, and in their case the allowance means from £ 1 6 to £ 1 8 . That is by no means reasonable, considering the disabilities under which these men and their families live-fa r away from civilization, or, at any rate, from great centres of population. These allowances were, made on Wales, the assumption that the cost of living in Perth is as cheap as in Melbourne, but, in my opinion, the cost of living in the former city is at least 10 per cent, higher, particularly since the new Tariff came into operation. Under the ..circumstances, it would be only just to grant to the officials on the gold-fields and other outlying places an additional 5 per cent. ; and I think I convinced the Postmaster-General as to this when I previously discussed the question.",39

The Postmaster General, however, has showed such readiness to rectify one grievance about which I complained to him, that it is only fair I should mention it . The letter carriers of honNew South Wales who use horses-and perhaps those of the other States-ar e paid a forage allowance of, I think, as. per diem, but some bright genius conceived the brilliant idea of effecting economy by stopping this allowance when the men were onholidays, thinking, I suppose, that when the were not being worked they would not need to be fed. But as there is no decent man who would not himself go withbeen out a meal rathter than that his horse should go hungry, the holidays, instead to join of being a source of pleasure to the unfortunate letter carriers, are the very rehonverse. I am informed that it is now proposed to alter the regulation. This is very good so far as it goes, but it is but adrop let in the bucket; and, as the representative of a number of postal employee's, I cannot restcontent without a detailed statement from the Treasurer as to what he intends to do.",41

330,Mr HUGHES,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I shall be sorry to him leave ofiice before he has done what I wish to be done. My constituents are continually reminding me of a state of affairs which I know to be little short of disgracef u l , and the fact that it has existed for some time is no reason why it should not be remedied at once. Sitting suspended, from 6.30 to 7.4.5 p.m.",42
331,Mr HUGHES,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"When we adjourned for dinner, I was pointing out that the conditions prevailing in the Sydney General - Post Office are the result of undermanning and of the undue employment of temporary hands, as well as of the rigid and unjust regulations governing promotion. I shall not deal further with that phase of the question except to say that, in my opinion, action should be taken without delay to put an end to such conditions. wish to make a few remarks with reference to the telephone system, so far as I know it , in Sydney. The general consensus of opinion in that city to-dav is that the telephone system is most unsatisfactory. Whether, that.branch of the Department is undermanned, I do not know; but I do know that if is almost impossible to clo businesson the telephone. The insulation is so defective that when one secures a connection through two branch lines it is' with the utmost difficulty that one can carry on any conversation with the party at the other end of the wire. I can with ease hear a 'person speaking from Melbourne or Newcastle to' Sydney, so that the matter.' of distance has no bearing on this question; but when recently I rang up llockdale from Sydney, and called my daughter, who has very acute hearing, she found it utterly impossible to clearlv distinguish, one word that was said. If that - were a rare occurrence, it might be passed; but it is the usual condition of things.. Then, again, when one gets a number, one is liable without any cause to be cut' off in the middle of a conversation. The explanation obtained as the result of a complaint is of the most perfunctory and unsatisfactory character, and a statement of a grievance certainly does not result in - the non-recurrence of the offence. A Department which exists primarily to enable people at a distance to communicate with ease should make an effort to provide satisfactory means enabling them to do so. I have heard it said that the telegraphic out and mail branches of the Sydney General Post Office are being neglected in order see that the telephonic branch of the Department may be developed. If this be so, the result, so far as the latter branch is concerned, is certainly not at all satisfactory. I am sorry that the Postmaster-General is not present, for I should like to impress upon him that telephones are now so widelyused not only in business, but by the public generally, that the system 'should be approximately perfect, an'd that it should at least compare favourably with those of other parts of the 'world. Another matter to which I desire to .refer is the use of a large number of instruments of obsolete pattern in the public telephone bureaux as well as in the houses of private subscribers. These are very defective, and serve only to accentuate the otherwise unsatisfactory .results of the whole service. The extension of the telephone system to settlers is another point worthy of attention. I now Every effort, should be made to mitigate the rigors of life in the back country, ancl telephones should be placed at the disposal of settlers at the lowest possible price. I venture to say that one of the chief reasons why so many people object to settle on the land is the dreadful isolation that life in the country too often means. A perfect system of telephonic communication would, to a great extent, mitigate that isolation. I understand that in country districts in America much use has been made of the system, and it is certainly not less needed in the back country of Australia. Yet the price asked in the first place, ancl the difficulties in securing exchanges experienced by those who are prepared to pay the price, are such as to cause great dissatisfaction. I wish now to refer to the. item in these Estimates relating to harbour and coastal defence, for which we are asked to vote £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 . I should like to know exactly to what use it is proposed to put that sum? I gather that it is intended to construct, here or elsewhere, torpedo-boat destroyers and submarines. I shall not deal now with the question of what class of vessel it is desirable to build, but I would strongly urge upon the Government the advisableness of having the proposed flotilla constructed here - I understand that something was done in the direction of inviting tenders from shipbuilders in Great Britain for the construction of one of these vessels, with the object, apparently, of obtaining a pat tern boat, together with plans, so that other vessels might ultimately be constructed .here.",42
332,Mr DEAKIN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Some of those who quoted prices proposed to build subsequent vessels, or parts, in. Australia, or to establish yards here.",43
333,Mr HUGHES,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"The more profitable and sensible plan would be to construct the whole of our flotilla here. What we really want is an expert to superintend the work. Whether it is advisable for the Government to hand over the work to contractors who will carry it out here, or to secure the services of an expert, and to. build them itself, is a matter that should be considered. In the State of which I have the honour to be a representative, we have a very efficient ship-building and naval construction yard, and I think it may be fairly urged that the cheapest and most sensible course that the Government could adopt, is to construct the vessels directly in Australia, provided that the services of a competent superintendent can be secured. I am willing to admit that the success of such an undertaking would depend upon obtaining such a man. It is useless for any one here to speak of his fitness for superintending such awork. We must secure the services of a man familiar with the construction of these vessels. The number of such persons is naturally limited, having regard to the circumstances under which vessels of this class are constructed. T believe that only one firm in England has constructed submarines for the British Government.",43
334,Mr DEAKIN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"For the British Government, yes.",43
335,Mr HUGHES,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Torpedo-boa t destroyers are built, I believe, by, at the most, four firms in Great Britain. obvious, sd far as submarines are concerned that, since the type is not yet fixed, we should be extremely careful before launching upon any expenditure that may be rendered almost useless by new discoveries. But while such a remark will apply to all kinds of vessels, and particularly to submarines, we ought not to hesitate to make some sort of a beginning. That beginning, I contend, should be made here under the superintendence of a competent man. I believe that the services of such a man can be obtained, and, in the circumstances, we might fairly ask the Government, without any unreasonable delay, to make a detailed statement of their intentions. The general policy of the : Government in this matter is quite clear, and has been laid before the country for some time. I believe the country approves of it, and I believe that a majority of this House is in favour of the Government proposal. We ought not, however, to stop short at a declaration of policy; we should at once proceed to business, and begin the construction of the proposed flotilla.",43
336,Mr DEAKIN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Jus t as we aie now proceeding with, the construction of the Government trawler.",43
337,Mr HUGHES,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I am glad that the Government have made a start with the building of that vessel; and I do not think that I am going out of the way in asking that some concrete step should be taken to-, wards the construction of this flotilla. The proposed expenditure for the establishment of a cordite factory is very necessary, and I shall not oppose it. Before resuming my seat, I wish to emphasize the point that it is very necessary that such steps should be taken as will enable a thorough inquiry to be made into the administration of the Postmaster-General's . Department by the permanent officials themselves. In the Postal Department officialdom has grown to such an extent that today it is not a question of what the Posrmaster-Generaf may think should be done, but of what the permanent officers tRink should be done. Whether that is a good or a bad thing I do not venture to say. but if Ministerial responsibility for that Department is to be abandoned we ought to be.told so. If the only function of, the Postmaster-General is to come here and make explanations, we ought to know it . Whenever we wish to accomplish reform in this Department we ultimately find ourselves up against some It is official-eithe r Mr Scott or Mr Hesketh. or one of the Deputy Postmasters-General - and beyond them it is utterly impossible to go. In short, one becomes involved in a regular network 'of red-tape. Let me give an illustration in this connection. Some time last. September a telegram was sent from a certain place in New South Wales to me in Melbourne. It was subsequently transmitted from Melbourne to Sydney, but instead of being delivered to me, it was very carefully enclosed in an envelopewhich was duly stamped-and sent back to Melbourne. As the wire referred to a matter which demanded immediate attention, I naturally made some inquiries into the occurrence, and the result of the official investigation reached me about four months afterwards. The blame was duly apportioned between the local postmaster, the letter-carrier, and myself. But the Department itself declined to accept the least responsibility in connection with the occurrence. It showed me in the most positive way-in a way at which I could not cavilthat we were all equally to blame. That is the sort of treatment we get at the hands of this Department. Consequently a departmental inquiry into its administration would inevitably prove a mere cul de sac. What we require is an inquiry with a view to setr ting some of the postal officials in their proper places, and to severely delimiting their duties to the needs of the Department.",43
338,Mr JOHNSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Lang) [8.4] - In view of the very severe condemnation by the honourable member for West Sydney of the trend of officialdom towards inefficiency to which we have just listened, and of the fact that the Postal Department has always been cited as a shining example of the benefits of Socialism, I wonder whether our friends in the Labour corner still hold the opinion that it would be wise to place the whole of the industries of the Commonwealth under similar conditions - to those which obtain there. If the Treasurer had been anxious to prolong the session to its utmost limits, he could not have devised a better plan than that of submitting Additional Estimates which involve so much contentious matter. From the beginning to the end of these Estimates, appropriations are proposed which ought to be refused. The various items clearly evidence the eyil of submitting interim Supply Bills as frequently, as they have been submitted in this Parliament. They also demonstrate that, as a result of this loose practice, honourable members are never in a position to clearly understand what is the estimated expenditure for the current year. We are now within six weeks of the close of the financial year, and yet we are asked to authorize the appropriation of more than £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 in the form of Additional Estimate's. It is absolutely unnecessary to consider a great number of the items contained in these Estimates at the present time, because, as the Treasurer is aware, it will be utterly impossible to-expend during the balance of the current financial year the money proposed to be appropriated, and under ordinary circumstances all the unexpended balances will have to be revoted. Therefore it is simply farcical to ask for these appropriations unless there is some ulterior object in view. When we come to analyze the amounts which it is proposed to appropriate in connection with - the various Departments, we get some most astonishing results. We have already voted for the services of the year by way of special appropriations, £ 9 2 9 , 2 8 3 ; for ordinary appropriations the sum of £ 4 , 2 1 8 , 8 3 5 ; we have authorized a further' expenditure of £ 8 1 9 , 8 7 4 upon new works and buildings, making a total on the Estimates-in-Chief of £5,967,992, ' and yet Ave are now asked to vote a further sum of £ 5 7 1 , 0 2 8 , thus bringing the aggregate expenditure for the year up to ,£6,539,020 - When we have figures like these before us at such an early stage in our Federal history, the States Treasurers have some justification for charging the Commonwealth with extravagant' expenditure. In connection with the Department of External Affairs, i l is proposed to vote an additional £ 8 , 2 9 9 , and the expenditure proposed in other Departments is as follows : - Hom e Affairs, £ 1 0 , 4 2 4 ; Trade and Customs, , £ 1 2 , 8 6 7 ; Defence, £ 1 1 , 3 3 6 ; and Postmaster-General, £ 1 0 7 , 7 2 0 - These amounts represent appropriations in connection with the ordinary votes. They evidence a most extraordinary condition of affairs. Of course, there are other Departments in . which expenditure is proposed, and to which I have not referred. I have merely quoted the expenditure in connection with the larger Departments. The total expenditure under ordinary votes is set down at £ 5 9 , 7 4 - But j n addition to this, I I 6 ' find that for additions, new works and buildings there are enormous additional sums asked for in connection with three 1 of the Departments. Connected with the Department of Home Affairs, ' an expenditure of £ 6 3 , 8 2 2 is proposed, which, added to the £10,424 to be appropriated under ordinary votes, 1 makes the total additional expenditure connected with that Department £ 7 4 , 2 4 6 . In the Postmaster-General's Department if is proposed to expend £ 6 3 , 4 1 0 upon additions, new works, buildings, & c , which, added to the £ 1 0 7 , 7 2 0 intended to be appropriated in connection with ordinary votes, makes the total new appropriation for that Department .£171,130. In the case of the Defence Department, there is additional expenditure to the amount of .£284,050, which has to be added to the £ 1 1 , 3 3 6 put down under the heading of .ordinary votes, thus bringing the total additional estimates for this Department U P to £ 95J3 ""2 8 the Committee believe that that money can be, or is intended to be, expended within the next six weeks?",44

342,Mr KING OMALLEY,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"H as orable member not worried the Postmastergive General about postal requirements in his district? MT. JOHNSON - I have not worried the Postmaster-General much about the ministration for a considerable length time; because I found it was of very little use. About six months ago I did ask that <an amount should be placed on the Estimates to cover the cost of painting very shabby-looking post-office in my dispended trict. I believe the estimated cost something like £ 1 5 ; and I was assured by the Postmaster-General, in error, that the work had been completed; as a matter of fact, the work has not been done yet. In the face of a little item of that kind, for which I was informed by an official recently that no money was available, are now asked to vote these huge sums, the greater proportion of which we are given to understand by the PostmasterCustoms General has already been spent. that the total estimated revenue of the and Telegraph Department for the year ending 30th June next amounts to quired ,£3,190,000. while the estimated expenditold ture, according to the Estimates-in-Chief, is £3,105,277, made up of ordinary votes, £ 2 , 8 0 5 , 2 7 7, and votes for new works buildings amounting to £300,000. is'now an additional ,£171,130 asked for, bringing ' the total expenditure up to £ 3 , 2 7 6 , 4 0 7, showing an excess of expendieyes ture over revenue of £ 8 6 , 4 0 7 .

The the honTreasurer has made a speech purporting to information to the Committee as to the proposed new expenditure; but I think few of us can regard the speech from an informative stand-point with any degree of adsatisfaction. The honourable gentleman has of admitted that much, of this money cannot be expended before the end of the year; and I strongly, suspect, with good reason, that there is* some deep design to form a a sort of trust account, wherein these unexbalances may be kept, to be utilized was later on for some other purposes than those for which we are now asked to vole the money. In fact, the Treasurer practically admitted that an old-age pensions scheme was, amongst other purposes, in his mind.",45
346,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Does the honourable member object to a proposal which we means the payment of old-age pensions ?,45
347,Mr JOHNSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"That is another question, which, as the Minister of Trade and knows, I am precluded by the I find Standing Orders from discussing just now. Post I insist that we ought to have straightforward finance; and if this money is refor old-age pensions, we should be so, ancl not be led to believe that it isrequired for some other purpose. When it was suggested by the honourable member for and Robertson that a trust fund of unexpended' There balances to provide-money for an old-age pensions scheme was in contemplation, the Treasurer endeavoured to throw dust in the of the Committee by asking a question precisely similar to that now addressed to me by the Minister of Trade and Customs. The real purpose of these Additional Estimates is to prevent any surplus Customs and Excise revenue, over and above the constitutional three-fourths, being available for distribution amongst the States for the future, and if the intention of the Government is to use money for other purposes than fhat for which it was voted at the time, I think it is most improper. If the Treasurer desires to provide a fund out of which to pay old-age pensions, he should say so in a straightforward way, and ask Parliament to vote the money for that specific purpose. Mr AUST IN CHAPMAN - Parliamen t will have to vote the money before it can be spent on old-age pensions.",45
348,Mr JOHNSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Yes , at a later stage and in a new financial year when we would hear a plausible tale of unexpended balances from the previous financial year being available. I know the Treasurer's methods. He would not hesitate even to spend the money, and then ask Parliament to ratify his actioni. VVe have seen that sort of thing done; and we know the ways of tricky Treasurers.",46
349,Mr STORRER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,-When has that been done ?,46
350,Mr JOHNSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I am not permitted to go into details, but, even in this Parliament, we have had the Treasurer come down with Estimates, and, when we have taken exception to certain of the items, we have been calmly told that our objections were of no use, because the money had already been spent out of the Treasurer's Advance. Then, as a result of passing Supply Bills, we have almost lost control of the public finances - We haye been obliged to vote sums of money because they have been expended, although we have not approved of the expenditure. . The one satisfactory statement made by the Treasurer was that, in view of the magnitude of the proposals for expenditure - in the coming financial year, he would submit his Estimates early. If he does so, it will be an improvement upon the practice of the present Government. ' But will he be in office in the coming financial year? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Some one be in office.",46
351,Mr JOHNSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,I hope that it will be some one whose views differ entirely from those of the present Treasurer. Any Treasurer coming from this side of the chamber will show more consideration for the rights of the States than he has shown.,46
352,Mr KELLY,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Some one has said that any change in the Treasurership must be for the better. Air. JOHNSON - Thes e Estimates, in my opinion, have been unduly loaded for an ulterior purpose not made clear by the Treasurer; a view shared with many honourable members on this side, and, perhaps, on the other, too. M:. BRUCE SMITH - The purpose is quite clear; it is part of an attempt tofrighten the States.",46
353,Mr JOHNSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I hope that the Committee, in dealing with these Estimates, will vote only such sums as may reasonably be expected to be expended before the 30th June next. Expenditure which cannot take place until next year should be provided for on the Estimates-in-Chief for that year. We must cut our coat according to our cloth, and until we know what our revenue is likely to be, it is useless to discuss proposals for expenditure. ' That is my idea of sound finance. If I read the signs of the times correctly, the probability is that before many months are over some one else will be at the head of the Treasury, and that the present occupant of the office will no longer control expenditure.",46
354,Mr HEDGES,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Fremantle) [8.35] Many complaints have been voiced by hon01 able members in regard to the administration of the Commonwealth Departments. It may'well be that what is wrong is due chiefly to defective methods. This is a matter which Ave should take into serious consideration. It would be strange indeed, seeing that Federation brought together so many different systems of book keeping ancl administration, if our method.! were perfect. Our Departments are controlled by officers who were reared in the services of the States, and are acquainted with different practices, ancl it would not be very strange if , instead of the best system being adopted by the Commonwealth, the most antiquated had come on top. Many reforms are required. In . the first place we need simplicity. The public accounts should be presented as clearly as a company's balance-sheet.",46
355,Mr KELLY,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,A grave .reform needed is will the burial of the present. system.,46
356,Mr HEDGES,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Expenditur e on new works should be capitalized, and we should know how much is invested in the transferred Departments, and the interest returned by them. Although Ministers and officials have been blamed, they may not be at fault. . Most of them, I think, are doing their best; but, under a bad system, it may easily happen that, although working very hard, they are not giving the best service to the public. Information - should be more readily obtainable. Methods should be adopted which would enable reasonable information to be procured with the minimum of trouble. This would lighten the work of the Departments. Accounts should be analyzed, and proper statements put before us at least twice a year, showing to the decimal part of a penny the cost of everything that is being done. That is the practice pursued in regard to enterprises not nearly so important as the work of a Government Department. The best methods known to the world should be adopted, and should be adhered to permanently. I have been told that certain employees in Victoria, were promised, thirty years ago, that their work would be classified, and that, although they are now grey-headed men, the classification has not yet taken place. The bringing forward of Additional Estimates is evidence of the want of a proper system. With the Departments growing rapidly, many of the higher officials are practically recommending increases of .salary and promotions to themselves. No doubt Ministers do their best; but they' cannot know everything.",46
357,Mr BAMFORD,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,The Public Service Commissioner has absolute control of the service.,47
358,Mr HEDGES,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"The work which he has to take in hand is out of all proportion to the energies of any one man. The Minister is charged with starving expenditure, and asked to make more appointments - It is time that Australia recognised that she requires for her Public Service the best men procurable, and that brains must be paid for. Well-paid, brainy men, who will devote their energies to the perfection of systems for best serving the public interests are better than hosts of underpaid men. It does riot always lessen work to increase the number of workers; it often increases it, by creating a need for extra supervision, and increasing bookkeeping. We expected under. Federation the effecting of economies, uniformity of system in bookkeeping and administration, and <i better service; but, although Ministers ancl officials try to do their best, complaints rife, ancl no improvement is effected. This is because we have not tried to rectify our svstems. Other Governments, however, have regarded it as important that the best system should be ascertained and adopted. I should like to draw the attention of the Committee to the report of what is known as the Keep Commission, which was appointed by President Roosevelt*, and directed to ascertainwhere and in what respects our present Government methods f all short of the best business standards of today, and to recommend measures of reform. This is not ancient history. The report of the Commission has not long been published, and it pointed to an appalling state of affairs prevailing in the Public Service of the United States. When such a condition of affairs can prevail in America, notwithstanding the reputed smartness of the people of that country, surely, having regard to the short life of the Commonwealth, we need not be surprised if our own Departments are in an equally bad position. The trouble in connection with our Departments is due, not to Ministers or officers, but to the system.",47
359,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Who is to be held responsible for the system?,47
360,Mr HEDGES,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I do not know; perhaps the honourable member may be blamed for it. The honourable member for West Sydney referred to-night to the honourable member, and in connection with one of our public Departments, pictured to the Committee a state of affairs so bad that, if it is not overdrawn, it is time that we seriously set to work to secure improvements. As the outcome of the report of the Keep Commission, one ledger is now being kept where 400 were formerly written up.. There is no reason to believe that the ledger-keepers under the old system were not working harder than is the one ledgerkeeper employed underthe new regime.",47

We need to appoint a Commission, consisting of the' ablest men we can select, to inquire into the administration of the service. I wish it to be distinctly understood, however, that in making this statement. I make no charge against any Minister, or public servant. are Notwithstanding that there is so much room for dissatisfaction in connection with our public Departments, every man in the service may be doing his best. The Keep Commission consisted of men holding very high positions in the service of the United States of America. It comprised the Honourable Charles A. Keep, Assistant Secretary to the'Treasury j the Honourable'^Frank H. Hitchcock, First Assistant Postmaster-General; the Honourable .Lawrence O. Murray, Assistant Secretary of Commerce and' Labour; the Honourable James R. Garfield, at that time Chief of the Bureau of Corporations; ancl the Honourable Gifford Pinchot, Chief of the Forest Service. Amongst the discoveries that it made was the fact that one of the Departments hacl been purchasing ink year after year at three' dollars a dozen, 'whilst another Department was being supplied with the same brand of writing fluid at a uniform price of 1.70 dollars per dozen.",47
363,Mr CARR,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,The honourable member cloes not Suggest that that state of affairs' exists here ?,48
364,Mr HEDGES,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"It may do. We do not know what may be going on - Then again it was found that the morning's mail regularly reached the desks of the persons for whom it was destined not earlier than .noon of the following day. know that the position is not the same in the Commonwealth service. In an article published in the American Review of Reviews for February, it is pointed out thatIt was the "" Keep Commission,"" officially known as the Committee on .Departmental Methods, that brought to light not only a number of startling - facts . . . . but revealed at the same time errors and irregularities in method which demanded immediate correction in' the interest of efficient and economic Government. Many of the indicated reforms have already been made, but others must await the sanction of Congress. Abuses that grew out of the spoils system were found to be still in existence-as in one division where sixty-five men were employed copying . letters in longhand into huge tomes that were never referred to. In one of the offices wliere the system of bookkeeping recommended by the Commission has been installed, a single ledger is now made to serve the purpose for which 400 were formerly employed, and the one is no larger than any of those which it has replaced. There may be hundreds of men in the Commonwealth service who are trying to cb their best under a very bad system, and many of them may be very poorly paid. My contention is that it is better to have . one capable man and to pay him well than t.i have twenty-three poorly paid officers. The dispoveries of the Keep Commission should serve as an ""eye-opener"" to us, and we should profit by them. The article continuesIn many instances the Committees Found twoand in some cases three and-four-clerk s doing precisely the same work. And in not a :f.iw cases it was work that it ha-s been advisable to dispense with altogether. . . . The investigation which has uncovered these conditions, thereby effecting a saving of millions of dollars annually to the taxpayers, has actually cost the Government about $2,000. All those employed in the work rendered their services without compensation, and without taking time from their regular duties. This fact in itself is a striking illustration of the new spirit of devotedness that has entered our civil service, and is fast pervading its ranks. Why should not the same feeling pervade the ranks of the Commonwealth service? It is pointed out in this article thatThe Commission carefully selected seventy employees of the Government with varied experience, and formed them into sub-committees, which were used as probes to search the innermost recesses of the administrative machinery and discover the actual existing conditions. I think that we need to do something in the same direction. It is idle, for iis to sit here as the elect of the people, and to blame the employees of the Commonwealth for failing to do this and that, when we have made no effort to concentrate the work of the We do. not Departments. The Departments taken over - from the States have been groping in the dark just as we have been, and we clo not know whether, in the work of amalgamating the several systems of the States the best have not been discarded and the worse adopted. Business people recognise that there are new methods of bookkeeping that are well worth looking into. I know, of a gentleman in Melbourne who allowed his son to undergo a business college course here, and then sent him to England, whenc he will proceed to America, with the objec! . of inquiring into various systems of business management. I hold that the Government should look into those systems and cause the best of them to be adopted ""in our big Departments. I should be the last to blame an employee' of any Department for not doing what was right, if I knew that he was simply overwhelmed with papers and dockets which were a mere duplication of work. I should rather pity him, and try to ease his labour.",48
365,Mr WILKS,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Is there not too much red tape in our Departments'?,48
366,Mr HEDGES,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"^Certainly ; and I ' h o l d that the red-tape system should be abolished. The writer of the article from which I have quoted points oiit thatTo-day there are individual bureaux that havemore employees than the entire departmental 1 service had in 1853, and the responsibilities o* their chiefs are incalculably greater than were those of the men who held similar positions 'fifty years ago. Nevertheless, there has never been any attempt to reclassify the positions or to adjust the salaries with reference to changed conditions, so that at the present time tralia. the most startling anomalies and inequities exist. Not only is there a great diversity of compensato tion for' the same kind of work, but persons reof the ablest men in the world. ceiving the higher salaries rendering the simplest routine service, while' others in the lowest grades are performing duties of the most exacting character. One might reasonably imagine this to be a description of one of our own Departments. It describes exactly the trouble that we are last endeavouring to combat in Australia. Here is another interesting statement regarding the effect of the old system obtaining in the public Departments of the United StatesThese conditions have the effect to the Government service two distinct classes of men : First, those who' have little ambition, no stomach for the struggle of the strong, who find in a Washington clerkship a peaceful haven and a modest competence for life. It is stated, further, that - . The recommendations of the Commission, which will require Congressional approval, contemplate a complete reclassification of the service, and a corresponding readjustment of salaries. The proposed system aims lo attract a higher grade of recruits by doing away with the $50 and $60 a, month clerks, and making the salary for the lowest grade $900 a year. I think our desire is that the public servants of Australia shall be as well treated as are those of any other part of the world. I am sure that we can never accomplish what we desire, unless we employ skill and talent such as were available upon the Commission which has been appointed in America. VVe should all feel proud if we could say that our Commonwealth Departments were conducted better than any other similar Departments, and we should all be supremely happy if we were never - obliged to ask Ministers a question which - was calculated to annoy them. I blame no Minister and no Government employee for the position which the Postal Department occupies today. We must recognise the necessity of formulating a system' which will practically run itself. I invite the attention of the Treasurer, who has just entered the Chamber, to the following extract from the report from which I have ouotedAs an example, the Treasury, which formerly only balanced its books once a year, at the expense of great time and trouble,, now has a double entry system of bookkeeping in - force which enables it to strike a true balance at the close of each day's work.",48
367,Mr WEBSTER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Does the honourable member mean to say that a similar system is not in operation here?,49
368,Mr HEDGES,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I am explaining the system which obtains in a country where these men are just as smart as they are in AusI am reading what appears to me be common-sense from a report by some The .arare in many cases ticle continuesIn a certain branch of the Government where large and numerous financial transactions are carried on, the officials were accustomed to take 90 days to render an account, but are now ready to do so daily. If a disbursing officer makes his payment, for intance, at 10 o'clock in the morning, he can give a complete account of his affairs at noon the next day. The Auditor of the Treasury, who has been in the habit-and necessarily so under the old system-of settling disbursing officers' accounts largely on faith, now has all the cheques and vouchers before him with of attracting which to verify them. ' and There are many other passages in this arand ticle which I should like honourable members to read for themselves, but there is one to which I desire to direct special attention. It is as followsHardly .any ""check is placed on waste or peculation. It would seem that every employee of the Government in Washington, from Cabinet Minister to coloured messenger, uses 23 pencils each month, or a total of 7,000,000 pencils a year, at a cost of $150,000. How do we know what is going on here? It is to stop"" this sort of thing that I advocate a system of analyses of supplies such as obtains in connection with all big concerns. Contractors, for example, know to the decimal part of a penny the exact cost of the oil and fuel necessary to run a locomotive, and even of the waste - which is used to clean it.",49
369,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Does the honourable member think that Ministers have nothing to do but to count pencils?,49
370,Mr HEDGES,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Unde r the system that I - advocate, if a Minister devoted only half-an-hour each month to the subject, he would be able to ascertain' whether any"" waste was going on. We should have all our officers graded, so that at a glance one would be able to see whether, as the result of back-stairs influence, a particular officer was getting a higher salary than another, notwithstanding that he was performing less work. I was so impressed by the business-like methods adopted by the Commissionto which I have called attention that I felt I was justified in bringing them under the notice of honourable members.",49
371,Mr HALL,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Werriwa) [9.8] - During the course of his remarks the honourable member who has just resumed his seat said that he blamed nobody for the condition of affairswhich obtains in the Post Office.,49

373,Mr HALL,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I did not hear him say that. I cannot help thinking that the bulk of the blame for the present must be laid at the door of the Treasurer, who has refused to make funds available for necessary works.",50

But in his Ministerial city the 'honourable gentleman exhibits a penuriousness which, if displayed jn private institution. affairs, would speedily make him wealthy.",50
376,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,The increased expenditure does not show that.,50
377,Mr HALL,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"But the Treasurer will not recognise that he is dealing with expanding Department. As a country reBill . presentative I receive numerous communications from business centres in my torate asking for telephonic facilities. Whenever the Department is approached it payable Commonwealth services. explains that a certain contribution on part of the residents will be necessary, '.rhe latter perform their portion of contract, and the Postmaster-General alWhile, most invariably writes that the work has been approved and will be proceeded with without delav. What happens quently is evidenced by the following letter, which is a very fair sample of the correspend spondence which I receive in reference postal mattersAbout six months ago I. signed an agreement with the Commonwealth Postal authorities, ing at the same time one year's 4 c , for a telephone service from Burrowa to a point about six miles from the latter place, which the postal authorities were to erect upon their own telegraph poles.

385,Mr SPENCE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Darling) [9.16] - Some comment has been made on the introduct on ; of the Additional Estimates so soon after we have dealt with the Estimates-in-Chief ; but for that I think honourable members, as a whole, - ought to take some share of the blame, particularly the Opposition, who are supposed to be the critics of the Government. We have been living for a long time on Supply Bills, and it is generally admitted that that is a most undesirable system. However, what has taken place seems to' have been by tacit consent; but henceforth there ought to be a definite understanding, so that there may be a more satisfactory conduct of the financial business of the Commonwealth. In regard to the Post and Telegraph Department, there is some difficulty in ascertaining who is to blame for a state of affairs which, if permitted to continue, will make the Commonwealth most unpopular, and give State rights advocates what they have not had in the past, namely, some reasonable ground of complaint. Even in so small a matter as the appointment'of an additional messenger, it is stated that funds are not available, to pay his wages. I am quite ashamed of having to send the departmental replies on to people in the country districts, who cannot understand how it is that the great. Commonwealth, with its immense income,* cannot find sufficient money to carry on the - most ordinary work of the post offices. When it is explained to the people that all"" expenditure has to be approved by the House, they ask why the House has riot sanctioned it ; and, of course, there is no answer. It is very possible that the House, as a whole, is to blame for allow- ing matters to come tp such a ""pass. In the case of many applications which are made to the Department and where the work is delayed, no explanation whatever is given. Sometimes we are told that there is a shortage of material; but, if that be so, somebody must be to blame. Only today I - heard of an application for a telephone to be fixed in a new building within two blocks of the Ballarat Post Ofiice. The application was made, the agreement signed, and the cash paid a month ago, but now the applicant is told, without any explanation, that he will have to wait at least another month before he can get his telephone..",50
386,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,I am not to blame.,51
387,Mr SPENCE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I find in the Department a great disposition on the part of officers to pass on the blame from themselves to others. From my experience of the Central Office and Mr Scott, I believe that gentleman to be a prompt business man; and attempts have been made, quite unjustly, in New South Wales, for instance, to make the central administration responsible for delay that has taken place. Then there is also a disposition to put the blame on the Public Service Commissioner, in many cases most unjustly. There is no doubt that the Commonwealth Government have improved the status of the service, and acted liberally in the matter of wages, while greatly extending postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities to the public. It may be that this extension and development has proved too much for some of the officers; but, whatever the cause, the whole system is wrong, and our first duty is to find out where the cause really lies. In the Sydney ofiice, with which I am most familiar, there appears to be, not so much a shortage of hands, as a lack of organization. There is too much "" red tape "" amongst the officials themselves, as is shown in the case of anv little inquiry, which is attended by a great deal of unnecessary clerical work entirely foreign to private business. ' Tn the case of a private firm, the foreman or the man in charge would, in the case of any dispute, have the parties before him, and dispose of the matter in a quarter of an hour; but in the Department there are applications, reports, minutes, and so forth, the preparation and consideration of which occupy much time. The Commonwealth is not responsible, because the system to which I am now referring grew up when the Department was administered by the States Governments.",51
388,Mr THOMAS BROWN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,I think it has been intensified under the Commonwealth.,51
389,Mr SPENCE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Whether that be so or not, there is a great deal too much "" red tape,"" which wastes the time of the officers and leads to the neglect of the public. A good illustration of this occurred the other day in Sydney. In the case of an appJ:cation for a telephone to be attached to a new building within a very short distance of the General Post Office, an officer of the Department had called twice. When it had been decided by the.applicant what sort of instrument he would have, and how. many, he telephoned asking the officer to call again. The reply came, by telephone, that written application would have to be made before the officer could call. A reference to the manager of the Telephone Branch elicited the same reply; and it was not until an intimation was given by the applicant that the Deputy PostmasterGeneralwould.be consulted that the officer telephoned asking at what' hour it would be convenient for him to call. It is ridiculous to compel business people to send in formal applications of the kind, when a word over the telephone ought to be quite sufficient. Personally, I think .it possible that sufficient power and responsibility have not been placed in the hands of the Deputy Postmasters-General. Instead of being left free to generally supervise the Department in the State, a Deputy Postmaster-General is made a slave to clerical work, most of which could be.done by a chief clerk. It is the absence of some definite responsible person which makes it so difficult to ascertain the true cause of a x delay which is often absolutely inexcusable, the stereotyped excuse always being that there are no funds available. I do not know wbo is responsible; but the system is certainly bad, and should be altered. I should like to know whether the 480 appointments in New South VVales and the 315 appointments in Victoria, for which provision is made in these Estimates, are additions to the staff.",51
390,Mr MAUGER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,r^-Yes; they are appointments to the permanent staff.,52
391,Mr SPENCE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Undoubtedl y .there has been a shortage of linemen and fitters in the telephone construction branch. Probably better organization of the clerical and. other departments in the Generalf Post Office would do a great deal to secure efficiency, but shortage of men and material has in many cases resulted' in delay in the construction of necessary works.",52
392,Mr MAUGER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"The appointments provided for will meet the deficiency for a few months; but if the business of the Department goes on increasing at the present rate, we shall later on require still more hands.",52
393,Mr SPENCE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Then provision is being made only for the current financial year?,52
394,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"There have been 1,574 new appointments this year.",52
395,Mr SPENCE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"There is £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 set down to provide for temporary hands in New South Wales.",52
396,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,That money was paid out of the Treasurer's Advance Account.,52
397,Mr SPENCE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"The public expects its reasonable demands to be met, and Parliament is prepared to make provision for meeting them. We should do more than make provision for a month or two in advance. The proposals for expenditure which after investigation have been approved by Departmental officers should not be delayed because there is not money' to carry them out.' Furthermore, the money required should be provided, not from the Treasurer's Advance Account, but from sums voted by Parliament in advance. The last Postmaster-General said that his desire was to put a telephone into every farmer's house. Farmers who have applied for tele'phone connection have written asking me why their applications have not been granted, but I can give them no satisfactory answer. They say, "" The Commonwealth has so much money that it does not know what to do with it , and hands back to the States such large sums that they can afford to reduce taxation, and yet, when telephone communication is asked for, the reply is made that funds are not available."" Although we have had two sets of Estimates before us within a month, if proper provision for extensions has not yet been made, another set of Estimates should be brought down.",52
398,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"These Estimates will provide for the present year. . Mr SPENCE - The country expects the Treasurer' to keep a check on expenditure ; but past experience should enable the Postmaster-General to estimate the probable expansion, of his Department from year to year, and to provide for it in a manner which will enable Parliament to criticise the Government's proposals, instead of merely having to sanction, expenditure after it has been made. By agreeing to Supply Bills, we have destroyed the opportunity ' for effective criticism. More than half the money provided for in these Estimates is for Defence', and as I am favourably 'disposed towards the Defence scheme, - I have nothing to say against the Government proposals. But I again emphasize the niggardliness of the provision made for the growth of the Post and Telegraph Department, which gets bigger and more important every day, as the public takes advantage of the conveniences which it affords. I shall deal with other postal and telephonic matters when we are discussing the Estimates in detail.",52
399,Mr WILKS,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Dalley) [9.39] - Addi tional Estimates, covering sixty-three pages, and providing for the expenditure of £ 4 1 1 , 2 8 2 , constitute a formidable document.

It would, however, be waste of time to criticise the various items, because the expenditure which they cover has already been made.",52

401,Mr WILKS,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"The principle that the representatives of the people are the guardians of the public funds is a fiction, and the public should know it. The Treasurer, ini introducing these Estimates, gave reasons and excuses fo» them.",52
402,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,I did not give excuses.,52
403,Mr WILKS,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"My complaint in regard to the Additional Estimates,' as well as in regard to the Estimatesin-Chief, is that most of the money we are asked to vote has been expended, Parliament having lost its control of the expenditure by passing a series of Supply Bills. The Treasurer has been 'cute enough, however, to use the"" occasion as an opportunity to ascertain the views of members in regard to future financial proposals, and many of them have risen to the burley which he has thrown out.",53
404,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Honourable members generally are in favour of the proposed legislation. "" Mr Wilks - My view is that it should not be discussed until it has been laid on - the table. The Treasurer says that he wishes to leave behind him a reputation f o i economy, as though he had followed in the worthv footsteps of Sir. George Turner. He said that he had not only shut the l i d of the'Trensury chest, but had also sat on top of it. Yet, while wishing the country to regard him as the most economical and careful Treasurer it has had, he poses as Lord Bountiful, and says that he would like to spend more money, at the same time curtailing the State expenditure.",53
405,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,I did not say that.,53
406,Mr WILKS,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"The Treasurer said that he would have liked to make millions of sovereigns which have been returned to the States, and to which they were entitled under the Constitution.",53
407,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Las t year the States received over £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 more than their three-fourths.",53
408,Mr WILKS,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"The Constitution requires that any surplus shall be returned to States each month : but the Treasurer wishes to get possession of all surplus monev, he finds that he can do so only by increasreason ing estimated expenditure. That is not the interests of the taxpayers, merely to prevent revenue from being paid to the .States.",53
409,Mr CHANTER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,The surplus should be ear-marked.,53
410,Mr WILKS,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,That should have been provided for in the Constitution.,53
411,Sir WILLIAMLYN E,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,It can be clone without amending the Constitution.,53
412,Mr WILKS,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I do not intend to express mv views in regard to the Treasurer's finanto-day cial proposals' until they are formally mitted. Everything hinges on the financial arrangement made in the Constitution. The public clearly understand the effect the Braddon section, which must remain in force until 1910, and I think that at the next general. election, which, in the ordinary course of events, will take place in that year, the Government should be prepared to submit to the electors a wellthought-out scheme to take the place of that provision.",53
413,Mr BAMFORD,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,^-The Braddon section does not automatically expire in 1910.,53
414,Mr WILKS,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"No , but a new system to take the place of that for which it provides may then be brought into operation. It is highly important that at the next general election a. well-thought-out scheme with respect to the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States should be submitted to the electors. I know of nothing, better than a modification of the Braddon section. I have read the various schemes that have been proposed by honourable members, ancl have, also noticed the fight put up by the States Treasurers for the interests of the States. To-day the Commonwealth returns to the States sixeighths of the Customs and Excise revenue. If the remaining two-eighths is not sufficient to provide for.Commonwealth expenditure, we should retur-n, f b r a' certain period, only five-eighths to the States, retaining three-eighths.",53
415,Mr CHANTER,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,That is practically the prisoners of Government's offer.,53
416,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,They are not offering to return five-eighths of the Customs and Excise revenue to the States.,53
417,Mr WILKS,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"That is so. The Treasurer desires that these Estimates shall, be passed, so that the unexpended balance may still remain in the Commonwealth the Treasury. The weak spot in the administration of the Public Works branch of the and Commonwealth service is that, for some or other, plans are not in readiness into carry out works for which provision is if it is done made on the Estimates.",53
418,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"The trouble is that we do not pass the Estimates until about six months of the year to which they' relate have expired. _ Mr Wilks - Exactly , but. the Public Works branch of the Department of Home Affairs has not plans in readiness to carry out many of the works for which votes are passed. The Treasurer referred to a law which existed in New South' subWales, under which the unexpended balance of any vote passed, in respect of a Department was placed to the credit of that of Department for the next financial vear. I believe that he was responsible for that legislation. The difficulty is that, in case of the Commonwealth, at the end of the financial year, all unexpended balances must be returned to the States. Apparently the Treasurer finds that the proportion that we are entitled to retain is insufficient finance the projects which he has in mind, but our position in regard to the carrying forward of unexpended balances is very different from that of the States. I have nothing to say in favour of parsimony, for, as the result of a parsimonious adminising tration, we may subsequently have to incur very heavy expenditure. I admit that the great proportion of the public servants the Commonwealth do their work well, but the general public, who have to foot the bill, are not satisfied with the way our Departments are run. They do not know whether the troubles of complain are clue to inefficiency or undermanning, but they certainly wish them to be remedied. A Cabinet Committee is now .supposed to be inquiring into the administration of the Postmaster-General's Department, and it is rumoured that it will recommend the appointment of a Royal Commission to carry on the investigation. The public themselves are familiar with the defects of the Department; they know that it is not run, as it ought to be, in their interests, and their desire is not to ascertain the cause, but to secure a remedy. I am told that a Royal Commission, consisting of mercantile men, will be appointed, and we may be sure that it will recommend that the control of the Department be vested in Commissioners. - , - spect",53
419,Mr CARR,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,Does the honourable member know something as to what is to be done?,54
420,Mr WILKS,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"The honourable member party knows very well which way the cat will jump. The Treasurer today asks us not to criticise these Estimates, but merely to pass them, .and so to indemnify him in respect of moneys already expended. I ject to the Estimates being introduced serial form. We had, first of all, the Estibefore mates-in-Chief. Those were followed by Supplementary Estimates, and we are now asked to deal with Additional Estimates. The Departments of the Commonwealth people. should be able to present complete Estimates early each year. My contention is scheme. that we should refuse to grant Supplies until the Estimates are dealt with. Until we refuse to pass Supply Bills we shall never have proper control of the Estimates. I shall not waste the time of the Comter. mittee by pretending to criticise these Estithe mates, for the - time has passed when we could be said to have them under control. Within the next week or two the Government will ask us to pass a Bill covering Supply for the first two months of the next to financial year, and, as honourable members are anxious to get into recess, that will probably be done.. If it is, we shall at once lose our power as custodians of the Estimates for the next financial year. I have protested again and again against the passof Supply Bills, but, apparently, to no purpose. Under these Estimates we are asked to .vote a sum of £ 2 8 4 , 0 0 0 , which of cannot possibly be' expended during the present financial year.

423,Mr WILKS,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"They wish to secure as large ah appropriation as possible, so that the trust funds may be increased andused in connection with other legislation which the Surplus Revenue Bill suggests. I do not believe that the Commonwealth should play second fiddle to the States in respect of matters that are distinctly of Commonwealth concern, and I fail to understand why the Prime Minister and the Treasurer should be waiting for the Premiers of the various States to formulate a policy with, reto our financial arrangements. It wasthought that with the"" establishment of Federation the occasion for Conferences of State Premiers would disappear. In pre-Federation days we had, a. Federal s Council which possessed no Executive power, but met to discuss questions such as those which the States Premiers met to deal with last week. The Premiers nf the States' meet only to discuss questions affecting more obthan one State, ancl yet we find the Prime in Minister and the Treasurer waiting on them formulating a policy in regard to the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. I should like the Government to. submit a well-thought-out scbeme to the",54

425,Mr WILKS,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,If we do not approve of the Government scheme we shall reject it . The Commonwealth Parliament ought not to shelve its own responsibility in this matI f the Government of the day arestrong enough to carry their scheme it will come into effect.,54
426,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"It will be the Commonwealth scheme for the time being. . Mr Wilks - When the right honourable member was in office in Western Australia he used to play the part of the strong Premier, and that is what the Premiers of the States are doing today. If we allow them to invade the Federail province we shall' weaken our position in the estimation of the public. At the same time we should mind our own business. We certainly ought not to invade the provinces of the States Parliaments or of the States Governments. If we are dissatisfied with the powers that we possess we must ask the electors in a constitutional way to extend them; but I do not think that they will bcprepared to grant any extension until we prove ourselves worthy of those we already possess! I do not propose to deal with these Estimates in. detail, for to attempt to debate them would be little short of farcical. Some honourable members may exercise their ingenuity in airing grievances in connection with them, but 1 do not wish to do so. If we are to adopt the sysfem of passing Supply Bills from month to month, do not let us delude the people into the belief that their representatives can be watchful custodians of the public funds. I object ro such a system, 'and think that we have no higher duty than that of keenly scrutinising public expenditure. Mr KI NG O'MALLEY (Darwin) [9-59]-- I do °r. propose at this late hour n to enter into a discussion of these Estimates, because, as has been pointed out again and again during the debate, a large proportion of the sum that we are asked to vote ha's been already expended. The Treasurer spoke today about returning to the States a fixed sum of .£6,000,000 annually.",55
427,The CHAIRMAN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I must ask the honourable member not to discuss that matter. Mr KI NG O'MALLEY.^-The Treasurer laid it clown that no matter how much the States might borrow to develop their own resources, they ought not to receive a larger sum from the Commonwealth.",55
428,The CHAIRMAN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I must again ask the honourable member not to deal with that question. - Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - I am very glad that the honourable member for Fremantle quoted from the report of the Commission which investigated the working of the Public Service in America. Some time ago I intended to bring that report under the notice of this Chamber; but eventually I decided not to do so, because I was satisfied that honourable members would exclaim, "" Oh, this is merely another Yankee notion."" I am very pleased that the honourable member for Fremantle, who is a' first-class business man, has quoted from that report, with a view to showing that even Australians have something to learn. My condemnation of the Government is not prompted by any dislike of them. I blame them merely because they have failed to appoint a Commission to investigate the working of our Public Service.",55
429,Mr THOMAS BROWN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"A Cabinet Committee is inquiring into the administration of the Post Office at the present time. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That Committee has neither head nor tail. It is neither male nor female. Politically, it belongs to the neuter gender. Ministers are not to blame for the existing condition of affairs. If the leader of the Opposition, or the honourable member for Flinders, or the right honourable member for Swan, or the honourable member for Wide Bay, were at the head of a Ministry tomorrow, they would have to contend with the system which now prevails. The evils associated with that system are the result of promotion by seniority. My complaint is that the Ministry refuse tp appoint a Royal Commission to attack this evil in the way that President Roosevelt attacked it. It is true that he placed his own; friends upon that. Commission, but they were honest men. Personally, I should be perfectly willingto trust any member of this Committee to select the members of a Royal Commission to investigate the working of the Public Service of the Commonwealth. I will guarantee that such a_ body would recommend an improvement upon the wretched - system which is responsible for all the trouble that we are experiencing. I do not know that we can improve upon the Ministers that we now have. They are simply a fair average of the members of this House. There are no Napoleons here, and very few Grouchys. I do trust that even at this late hour of the day the Government will have the courage to face this question, and to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into and report upon the efficiency of the Public Service. We may possess the best system of accountancy in the world, but if so, it is strange that business men outside have to Take cognisance of every little detail connected with their expenditure; banks balance their booKs every afternoon, whereas we do not. Surely the same system can be introduced into our Public Service. Why should the system adopted by the Government be an antibefore quated one? Why should it be one obtained 2,000 or 3,000 years ago? the system that Jeremiah and all the old gents adopted thousands of years I should be sorry to ruffle the.composure of Ministers, who have trouble enough on their hands at present. But if they had courage to emerge from the ruck and to "" We want the best system in the world,"" surely they would get it. . Able business men are to be found both in Melbourne Sydney, and they find that they, have to. attend'to details, otherwise they would land themselves in the Bankruptcy Court. I satisfied that there is an'enormous waste going on in our Commonwealth Departown ments. That, is why Socialism is unthe popular today.",55
430,Mr BAMFORD,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"--Who says that it is fact. unpopular? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Postal of Department, owing to the inefficient systion tem which obtains there, is making GovernSubjects ment institutions unpopular, and no doubt the ."" boodleiers "" are doing their best to stroy them. Surely no. honourable member would like to see the.Post Office controlled by private enterprise. In Tasmania, some post offices are overmanned, whilst others are undermanned. Some of the officers there complain that they are overworked whilst others have no work at all. These are matters which require investigation. believe that the Commonwealth is losing Tasmania, thousands of pounds annually as the result of the inefficiency of some of the-Departorderedthe ments. Would it not bebetter to retire all those officers who were promoted because of their seniority, and because they happened . to possess political influence days gone by, and to put efficient men their places? I wish to see something done to make the Postal Department progressive and up-to-date. If , at intervals, various Deputy Postmasters-General were transferred from one State to another, . would get away from family influences, and that would be a good thing. It to me that they aTe all interwoven the woof and warp of matrimony, gress, so that a sort of family circle - has been established. If they were transporation. ferred from State to State at intervals, this family interest would be burst up, and by-and-by we - should get efficiency. Mr Bright, .of Brisbane, has brougbt about quite a reformation in the Melbourne Post Office, where the officers are dancing like bob-tailed bulls in clover-the y never .knew what it was to have a real head that over them. And if Mr Bright has It is done so much for the Department in good Melbourne,' a' Melbourne man might be ago. able to do as much for it in Brisbane. I wish that honourable members would understand that since Federation they have the tu fill a double capacity. They owe a say, paramount allegiance to the Commonwealth and a subordinate allegiance to the States; but the interests of both are interwoven. and Commonwealth and States are composed of the same people, have, the same interests, and involve the same financing; and it must am not be forgotten that if we destroy the power of any of the States, we destroy our power-that if we empty' the pockets ot States we empty our own pockets. We are all .one, and we must not forget the A few days ago, President Roosevelt addressed a great conference of States representatives at Washington on the subject the conservation of forests, the preservaof water rights, and generally on those which make it clear that there is a country to preserve not only for the pre-, desent generation, but for future generations. That is the spirit I desire to see abroad in Australia. I suppose it makes no difference what honourable members may say in regard to these Estimates, but I should like. to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General the fact that there is a contract in existence to carry the mails from I Magnet Junction 10 miles' to Magne.t in I notice by the newspapers that the directors of the Magnet mine have men there to move out of their little homes, and as 400 men, women, and - children' depend on this railway for the conveyance of their food, I desire to know in whether the Government have power to comin pel this, monstrous boodleier company not' only to carry the mails, but also to transport means of subsistence. This is a very the serious matter, and if the Government have no legal power, I think that, on the score they of humanity, we ought to find some means of compelling the company to do What is seems right. In the Post and Telegraph Dein partment we require efficiency and proand it ought to be conducted on the same basis as any successful business corThe old slipshod system must go. I - firmly believe that a thorough investigation would reveal the fact that the work is double-banked to an enormous extent-that twenty and thirty men axe doing the work of one man-and if the Government know that this is so, why has the Postmaster-l*eneral not the courage to-attack the position? - Mr DUGALD THOMSON (North Sydney) [10.20] - I have already called attention-in a general way to items, the necessity for which ought to have been well within the knowledge of those who prepared the. Estimates-in-Chief. There is not a major instance, but an instance of what pears to be an unnecessary omission fiom the Estimates-in-Chief,. under the heading of "" The Library."" In the Estimates-inChief, a sum of ,£1,500 was cut down for books and bookbinding, including insurance against fire, being similar to the amount voted in the previous year. In the Additional Estimates, however, a sum of is provided, although there are only six weeks of the financial yearto run.",56
431,Mr DEAKIN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"I am. informed by Library Committee that some exceptional purchases of books from a library have been made, and that those books have to bound.",57

433,Mr DEAKIN,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"That is in consequence of * it being necessary to provide special cabinets for the card catalogue which has been adopted. . Mr DUGALD THOMSON-But we .find the same sort of thing running through all the Departments, and some explanation is necessary.",57
434,Mr DEAKI N,ADDITIONA L ESTIMATES,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [10.23] - I have already mentioned that the Library Committee inform me that there axe exceptional circumstances in each case referred to by the honourable member. The first is the purchase of an unusual number of books, mainly, I understand, valuable' Australian works, - frorn a library; and these, of course, had - to be secured at once, and need to be bound. The second increase is caused by - an extension of the card catalogue system, .under which the Library is now worked. ' Proposed vote agreed to.
