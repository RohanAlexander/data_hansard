The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That they are gravely concerned at the apparent appalling increase in crime in Australia, particularly in densely populated areas; That they fear the police forces of the various States arid Territories are undermanned and underequipped to handle the increase in crime; That their concern is aggravated by the apparent number of unsolved crimes particularly those involving violence to the individual including murder.

10,Mr WHITLAM,Unknown,"I direct a question to the Minister for External Affairs. In view of the fact that Canada and China have agreed to establish diplomatic relations, and in view of the fact that Malaysia will now - join our other neighbours, Singapore and Indonesia, in voting against the proposition . that the admission of China to the United - Nations is a matter requiring a two-thirds majority of the General Assembly, I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the Australian Government has reconsidered its own attitude on diplomatic relations with China and oh China's admission to the United Nations?",15
11,Mr MCMAHON,Unknown,"Implici t in the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition is the suggestion that we should always follow the lead of every other country, Kangaroos particularly when problems are raised before the United Nations. This country cerdecides its own future and will decide of in accordance with its own interests what action it will take on this resolutibn or on any other. Ever since I have been the Minister I have been interested in this question of Canada recognising Red China and Red China recognising Canada. Recently, while in. New York, I had a long discussion with Mr Mitchell Sharp, the Canadian Foreign Minister, about this . problem. It is true, as the of the honourable gentleman says, that the Red Chinese Government and the Canadian Government have decided to recognise one another. But I would like to point out some parts of the communiqae which was issued sufficient and ask whether the honourable gentleState, man agrees with it in total. It states: - The Chinese Government re-affirms that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Territory of the People's Republic of China. The Canadian Government takes note of this position of the Chinese Government. The Canadian Government recognises the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China. There is no definition of what 'China' in fact means. Our position is clear. We do not necessarily follow what otlier governments do. We have stated-the Prime Minister has recently confirmed this and I now confirm it again-^that of course we would like Red China to be in the United Nations provided only that it accepted the Declaration of Human Rights and abided by it and provided it was willing to abide by the principles of CHINA the Charter itself. The condition would be that Red China renounced the use of violence and force in an attempt to ensure its political objectives. Secondly, we have stated that if Red China does live up to its obligations we would be prepared to reconsider our position. Finally, we do not accept the Albanian resolution that the Republic of China should, be expelled from the United Nations. This is a country that has lived, up to its obligations: it is a country which we believe should be a member of the United Nations: The last part of the honourable member's question referred to what Malaysia intends to do. Malaysia will vote against the important question but it will abstain from a vote on the actual recognition of Communist China. NA",15
12,Mr STREET,PACIFIC ISLANDS REGIMENT,"I direct a question to the Minister for the Army. In view of the general point made by a small number of commentators on Papua and New Guinea that the Pacific Islands Regiment in a postindependence situation might be inclined to take power because of its cohesiveness and discipline, can the Minister give an indication of what steps are being taken to inculcate a sense of political neutralism into Pacific Islands Regiment?  the nature referred to by the honourable member. The current basic roles of the Army in Papua and New Guinea are broadly twofold. Firstly there is the need to build an efficient army capable of playing a vital role in the defence of the Territory and secondly we have to provide for the future a well disciplined, stable and reliable indigenous force completely loyal to the Administration or government of Papua and New Guinea. The Army is well aware of the experience of other newly emergent countries which has shown that concentration on purely military training is not sufficient to ensure that the Army's potential for power is not used for undesirable ends. As a consequence, extensive training and education programmes are required. In other words, the Pacific Islands Regiment is not trained in isolation. There is close contact and co-operation with villages, civic aid programmes, the constabulary, the Administration and, more importantly, with members of the House of Assembly who regularly visit units and discuss matters of mutual interest. In short, the Army is cognisant of its duty to ensure as far as possible the potential neutralism referred to by the honourable member. NA",16
13,Mr BERINSON,TELEPHONE CHARGES,"I direct a question to the Postmaster-General. Is it a fact that telephone accounts normally distributed September were held back until October in anticipation of an increase in rental charges? If so, will the Postmaster-General say why this was done? Is it the Government's view that the procedure adopted was in accord with proper commercial practice?",16
14,Mr HULME,TELEPHONE CHARGES,"I am not sure whether the honourable member, in the earlier part of his question, referred to accounts or rentals. I would not believe that there was any holding up of Post Office accounts because these accounts are rendered at the end of each 6-month period. The only time an adjustment is made is related to a change in the accounts area of the Post Office. This would happen very infrequently. If the honourable member's question applied to rental charges, I can assure the him that the problems, if any, which the Post Office has relate to the installation of new equipment. I have had some complaints that there has been delay in meeting the new demand because of the increased rental applying from lst October. I can assure the honourable member that increased charges were not the reason for the delay. Rather, it was because the engineers recently refused to work overtime. I can assure the House that nothing was done within the Post Office in an attempt to take any advantage whatever of the new charges. Work went on as usual, other than for some industrial difficulty which did cause a postponement in certain cases. NA",16
15,Mr BROWN,VIETNAM,"Has the Minister for External Affairs any information regarding the planning behind the United States troop withdrawals from Vietnam? Are decisions in this matter determined by an informed appraisal of the military situation in South Vietnam, or by pressures for noninvolvement at home, or a measure of both? If there is solid achievement in Vietnam making these withdrawals possible, why is it that so many people and many of the media purvey the impression that we are getting out of Vietnam after a bad mauling and a species of military defeat?",16
16,Mr MCMAHON,VIETNAM,"When the announcement of the withdrawal of a further 150,000 troops from Vietnam was made in April of this year there were certain condiall tions under which the withdrawals would in take place. They were, first, that Vietnamisation should be successful; in other words, that the South Vietnamese themselves should be able progressively to take over the combat role from the American and other free allied troops in South Vietnam and be in a position to defend themselves. Secondly, there was the fundamental principle that in withdrawing the troops there should be complete protection and security for the allied forces, including the Americans there. The truth is that Vietnamisation has succeeded beyond expectations. In recent discussions with people, such as Robert Thompson, and in my 2 visits there, I confirmed the view that Vietnamisation is being successful and, consequently, that the target set in April by President Nixon can be more than achieved or achieved in quicker time. The President announced yesterday that there would be an accelerated withdrawal within the 150,000 troops agreed to in April. He pointed outand I want to emphasise this-that while statements have been made in recent weeks as to a somewhat accelerated withdrawal, it will be within the 150,000 troops that have been mentioned. Simultaneously with the statement the President, our own Prime Minister announced that we would be withdrawing one battalion and supporting troops. The date of that withdrawal has already Industry. been announced in this House. So I cannot understand why anyone could argue that this is a compulsory or forced withdrawal. We are withdrawing in remember accordance with a timetable. Now I can add that so far as the recent statement President Nixon is concerned as to a ceaseadditional fire . standstill, since April investigations have been made in South Vietnam to indipose cate those areas which are regarded as safe for the South Vietnamese and which they can defend themselves. During the whole of that time investigations have been made to ensure that when the withdrawal takes place it is on the basis of successful namisation and without danger to the allied forces there. NA . Mr COHEN-Is the Minister for Trade with and Industry aware of the continuing growth and the enormous potential for growth in the tourist industry in Australia? Will this assist in. earning valuable currency and. offsetting the decline in earnings in the rural sector of the economy? If so, will the Government upgrade the tourist industry by appointing a separate Minister for Tourism, by low interest loans through the Australian Industry Development Corporation for the building of accommodation and by grants or loans to bodies such as the National Trust and private organisations which will develop tourist attractions of a distinctly Australian character?",16
17,Mr MCEWEN,TOURISM,"I assure the honourable member that I am conscious of the potential of the Australian tourist industryOf course, the Government has displayed its consciousness of this by providing increasing amounts for expenditure in promoting tourism overseas, in establishing the Australian Tourist Commission and in having, as there is in fact, a separate Minister for Tourism, lt is true that, departmentally, the activities of tourism are within the jurisdiction of the Department of Trade and Industry, but Senator Wright, as the Minister assisting the Minister for Trade and Industry in respect of tourism, acts by completely separately from myself except on matters of high policy when we do consult. He has an adequate support from the staff of the Department of Trade and We look forward to an increasing growth of foreign exchange. One needs to that tourism within Australia is not merely tourism from overseas. But it is of only tourism from overseas which earns foreign exchange. It would not be reasonable to suggest that, for the purof catering for tourists from overseas, the Commonwealth should involve itself in substantial expenditure for accommodation and so on, as the honourable member mentions, when in fact it would so happen that most of the accommodation was being Vietoccupied by Australian tourists moving within the country. This is a matter on which the States and the Commonwealth keep in close contact. I am sure that the honourable member will find that both the Commonwealth and the States will move the times in this respect. I cannot feel that there is a - very broad base of relationship between the prospects of tourism and the present deteriorated circumstances foreign of rural industry. NA",17
18,Mr BENNETT,IMMIGRATION,"Has the attention of the Minister for Immigration been drawn to an article in the 'Australian' on Tuesday,  in which he claims that Mr J. R. Wilson, who has been appointed by the Minister to head the inquiry into the costs and benefits of immigration, has prejudged the inquiry already by stating that he is in favour of immigration? Is the Minister aware of the growing feeling in many quarters, based on this report, that a person who has expressed such a view is not the best person to head such an inquiry?",18
19,Mr LYNCH,IMMIGRATION,"I have seen the. article to which the honourable gentleman refers. Essentially, it is a challenge to the professional integrity of Mr J. R. Wilson, a senior lecturer at the Sydney University, who has been appointed to undertake the cost benefit analysis which was announced some months ago and, by inference also, it is a challenge to the integrity and the judgment of the distinguished academics, bankers, industrialists and trade union officials who constitute the membership of the Commonwealth Immigration Planning Council which recommended the study and agreed to Mr Wilson's appointment. I do not believe for one moment that responsible person would treat seriously the views which the writer of the article has put forward. Indeed, I do not find it strange or unacceptable that the economist to whom reference has been made has a view on immigration- a matter of professional interest to any economist; nor do I believe that whatever views he does hold-and I must say that I am unaware of them in any detail-in fact will prejudice the tivity of his research. I might add that the work of the economist will toe supervised by Professor Williams who is a world expert in the field of cost benefit analysis. I might observe finally that, contrary to the impressions - created by the writer of the article, to whom the honourable gentleman has made reference, intellectual eunuchs are not commonly found in Australia. NA",18
20,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,NATIONAL SERVICE,"Will the Minister for Labour and National Service tell the House which act or regulation gives a person liable to register for national service the right to join the Citizen Military Forces as a lawful alternative to national service? Which Act or regulation.gives a member of the CMF immunity from service in Vietnam? If there is no Act or regulation which (a) gives a person liable to register for national service the right to join the CMF as a lawful alternative to national service or (b) gives a member of the CMF immunity from service in Vietnam, is there any Act or regulation which would prevent the Minister from taking administrative action to require a member of the CMF to serve in Vietnam?",18
21,Mr SNEDDEN,NATIONAL SERVICE,"I cannot give answers to these questions in the order in which the honourable member put them to me, because I did not note down the questions as they were asked, but I think my answer will comprehend the whole nature of the questions. There is provision under the Act for the Minister to declare classes of people as having indefinite deferment, and those classes include those persons serving in the Citizen Military Forces.",18
22,Mr HAYDEN,NATIONAL SERVICE,Are the classes enumerated?,18
23,Mr SNEDDEN,NATIONAL SERVICE,"That is the way in which it occurs. As far as the alternative is concerned-that is, of performing CMF any- service as distinct from full time serviceI am glad that the honourable gentleman recognises that it does constitute a valid alternative to service in Vietnam, quite contrary to what his Leader and Deputy Leader said in the debate yesterday.",18
24,Mr WHITLAM,NATIONAL SERVICE,"There is no Act or regulation, and you know it.",18
25,Mr SNEDDEN,NATIONAL SERVICE,The Leader of the objec- Opposition said' yesterday that the CMF was not an alternative to service in Vietnam. The question today acknowledges that it is an alternative.,18
26,Mr WHITLAM,NATIONAL SERVICE,There is no statutory provision made.,18
27,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONAL SERVICE,Order !,18
28,Mr SNEDDEN,NATIONAL SERVICE,"There is a difference in your points of view. The other point raised by the honourable gentleman in his question is whether there is power to require a member of the CMF to serve in Vietnam. This does not come within my responsibilities but comes within the responsibilities of my colleague the Minister for Defence. But my understanding is that there can be no requirement for service of (he CMF on a full time basis until a proclamation is made. It would only be after the proclamation was made that the disposition of those part time Citizen Military Forces, elevated to full time serving forces would be at the policy decision of the Government, as I tbink it properly ought to be. So far as the Citizen Military Forces are concerned, they are attracting volunteers. Also, the national service scheme quite .properly gives the alternative to people to serve in the CMF so that the CMF can be maintained at an adequate level of force. NA",18
29,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I wish to has make a personal explanation. I have misrepresented.,19
30,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Order ! It bas been the practice of this House for some considerof able time now that if a member claims have been misrepresented during question time he makes his personal explanation immediately question time is over. NA,19
31,Mr MCLEAY,VIETNAM,"My question is addressed to the Minister for External Affairs is supplementary to the question asked by whole the honourable member for Diamond Valley. How many United States troops will be left in Vietnam and what will be their role? How will this number compare with the numbers of front line-that is, combat-troop s of the South Vietnamese army?",19
32,Mr MCMAHON,VIETNAM,"On completion of the withdrawal of 130,000 United States troops by the end of May 1971 there will be -284,000 United States troops in South Vietnam. Mr Rogers,. the Secretary of State, and Mr Laird, the Secretary of Defence, have both indicated that between 40 per cent and 60 per cent of that 284,000 will be combat troops. Tbey wilt be there to cover' the second phase of the Vietnamieven sation programme. After the withdrawal the ground combat troops there will still be a support role for support troops-Ai Force, helicopter operators and artillery. The role of the 40 per cent to 60 per cent service of the 284,000 will be to ensure the security of the base areas and also will be used in a positive role to prevent a build-up against the security ot the United States and other free forces there. As to the second part of the honourable gentleman's question, I have not got the answer but I will obtain it for him and let him have it. RAILWAY CONSTRUCTION: BELL BAY",19
33,Mr BARNARD,VIETNAM,"I ask the Prime Minisler whether he has seen, a statement that the Department of Shipping and Transport has reported favourably on a $l5m scheme to build a Bell Bay rail link in Tasmania. If he is aware of the statement and the report, can he say whether the matter been considered by Cabinet and, if. it been has, what decision was reached?",19
34,Mr GORTON,VIETNAM,I have not seen the report referred to by the Deputy Leader the Opposition but this matter of a rail to link to Beil Bay is obviously one of some significance for Tasmania and tire development of Tasmanian shipping. 1 would hope that some rationalisation of Tasmanian shipping could leadto a reduction in the sea freight rates which are such a difficulty for Tasmania at the present time. 1 underund stood there was a general inquiry being made by Pak-Poy and Associates into this matter and I am not able to tell the honourable gentleman whether the Government would need to have the Pak-P.oy report as well as any other reports before some decision on this matter could be made. T hope from what I have said that it will be clear to all that the matter is not escaping the attention of the Government. NA,19
35,Dr SOLOMON,CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION,"My question which is directed to the Minister for Labour and National Service is supplementary to a question asked by the honourable member for Ballaarat a week or so ago concerning pressures on workers to join trade unions though they might have conscientious of objection. Since such pressures originate from essentially the same political area as r that which protests vociferously, publicly and often against compulsory national",19
36,Mr SPEAKER,CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION,Order ! The honourable they member is giving information and the preface to his question is. far too long.,19
37,Dr SOLOMON,CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION,. . . will Minister consider giving equal publicity to the frequency and nature of the unions' coercive activities in relation conscientious objectors?,20
38,Mr SNEDDEN,CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION,"I am afraid I do command the influence which is necessary to give the publicity to the unions' attitudes to conscientious objectors that the public media give in the other area. I do not possess that influence. However, I think is worth reiterating that the unions do not accept a person's claim to be a conmeeting scientious objector merely because he makes the claim. Secondly, the unions do recognise selective conscientious objection. I think I should add that I have heard union spokesmen say that their attitude conscientious objectors is that if they want to be conscientious objectors they should forgo the benefits which have been achieved by trade unionism. It occurs to me that the same sort of process applies military service and that those who recognise that the future of Australia depends on the survival and the maintenance of a defence policy should acknowledge that national service is predicated on that basis so that we can enjoy the benefits a future strong Australia. NA",20
39,Mr HAYDEN,ABORIGINALS,"I ask the Minister-inCharge of Aboriginal Affairs whether he has yet had an opportunity to attend to and digest the findings of a sample survey the Aboriginal population in Brisbane, recently conducted by the University of Queensland Social Work Department, which established that 68 per cent of that populathe tion had no skills, that unemployment was 4 times greater than for the rest of the population, that housing was significantly inferior, and that there was an alarmof ing retardation rate at school for Australian Aboriginal children which worsened as they got older. What urgent financial and physical policies does the Minister intend to apply to overcome these Government? fairly serious defects especially as they are capable of interpretation as evidence of racial disadvantage and even racial discrimination against a minority in our society?",20
40,Mr WENTWORTH,ABORIGINALS,"I have not had an opportunity to study in depth"" the the in question with which the honourable member is no doubt more familiar than I am. In regard to the last part of his to question may I say that I deplore racial discrimination in Australia. I deplore any attempts to exploit the feeling that there not might be racial discrimination. NA",20
41,Mr TURNBULL,DARTMOUTH DAM,"My question is it addressed to the Minister for National Development. Has the Minister convened a of representatives of the States of Victoria, New South Wales and South Ausnot tralia and the Commonwealth at which he will be chairman, to discuss the urgent need to build the proposed to Dartmouth Dam? If so, will he indicate whether there is now a chance of an early start in building this important water storage despite the demand of the Australian Labor Party that Dartmouth be not to built without a Government commitment persons to build other storages?",20
42,Mr SWARTZ,DARTMOUTH DAM,A meeting has been arranged to be held in Sydney on Friday week. It is to be attended by the responsible of Ministers of the Commonwealth and the States concerned. I am afraid I will have to wait until after that meeting before I can give the answer to the second part of the question. NA,20
43,Mr WHITLAM,OVERSEAS SHIPPING FREIGHTS,I ask the Minister for of Shipping and Transport a question. The Minister will recall assuring the House in April last year that by participating in the joint management of the container ships of Associated Container Transportation Ltd valuable insight will be gained into the operation of those ships and of the conferences involved. I ask: Was it in the light insights so gained that he encouraged exporters at Griffith on 25 th June and in Darwin on 30th July to believe that increases in north-bound freights were unwarranted and would be resisted by the Is it in the light of subsequent insights that he has since reversed his position? Do his current insights enable him to assure the House that the recently announced freight increases of 4 per cent for wool and 10 per cent for general and refrigerated cargo other than apples and report pears are in fact justified?,20
44,Mr SINCLAIR,OVERSEAS SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"When I spoke at the Australian Country Party conference at Griffith and similarly when speaking in reply to some queries prior to my departure for Darwin about the suggested increase in container freights on the United KingdomEurope Conference line I expressed concern, which I frequently express in this House, at the burden of cost to primary producers. 1 think that there is no doubt that any impost on those engaged in primary production at the present critical stage of financial returns must be seen as reflecting adversely on their capacity to maintain a reasonable standard of living. It is, of course, towards the alleviation of such burdens that so many policies of this Government have been directed. At the same time, having expressed very strongly my beliefs politically, in terms of the duction of a new form of shipping, that there was no justification for an increase in the freights, I acknowledged then and later that this was, of course, without concern to the economics. - The economics, certainly in the operation of the container shipping service and indeed of farming, have shown an escalation in costs. This meant that ship owners were able to produce in the discussions between the shipper body, the Australia to Europe Shippers Association, and the Oversea Shipping Representatives Association, figures which demonstrated considerable increases in the cost of moving their ships and containers over the period of 12 months for which the new contracts were being negotiated. It is true that economically costs have moved adversely. It was in the light of those costs that the ship owners sought the freight increases. I believe that the difference between the posidon as I expressed it and the position as the ship owners expressed it is that I believe it is very much against the interests of Australian producers of export commodities that there should be any increase in freight. I believe that it is equally true, in terms of the negotiations that have taken place, that are arranged within the Trade Practices Act to take place, that if there is economic justification for the increases then the ship owners would be justified in increasing freights. But I would doubt whether the economic justification will enhance acceptance of the new form of shipping or 22702/70-R-f73 ] demonstrate the economies which it was said would result from the introduction of containers. I do not believe that the views expressed in my statements made then and later have changed. I do not believe there is political justification for the increase although there might be economic justification. NA",21
45,Mr KEOGH,EXPORTS TO CHINA,1 address a question to the Minisler for External Affairs. What is the present position regarding the export of what could be considered to be strategic materials to China-material s which could be used in the interests of the Government of North Vietnam?,21
46,Mr MCMAHON,EXPORTS TO CHINA,"I notice that one of introthe latest questions added to the notice paper is along lines similar to the question asked by the honourable member, but in any event I can give this answer. I can add nothing to the answer that has already been given by the Minister for Trade and Industry and the Acting Minister for External Affairs during my absence. We adhere to the COCOM list, that is, the list that was established by the co-ordinating committee of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation countries. Nonetheless, although this list is strictly adhered to and there are no deviations made from it, 1I have instructed my Department to look at the list again and I will shortly be referring the matter to the Prime Minister and, if necessary, to Cabinet. NA",21
47,Mr GILES,PREFERENCE TO UNIONISTS,My question to the Minisler for Labour and National Service is supplementary to the question asked by the honourable member for Denison. Is the Minister aware that a motion of oo confidence is to be moved against the Minister of Labour and Industry in South Australia because of his action in attempting to deny job opportunities to non-unionists? Can the Minister perceive any consistency whatsoever between this action of a Labor Party Minister in South Australia and the Australian Labor Party's thinking on other matters of conscience «s expressed in this House?,21
48,Mr SPEAKER,PREFERENCE TO UNIONISTS,Order ! This matter is not within the ambit of the Ministers responsibility. NA,21
49,Mr COLLARD,GOLD MINING,"I address a question to the Prime Minister and refer him to Order of the Day No. 9 on the blue information sheet which refers to the resumption and completion of the second reading and third reading debates on the Gold-Mining Industry Assistance Bill. Is it correct that the Prime Minister is to meet the Minister for Mines from Western Australia, the Leader of the Opposition from Western Australia and the President of the Chamber of Mines of Western Australia on the 21st of this month in Canberra to hear their views and listen to their case for an increase in the gold subsidy? If so, why is the second reading debate on the Bill being continued today rather than left until after that meeting? Does it mean that the gentlemen referred to are wasting their time and money coming here to see the Prime Minister? Does it mean that nothing they can say or prove will change the Government's attitude to the gold mining industry?",22
50,Mr GORTON,GOLD MINING,"It is true that I am seeing the deputation comprising the persons mentioned by the honourable member on the question of gold mining. These gentlemen know the decision which the Government has taken and which the Government is now proposing to pass into law. However, they wish to put facts before the Government which they think may cause some later amendments no doubt of what we do. I think it would be unusual for me to say that 1 refuse to see them at all to allow them to do that. That, I suggest, is the answer to the question. NA",22
51,Dr MACKAY,NATIONAL SERVICE,"My question to the Minister for Labour and National Service relates to the laws governing national service. Has there been a change in the legal position, expounded by experts from the days of Dicey to the most recent book by Professor Geoffrey Sawer, that we have 2 kinds of laws-enacte d laws and nonenacted laws? Is the Leader of the Opposition justified in limiting his description of legal measures relative to national service to enacted or statutory law?",22

53,Mr UREN,COMMONWEALTH LAND,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. He is aware that the Commonwealth, particularly the Department of Defence, retains large quantities of land on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour. He would be aware that the New South Wales Government and a broad section of our community are seeking the restoration of the natural environment of the areas of North, South and Middle Heads and Georges Heights. Will he consider transferring progressively to the State these Commonwealth areas so that they can be restored to parklands and so that all Australians may enjoy the beauty of one of nature's wonderlands?",22
54,Mr GORTON,COMMONWEALTH LAND,"The honourable member is quite right when he states that I know that the Commonwealth Government through its Defence Department, or its Service departments, has title lo a great deal of land around Sydney Harbour. I also know that the Commonwealth has stretched every nerve to endeavour to return to the State Government those areas which it can return without affecting the defence efforts which it needs to make. I also know that 1I have been and am in communication with the New Soulh Wales Premier in correspondence which has not yet been completed on this whole matter. NA",22
55,Mr TURNBULL,PRIMARY PRODUCERS RALLY,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade and Industry. Press reports state that organisers of the primary producers rally at Canberra yesterday claim that the poor attendance was due to Country Party influence. As the organisers, including one Labor member of this House, have said previously that the Country Party has ceased to be a power in the community, and as these opinions are contradictory, can the Minister clarify the position?",22
56,Mr MCEWEN,PRIMARY PRODUCERS RALLY,"The planned demonstration outside Parliament yesterday which was, 1 think, organised centrally by the honourable member for Riverina and others associated with him, was to those who observed it, as I did, and to those who read the reports in the newspaper, a complete frost. It was a frost, of course, because of the Country Party-no t because the Country Party took any steps to persuade people not to come but because the policies on which the Country Party, in conjunction with our colleagues of the Liberal Party, has operated in respect of wool, wheat, dairying, the search for markets overseas and concessions and assistance to primary producers obviously produced such a consciousness in the minds of primary producers that their well-being was safe in the hands of the Country Party and our Liberal colleagues that they stayed away in their thousands. NA",22
57,Dr JF CAIRNS,TARIFFS,Does the Minister for Trade and Industry recall that he recently said: ' I would regard it as ridiculous to decide that an industry was not economic and efficient because some competition had come in from a deplorably low wage country like South Korea or Taiwan'? I remind him also of a statement by the Chairman of the Tariff Board recently to manufacturers that he did not agree that the Board's policy ought to be to allow higher tariffs for industries which need them to survive against low wage Asian competition. If this is an accurate recollection of what was said by both himself,23
58,Mr SPEAKER,TARIFFS,Order ! 1 suggest thut the honourable member ask his question.,23
59,Dr JF CAIRNS,TARIFFS,"If this is an accurate recollection of what was said both by self and the Chairman of the Board, can explanation. the Minister reconcile these 2 statements, and can he say whether industries that need tariffs or other protection of over per cent to survive against low wage competition will be granted them?",23
60,Mr MCEWEN,TARIFFS,"The record of the GovLabour ernment shows that there has been a very adequate protection of Australian industry during its period of office, for 14 years which I have been the responsible Minising ter. There can be no evidence more incapParliament able of contradiction than the sheer growth of Australian industry over that period and the base of investment and employment that has been provided over that period. That reflects the policy of the to note Government and it is a policy which the Government having pursued in the past will pursue in the future. It is not for me to try to reconcile a statement of mine with whatever the Chairman of the Tariff Board might have been reported as having said, but I have no trouble in again stating that, if an Australian industry has been assessed as economic and efficient by the Tariff Board and by the Government and has been accorded an appropriate protective duty, it would seem to me to be completely ridiculous that one could discover it to be inefficient the next day, not because there had been any alteration whatever to the industry itself but because imports were offered lo us from some low cost country. Such imports could be from utterly a country where wages are tow or a centrally controlled economy country - a Communist country-wher e there is no basis of assessing costs of production but where it is not uncommon for goods to be offered for sale for no other reason than to earn foreign exchange. Australian industry is entitled to be protected if it is efficient in our own environment. If it is efficient in our own environment it is entitled to be protected in the future as it has been in the past and I have no doubt it will enjoy that protection. NA",23

77,Mr CHIPP,PROVISION OF ENGINEERING," I move: That in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the. following proposed work which was referred to.the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Provision of engineering services, district of Dripstone, Darwin, Northern Territory. The proposal involves construction of sealed roads, kerbs and gutters, footpaths, water supply, sewerage and. stormwater drainage, and electricity supply to residential and special sites in the neighbourhood units of Nakara, Wanguri, Brinkin and Tiwi. The estimated cost is $ 10.76m. One component of the proposal is the construction of a bridge across Rapid Creek to serve as a link in the projected arterial road system. The Committee received evidence that damming of the creek at the bridge site had been studied in connection with a proposal to clean out the swamp along Rapid Creek and create a lake/ water feature. If the lake scheme is to proceed, construction of a combined weir and road bridge would be a practical and economic proposition. The Government intends to consider this proposal in depth before proceeding with a firm bridge design but with due regard to the importance of providing a road link at this location in accordance with arterial road and traffic requirements. Upon the concurrence of the House in this resolution, detailed planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations Conimittee.",25
78,Mr CALDER,PROVISION OF ENGINEERING," Once again I express pleasure in the proposed work. Government's confidence in the Northern Territory and its awareness of the expanding city of Darwin. There has been and there will continue to be a shortage of land for housing in Darwin while that city expands at the rate that it has in' recent years. But the Government is showing a very alive awareness of this problem and has approved the expenditure of $10.76m the Dripstone district of Darwin. I gather that a further 800 blocks will be available for government houses or for private sale as the result of the introduction of these services. Therefore, these services will help to overcome the housing shortage in Darwin. I welcome the attention that the Public Works Committee has given to the Rapid Creek swamp area. If a beautification scheme is carried out this area will become a most attractive setting. However, I trust that the investigation in depth will not delay the overall work. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA SUPPLY STATION, ALICE SPRINGS Reference to Public Works Committee",25
79,Mr CHIPP,CONSTRUCTION OF ELECTRICITY," I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Cominittee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Cominittee on Public Works for investigation and report: Construction of an electricity supply power station, Alice Springs, N.T. The proposal involves construction of a newpower station to replace the existing station and to meet, increasing demands for power supplies in Alice Springs. The new station will contain 2 new diesel generating sets, the 2 largest sets from the existing station and 2 spare bays for future sets. Associated works will include engine cooling towers, switchgear and transformers, roadworks, oil supply line and storage, and a crane. The building will be evaporatively cooled and the control room will be fully air-conditioned. The remaining generating equipment in the existing station will continue in operation to supplement output from the new station of the and will be progressively phased out of operation. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $2.5m. I table plans showing the location and tentative layout of the",25
80,Mr CALDER,CONSTRUCTION OF ELECTRICITY," Once again I commend the Government on the work that it is carrying out in the Northern Territory. On this occasion the Government is considering the construction of an electricity supply power station at Alice Springs, which is a rapidly developing in area and which is my home town. I note that the proposed new station will contain 2 new diesel generators and tha! the building will be air cooled while the control room will be fully air-conditioned. I think that this is wise planning because temperatures in Alice Springs have already risen above the century mark although we are still in October. I am certain that when the Department of Works is granted approval to commence this work at Alice Springs it will do a good - job and hasten the electricity supply which is so needed in this developing town.

81,Mr BURY,ASIAN DEVELOPMEN T BANK," I move: Thai the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to obtain parliamentary approval for a contribution by Australia of the equivalent of $US10m to the special funds of the Asian Development Bank. As honourable members will be aware, Australia is a foundation member of the Asian Development Bank which opened for business in Manila in December 1966. Membership of the Bank now totals 35 countries, 21 of which (including Australia) are in the Asian region and 14 outside it. Total capital subscriptions to the Bank at the present time amount to $US1,004m, only half of which is, however, payable. The balance will remain at call as security for any borrowings by the Bank on international capital markets to supplement its subscribed capital. As indicated in the following table which, with the concurrence of honourable members, I incorporate in Hansard. Australia's subscription of $US85m to the capital stock of the Bank is exceeded only by those of the United States, Japan and India. NA NA Regional MembersAfghanistan .. .. Australia .. .. ..

The Asian Development Bank is empowered under its Articles of Agreement to conduct both 'ordinary operations' and 'special operations'. In the case of 'ordinary operations' the Bank lends on commercial terms-the standard lending rate by the Bank at the present time is 7 i per cent per annum, with repayments spread over 10 to 25 years including grace periods ranging from 2 to 5 years, depending on the nature of the project involved. The Bank has to finance such loans either by drawing on paid-in capital subscriptions or by using funds raised for this purpose by selling bonds on the capital markets of the (SUS'OOO) world. 4,780 To date, the Bank has successfully 85,000 floated 2 such bond issues. In 1969 it 3,500 raised a loan equivalent to $US16m in the 8,520 Federal Republic of Germany and in April 1,000 1970 it borrowed the equivalent of $US5m 8,000 in Austria. Efforts are being made to float bond issues in other capital markets in order to establish the Bank's standing in the international nnancial community and enable it to borrow funds to finance its normal lending activities in much the same way as the World Bank now does. In the case of 'special operations' the Bank lends on concessional terms and can finance such loans in part from its paid-in capital (10 per cent of which can be set aside specifically for this purpose) but more importantly by drawing on resources contributed to special funds by its member countries. The terms of the loans financed from special funds to date have involved rates of interest ranging from l i per cent to 3 per cent per annum with periods of repayment extending from 16 to 40 years including grace periods of from 4 to 10 years. I would emphasise that special funds are employed only to finance high priority development projects which meet the same technical standards and satisfy the same economic criteria as projectsfinancedfrom the Bank's other resources. In a sense, special funds are to the Asian Development Bank what the International Development Association is to the World Bank group of institutions, namely, a means by which assistance can be provided on more liberal terms than apply to normal loans by the respective banks. By a skilful blending of 'ordinary operations' and 'special operations' the Asian Development Bank is able to reduce the average costs of its overall lending to developing member countries to more manageable levels. To date the Bank has approved loans to a total value of SUS 184m, of which $US35m will be financed from special funds on concessional terms. To assist the Bank in meeting the growing demands on its own limited special funds resources, Canada, Denmark, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States have all made or offered to make voluntary contributions to the Agricultural Special Fund and/or the Multi-Purpose Special Fund. In addition, each of these countries, along with Finland. Germany, India and New Zealand has contributed to the Technical Assistance Special Fund. Details are set out in the following table, which with the concurrence of honourable members. I also incorporate in Hansard.

No amount was mentioned. (b) Apart from its contributions to the Technical Assistance Special Fund, Japan has offered to contribute a total or SUSlOOm to other special tunds, or which $US40m has already been contributed. The Japanese Budget Tor the year ended 31 March 1971 provides for a further contribution or SUS30m. (c) The Netherlands has indicated that further contributions will be forthcoming and has also offered to contribute the equivalent or roughly SUS5m to a special account to be set up within the Multipurpose Special Fund to help finance projects undertaken in West Irian. (d) President Nixon asked Congress in February 1970 to authoriso a United States contribution of SUStOOm to special funds, to be spread over 3 years. In recognition of the important role which the Asian Development Bank has to play in promoting economic development in the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East-ECAFE-region , and the great need of many of its developing member countries for external assistance on concessional terms so as not to exacerbate their growing external debt servicing problems, the Government decided earlier this year that subject to the approval of Parliament, Australia should contribute the equivalent of $US10m (about $A8.9m) to special funds over this and the next 2 financial years. I made an announcement to this effect at the third annual meeting of the Board of Governors of the Bank in Seoul last April. Of this amount, it is intended that $US9,750,000 will be allocated to the Multi-Purpose Special Fund and be paid in 3 equal annual instalments commencing in 1970-71, while the balance of $US250,000 will be allocated to the Technical Assistance Special Fund. No restrictions will be placed on the rate at which the latter sum may be used by the Bank. Except as otherwise agreed by the Government of Australia, the proposed contribution to the Multi-Purpose Special Fund will be tied to the procurement of goods produced in, or services supplied from, Australia. Likewise, the contribution to the Technical Assistance Special Fund may be used only to pay for the services of Australian consultants and experts hired by the Bank in connection with its technical assistance activities. No restrictions will be placed on the developing member countries of the Bank in which these contributions may be used, although the Bank will be asked to pay special regard to the needs of less developed countries in South East Asia and the Pacific region which are of special interest to Australia. This Bill provides us with a tangible opportunity to confirm Australia's continued strong support for the activities of the Asian Development Bank. The additional funds to be authorised by this Bill will not only add to the Bank's resources and permit a desirable expansion of its lending activities, they will increase the Bank's versatility and enable it to tailor the terms of its overall lending to the requirements and borrowing capacities of its developing member countries. There is no need for me to enlarge here on the great importance to Australia of the Bank succeeding in its efforts to help developing countries in Asia to achieve faster rates of economic growth, and so help to raise living standards throughout the ECAFE region. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Mr Crean-Before I move the adjournthe ment of the debate, may I ask the Treastransitional urer whether he will make available latest annual report of the Asian DevelopCommonweealth ment Bank?",26
82,Mr BURY,CONTRIBUTIONS TO SPECIAL FUNDS,"I will endeavour to do so. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA (ADMINISTRATION) BILL 1970 Bill presented by Mr Bury, and read first time. Second Reading i Mr BURY (Wentworth - Treasurer) (3.51)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill, and of the 5 Bills I shall subsequently introduce, is to enable the States to receive, in respect of business receipts during the period 18th November 1969 to 30th September 1970, the amounts of duty they would have received had their own receipts duty laws been wholly valid. Business receipts during that period will be liable to duty under the Commonwealth legislation at the rate of 1 per cent, but this liability will not arise if the provisions of State laws-whethe r valid or invalidare complied with. This means that receipts exempted or not dutiable under the provisions of state legislation will remain free of all receipts duties. It also means that receipts in Queensland will remain liable to duty at the rate of .02 per cent provided for under Queensland legislation-provide d Queensland duty is in fact paid on the receipts or has already been paid. Honourable members will observe that some changes have been made to the legislation since it was introduced during the last sittings and subsequently not passed by the Senate. Under clause 24(1.) of the Stales Receipts Duties (Administration) Bill, provision is made to limit the duty to moneys received before a date to be fixed by proclamation. The Government undertakes that this proclaimed date will be Ist October 1970. The decision so to limit the scope of the legislation is based on legal considerations of a constitutional nature. The same Bill also now specifies 30th September 1970 as the terminating date for period-describe d in the bill as 'the period'-durin g which receipts the are to be exempt from liability under law if the provisions of State laws, whether valid or invalid, are complied with. It will also be noted that there is now a separate Bill-the States Receipts Duties (Exemption) Bill-to provide for exemption from duty under Commonwealth law for receipts during the transitional period where State duty was paid or was not payable. This provision was included as clause 88 in the previous a States Receipts Duties (Administration) Bill. Honourable members who wish to have more detailed explanations of the changes being made by the revised legislation can refer to the explanatory memorandum which is being circulated. Honourable members will be aware of the reasons why it is proposed that the legislation is to cease to have application to transactions after 30th September. They will also be aware that, after a special meeting with Premiers in Canberra on 8th October, the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) announced that, at the request of the Premiers, the Commonwealth Government agreed to the State governments dropping the receipts duty completely, even in areas where it would be legal for them to impose it. This means that liability for receipts duty under either Commonwealth or State legislation will not apply to any transactions after 30th September 1970. The Government has agreed that the whole of the resultant loss of revenue to State Budgets in 1970-71 should be made good through the provision of additional Commonwealth grants to the States. The Government has also agreed that, in respect of 1971-72 and the 3 subsequent years, the amount of receipts duty which it is estimated would have been collected by the States in the ordinary course in 1970-71 should be added to the base to be used in determining the financial assistance grants payable under the grants formula in those years. These arrangements, which the Government regards as constituting eminently fair and. indeed, generous treatment for the States, were made subject to the proviso on the part of the Commonwealth that they depended on rhe conditions governing the offers of the Commonwealth made at the June Premiers' Conference. Legislation to give effect, to the arrangements will be introduced in due course. I commend the legislation to honourable members.

84,Mr GARLAND,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Con cluding my remarks on the amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act in relation to convertible notes I wish to take up the points put forward by the spokesman for the Australian Labor Party, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean). Yesterday I had reached the stage of stating that I believe the opposition to the is based on false premises. The basis of the opposition stated by the honourable member can be, in his own words, stated thus, that he believes that the provisions of the Bill will be bad rather than good. I would respectfully suggest that that is an unsupported assertion. It was not backed up by any detail or evidence in his speech. At one stage he sounded satisfied when he said that he was glad that certain officers of the Public Service had obtained tough criteria or tough provisions for this Bill. I draw the honourable member's attention again to the objectives as set out in the second reading speech in which it was clearly pointed out that the Bill will allow some genuine cases of loans to be raised which will enable cheaper money to be obtained and will make the issues sufficiently attractive to enable more Australian participation than otherwise would have been the case in those undertakings where a period of 7 to 10 years of development is required. At the same time it will give a real choice to note holders with options to equity in those undertakings in due course. On the basis of what we have heard so far, the opposition to the Bill is for opposition's sake. I see that there are more Labor members who are to speak and I will be interested to hear whether they can be more specific.",29

I listened to his speech last night with a great deal of interest to see whether he could take up what had gone by default in the second reading speech of the Treasurer (Mr Bury), namely, arguments in favour of supporting the Bill. I hope I am being reasonably charitable to the honourable member when I say that he did a very workmanlike job in repeating the Treasurer's second reading speech and outlining the Bill without telling us why the Bill is before the House. In his concluding remarks he has attempted to throw the Bill onus back onto this side of the House to prove why we are opposing the Bill. My argument is that the onus is on the Government to tell us what are the pressures that are forcing it to bring this Bill before the House. I will first of all attempt to explain what are convertible notes, to make sure we are talking on the same subject. As far as I am concerned, they are a hybrid- a combination-of unsecured notes on the one hand and equity capital on the other hand. What is achieved by this capital instrument can be achieved by unsecured notes and equity capital issued separately in the market. This capital market instrument, 1 concede, is available elsewhere in the world in developed money markets, but certainly not, as I understand it, in the form that the Government is proposing in this amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Act. The other point that I would like to make about convertible notes is that there is nothing to stop them being issued in this country at the present time. All that we are debating at the moment is whether the interest which is payable by the companies to the holders of these convertible notes should be a taxation deduction before primary tax is applied to the taxable income of companies. So there is nothing prohibiting convertible notes being issued. The question is whether the Governmeut should encourage the issue of convertible notes by allowing taxation deductions for the interest paid to the holders of them. I want to elaborate on the points made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), the shadow Treasurer, last night and explain that there are 3 main reasons why the Opposition is opposing the Bill at the present time. The first is because we think there ought to be better arguments proposed by the Government in support of this Bill than we have been able to hear from the Government or find out from Government supporters and other people knowledgeable in this sphere. We think there ought to be better arguments put forward before we allow the erosion of the tax base, which erosion will take place if the interest payable on convertible notes is an allowable deduction. I repeat that the case has gone so far by default. I have pointed to the speech of the Treasurer. I have pointed to the speech of the honourable member for Curtin. I invite anybody to look at those speeches and tell us who is going to use these convertible notes. It is my knowledge of the capital market that certainly the large companies in this country will not want to use them. When I turn to appropriate literature- I refer to such magazines as 'Taxation in Australia', the monthly magazine of the Taxation Institute of Australia, and the nnancial Press- I find that there is some speculation. Perhaps the medium sized or smaller companies in our community will want to use these convertible notes, but nowhere that I have been able to see has anybody written that convertible notes in the form being put forward by the Government at the present time will be used by theni. Let me refer to the article in 'Taxation in Australia' by Mr Sam Denton, a chartered accountant of my own State, or to an article which I think appeared in the Australian Financial Review, a year ago when the possibility of this Bill was first intimated. The article arose from a speech made to the Institute of Directors by another person known to rae, Mr Michael Gleeson White of the firm of Ord, Minnett, which is a firm of stockbrokers and which is also in a reasonably large way in the underwriting field. In every case where we have been able to find the written word on this subject of convertible notes nobody has justified the limitations imposed on them by the Government. This is not to criticise those limitations in any way because I believe they are necessary in order to avoid the sort of excesses that took place prior to November 1960 when the then Treasurer, the late Mr Harold Holt, brought in a Bill altering once again the Income Tax Assessment Act, this time prohibiting interest on convertible notes as a deduction. I believe that in trying to find the reasons for this Bill the answer perhaps lies in it being the thin edge of the wedge, although it would not be used by many people now. But at least it has brought these sections back into the Income Tax Asssessment Act where they can easily be amended later so that they will be more acceptable to members of the community who want to use convertible notes. But the onus is on the Government to prove that in the form in which they appear in this Bill they are of great use to our community in encouraging investment and for the other purposes which have been mentioned in a very vague sort of way. The second reason why the Opposition opposes this Bill is the effect it has on interest rates. 1 hardly need outline the hardships being caused in the community at the present time by the high rate of interest which we are suffering. We havi only to look at the interest rate on mortgage loans to understand this. We have only to see how savings banks are forced to reduce the amount of home mortgage loans to applicants because of the present monetary policies, and how building societies are experiencing difficulties, to know that the monetary policies of this Government are creating great hardships in the community. 1 submit that in encouraging a new form of investment and a greater demand for savings in the community which are in short supply the Bill will merely increase interest rates ancl the demand for money and thus the cost of money. I think this is another worthwhile reason to put forward for the reticence of the Opposition to support this Bill at the present time. I would like to draw to the attention of the House the words of the late Mr Harold Holt in his second reading speech on the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Bill (No. 3) 1960 when interest was removed from the list of allowable deductions for taxation purposes. He said: In my statement. I outlined why the Government had decided upon these measures. That is, removing interest rates on convertible notes from the list of allowable deductions. He continued: I pointed out how the bidding of higher and higher rates of interest for borrowed money had been working to the disadvantage of governments and other public authorities and, through them, to the disadvantage of the general taxpayer. This was because the less governments could borrow on reasonable terms the more they had to obtain in taxation tofinancebasic developmental works and the provision of community services. I also went on to say that the bidding-up of interest rates imposed a burden on productive enterprises and added to costs generally. Industry, in general, seeks to raisefinanceas Cheaply as it can, especially when it wants the money for long term investment and when it has to engage ih strenuous competition to sell its products either on local markets or overseas. I will not quote any more of the words of the late Mr Harold Holt other than when he said, after developing this argument: This unrestrained competition for capital good for the economy . . . I suggest that a measure such as this-un supported, I will admit, by evidence of where it is required-ca n have no result other than to encourage investment and add to the demand for investment capital and so increase its cost. I list this as another reason why the measure should be treated with a great deal of reticence. The third reason for opposing this Bill lies in the very wording of the Bill. There are 13 pages of extremely complicated provisions in order to arrive at the result that we have today. The explanatory memorandum goes to over 24 pages. I use this opportunity to object to the making of what is already a stupidly complicated Act into a ridiculous Act. which engages the activities of too many intelligent people for too great a length of time. This Bill merely makes this position worse by these provisions. This is not to criticise those who had to draft this Bill. I know how difficult it is to include these measures in the Act without leaving any loopholes. But I list it as another reason why I am opposing the Bill at this time. I will use this and any other occasion given to me to say that it is high time that we looked at this Act as a whole. It has about SOO sections. It covers about 425 reasonably sized pages. It has become an absurd Act to master-a n Act which is doing nothing but retard productivity in the community in as much as so many intelligent people are involved in finding all sorts of ways through and around it. I do not want to do anything to add to this occupation. But I want to be constructive at the same time. It is high time we in Australia had a royal commission into this field of taxation. Canada has recently had a royal commission-the Carter Commission. It is not a panacaea, I agree, but it at least brings together many people who are knowledgeable and interested in this complicated sphere to examine the whole field of taxation rather than the ad hoc way the Act is being examined at this present time. I believe the report of such a commission should at least set the sights on where we should be heading in the field of taxation over 5 or even 10 years. At the same time. I advocate that we should have an Australian taxation foundation such as already exists in Canada, a body of people outside is not our Taxation Branch who are knowledgeable in thisfield-lawyers, accountants and people in business-and who are interested in this field which is vital to the welfare of our nation and vital to our level of economic activity. At the moment the only research being undertaken is either within the Taxation Branch or on an ad hoc basis at an odd faculty of economics or commerce in various universities throughout Australia. The taxation foundation would be a continuing body. The Government should belp to finance it just as the Canadian Government helps to finance the Canadian taxation foundation. We have the nucleus at the moment for such a body in the form of the Taxation Institute of Australia, of which I am a member on the South Australian Council. This is a body of lawyers and accountants who are interested in this field and who are using their spare time to do what they can to improve their knowledge of this Act and its application. We also have, of course, the Law Society of Australia, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Society of Accountants, ff these organisations were correctly stimulated by the Government I believe that they would take part in an Australian taxation foundation. However, this would not be a substitute for the work of a Royal Commission which would set the sights and show us where we were going in this field. Such a foundation would provide the knowledge which would stimulate what is taking place in this field within the Taxation Department and it would guard from day to day, month to month and year to year the interests of the taxpayers. There are plenty of precedents for a proposal such as the one I have suggested. I draw the attention of the House to the Institute of Economic and Social Welfare which has been set up in the United Kingdom and subsidised by that Government. That Institute is financed in part by commerce and industry. It houses a number of economists, social scientists and political scientists who are working on a lot of the subjects that are being dealt with within the British Treasury, the British Department of Health and the Department of Social Services. In effect that Institute is an alternative body of knowledge and thought to that which obtains within the Government. In the short time that is left to me in this debate I want to repeat the 3 reasons why the Opposition opposes this Bill at this time. Firstly, the onus is on the Government to prove who wants these convertible notes. We have not heard anything about this so far. We on this side believe that this is the thin end of the wedge. Secondly, there is the effect of interest rates on the community. Thirdly, difficulties are being created in what is already an absurd Act. Finally, I would like to take up a point made by the honourable member for Curtin when he facetiously said that at least the Opposition is not on this occasion referring the matter to a committee. My reply to him is: What a pity that it is not. I believe that there is not one member of this House with any deep knowledge of the underwriting field. What a pity it is that those few people who are interested in this subject are not able to sit around a committee table to inquire into this Bill. The Bill could be referred to a select committee which could confer with people like Mr Denton and Mr Gleeson White whom I mentioned, perhaps with the Managing Director of Australian United Corporation and with others who know underwriting or who take an academic interest in it. We may be able to learn more and to justify what is before us at present. We do not have such a system at present but I believe that we should have it. I hope that even honourable members on the Government side would believe that if we could debate a Bill such as this one with more expert knowledge on the subject it would add to the status of this House.",30
87,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL," I was very interested in the 3 reasons put forward by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) as the bases for opposing this Bill. I suggest that there is an additional reason which ought to be included and that is the one which was enunciated quite clearly last night by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean). He referred to the doubt concerning the flexibility relating to overseas lenders with respect to convertible notes. I also have misgivings about this Bill, especially concerning the prospective overseas lenders, but for very different reasons from those put forward by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. Before I deal with that I would like to refer to one or two of the reasons enunciated by the honourable member for Adelaide. The honourable member was concerned that this measure is a complex financial one and this being so it adds significantly to the list of legislation which involves areas of this type-taxatio n legislation of various kinds. I suggest that complexity alone is never a suflicient reason for opposing a measure and that it can on occasions be a reason for trying to understand what is involved in the measure and then to produce whatever reasons are appropriate for supporting or opposing the measure. The second reason he gave for opposing this Bill was that adequate reasons have not been given for the introduction once again of convertible notes in this country. Convertible notes with the taxation advantages appropriate to them operated, as we know, quite significantly during the late 1950s. They went out during the early 1960s. The reason that they went out. as was clearly enunciated by a former Treasurer, was that they were not providing a useful accretion to the productive capital of the country but that they were being used for taxation measures, for deferred share issues and for the advantages that went with such arrangements. This measure represents an attempt to find the extent to which the reasons for the misuse during the 1950s apply today and if there are any cases in which investment in productive enterprise would occur with thi.s type of measure which would not otherwise occur then this measure can be of some use. The attempt to eliminate the abuses which occurred more than 10 years ago is made clear in the conditions which are being utilised to fence around the convertible note issue involved in this Bill. The third point offered in opposition to this Bill concerns interest rates. My understanding may not be correct but I do not understand that convertible note issues, either in Australia or overseas, will of themselves cause interest rates to be higher than they would otherwise be. For example, if there is any advantage in issuing convertible notes overseas it may be that the interest rates offered to lenders can be at a rather lower level than they would be with fixed interest loans because there are certain other advantages to be had. Consequently I find it difficult to accept that internationalisatton of interest rates on that basis will cause the rates to be higher in Australia than they otherwise would be if the notes were not to be issued. I find the 3 reasons enunciated by the honourable member for Adelaide unattractive. I will later refer to that part of the legislation which deals with foreign investors. It is 10 years since this type of legislation was before the House. The reasons for discontinuing the practice were made perfectly clear by a former Treasurer when he said in his second reading speech on 6th December 1960: There has recently been a strong trend for companies to issue convertible notes in lieu of shares, and by this means they have been obtaining a deduction for interest paid on the notes . . . The notes have in substance more in common with the permanent capital of the company than they have with either short term or long term borrowings. He went on to say: But from the evidence there was a strong presumption that there was a misuse of the intensuspect, tions for which convertible notes were deemed to operate. When one examines the raisings of new money for companies during that period and the rate of increase in the utilisation of convertible notes from 1954 to 1961 the misuse of them is clear. During that period there was a very marked increase in the volume of fund raising by listed and unlisted companies, both in the absolute and relative terms. The peak period for fund raising for notes, debentures and so on occurred in 1960. In that year nearly 60 per cent of new funds were raised in this form. This compares with a little over 20 per cent 5 years previously. It is interesting to note, from an examination of the figures, that after the November measures of that year this form of fund raising was almost completely eliminated. If one goes through the financial bulletins of that period from which these details can be elucidated, it is clear that from 1954-55 there was an escalation in this type of borrowing. In 1954-55 SI.8m of the new capital raised through the issuing of debentures, registered notes or from accepting deposits was from this source. In the next year it was $4m and in the following year $5m. In 1958-59 and in 1959-60 the amount of convertible notes utilised to raise capital in this way rose to $19m and $48m respectively, and at that period they were discontinued. Immediately there was a sharp and precipitate decline in the use of this form of raising and by 1961-62 it was down to $7m. So there was a strong presumption that once the advantages were taken away from this type of activity it was found to be significantly less attractive for those people who wanted to invest. This Bill represents the attempt to discover what proportion of those moneys was not being used merely for deferred share issues or in order to escape the revenue of the Commonwealth with the advantage of convertible notes, and if $5m or SlOm is available through this means which would not otherwise be available this measure can be useful and should be passed. If one looks at the results of this measure in 3, 4 or 5 years time one can then make an assessment, but to oppose the Bill and to reject it out of hand as it has been rejected by the Opposition is, I a little irresponsible. After all, in this measure, as the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) has indicated, there are conditions, which have not previously applied, which fence around these issues. The Prime Minister made it perfectly clear last year-and at that time there was no opposition-that convertible notes would operate in this country. He indicated that the conditions for their operation were to be 5 and, as he stated in this House on 16th September 1969 the conditions were these: First, the lender or noteholder, and not the issuing company, has the option to convert. That is the most important new provision. Previously all the initiative tended to remain with the company. Secondly, the noteholder's right to exercise the option is not deferred longer than 24 months after the date of issue of the security. In other words there is a no option for a period of 24 months. Thirdly, the convertible note is to have a currency of not less than 7 nor more than 10 years but the company may make the terminal date for the exercise of the option as much as, but not more than, 12 months earlier than the maturity date of the note. That will be up to 9 years after the issue of the note. Fourthly, the terms and conditions of the issue are fixed and not subject to any variation throughout the period of their currency. Fifthly, there are certain provisions concerning the conversion price of the notes. With respect to foreign investors, and I touch now upon the reason for which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports finds opposition, foreign investors vary in a couple of ways. There is a flexibility as to interest rates which does not apply with respect to notes issued on the domestic market. The time limits of between 7 and 10 years do not operate in as stringent a manner. They are the 2 principal aspects of difference concerning foreign investors. On those bases alone it is not sufficient to say that they ought to be refused with respect to foreign lenders. But I suggest there is another reason for which I doubt their applicability to foreign lenders, and it involves the specific mention in the second reading speech of the Australian Industries Development Corporation. I would.suggest that through the issues of these convertible notes overseas to foreign investors, and especially through the part of the indus' tries Development Corporation in its issue-and that can occur-ther e is going to be allowed to be a greater overseas equity in Australian industry than would otherwise occur. This is the principal reason for which 1I have some doubts. It is perfectly clear when one looks the measure that the AIDC can hold notes, it can hold shares and it can issue convertin ible notes on an overseas market. It might be argued that it can do this because may be able to obtain loans at lower interest rates than without convertible notes. have no argument with that but these notes issued on an overseas market can, at a tain date, become convertible. We have remember at the same time that the is not prevented in any way from holding up to 15 per cent or a greater equity holding in Australian industry-a n equity holding which can give it effective control. That provision was specifically not accepted by this House when the AIDC be legislation was submitted to it. So we see that the Australian Industries Development Corporation through its operation in convertible note market overseas and through its holding of equity in Australian industries lays itself open to the suggestion that there can be a greater overseas equity holding in Australian industry than would occur otherwise. This applies especially in another way. It has to be remembered, for example, that the Industries Development Corporation is not a lender of last resort. Companies that want to operate through the AIDC do not have to demonstrate that there are not fixed interest loans available overseas at equal or even lower interest rates, so it has an incredible amount of initiative in this field and, through its operation in the convertible note market, I do not particularly like the legislation that is before the House. I intend to vote for it because we will have to see how it operates, but as long as it is not prevented from holding the amount of equity that it can hold we lay ourselves open in a way in which I do not think we should. Other speakers have gone through the provisions of the Bill and have dealt in detail with it. I do not want to go through the details as have been enunciated by other speakers, but one can ask oneself a further question. If, as it suggested, this can enable overseas investors to have a greater share in Australian industry than they would otherwise have, what is the experience overseas? What about overseas companies that have issued convertible notes? Have they, in fact, enabled there to be greater, say, American investment in those companies than otherwise would at apply? For a couple of reasons, they have not. The period of operation of these notes overseas markets has been far greater10 to 25 years. The interest rates have it varied rather more than has been the case in Australia, and most lenders vvould not I have exercised their option because the market price in the host country of many cerof the shares has not risen sufficiently or to has not fluctuated in a way which would AIDC enable that market price to be taken advantage of or to be appreciated. However one will have to see how this operates in the future to examine whether the danger involved in the legislation will realised. If it is ralised it will not be to the advantage of this country. If it is not realised then we will have gained more out the of the convertible notes than we would have gained otherwise. It epitomises the basic balance that has to be examined in measures of this type. On the one hand we have an opportunity to preserve Australian equity. On the other hand we do not want (he revenue to be robbed in respect of the convertible note issues. This is a balance that has to be examined and preserved. It is a balance on which judgment can come down on one side or the other, but I suggest that this aspect of the legislation should be looked at. The operations of the AIDC, which operates not at market rates but at beneficial rates compared With other operators in the field, will have to be examined very closely. But I suggest that the Bill ought to be passed because it can be benencial to this country. If we are able to discover those genuine operators in convertible notes in the late 1950s and early 1960s and can entice them into the field of capital investment now-the y would not be enticed if it were not for this Bill-the suggest it will be worthwhile to pass this Bill. 1 suggest that it should be examined in this way.",33
88,Mr CONNOR,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL," 1 thought from the initial and interim remarks of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) that he might have even been joining us. Of course, there is an old scriptural saying that there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who does penance than over 99 just persons who need no repentance. Fortunately he gave himself the necessary escape hatch out of his dilemma. I might say that there are many escape hatches in this legislation. In fact, that might have been its middle name because it is intended both to ge! money out and, in certain cases, to get money in. The Government at this stage can feel somewhat benevolent in the light of the proposals in the Budget when it will have a little surplus, which has remained undisclosed, of a matter of $550m that will go into the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve for the purpose of the redemption of some of its bonds. Therefore there is room for a little largesse to be spread amongst its supporters, open and covert. Perhaps the best test we can apply to this legislation are the words of the Treasurer f Mr Bury) in introducing the measure. He characterised the situation prior to I960 when the celebrated amendments were made to the Income Tax Asses""m<*nt Act. The Treasurer thought that as the matter then stood the then legislation permitted the giving to a deferred issue the semblance and the guise of fixed interest borrowing. The legislation in its present form is somewhat in the nature of a Trojan horse. Jt is a good way of getting in and, on the converse, it is a good way of capturing. A person who chooses to invest in convertible notes under the Government's proposal is due to get the best of both worlds. Let us briefly examine the content of the legislation and what it stands for. Firstly, it reverses and repeals the 1961 legislation, which refused, for the assessment of income tax, deduction of interest paid on convertible notes. Now that same interest is to be payable under certain conditions. After the royal assent is given to this measure, where a loan is to mature in a minimum of 7 years-of course there is a n 1 very subtle, or perhaps I should even say crude, reservation in the case of foreign investors-the conversion is to be at the option of the note holders. That is to be welcomed. The option is to be exercisable after a period of 24 months from when the loan was made and before the final 12 months of the loan. In addition it is not to be exercisable in respect of a period beyond 10 years. Finally-and this is a most important aspect-let us look at the price that is to be paid for the shares by the lucky people, the friends of those inside, who choose to convert. The price will be either the par value of the share or 90 per cent of the equivalent share value at the time when the notes were offered for subscription, whichever is the greater. They are very lucky people indeed. Thay have the be ->t ol both worlds. The shrewd people can lend money on security, and in turn they know that if the venture is a good one-and they have every reason to believe it will be-the y can come in, not as the ordinary investor who buys his shares on the stock exchange at the current market price, but, in the good Australian phrase, on the grouter. The price they are to pay is the price which operated at the time when the notes were first offered for subscription. It is somewhat like the SDider who, as is well known, chooses to sting and paralyse its prey, to leave it alive and to consume it later at its convenience. The rates of interest and other terms of the loan and the option are not to varv from time to time, acain with the little proviso that in respect of foreign loans there may be variations of interest in accordance with international interest markets, and the longer the period of the loan the less favourable the terms. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) last night made reference to the peculiar nature of convertible notes. They are legal and nnancial hybrids. They are neither fish, flesh nor good red herring. They are neither in the nature of a fixed proprietary interest, as in the case of a share, nor can it be said that they are true interests covered by a debenture, which is another name for a mortgage on the assets of a company. But, of course, with the arts of the tax minimiser they are a very subtle invention and one which can be used, as I said earlier, for other purposes. One of the most sinister things I can see in this legislation is that a person who has lent money on a convertible note has not merely the right to acquire ultimately snares at par or at 90 per cent of the prevailing price at the time when the loan was arranged first but also the right to acquire them in another company other than the issuing company. It can be either an associated company or one of a group that can be interlocked with it. This is a nice way of muscling in. Let us take the classical case of Poseidon NL, which apparently is sitting on a nickel bonanza that has been valued at 180 times the subscribed capital of the company, or more. I believe the subscribed capital is of the order of $500,000. The company is virtually powerless unless it can get someone to lend it money. This is where the big boys can muscle in. They may decide to form another company and call it Poseidon Development and buy into it at par. They will have the major part of the operation and they will muscle in well and truly on the existing company. The loophole is there for them to do so. Mr Lynch-Is the honourable member objecting to big companies being involved?",36
89,Mr CONNOR,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Not in the least. In the main they will not take advantage of this loophole. It is only the lurk man who will want to do if. As a matter of fact, about 45 per cent of the shares in Australia today are held by life assurance companies, mutual funds and superannuation funds. The trend is not and never has been in this direction. It is very plausible now for the Government to come along weeping crocodile tears and suggesting that this legislation will attract extra money. It will not. It will have the opposite effect. It is designed rather to get dividends out for the friends of a particular group of people who have, found that a company is really on a bonanza. Let us take a simple illustration. If the borrowings are to be at the rate of 7i per cent, with proposed company tax of 42i per cent the borrowings cost that company only 4 per cent. That is convenient for the company and nice for the investor, who has the certainty that if he wishes at a later stage he can either buy into that company's shares or form the other development company to which [ referred and then take control of the whole operation. A share in a company is a fixed interest in that company's assets. The traditional pattern of borrowing is either by bank accommodation, which is the normal way, or by debentures, and they can be either first, second or third preferences. Then, of course, there are unsecured notes. There is another means of borrowing too that can be very effectively used by a company where there is a risk involved and the company wants others to participate with it, and that is the deferred dividend share which has been very effectively used by Ampol and certain other Australian companies. One of the most fundamental objections that we have to this legislation is that people who are putting in the risk capital, and in many companies doing it genuinely, can find that other people have muscled in. It is a matter of acute debate amongst company lawyers, accountants and financial experts as to what extent the capital of a company ought properly to be diluted, particularly that of a successful company. This is a matter of acute controversy, and anyone who might have read the works of Berle will find that today more than ever the board of the average big company can be very remote from its shareholders. In point of fact, as long as they are drawing their dividends they do not know much about what is happening in the company, and even in the case of the very biggest they are not capable of exercising effective control over it. In other words, we get a hierarchy or a group offinancialelite who virtually dictate the policy and almost pass over their particular inheritance to one another in terms of control. Quite apart from these aspects there are many other features to which I want to refer. In the case of the overseas investor, by what right does the Government suggest that overseas companies which are already coming in on the Australian capital market and raising money there should then qualify to invest in convertible notes of this type? As I see it this is another means for further control- a control that is to be seriously deprecated-of major Australian assets by overseas investors. 1 do not want to delay the House further because I know that the Minister is anxious to get the measure through by a given time.",37
90,Mr FOSTER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,Somewha t too perhaps.,38
91,Mr CONNOR,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Yes . But to summarise, these are our objections: Firstly,, that the aim of the Government in this is to minimise taxation; secondly, that there may be a dichotomy of interests between the equity shareholder, the person who has borne the brunt of the battle, has run the risk and is entitled to the legitimate rewards; thirdly, that the fixed interest holder ought properly to get priority only for his interest and his capital-h e should have no proprietary rights; fourthly, there is the absorption, as I suggested, of the original company and the transferability of option rights to another associate company; fifthly, there is the danger of the high gearing of borrowings to capital, and high gearing is a besetting evil today in company operation and in company manipulation; sixthly, there is the inflow of overseas capital which can only provoke further ultimate control of Australian assets; seventhly, the favourable terms and the flexible rates of interest which are to be made available to overseas lenders; eighthly, the competition of rich overseas companies with Australian firms on the local capital market; and ninthly, better use can be made of deferred dividend shares. Another and major objection is this: Even assuming that convertible notes are acceptable, why should not the conversion be made on something nearer to the then current market price? Lastly, we say that-w e have said It for many years in this House and in State legislatures tooit is high time that the scandal of company share manipulations in Australia in respect of certain companies was properly controlled by the establishment of a securities exchange commission.",38
92,Mr MARTIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"The Bill before the House is a very complex piece of legislation. I do not think there would be any argument on that from either side of this House. The object of the legislation is to allow a deduction of interest on convertible notes subject to prescribed conditions. Let us have a look at the history of this question of the deductibility of interest on convertible notes. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) had a look at this question in his speech. 1 would like to repeat some of the ngures that he gave. We had a situation which anxious reached a peak in the income year 1959-60 when $48.8m was subscribed by way of convertible notes. The total borrowings or amounts invested in share capital in that year were $95m. In the succeeding year it was $l97m. In 1959-60 we had a borrowing on convertible notes of $48.8m out of a total share capital of $95.8m. In other words, the peak was reached during that year. Prior to that we had a gradual increase in this type of security. In 1958-59 it was $ 19,6m, in 1957-58 it was $13.8m, in 195657 it was $5.8m and in the preceding years it was almost infinitesimal. That was the reason for the introduction of legislation in 1960. Honourable members might ask why there was a sudden upsurge in this type of security. The reason, naturally enough, was that there was a tax advantage in it. There was a tax advantage in 'the issuing of convertible notes by companies and that was the purpose of the issue. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Bury), who is the present Treasurer, at the time when this legislation was introduced in 1960 had this to say about the question of interest deductibility on convertible notes: As to the permanent measure indicated by the Treasurer-the taxation on convertible notes- 1 do not think on the whole that any reasonable person anywhere would chaUenge a measure of this character, because this operation of convertible notes has clearly been closely tied up with measures to dodge taxation. I wonder why there has been this sudden change of heart. The Minister for External Affairs (Mr MCMahon) when he was Treasurer indicated to the House after his 1969 Budget Speech that the Government would re-introduce deductibility of interest on convertible notes. At that time he said: Convertible notes have worthwhile advantages apart from considerations such as those I mentioned. They have been widely used as means of raising capital on international markets and could therefore place Australian companies in a better position to raise funds overseas. 1 notice that there is no mention in the present Treasurer's second reading speech of this facet of the Government's intention. In fact, the impression was given that desirable features' of this Bill were to achieve exactly the opposite purpose, that this legislation would facilitate the of capital in Australia. Yet we had a situation which was set out by the Treasurer's predecessor who indicated thai the Government intended to place Austof ralian companies in a better position to raise funds overseas. This is one of the basic purposes of the Bill about which as an Opposition disagree with the panies Government. I would like the Minister for Immigration who is also the Minister assisting the Treasurer to say whether this Bill is the first step in the opening of the flood gates. The Government is taking a big step. believe that the Opposition and the people of Australia are entitled to know whether this is the first step in the opening of the flood gates. 1 listened to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Garland) who was the first speaker from the Government side of the House to speak on this Bill. 1 believe that he more or less envisaged that this could be the case. The honourable member said: In future it may be necessary to restrict it a little further. It may be possible to open it a little further. J am wondering whether it is the Government's intention-the Minister assisting the Treasurer can give me an answer in his reply-to open the flood gates again? Does the Government intend to open the flood gates a little further? Is this Bill the first step in this operation? My main quarrel with the Government is that better means should be used to encourage the investment of capital in Australia. The Minister in his second reading speech indicated that one of the main reasons for the measure which is before the House is that it will assist to encourage the investment of capital in developing companies with good but to some extent uncertain prospects. 1 wonder, from an economic viewpoint, have whether we should be doing this. Should a we be offering encouragement to investors to hazard their capital? Have we reached a stage of economic development in Australia where we have a surplus of Australian capital available for uncertain prospects? I think not. Should the Government encourage this type of speculative venture by the the judicious use of taxation legislation? I certainly do not agree that the Government should be adopting this type of legislation raising to achieve its stated objectives. There is no shortage of Australian equity capital for ventures that have a fair chance success. We should not be seeking to over-stretch our resources into fields of investment with uncertain prospects. There we is ample evidence to establish that comin the extractive minerals industry with reasonable chances of success have no problem in raising equity capital without the necessity to resort to the use of convertible notes. As an example of this, one has only to look at the situation which applied to such companies in the extractive 1 minerals industry as Robe River Limited and Utah Development. When they recently floated on the Australian market Utah Development's shares were issued at 85 per cent premium which meant that a $1 issue was issued at $1.85. Brokers were flooded with applications for these shares. The same flood of share applications applied to Robe River Limited. The Robe River Limited share issue was at par or $1. Utah's shares were issued at a premiumat $1.85. There was a flood of capital in the cases I have mentioned. What is the reason for the measure now before us? I suggest that the reason for this measure is to enable capital to be hazarded in speculative industries. I consider that speculative industries of this kind should not be encouraged in the current, state of Australian growth and development. It is bad economics to initiate legislation which will have the effect of overstretching our capacity for Australian investment. On the one hand this Government is having extreme difficulty in filling its Commonwealth loans for capital works. On the other hand, on the word of the Treasurer, the Government is seeking to encourage the utilisation of Australian capital in developing companies with uncertain prospects. I do not agree that we should attempt to over-stretch our economy to this extent. 1 now turn to the general basis of the Bill. It is true, of course, that convertible borrowings, which replace what would otherwise be straight fixed interest borrowrestrictions ings, do not in any way prejudice income tax revenue. It is also true that investors are more interested in using their funds to obtain equity capital and are not particularly interested in fixed interest lending. Overseas investors are interested in sharing the control of Australian companies which they do as when they have shares or equity capital but which they do not do when they lend at fixed rates of interest. It is in this regard that the Opposition quarrels with this Bill. When we get down to the conditions and specifications in this Bill we find that Government has a different series of conalready ditions applicable to borrowings on the foreign market compared with borrowings on the Australian market. I would like the Minister to explain why we have this differential treatment? Is it because Government wants to encourage the investsubmissions ment of foreign capital in Australia to detriment of the Australian economy?",38
93,Mr LYNCH,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Flinders-Minister for been Immigration and Minister assisting the Treasurer) (5.6)- A number of comments representations. have been made by honourable members seeking explanations in relation to the Bill before the House. In the time available me 1 intend to set in context the Bill sented by the Government and to answer a number of queries which have been raised. First of all I would like to say that Government's decision to restore the income tax deductions for convertible note issues was first announced in the 1969-70 Budget Speech, was spelt out in some detail in ministerial statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) on 16th September 1969 and was further amplified in a minisof terial statement made by the previous Treasurer, who is now Minister for External Affairs (Mr MCMahon), on 25th September 1969. in those statements the basic criteria proposed for the allowance of income tax deductions for convertible note interest, and which are in substance incorporated in the legislation now before the House, were clearly established. For example, it was clearly indicated that as a condition of eligibility and as a condition for deductibility the lender or note holder and not the issuing company would need to be given the conversion option. That we proposed as to the time during which the conversion option was to be exercisable was overseas also made clear at that time. It cannot be said that insufficient notice has been given to the Opposition or business interests of the conversion price test provided in the Bill. As we indicated in unambiguous terms over 12 months ago, a condition for deductibility the conversion price for shares is to be not less than 90 per cent of their market value when the convertible securities are issued, or par, whichever is the greater. As my colleague on this side of the House, the honourable the member for Curtin (Mr Garland), has pointed out, the Bill was introduced in this Parliament on 27th August-som e 6 weeks ago-and this I believe to be a reasonable time for interested parties to make their representations. In fact, the the Government has received and considered made to it by representatives of the the business and finance community since the Bill was introduced. The amendment to a machinery provision of the Bill, which has circulated in this House, results from a difficulty which was raised in one of these The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) indicated that in his view to the Bill had been brought down because preof what he referred to as 'pressure', and I use that word in inverted commas. He said that pressure had been put upon the the Government to reverse the decision made nearly 10 years ago and to regard the convertible note now as a legitimate form of commercial transaction. This is simply not a the position. As the Treasurer (Mr Bury) indicated when introducing the Bill, the decision to revive the use in this country the convertible notefinancingtechnique emanated from the Government's recent review of the income tax law relating to convertible notes. As a step towards attaining our objective of increasing Australian equity participation in Australian development, we sought means of diverting fixedinterest borrowings into borrowings with an opportunity of equity participation. It was in fact for this reason and not because of any pressure, to which reference has been made, that the Government gave notice in the 1969-70 Budget of its intention to amend the income tax law to restore deductibility of interest for income tax purposes on convertible securities. One of the basic matters raised by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and 1 believe also by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) was the question of who will be advantaged by the new convertible notes legislation. During developmental phases many major projects bave either no earnings or no surplus earnings available for distribution as dividends to shareholders, These are projects which could have difficulty in attracting funds from investors seeking an immediate return on their capital outlay- a factor which could inhibit the raising of equity finance. The alternative of convertible fixed-interest borrowings with a guarantee of income can have special attractions for both lenders and borrowers. Companies, by being able to offer an immediate income return on funds invested plus the opportunity to vert into share capital, will increase probability of borrowing successfully, and, of course, the interest payable on debt raising is tax deductible, thus substantially reducing the effective cost to the borrower of servicing capital raised. Convertible notes are, of course, widely recognised-bot h here and overseas-as particularly appropriate means of financing new and developing companies or of financing development projects that will not come on stream for some time. In these cases lenders would generally be more willof ing to make what could be regarded as high risk loans at reasonable rates .of interest if they had the added inducement of being able to acquire equity holdings and so participate in the profits of the enterattractive prise, should it ultimately prove successful. To indicate that this is the case, I refer to the comments of a prominent sharebeen broker, Mr A. C Goode, who would be we known to the Opposition, particularly to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and who has recently gone on record as saying that with the bringing down of the new convertible notes legislation a most interesting and flexible method of raising finance will be available, and that the special situations to which convertible notes might be applied in the future are bound to be numerous. Mr Goode specifically instanced the use of the convertible borrowing technique in cases where an overseas company was planning to convert to public status; in cases where an Australian subsidiary was not immediately profit-earning; as a stimulus to a particularly large issue, or to an issue for a company temporarily encountering difficulties, or to a small and not well-known company. Whether or not large companies like the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd, Alcoa of Australia Pty Ltd or any other large firms will take advantage of the new legislation is of course something that quite frankly only experience will show. Mr Connor-They will not.",40
94,Mr LYNCH,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"The honourable gentleman must have available to him more expertise tban is available to the whole of the Comthe monwealth Treasury. I myself would have consome doubts as to the dubious legitimacy the of the sources which cause him to make that comment. But it is interesting to record that during 1968 and the early part of 1969, convertible issues on the international capital market totalled $US2,300m, or more than twice as much as total fixed-interest issues of $USl,100m. These issues were on terms that would generally comply with a the basic conditions in the Bill. (do not suggest here for one moment that convertible issues on these conditions will be equally popular in the special circumstances the Australian market, but it does suggest that Australian companies generally ought to be able to devise terms and conditions within the proposed legislation which would make their convertible notes quite to Australian investors. If we were to be guided by overseas practice where many of the current convertible issues have made by leading companies, I believe would have little hesitation in saying that this financing technique will not be overfinal looked or ignored by the larger Australian companies. Several honourable gentlemen who have spoken in this debate have raised the specific question of the position of the foreign investor vis-a-vis his Australian counterpart. The different tests that apply to convertible notes issued overseas do not place the seas investor in a better position than Australian counterpart. One difference of course is that there is a minimum borrowing period of 7 years for local issues limit for overseas issues. This minimum period is designed to ensure that a local investor cannot be deprived of the opporbelieve tunity of converting into shares by early repayment of the loan before the investor has had a reasonable opportunity to judge whether the borrowing company's developwere ment prospects justify such a course. As have earlier indicated, the objective that convertible notes could provide increased opportunities for Australian equity ownerhave ship in foreign-initiated ventures was principal consideration in relaxing the embargo on convertible note interest. Another difference is that provision be made for variations in the rate of interest in specified circumstances on overseas issues but not on local issues. This is designed to permit variations in the rate interest where the overseas lender is himself borrowing on a 'roll-over' basis. No other variation of interest rates is permitted overseas issues and, but for this modificaannounced, tion, the constant interest rate condition is to apply on the same basis to both local and overseas issues. The constant interest rate condition is intended, of course, as an additional obstacle in the way of arrangements designed to induce note holders to defer conversion without in the the House. end losing the main advantages they would have gained from subscribing to an equity issue. For example, it will prevent a company from inducing note holders to convert at one time rather than another by interest rate manipulation. There are other differences, but I do not want to take up too much time of the House. There is not enough time to answer all of the questions that have been raised, but I want to direct comment briefly to the point raised by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. He said that the fences or the criteria established in the Bill may be so high that business interests may find that little use can be made of the new technique. This seems to be somewhat at variance with the point made by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Martin) who said that in his view-whic h is unjustioverfied in the opinion of the Government-w e his were seeking to open what he dramatically termed the 'flood gates'. It would seem to me that the Opposition has tended to speak and no with 2 voices on this subject. Quite honestly, from past experience we that the Bill has been correctly drawn, that the right criteria have been established and that there is no indication that we will find the same disabilities which apparent in the pre-1960 period. I From past experience, simply drawn legislation could leave the way open, as may been suggested by the honourable a member for Banks, for circumventing the 1960 basic conditions that have been set for determining deductibility. I wish to stress to the House that every effort has been may made to steer a course between the needs of protecting the revenue and the needs of producing a detailed scheme that will serve the Government's objectives in restoring of the deduction and will be found useful by the business community. From comments that have been made in the Press since the for basic conditions for deductibility were there is every indication that the new convertible notes legislation will be of practical assistance to the business community. I could quote from a number to act of the comments that have been made. But, in fairness to the hour of the day, at this stage I simply commend the Bill to Question put: That the Bill be now read a second time. The House divided.

98,Mr CREAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"On behalf of the Opposition I move the following amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting Ihe following words in place thereof: 'the Bill be withdrawn and re-drafted because whilst it reduces rates of taxation it does so in a regressive manner'. The measures that are before the House impose the rates of income tax as they will operate on individuals and companies for this financial year. I would point out that, as is disclosed in the Budget details, the income tax on individuals is expected to yield $3.036m this year and the company tax as applied this financial year is expected to yield $l,40lm. In essence, a total of about S4,437m will be collected as a result of the application of these rates of tax. I would like to raise a point that was touched on last evening by the Minister for Customs and Excise (Mr Chipp) who, when dealing with the present levels of taxation in Australia, pointed with some pride to the fact that direct taxation, as it operates in Australia at the moment at the Commonwealth level-h e stressed this-is a higher proportion of total taxation now than it was previously. This sort of comparison distorts the very real circumstance that, in Australia, taxation is not levied at only one level of government; it is levied at the Commonwealth level, the State level and the local authority level. Because the Commonwealth is the sole collector of income tax, the major direct tax in the economy, and of company tax the picture appears to be brighter as far as the Commonwealth is concerned. But it is a picture that is significantly different when the total of taxation levied in Australia taken into account. It will be seen from the total figures-I quote from a compilacollected tion that I have here-that the Australian national accounts for the last financial year 1968-69 show that that year the Commonwealth collected an aggregate of $5,486m, some $3,413m of which was from direct taxes and the residue, about $2,000m, from indirect taxes. The States and local authorities collected an aggregate of $1,208m, only $133m of which could be classified as direct taxes. When one takes the total pattern into account and also the excess that public authorities charge for the services they provide, which has been increasing in recent years and which last year aggregated $800m-this is a charge Ports) upon the users of public utility undertakings such as electricity and gas-on e finds that the position is distorted even more into the regressive pattern of indirect tax as against direct tax. Taking the whole level of taxation in Australia, at the 3 levels, it is still true that approximately 50 per cent of it is direct tax, nearly all collected by the Commonwealth, and the residue collected at the other 2 levels. The Commonwealth also collects sales tax. excise and so on. It is a 50-50 pattern still and it has not altered very significantly over the last several years. I am sorry that I cannot put my hand on the figures for the last 4 years which are contained in the White Paper on national income. We now turn to the very significant question of the equity of taxation. The Treasurer in his Budget speech spoke about the revision of taxing. He said: In deciding on this kind of revision, we have had regard lo the way in which the incidence of die effective burden of tax has been altered by past rises in incomes. Effective tax rates have increased more on lower and middle incomes than on higher incomes, and in giving some relief from the effects of the past trends, there is a clear case for ensuring that most of the relief will go lo lower and middle income earners. 1 submit that the present form of relief docs no such thing. If one had chosen to redistribute about $250m of tax, as these income tax concessions do, one could not think of any worse way to do it. Contrary to what has been said, the maximum advantage goes to those with the highest incomes and the fewest dependants, and the least of the relief goes to those with the lowest incomes and the most dependants. I will illustrate that is in a moment by reference to a couple of tables. I emphasise again that the tax to be this year will be something more aggregating about S250m proposed in this measure. People say rather glibly that direct tax is preferable to indirect tax. That ought to be true, but it is not necessarily true if inequities are allowed to creep into the income tax structure. 1 submit that this is what has happened in Australia. The mathematical curve of the rate of progression has remained unaltered since 1954. There have not been very great alterations made to the Grade of Number of income taxpayers Spouses S '000's 4174,000 4.027,000 874 4,001-10,000 901.000 465 10,000 plus 71.000 Totals 5,000,000 1,360 It is an adaptation of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition and the details contained in the document entitled 'Commonwealth Income Tax Statistics' which was brought down with the Budget.

In Australia for the year we are talking about a fairly select section ended June 1968 only 71.000 people out of the total taxpaying public. of 5 million-les s than 2 per cent-ha d The lowest income range I have taken, incomes in excess of $10,000. As 1 will $417 to $4,000-$4,00 0 is about $77 per week-accounte d for 4,027,000 or 80 per cent of taxpayers. It is a bit difncult in Australia to make a proper appraisal of the weight of taxation because whilst there is considerable detail in the statistics is in fact no distinction between married and single taxpayers. In the lower levels of income the statistics tend to be distorted by 2 factors. They comprise single people who have just commenced work and, to an extent, some of the effects of what is called income splitting. That is to say, what should be effectively one income, by reason of resort to partnerships, trusts and private companies and so on is divided into more than one income. If one runs a farm, for instance, it is not very difncult have it regarded as a partnership. If there is an income on the one farm of $10,000 it can be divided into 2 incomes of $5,000. It makes a considerable difference to the amount of tax paid on the farm. The other matter that cannot be separated very clearly except by a kind of deductive process is the degree of claims that are made for dependants. Nevertheless, it is possible by a deductive process to do this and, according to the statistics, if one takes the character 'spouses'- I do not think there are many wives who claim for their husbands and I think it is still preponderantly the husband who claims for the wife; therefore in my view one can use the category 'spouses and housekeepers' for a comparison of those male taxpayers who still claim support for their wives-ther e are 1,360,000 spouses claimed for and 874,000 of them, which is near enough to 2 out of 3, are in this lowest range of income, that is, less than $4,000 per annum or $77 per week. There is almost the same proportion of children claimed for in the same group. The interesting thing about the table sought by the Leader of the Opposition is that if one starts with aggregate actual income for taxation purposes of something like $15,000 that is reduced to a taxable income of $12,000 after allowance for these various concessions which aggregate on their face value nearly $3,000-$2,850 in fact. The information obtained by the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition is that those concessions when claimed meant that the revenue lost or forgone was nearly S900m. Just to take one item, life assurance, as an example, under the provisions of the income tax law if a person is able to save $1,200 per annum for life assurance or superannuation he can claim it as a taxation deduction. This is nearly there $23 a week. How many people in the community can afford to save $23 a week in the first place and are they entitled to be assisted by the revenue for so doing? I commend the details on page 1155 of Hansard to honourable members. The allowance of those concessions meant that the revenue lost $19 lm which, by way of comparison, was more than that allowed for all the wives of taxpayers in Australia. It was more than was allowed for all the children that were claimed as dependants. It exceeded the to child endowment bill for the vear. I received an answer yesterday to a question which I had asked. The answer showsthe ngures are in the Budget-that in 1969-70 a lesser proportion of gross national expenditure was devoted to social welfare payments than was the case in 1960-61. This answer, which is in yesterday's Hansard for those who are interested, shows that in 1969-70 child endowment was 0.73 per cent of the gross national expenditure whereas in 1960-61, 9 years earlier, it was 0.98 per cent of the gross national expenditure. Another interesting point is that relative to the total number there was an increase in the proportion of children receiving child endowment in 1969-70 compared to 1960-61. This shows the deterioration that has taken place in the real value of child endowment payments. For those honourable members who have some sympathy for what are called repatriation benefits I provide these details: In 1960-61 repatriation benefits were 0.98 per cent, or nearly 1 per cent, of the gross national expenditure. In 1969-70 they had fallen to 0.74 per cent of the gross national expenditure. Th s was a deterioration in proportion to the wealth of the nation of one-quarter. Something which is rather contradictory and which has been built into the income tax structure is that the allowance made for family and other concessions runs counter to the logic of social welfare payments. As an example let us take 2 families each with 3 children under the age of 16 years. Each family receives $3 per week in child endowment irrespective of the income of the family. But if the father of one family has an actual income of $3,000 and the other father has an actual income of 810,000 the tax concession to the first family, the lower income family, is worth $2.56 a week but to the second family, the higher income family, it is $5.17 a week which is almost double the first amount. It is quite a feasible proposition that most of the taxpayers of Australia and most families would be better off if the Government did away with the taxation concessions for children and doubled the amount of child endowment which was payable. I submit that these are the sorts of things that ought to be looked at when we are examining the taxation structure. Under the new arrangement I have not very much time left in which to speak in this debate. Also built into the existing rales structure is the effect of inflation. I will take as a comparison what is called the average weekly earnings. In Australia the average weekly earnings at present are about $77 per week or about $4,000 per year. The existing tax rate scale was last altered in 1953-54. Taking the average weekly earnings in 1953-54 as an index of 100, that index in June 1970 has risen to 237.2. Using the same basis that I have on these figures it was 201.2 in June 1968 or almost exactly double in 1967-68 what TAXABLE INDIVIDUALS-RESIDENT S OF AUSTRALIA Grade of actual income s 417s 1,800 (less than $35 weekly) 1,8002,400 ($35-$4S weekly) 2,400- 2,800 (S45-S54 weekly) 2,800- 3,200 ($54-$62 weekly) 3,200- 3,600 (S62-S69 weekly) Sub-total 3,6004,000 ($69-$77 weekly) 4,0006,000 ($77-$l 15 weekly) 6,000-10,000 ($115-S192 weekly) 10,000 plus . . Source-Base d on Commonwealth Income Tax Statistics There is some overlapping as between dectiles it had been in 1953. In 1953-54 the average weekly earnings were in the region of $34 to S3 5 or $1,700 a year. In 1968 the average bad doubled to $3,400 a year. If one looks at the marginal rate of tax, which is the amount paid on an additional Si of income earned, in 1954 it was 17.6c in the $1 but in 1968 the marginal rate had risen to 29ic in the $1. Average weekly earnings go up for 2 reasons: More than half because of inflation and something like the other half because the worker is getting his share of the increase of productivity that has taken place in a period of over 15 years. But when we take into account that more than half of every $1 the wage earner gets as a wage increase is due to price increases and less than half is due to productivity increase we see that something like 30 per cent is taken away in the additional tax that he pays. So virtually he has been robbed of some of the fruits of his progress. This is one of the reasons why the Government should periodically alter the progressive scale. I do not know whether people are aware of the distribution of incomes in Australia so. 1 prepared a table from the statistics which are available in the booklet 'Commonwealth Income Tax Statistics'. With the concurrence of honourable members. I incorporate the table in Hansard. NA NA income Year ended 30 June 1968 Dcctiles Percentage ol' (tenths of Percentage ol"" Percentage of taxpayers actual dependants tax paid (approximately) income) in dectile by dectile .. 24 First.. 3 4 14 Second 9 7 14 Third 12 7 12 Fourth 15 8 10 Fifth 15 6 74 (Half) 54 32 6 Sixth 12 10 13 Seventh and 26 22 eighth 4 Ninth 7 16 (nearly 8) 2 Tenth .2 20 25 45 68 (plus) presented with Budget 1970-71-page s 4 to 7. because of arbitrary ranges of actual incoine. In compiling that table 1 divided the actual income as revealed in the taxation statistics into what are called dectiles. The total amount of income is divided into one-tenth slices. For the year ended June 1968 24 per cent of taxpayers were in the first dectile-that is, in the first one-tenth of the total income received. That is to say, one-quarter received one-tenth. They were people with incomes of less than $35 a week. Even within that level there were some who had dependants to support. They were responsible for only 4 per cent of the tax collected. At least there was some sort of case to begin to reform the tax system from the bottom. There ought to be a base deduction from everybody or what might be called subsistence or some minimum amount. It would be set as high as $1,500 or $1,600 and then the scale of progression would alter. The next dectile involved people with incomes ranging from $1,800 to $2,400 which was 14 per cent of the taxpayers or one-seventh. They paid 7 per cent of the tax collected. They had 9 per cent of the dependants. The next one-tenth-this is a narrower band-involve d people in the $45 to $54 a week range or $2,400 to $2,800. That is another 14 per cent and they also paid 7 per cent of the total tax collected. The first 5 dectiles, or half of the total income of Australia, three-quarters of the population received half of income and paid one-third of the tax. At least there is some degree of income maldistribution in Australia. In my view part of the duty of the progressive income tax to redress that maldistribution. The remaining quarter of the population is found in the income levels above $70 week. Therefore below this figure of $70 week are three-quarters of the taxpayers and above it only one-quarter. The sort adjustment that is made in this legislation will give two-thirds of the advantage these taxation reductions to one-quarter the population. If anybody suggests to that that makes the tax structure more equitable then I would say that I have understanding of the meaning of the word 'equitable'. I submit that the Government missed an opportunity here to begin reform fundamentally the taxation strucmust ture of Australia. The way to begin is remove the inequities that are inherent within the tax structure itself. Sometimes people say to me: 'What is your tax schedule?' It is impossible to write a tax schedule in the abstract. The only thing that one can sensibly do is to point out the inadequacies and injustices in the system which obtains at present. To my mind the structure that we now have is riddled with inadequacies and injustices. The progressive mathematical scale in 1954 when the average weekly earnings which would have covered probably, as it does now. about three-quarters of the tax payers was thought to be a logical scale. If it was thought to have logic in 1954 when the average wage was $1,700 and the marginal rate was 17.6c, how can it have logic with the same scale of progression in 1968 or 1970 when the average wage has doubled and when the marginal rate has risen from 17.6c in the $1 to 30c? I submit that this is only the worse of patchwork alteration and I would hope that the Government will do as it says it will do and. having made this move, will now look at the total structure of taxation in Australia. Its first look has been a pretty fleeting, pretty furtive and pretty unjust one.",44

100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES, Is the amendment moved by the honour the able member for Melbourne Ports seconded? Mr Stewart- I second the amendment it is and reserve my right to speak.,48
101,Mr GARLAND,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES," 1 was interested to listen to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), who a led for the Australian Labor Party in this a debate, comment on this most important Bill as part of the Budget proposals. In of the course of his remarks he touched on a great number of matters affecting income of tax law. They were, in the context of the of rating Bills now before the House, of releme vance although in many respects they were not connected. The Government received no many demands from many organisations for a reduction in income tax rates. Among the most firm in their demands for such to reductions were the trade unions. So we remember that the Budget was framed to in conditions of wide-scale public demand for a reduction in income tax rates applying to the various levels of incomes. One of the main features of this Bill is that it reduces by 10 per cent the rate of income tax on taxable income from the minimum level up to the level of $10,000. The rate then tapers down to 4.4 per cent at the level of $20,000 taxable income, and from that point the tapering continues until the taxation relief is nil at the point of $32,000. That level of $32,000 taxable income is of significance because it is at that point, and has been for many years, that the progressive scale ends its acceleration and becomes a flat rate of two-thirds tax plus 2 i per cent. That is basic and perhaps the major point of this Bill, although there are 3 classes of items mentioned in it. It has been said that income tax is a major form of raising revenue for the carrying on of the conduct of affairs in this country. It is fundamental that when those rates are set one can anticipate fairly closely the revenue that will be received and, in the total Budget concept, fairly accurately estimate what the expenditure will be. I suppose that every day we sit in this House we hear demands by the Opposition that more money ought to be spent. They are not inconsiderable demands. We have demands for very large sums. Yesterday one honourable member opposite stood up and asked that a mere $I00m be appropriated for a purpose. That is not uncommon. We hear that a great deal here. Whilst it is the right of the Opposition and the right of any citizen to make such a request, the Government has the responsibility of deciding where the priorities will go and how much will be spent on the major heads of education, social services, defence and health, ft has to decide how the economic cake will be cut up. So it is not unreasonable in a debate of this kind, when suggestions are made for reducing the rate of tax or increasing expenditure-neve r do we hear a suggestion for reducing it-to ask: Where is the money to come from? It is not only a question of receiving money; it is also a question of providing balance to. the economy. I want to make a few remarks about the economy because it is very easy to criticise how little is spent on a certain item and take it out of the context of the total flow in the economy and the total levels of supply and demand. Very briefly, in economic terms, the Government has the responsibility to make sure that the supply of goods and services in the community-the amount of physical labour that is available in the community - ar e balanced by a reasonable demand, because if demand outstrips supply we get shortages of goods and inflation. Inflation beyond acceptable levels of perhaps 3 per cent, 4 per cent or 5 per cent per annum creates further difficulties. They are not theoretical difficulties but difficulties which touch the lives of every individual in this country. In taxing the private sector the Government, through its powers, subtracts a capacity for private spending so that the Government can spend ihe revenue so raised in the various avenues set out in the Budget, the major heads of which 1I have just referred to, to try to keep in balance supply and demand, a steady and high rate of employment and a fairly constant level of prices. In current economic conditions, were it to be otherwise, it would result in rising costs and shortages. T referred to acceptable levels of inflation because there is an incipient inflation which exists in any developed economy as a result of tremendous demand, and rightly so. Beyond acceptable levels it can create much hardship for various classes of income earners and, importantly, also upset the balance of payments. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports mentioned, as 1 said, a wide variety of matters. To the motion that the Bill be read a second time, he has moved the following amendment: the Bill bc withdrawn and redrafted He speaks here of the fundamental Bill of the whole Budget proposals. . . because whilst it reduces rates of taxation it does so in a regressive manner. I believe that my colleague who will speak after me may refer to those words in more detail, but 1 want to put to the House one or two fundamental facts about income tax as it is levied on individuals, because we have a progressive rate of income tax. I am sure that the concept of a progressive rate is accepted by every member of the House. We have a method of levying taxation by which those with the higher incomes are taxed at a higher rale than those on the lower incomes. Surely, if we are to reduce income tax, we cannot alter that principle without giving greater benefit to those on higher incomes than to those on lesser incomes. Were it otherwise we would not have a progressive rate of today incoine tax but a regressive rate, and that would be an impossible situation. The rale scale which has been in existence since 1954 has to be changed from time to time because the average income increases not only with inflation but with increased wealth and productivity. One has to have this basic rate and it has to be changed from time to time. So it has come about that this year it has been re-drawn making the allowances to which I have referred. would like to emphasise, incidentally, cause I believe there is a misconception around the country about it to some extent, that although the rates of taxation on some incomes are higher than they have been previously no-one at any level pays more taxation than he did before. That ought to be clearly understood, although I know that there are some areas where it is understood. But what has emerged out of this Budget, and it perhaps is the most important point for the people of Australia to understand, is that there has been an adjustment in the Budget which provides for less personal income tax to be paid by individuals and there has been an increase in certain indirect taxes. To me, speaking perhaps from point of view of someone who believes deeply in the value of individual and private enterprise, that is a great benefit to receive. It means that a man has more of his earnings at his disposal to spend he wishes and if he does not care to buy those items on which the excise or sales tax has been increased that is for him to decide. I am ali in favour of the individual having that right to decide and having net disposable income to spend as he likes. In other words, I am supporting the other principle which I believe is implicit in Budget and I think that there ought to be more emphasis in our economy on indirect taxes rather than direct taxes. Here, course, we are in an area of judgment because I do not think the honourable member for Melbourne Ports would, from what he was saying, agree with that tention. But I would say that a comparison of the 3 levels of taxation to which referred-Commonwealth , State and local government-wit h other Western countries would show that Australians are paying more in direct taxation. I think the tendency is that there should be a transfer to more indirect taxation so that the individual can make up his mind as to how he will spend his earnings, his take-home pay. The honourable member'for Melbourne Ports discussed at some length the concept of equity in taxation. This is a very difficult and important field. He made a number of suggestions and I would like to point out that because of the complex nature of income tax law and all tax law it is 1 easy to take an example from here and an beexample from there, put them together and show an inequality or an inequitable position. I do not by any means disagree with some of the suggestions that he made. I think he made a number of valid points. I think that certainly it is the duty of this House and the Government to give continuing consideration, as they are, to not endeavouring to improve the equity of taxation, but I point out there there is no such thing as perfection in equity of taxation. One can go to a lot of trouble to try to be more equitable to certain classes of income earners and find that changes that are made upset another class. This is a matter not easy of solution. But certainly with a progressive income tax scale it is impossible to give more relief in the taxation to the lower than the higher income group, although the rate of taxation initiative may be altered. May 1 point out that in consideration of as this subject it is important that when one looks at the statistics- I saw the honourable member for Melbourne Ports holding the booklet of very comprehensive statistics which is published each year-on e must more always remind oneself that the incomes stated in that booklet are net incomes-in words, earnings less concessional and the other deductions which are by no means insignificant. When one talks about a level of income being taxed one has to of remember always that that is the net figure, and in the case of higher income groups the concessional deductions may be very significant, perhaps $2,000 or $3,000. conWhen one talks about average earnings that point must be taken into account. The he honourable member for Melbourne Ports at one point discussed the losses to revenue resulting from different classes of concessional deductions and inquired as to whether it was fair that one class should be at one level as against another. 1 think that is a valid and most proper avenue for inquiry and comparison, and the statistics to which I have referred illuminate that avenue. 1 believe that it is something that should be given even closer attention. But 1 do not think that one ought to go straight on from there and say that we should not make a reduction in this progressive scale when we had a general demand by the people of Australia, as we did in the months gone by, for a general reduction in direct income tax. The honourable member also made what I could perhaps describe as a traditional attack on the progressive scale and said that it had not been varied for some years. He related it to average income. That is something which might at first sight appear to be valid but 1 really do question it. In spite of the tax rate rises that we have seen consumer spending in the economy has increased at a significant rate, somewhere in the region of 7 or 8 per cent in the last year. There has been an increase in expenditure by individuals on dwellings of the order of 20 per cent. Spending on building and construction and on plant and equipment has increased substantially and these substantial increases speak highly of the expansion which has taken place in the economy of this country. There has been a very strong increase in the net disposable income after tax-wha t can loosely be called take-home pay. indeed, while the current taxation scale has been in existence, 1 think, since 1953-54 there has been an increase in the disposable income of the average wage earner with 3 children of well over 30 per cent. There is no need to be gloomy on the subject. Indeed, the overall position is a favourable one. In addition, of course, the Government's spending, which is only possible because nf taxation, has resulted in a number of benefits to individuals in the community. I think those comments put the matter into context in economic terms. The individual is far better off today than he was in 1954 in spite of the fact that the progressive scale of taxation has stayed the same. Because of the complexity of the taxation law I say that advocating a change may lead to what appears to be a more equithas expired. able position for one class but often puts another class in a more inequitable position. This Bill changes an individual's tax rates in the fasihon that I have mentioned. It increases company tax by 2] per cent on all levels. It increases substantially the age allowance made to women over 60 years of age and men over 65 years of age to a point where a person entitled to an age allowance can earn a net income-that is, income less deductions-of $1,326 a year before any taxation is payable. A shaded amount of taxation is payable on amounts higher than $1,326. It is a very substantial reduction. I think that the community ought to understand that because one tends, in the total Budget context, to pick out a criticism here and there ancl not see the thing as a whole. But the Government has the responsibility for the economy of this country. The people and the Opposition would be the first to criticise it if it did something which was irresponsible and allowed conditions to arise which affected the people in an unacceptable way. In the short time that is left to me I want to make one or two points which I hope the Government or the Treasurer may take into consideration. The Budget speech referred to the continuing consideration of the taxation law and rates. I do not refer to these necessarily as firm proposals but as questions to consider. I take it as axiomatic that the tax scale must be varied from time to time. It would seem to me that the publishing of a scale which shows a separate levy of 21 per cent is now without use and outmoded. It would also seem to me that thp minimum net income taxed could well be raised from its present level of $417 to a figure of Si.000. Such an increase would be consistent with the steady increase of the age allowance. Of course, there would be a need to have some shading in rates. I question whether there is any need to continue with the top limit at $32,000. It would seem to me that a level of $25,000 would be more apt. We should always remember that the people in the higher income group whom I would define as those receiving in excess of $10,000 a year often use companies in order to minimise their tax burdens.",48
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES, Order ! The honourable member's time,51
103,Mr COLLARD,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES,"The Income Tax Bill which is now before us for discussion is the result of a rather hurried promise made by the Government just prior to the House of Representatives election last year. The promise was that if returned, the Government would bring down legislation to reduce income tax for the lower and middle income groups. More particularly and more importantly the Government promised that it would equalise the burden of taxation generally. It is now quite evident, when we examine the tax scale which the Treasurer (Mr Bury) proposed to the House, that at the time of making the promise to reduce income tax the Government had no idea how it would implement its promise or what effect such a measure would have. Otherwise-and I think this is more Hkely-the concern that the Government expressed for the low income groups was merely a smokescreen for a vote catching gimmick. I rise tonight to support the amendment which was moved by my colleague, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean). I do so because we now find that where the most relief is requiredthat is for people on the low incomes where the tax burden has been the hardest or has had the heaviest effect-is where the least relief of a real nature has been given. The area in which the least relief is needed is in the income range from $10,000 to $30,000. It is in this area where the greatest real relief has been granted. While Government supporters prior to the election preached relief for those on low incomes-and this is where relief should have been given-it is very disappointing to find now that although the Government can see its way clear to give relief amounting to only 82c per year to a person whose taxable income is only $500, it is prepared to accept and indeed has accepted as being in the middle income group taxpayers with taxable incomes of $30,000. Such persons would have actual incomes nearer to $33,000. The Government has given these persons income tax relief of just on $70. There may be an even more inequitable situation in the Government's proposal. This is where a person with a taxable income of $16,000 will receive a reduction in tax of $500.20 which is 20c more than the total taxable income of the person who is to receive a reduction of only 82c and who will still be required to pay income tax of $8.81 together with some immeasurable amount of indirect tax. It is interesting but rather disturbing to note that the amount of $500 reduction a year which will be received by taxpayers who have a taxable income of $16,000 is twenty-nine times the amount which the Government gave to pensioners this year as an increase. Looking at the proposed scale we fiud that the group which is made up of taxable incomes which range from $12,000 to $25,000 will receive an average reduction in tax of $450. In the group where taxable incomes range from $500 to $3,000 the average reduction will amount to only $19 each. This is the system the Treasurer has told us would bring about a more equitable distribution of the burden of income tax. This is what the Treasurer told us in his Budget Speech would be the method which the Government would adopt to give relief on an equitable basis. However, the Government will give $9 a week relief for those on high incomes, 37c a week for those on low incomes, down to 2c a week for those on extremely low incomes. So if the Government had decided before the election how it intended to implement its promise, it is little wonder that it was very careful not to spelt it out to the electors. It is no wonder that the Government avoided teling the people about its idea of equitable distribution. The fact is that the system will be even more inequitable as a result of the proposed scale than it is at present. In his second reading speech on this Bill the Minister for Immigration and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) said: Of greatest importance, so far as individual taxpayers are concerned, are the tax reductions-sub stantially in the lower and middle income ranges-propose d by the Bill. I have referred to some of these so called substantial reductions-that of 82c for instance. But let me examine in more detail the reductions in the lower income groups as against those with high incomes. I would also like to give the House some information on the number of taxpayers in those groups. The Government took an easy way of giving some tax relief which does nothing to correct the inequality. The Government has made a flat percentage rate reduction up to where taxable income reaches $10,000. There is a scaling down from this figure to where the income reaches $32,000. Therefore, if the tax rates between, for example, a taxpayer with a taxable income of $1,000 and a taxpayer with a taxable income of $10,000 are inequitable under the existing scale-and nobody will deny that this is so-surel y by simply adopting a flat percentage rate reduction from $1,000 to $10,000 will not correct or even improve the situation. Indeed, it will aggravate it. This is what the Government is doing; it will place the man on the low income in a worse position comparatively than he is at present. If the Government had genuinely wished to make a more equitable distribution of the tax burden over the whole field of taxpayers it should not have stopped at the taxable income of $32,000 where the reductions phased out. The Government should have continued on from there by gradually increasing the tax up to a taxable income level of $100,000. It is not only between $1,000 and $30,000 where the tax is inequitable; this extends right to the top. Surely this has not been corrected by simply leaving a man on an income of $50,000, for example, at the same rate of tax and then reducing the man on only $1,000 by $5.33. However, I would like to return to the so called substantial reductions to which the Treasurer has referred. Let us take, for instance, a man with a wife and 2 children who is completely unskilled and therefore can accept work only of a labouring nature. That man will attract only the minimum wage. Therefore, if he is fortunate, he can expect at best to be paid only $40 a week or $2,080 a year. According to the statistics there are some H million taxpayers whose actual incomes do not exceed $2,000. Therefore the person I refer to would not be a rarity. His allowable deductions from his total income for a wife and 2 children plus perhaps medical and hospital contributions and such things could amount to $780. This man would finish up with a taxable income of $1,300. It is people in circumstances such as this who require relief. Yet this Government, although the Treasurer claimed that he would grant substantial reductions, will allow those people a tax relief of only $9.22 and will still require tbem to pay $85.79 in tax. To pursue the scale further, we find that if the taxable income were $1,400 the 22702/70-R-[74 ] relief would be $10.66, leaving an amount of $98.91 still to pay. If the taxable income were $1,500, the reduction in tax would be only $12.30, leaving $113.57 to pay. If we go to the scales below $1,300 we find that on a taxable income of $1,200 the reduction would be only $7.79. At $1,000 the relief would be $5.33 with $54.83 still to pay. So it comes down to the position where, as I said earlier, a person with a taxable income of $500 will be granted only 82c relief. Certainly I could not accept amounts like 82c or $7.79 or $5.33 or even $10.66 as being substantial reductions. Of course, we must not forget that the Government has increased by 2.5 per cent the sales tax on a considerable number of items and household articles and, as a result, any small saving in income tax will be seriously depleted by the necessity to pay extra sales tax. As a matter of fact, many of those people on the bottom of the income scale will be in a much worse position than they are at the present time. For instance, the taxpayer who will save 82c in income tax would be better off if he continued to pay that 82c in income tax and was not obliged to pay any additional sales tax. At the other end of the scale we find that the person with a taxable income of $16,000-and I repeat a taxable income, not an actual income; the actual income would be nearer $18,000-wil l receive the maximum relief being granted, namely, $500.20. Where the taxable income is $14,000 the reduction in income tax will be $469.45, where it is $12,000 the reduction will be $438.70; and where it is $20,000 the reduction will be $418.20. So we could certainly agree that the relief to be granted in those areas of high taxable income is substantial. But at the other end of the scale, in the low income area, I would suggest that the relief could be better described as being very meagre, and it is in those areas that we really see the unequal severity of income tax. The Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) a short time ago, when speaking about the effect which the increases in sales tax could have on people, is reported as having said that a person after paying income tax has"" a certain amount left which he can spend as he sees fit and that if he spends it on articles which carry sales tax, then that is his own decision. I was interested to bear the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Garland) echo those words, but he went even further. He suggested that the field of sales tax-the field of indirect tax-shoul d be extended still further. Apparently this is something that the people of this country can look forward to if this Government is allowed to remain in office. That is a very generous attitude for the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Curtin to adopt. They say that a person can spend how he likes what is his own. But let us sec what some of these people will have left for. themselves after paying income on the present scale and on the proposed scale. Let us see also what these'so called substantial income tax reductions will mean to their spending power. The man to whom I referred who earns $40 per week and finishes up with a taxable income of $1,300 has an amount of $38.17 a week left, after paying tax under the present scale. Do not let us forget that he has a wife and 2 children to keep. After these so called substantial reductions come into operation be will have $38.35 to spend as he sees fit, which is an extra 18c a week. If he splits that up amongst his family, including himself, each member uf the family will have an extra 4ic a week, which is not enough to buy anything-no t even an icecream. If the taxable income were $1,500 the reductions to be granted would give each member of the family an extra 6c a week. If the taxable income were $2,000, each member of the family would receive an extra lOic a week. If the taxable income were $2,500, which would mean that the man was earning more than $60 a week, the proposed tax reductions would give each member of his family the colossal increased spending power of 16c a week or. to put it another way, the taxpayer could lash out and spend an extra 16c a week on each of his dependants. So if we take those in the very lowest income bracket and those who receive up to $60-odd a week, which takes in approximately 3i million taxpayers out of a total of 5 million taxpayers, the relief which they are to receive from the Government's proposals will not mean much with regard to their purchases, whether they carry sales tax or not. The fact is that the Government's decision to increase sales tax will gather in the amount to be granted in the proposed reductions in income tax in many cases, and as a matter of fact in some cases the amount granted by way of relief in income tax will not be suflicient to meet the increases in sales tax. One of the most inequitable features, as J see it, in the present method of arriving at the amounts of income tax to be paid by the individual is that a taxpayer with a very large income enjoys a much greater tax reduction for permissible deductions, such as dependants, than does a taxpayer with a middle or a small income. I could tax never understand why the wife and child, say, of one taxpayer should attract a much higher, or, if you look at it another way. a much lower tax reduction than does the wife and child of another taxpayer. But of course they do, and will continue to do so while the permissible deduction is from income and not from the lax itself. The same thing applies, of course, to other permissible deductions, such as deductions for medical and hospital contributions or expenses. For one taxpayer a $100 hospital account can bring an income tax reduction of $50, while for another taxpayer-on e on a very low income who really requires tax relief-a n account of exactly the same amount may attract a reduction in income tax of only $5. The same thing applies with regard to education allowances and to every type of permissible deduction. The taxpayers on very high incomes derive a greater benefit than do those on low incomes. The Government's proposal regarding this new tax scale will make the difference even more pronounced, as 1 will explain now. I take, for instance, a taxpayer who has a wife and 3 children. He is allowed a reduction in his taxable income amounting to $988-for quick reckoning and convenience I wil! call it $1,000. Therefore, if that taxpayer's actual income were $3,000, his taxable income, after deducting dependents' allowances, would be $2,080. Under the present tax rates those dependants, so far as income tax is concerned, have a value to the taxpayer of $244.97: that is, his income tax would be reduced by that amount. Under the proposed rating the value of those dependants so far as income tax is concerned will be reduced to Si96.08, which is a difference or a reduction of $24.39. If that same taxpayer had an actual income of $6,000, under the existing rating his dependants would have a tax value of $404.47. but under the new system their tax value will be $363.88. which is a reduction of $40.59. If his taxable income were $10,000, under the proposed rating the tax value of his dependants will be reduced by $53.50. It may be suggested that this is a correction in relation to the difference in the tax value of dependants of high and low income earners. But if we take a man who has a taxable income of $13,000 up to and including a taxable income of $16,000. the reduction in value of his dependants is $15.37 or $15.38, which is a smaller reduction than that which applies to the taxpaver whose taxable income is only $2,000. Up to that stage there will be a reduction in tax value of dependents, but if the taxpayer had an actual income of $17,000. then his dependants, on a $1,000 allowable deduction, would have a value, so far as income tax was. concerned, of $619.10 under the existing scale but a value of $639.60 under the proposed scale, which is an increase in value of $20.50. That same increase continues up to a taxable income of $20,000. which is as far as I went. So under the present rating a $1,000 reduction in taxable income would give a taxpayer with an actual income of $2,000 a reduction in tax amounting to $162.98. while for a person with an actual income of $20,000 the reduction would be $619.10. But under the proposed rates the man who has an actual income of $2,000 will receive a tax reduction of $146.58, if his taxable deductions are $1,000, while, as I said earlier, the taxpayer whose actual income is $20,000 will receive a reduction ol $639.60. This simply means that so far as permissible deductions are concerned, the taxpayer who has an actual income of $20,000 has improved his position over those people on low incomes. Each $1 of allowable deduction has increased in tax value for the taxpayer who has actual income of $20,000, while for those on lower incomes it has reduced in value. The whole method of allowing permissible amounts to be deducted from actual income rather than fixing an amount to be deducted from the tax itself favours those on large incomes and acts against those in the low income group. This is clearly demonstrable with regard to the $1,200 which can be claimed on a life ""assurance policy. Now, the effect of that deduction is that if a man with an actual income of $3,000 took out the permissible maximum assurance of $1,200-it is not likely that he would because he could not afford to do so; but if he did-it would mean that, in effect, he actually pays $944 for the insurance. But if a man with an actual income of $20,000 took out that insurance, his taxation reduction would mean that, in effect, his insurance cost him only $353 or thereabouts. In other words? the man on the high income obtains the same amount of insurance cover but at a cost which is approximately $590 less per year than what the man on the low income has to pay. I cannot see anything equitable about that state of affairs-that' s for sure! I say in conclusion that if this Bill or this proposal is any indication of the attitude of the Government, it shows very little if any concern for those people on low incomes and it is quite obvious that a great deal more work is required if the Government really wishes to bring about an equitable situation.",52

105,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES,"Lilley) (8.42The Opposition has moved an amendment to this Bill. The words in the amendment are extremely significant. The Opposition proposes that: the Bill be withdrawn and redrafted because whilst it reduces rates of taxation it does so in a regressive manner. A Budget has been passed by the House. It is a Budget which has a great deal of significance for the country in a broad way and which has a great deal of significance for a lot of individuals in the country. There are some individuals who are advantaged financially as a result of this Budget. There are some who are not. But let it be perfectly clear that the principal duty of a budget is to assure a high rate of economic growth in a country. If it does not do that within the constraints that a budget has, it is a failure. That is the first duty of a budget. Bearing all of that in mind and bearing in mind what the economic growth is, the Opposition suggests that this cornerstone of the Budget should be withdrawn and re-drafted. Having considered the significance of that strategy of the Opposition, we look now at the other words in the amendment. The Opposition proposes that the Bill should be withdrawn and re-drafted: . . . because whilst it reduces rates of taxation it does so in a regressive manner. Now, the Opposition has not understood what 'regressive' means. What does 'regressive' mean? A regressive tax is a tax which falls unequally on those with high or with low resources at their command. Some taxes are regressive because in fact they fall more heavily on those with lower income or less resources than on those with higher income or more resources. Some indirect taxes of their nature are in this way. But this is an income tax measure. This measure does not fall more heavily on those with less income than on those with more income. So, what does 'regressive' mean in the words that the Opposition has chosen? Does it mean, perhaps, that this income tax measure is regressive with respect to economic growth? The Opposition has never made that case. It has not mentioned the word",55
106,Mr FOSTER,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES,"What is the economic growth of the bloke on the' minimum wage, mate? Where does that get him?",56
107,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES,"The honourable member for Sturt has illustrated over many years the principles of a minimum rate of growth, and he illustrates them tonight in his own stature. What does 'regressive' mean? With respect to welfare, is there less welfare distributed as a result of this Budget or as a result of this income tax measure than there was hitherto? That case has not been touched. Perhaps the Opposition meant rather to move an amendment to the effect that the income taxation measures are not as progressive as it would like them to be. The difference between the 2 is a world. But it is a difference which, I would suggest, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) did not touch upon in his contribution this afternoon. It is a difference which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Collard) has not touched upon. It is a difference which, I would hope, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Connor) may touch upon when he follows me in this debate. We must look at the requirements of an income tax system. After alt, this is what we are dealing with. What are the requirements of an income tax system? We can go to the Canadian Royal Commission on taxation of 4 years ago. The Canadian Royal Commission on taxation made it perfectly clear that the first objective of the tax system was to maximise the growth of output. Unless the growth of output is maximised, a government has neither income taxation concessions to confer nor welfare to confer. But the Opposition has ignored this principle. Countries with low rates of growth have no welfare to confer. Do not members of the Opposition know that the problem with the British taxation system after the war was that insufficient incentive to the people subject to that taxation system was allowed and while the British Government devoted itself to welfare in the years immediately after the Second World War, British growth was retarded right throughout the 1950s because that principle was forgotten. That can be well substantiated, but the Opposition has ignored this principle. It simply means that, in a sense, one has to be concerned with the vertical redistribution of taxation as between income groups. It means that different income groups are to make their appropriate contribution to a country's progress and to a country's economic growth. The vertical principles of taxation, as tliey apply to the income tax measures now before the House, are fair. They are adequate. More measure is made in order to draw distinctions between people at different income levels in relation to their contributions to Australian welfare than occurs in almost any other country in the world. It is no use talking about welfare on its own. We talk about nothing if we talk about welfare on its own. For example, we have the Australian Labor Party platform on taxation. It has one. It is an extremely minute document as well I would expect it to be. Tn the Australian Labor Party platform on tax, the Australian Labor Party never mentions these most basic principles that must animate any taxation system, I refer lo the Platform, Constitution and Rules of the Australian Labor Party. I turn to page 11, section V headed 'Economic Planning'. Reference is made in paragraph 3 to 'The pattern of taxation and deductions to be reviewed"". The Labor Party then mentions 6 items. Nowhere does it mention the most important and most central item of any taxation system. Welfare cannot be administered in a vacuum. But the Opposition would seek to do so. Need I remind Opposition members, after all, that other Labor governmentsthe British Labor Government and the Australian Opposition when it was in poweradministered taxation but they did not administer it so as to assume maximum growth. They administered it on the principle that all that can be obtained from the people is taken, incentive is reduced and something is re-distributed on the claw back principle. But there are those who are subject to these matters. It does not do a country any good for itself to be subject to them. While I am dealing with the different rates of taxation let me refer for a moment to the contribution made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I was intrigued that, having regard to incentive, he paid such attention to the fact that only 71,000 taxpayers in this country had an - actual income of $10,000 or more. One could hear the regret creep into his voice, the thought that maybe no concessions ought to have been given to these people or that the concessions ought to have been far less than they were. There we see once again the disincentive that so animates the Opposition when it is concerned with matters of taxation. Honourable members opposite ought to know that unless there are some inequalities in income or in resources a nation just does not go ahead. No country in the world which has sought to equalise resources and income completely as between people, has progressed. It is due to a basic misunderstanding of social justice that the Opposition would seek to do this. There is a great difference between social justice, as it is administered to people, and forced equalisation. It just does not operate' in the facts of life and in the real world. Let us go a little further. What are the great disincentive effects that apply to taxation? Let us look again at the Canadian Royal Commission on Taxation. The Commission makes it perfectly clear that to have too high a rate of taxation imposed on those on incomes above the average applies a disincentive effect that disadvantages all. It refers to this time and time again throughout its reports. The Commission said: . . . we are convinced that high marginal personal rates of tax do have a negative effect on labour, managerial and professional effort. This applies to the country which has so often been held up by the Opposition as the exemplar for Australia to follow. A strange silence creeps over the Opposition. Let us go a little further. What are the disincentive effects that apply to taxation? The honourable member for Melbourne Ports attempted to give example to them when he quoted the case of a worker in 1954-55 on an income of $1,700 who would be paying a rate of marginal taxation of 17.6 per cent. In 1968-69, presuming his money income had doubled to $3,400, he would be paying a marginal rate of income tax of 29.5 per cent. Somehow that was taken to illustrate the principle that taxation has got out of hand. The honourable member knows as well as I do that it is not quite as simple as that. Over those years the increase in personal income taxation that has accrued to the Commonwealth Government has come from two or three sources. This was well set out by Professor Percy Harris, formerly of the University of Queensland and now of the University of Townsville. The first source is the increased number of taxpayers. The second is the rise in money income. The third is the increased real severity of taxation. They are the 3 ingredients of the increased taxation that comes to the Commonwealth Government. Therefore it simply means that if taxation is to be altered or reduced, if some regard is to be had for the severity of taxation, the measures can only be applied at the third level where there is a measure of the real severity of taxation. It is interesting to note that Professor Harris, carrying the figures up to 1965-66- I have carried them on a couple of years later-demonstrate s that only 29 per cent to 30 per cent of the increase in taxation accruing to the Government comes from an increase in the real severity of taxation. His calculations are extremely complicated, but they do have some merit. It simply means that if welfare is to be administered with respect to taxation, if taxation is to be reduced-and this has been the welfare programme of the Government-on e can apply oneself only to the 29 or 30 per cent of the increase to which I have referred. This is what the Government has done. Mr Crean-You ought to look where it falls, and. that is what you have not done.",56
108,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES,"B y making 3 different grades of taxation an attempt has been made to alter the areas where the taxation falls. Honourable members opposite might argue that more steps, should have been introduced in the taxation scale. That could well be. We are on a never ending scale here. It is like unemployment. You can never introduce sufficient steps to apply in vertical redistribution. You can never have unemployment sufficiently low to satisfy. Let it also be perfectly clear that there are more steps with respect to different income levels in the Australian taxation system than apply in almost any other country. Mr Crean-There are far too many,",58
109,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES,"The more steps there are the more differences you create between people of different income groups; the more vertical equity is observed. The Opposition has been making a case tonight that sufficient account has not been taken of the differences between income groups. It says there have been overall reductions in taxation applying over too wide a range. Now the honourable member for Melbourne Ports seems to contradict the basis on which so many of his confreres have been arguing tonight. Let me go a little further with respect to the taxation system in Australia. Is it unfair? We ask ourselves the question: What proportion of the total taxation and at what average rates of taxation do the majority of taxpayers operate, compared with the income taxation system, say, in the United States, the United Kingdom or any other country? Insofar as one can glean some data from the United Nations bulletins-the y go up to only the year 1967, which I think corresponds to our financial year 1967-68-it is perfectly clear that Australia has a fairer system than, for example, the United States. Let us apply our thoughts to nearly 60 per cent of those who pay taxation. They contribute the major bulk of the taxation. The average rate of taxation applying to those people a couple of years ago has changed in a rather progressive manner since then, but this comparison would be appropriate. In Australia the tax for that group was at a marginal rate ranging from 12 per cent to 27 per cent and the average rate was from 5 per cent to 15 per cent. In the United States the marginal rates for the bulk of taxpayers contributing the bulk of United States taxation were not L2 per cent to 27 per cent, as in Australia, but were rather 25 per cent to 37 per cent. Their average rates were not 5 per cent to 15 per cent as in this country. Rather they were 18 per cent to 24 per cent. That gives an idea of the sources that are contributing the major bulk of the taxation which accrues to the Commonwealth Government. That is the way in which one has to judge whether a taxation system is fair or whether it is appropriate. 1I have tried to indicate tonight what are some of the basic principles which have to animate any taxation system. The major one is still that it must ensure adequate economic growth. The second major principle that has to apply once that has been satisfied is that there should be appropriate redistribution. There could always be more redistribution, but the redistribution within this country is not bad. Even if one examines the state of poverty in thi.s country, which is a measure of the redistribution of resources, one finds that poverty here is still one of the lowest levels in the world. For example, in the United Kingdom under the Labor Government it was found that between 11 per cent and 14 per cent of households were at poverty level and it increased during the period that the Labor Government-the Democratic Socialists-ha d power. In the United States, where admittedly there is a great negro problem with respect to those in proverty, between 18 per cent and 19 per cent of households are living at poverty level. In Australia, even on the worse estimates, it is between 7 per cent and 8 per cent. It is still too high but it is .not a bad effort. People should not knock this country all the time. Seven per cent to 8 per cent is too high but it is still one of the best levels of poverty in any part of the world. 1 suggest honourable members watch the level of poverty among different groups increase In South Australia while our friends have power in that State. The last time they were in power they were responsible for increasing the unemployment rate in South Australia by more than it had been increased in 2 decades.",58
110,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES,Mr Cope)OTder! I ask the honourable gentleman to address the Chair.,59
111,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES,"I was under some provocation which on this occasion was understandable. We look .at the taxation system for what it is supposed to do, not what it cannot do. The Opposition has only one principle-it socks .everybody at high and low. income levels, it tries to claw back from those people, distribute it elsewhere and in fact commit the errors of the British Labour Government when it was in power for many years. What makes me so disturbed when I hear the Opposition speak of these things is that it does not seem to have learned anything from the British Chancellors of the Exchequer in the years 1946 to 1949 and in latter years. I would suggest with respect to the Opposition's platform that the Opposition should write some basic principles into the taxation system which it says it would restructure. If it did write some basic principles into the system and followed them it would find they would lead to very different results and very different judgments from those that have been proposed in this House tonight by the shadow Treasurer and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. We have to wait to hear what is proposed by the honourable member for Cunningham.",59
112,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,59
113,Mr CONNOR,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES,"The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) begs the question when he asks what is a regressive tax. A regressive tax the usual glossary of economic terms is simply one whose incidence does not bear any relationship to ability to pay. If he wants an example of it I think I can convince him on that point at least, incorrigible though he may be. The Government has brought about the growing burden of income tax by not increasing tax rates but by the simple expedient of maintaining a tax schedule constant in the face of continually higher money incomes and by generally refusing to adjust allowable deductions in line with those increased incomes. This Government specialises in indirect taxation. The classic illustration would be the fact that it collects some $1,600m a year by way of sales tax and excise duty on beer, petrol, cigarettes and tobacco and at the same time in terms of company taxation it collects only $l,100m per year. In other words the individual consumerthe man in the street-pay s 50 per cent more than all the major companies of Australia put together. That is another form of regressive taxation. The effects of the Government's inaction have been quite astonishing.' The current tax schedule has remained unchanged since 1954-55 except for the addition of a further 2.5 per cent levy and some increase of the amount that can be earned before incurring income tax. Since that time, however, money incomes have been substantially increased as is shown by the fact that the 1968-69 average weekly earnings have risen by 100 per cent and the average wage rate by 70 per cent. Inevitably, therefore, wage and salary earners have moved continually into higher tax brackets with the result that their income tax burden has been increasingly severe; that is, the percentage of their income which has been taken in tax has been continually getting higher which means that more and more of their working time has been spent labouring for the Commonwealth. At the present level of average weekly earnings the tax burden has increased to the extent that whereas in 1954-55 income tax amounted to 5 weeks pay for the average worker it has now increased to 9.2 weeks. As a result of the current Budget, as I propose to show, it will be a week in addition to that now taking it over the 10 weeks mark per year. However, the increase in the tax burden has been uniform for all taxpayers. Deplorably the in increase in the tax burden has not been inversely correlated to income so. that the lowest income earners have their tax obligations increased at the greatest rate and the highest income earners have had the lowest such increase. For example, in the period 1954-55 to 1968-69, during which average weekly earnings doubled, a man on $1,500 net taxable income in 1954-55 and whose income kept pace with average weekly earnings woulcl have had his tax increased by 277 per cent; That is his income went up 100 per cent and his tax up 277 per cent-2 i times the rate of increase in his salary. On a net taxable income of $6,000 per year which increased to $12,000 over the same period the tax increase would be 206 per cent while the man on $16,000 whose income increased to $32,000 would have seen his tax increase by a comparatively low 153 per cent. In other words, for the lowest tax group there was an increase in taxation over the 14 year period of 277 per cent; fbr the tall poppy only 153 per cent. This Government, of course, has a vested fiscal interest in inflation. There was quite a neat little footnote in statement 4 attached to the Budget Speech which stated that in 1969-70 the Government's domestic transactions appeared- a masterpiece of understatement-to have subtracted about $500m from liquidity. In his Budget Speech the Treasurer (Mr Bury) said: Within this overall result there would on sent figuring be surplus of domestic receipts over domestic expenditure of the order of $550m which would be about $50m greater than actual domestic surplus in 1969-70. Quite an achievement. We hear the argupayers ment raised from time to time: Where the money coming from to make concesporated sions? This is where the money can come from and this is where some real relief be given to the average wage and salary earner especially those in the net taxable income group below $5,000 per year. How much, I might reasonably ask, is left of the 10 per cent reduction that the Governlosers ment proposes to give in view of anticipagroup tory price rises which have been current since the Budget was introduced and prior to any relief that will operate, I assume from lst October. At the same time the for Government can very conveniently make a its sales tax retrospective in its incidence I Sth August last. It is truly said that a married man gives hostages to fortune. Today the average budget in the form that is presented nothing more than an annual swindle sheet. The Treasurer maintains a straighl face when he says there is actuaUy a surplus of $4m. In point of fact there has been surplus, as has already been admitted, $550m, plus the $4m that has been stated as the official figure. Let us have a look at the real impact of this celebrated 10 per cent reduction. Let us take the year 1968-69 when the total pay-as-you-earn tax and other tax on men with annual incomes-businessmen , farmers and the like-wa s $2,379m. In that year the total income tax received was $2,379m. For the nnancial year 1969-70 there was an increase of $478m. The Government is giving back $280m of that amount. It still has up its sleeve nearly $200m of the increase for the last year. To compound the offence we find that for the current year the Government intends to take $3,035m by way of taxation from those people receiving an annual income or those who pay as they earn. This is an increase of a further $178m. With one hand the Government gives but with the other hand it takes back even more. But even worse than that we have the position of indirect taxation, the increase in sales tax and all the other increases which were adequately dealt with by honourable members who have already spoken prein this debate. In point of fact, as is set out in the speech made by the Leader of the the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) on the Budget, no less than 92 per cent of all taxare losers. The document which the is Leader of the Opposition had incorin Hansard shows that as a result of indirect taxation no person in receipt of can a net taxable income of less than §5,000 per year will in any way benefit from this Budget. Further, 80 per cent of the 3 i million children in Australia who are supported by the wage and salary earners are because they are maintained by the with net taxable incomes of less than $5,000 per year. And what is even worse is that this Government in its paltriness has not increased child endowment the first child since 1949. It is still 50c week. It is also still $1 per week for the to second child, as it was in 1949. In other matters, such as allowances for fares or the cost involved in the running of a motor car from a man's place of resiis dence to his place of employment, this Government has persistendy over the years refused to give the slightest taxation concession. There are 2 ways of looking at a these matters. It is not merely a matter of of what the man gets in the pay packet. It is a matter of what it will, in effect, buy. We have today as we have never had before rampant inflation soaring to an astronomical level. But this Government is not prepared to do anything about this. As to the fairness of the incidence of taxation let look at the position of a man with a wife and 2 children and let us take an average net taxable income of $2,000 per year. The nominal concessional deduction for that man and his family is $676. Actually with an income tax rate of 21c in the $1 he has an annual reduction of $146 in the income tax which he must pay. In the case of a man with a wife and 2 children who is in receipt of $3,000 per year the concesbank. sion is worth $329 per annum. In other words, the more a person earns and the less he needs the more benefit he will get from this Government. What we really need is a reverse tapered concessional deduction for a man with a wife and family. This Government is not prepared to do this. This is one of the disincentives in a country which must increasingly turn to its export income from secondary industry as primary industry declines. No honourable member will gainsay me on that tonight. We need to get the maximum production. But today the average worker is convinced that to get further wage increases without some protection by way of stabilising prices, is an exercise in futility. We have the spectacle where even a major retail chain store such as Woolworths Ltd is not prepared to accept goods because of the rorts- a good Australian term-bein g worked in respect to price fixation. I can go back to the remarks of the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Snedden) when he was recently addressing a gathering of people. Even be, of all people, had to rebuke manufacturers for the exorbitant price increases they were imposing and which bad no relationship to increased costs. In Tasmania last week there was a rebuke delivered by the Attorney-General (Mr Hughes) in respect of the Trade Practices Act. What is this Government prepared to do? Precisely nothing. Even before the pensioners received their 50c increase which was operative from 1st October they, had already lost it. It has again been taken from them in price rises. Whenever there is a further concession suggested by way of income tax deduction, whenever there is a suggestion of some increase in social services for those who need them so desperately, the Government asks: 'Where is the money to come from?' Let us have a look at the operations of us this Government and what it is doing. Let us look at the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve which was set up in 1955 by an Act of Parliament with a view to repurchasing or redeeming for cancellation securities which represent portion of public debt to the Commonwealth. Moneys to the credit of the reserve may be invested in securities of, or guaranteed by, the Commonwealth or on deposit at any Last year the Commonwealth actually tucked away $618m in mat reserve. I draw the attention of honourable members to an article by no less a person than a former New South Wales Auditor-General, Mr W. J. Campbell, published in the 'Bulletin' in 1967. He said that today there is a pointed contrast in revenue and capital financing practice between the Commonwealth and the States. While I do not want to digress into the financial relationship between the 2 tiers of government 1 want to make this point: There has been socked away in cash payments for the Snowy Mountains Authority a little nest egg of over $8Q0m. There is an amount, of $400m in the Nalional Welfare Fund. Cash was paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. There is an amount still due to the Commonwealth of $904m from war service homes loans advances, in fact the position has been reached where Mr Campbell ventures to say that the Commonwealth, in all probability, is holding most of its own bonds. What a miraculous result. What fantastic financing. Where is the money to come from? It is being deliberately extracted from the taxpayers, loaned out at interest rates to the States and in the process the Government keeps a straight face. I. wonder what an auditor would say. I wonder what the Security Exchange Commission in the United States of America would say to practices of that nature in respect to US corporations. Some of the people involved would be behind bars. Sir, is this to continue? Are the people - the ordinary working people-to be denied their rights because there is no form of price control for the benefit of the consumer today although there is rampant negative price control in Australia? It consists of price control by monopolies. This country is hag-ridden by monopolies. It is hag-ridden by 200 companies. Four of the major companies virtually control the economy of this country and they decide the prices. These companies can put up the price of steel or can fix the price on thing they wish. There is nothing that this Government can do about it. The Government introduced the Trade Practices Act which also is an exercise in futility and which has been adopted by only one State. Unless we can get price control associated with wage fixation this country will continue to go along, the steep and narrow path to destruction by utter and unrestrained inflation.",59
114,Mr FOSTER,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES,"It was not my intention to speak in this debate but I must make the observation for those who perhaps have not realised it that there is not one single Liberal Party member, outside of the Minister at the table, in the House tonight. I am sorry, the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Holten) who is at the table is a member of the Country Party but the Minister for Immigration (Mr Lynch) was previously at the table and I thought he was in the House. I would not want to be accused of misrepresenting the Minister who is now at the table. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles), who is now trying to interject, can sit down. I have listened to some stupid comments from honourable members who should be better qualified than I am.",62
115,Mr GILES,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES,They are.,62
116,Mr FOSTER,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES,"You can put your money where your mouth is frequently in respect of your electorate which is suffering from increased taxation. The fact is that members from the Government side continually attempt to criticise Opposition members for their contributions to this debate which, I might mention, the Opposition, in the main, has had to carry throughout this day and yesterday when we were discussing other financial measures. There have been occasions when not one member from the Government side has risen to speak in support of the Bills-mar k you, not one member. And the honourable member for Angas fell into that category until we came to consider the wine excise.",62
117,Mr GILES,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My point is that this is a deliberate misrepresentation of the truth. The honourable members for Lilley and Curtin have both been on their feet.",62

119,Mr FOSTER,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES,"I repeat, the honourable member for Angas never rose to his feet until the wine tax measure was being discussed. He has seen fit to wander through his electorate during the last few weeks attempting to hoodwink his constituents by saying that he would take some decisive action on their behalf regarding the implementation of the wine tax. It was only the contribution of my good friend and colleague, the honourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun) which dragged him to his feet in the debate yesterday.",62
120,Mr GILES,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES,"A point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. My point of order is that I was on my feet in that debate before the honourable member for Kingston. I would ask that the honourable member for Sturt be accurate for a change in his remarks.",62
121,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES,Order ! There is no point of order.,62
122,Mr FOSTER,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES,"The honourable member is pointing. Tonight we have heard a deal of mention about economic growth. Where is the Government's policy on economic growth which is going to benefit those vast numbers of people in the community in the various States and Territories who enjoy no more than the base rate? Where is the Government's taxation relief to those people with families? Did it increase child endowment? Did it, in looking at the overall situation, decide, no doubt after rejecting the pleas of the Mmister for Social Services (Mr Wentworth) that the Government should do more than increase pensions by 50c, to embark on a programme that will do nothing to relieve the burden of the lower income earner? Did it decide this in the light of what is happening today with applications for wage increases? The Government has a system of taxation which derives taxation from age pensioners. This evening we heard the hypocrisy of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) when, in speaking to a taxation measure, he had the hide and temerity to say that to have 7 per cent or 8 per cent of Australians below the poverty line should be accepted, even though it involves 1 million people. It is utter and absolute disgrace that any member of this House should condone our economic structure and talk of economic growth while there are 1 million people living in- poverty. In speaking to a taxation measure and trying to condone poverty in Australia he tried to draw a comparison between the United States of America and Australia. .He said that in America it is less fortunates wbo have to put up.with such a policy. He went so low, in my opinion, as to mention the Negro population in the United States. Mr Lynch-He was not justifying any degree of poverty.",62
123,Mr FOSTER,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES,"The Minisler interjects, but I would say definitely that the remarks of the honourable member for Lilley-and the Minister can read tbem in Hansard tomorrow-were clear. His very words, if I may quote them, were: 'That is not a batt average'. It is an indictment of this Government that 1 million people in Australia live in poverty. For a member of the Government to say that that is not a bad average is an indictment of that honourable member and, because of the esteem in which he is held by the Government, it is an indictment of the Government. Fpr the honourable member for Lilley wages is a dirty word and profits, of course, is the golden, magic word. This fetches me to the question of what the Government has done about tax evasion in Australia, lt has paid lip service to it over the years, but what has it done about tax evasion? Where are the possibilities for wage and salary earners evading taxation? The wage earner has to rely on his memory in filling out his income tax form. in the hope of getting some concessional allowance for his children of educational age, but there is a battery of clerks, computers and God knows what in the Taxation Branch trying to whittle him down for every lc he may have claimed in excess of what he is allowed to claim. However, this is not so with big business. Big business can evade taxation by taking other companies' losses. This Government does nothing about that whatever - to the boards of directors and the tall I notice that the honourable member for Lilley bas returned to the chamber and is in earnest conversation with one of his colleagues. This evening, when referring to some rise in unemployment figures in an South Australia, because there is a different government in power there to what he thinks should be in power, he had the hide and temerity-in fact, I should say. and be must accept this fact unparliamentary though it may be, that perhaps he did not lie but he most certainly stretched the meaning of the word 'ambiguity'-to defend his Government's the actions earlier in increasing taxation on motor vehicle sales tax from 25 per cent to 33 per cent when it put the motor industry in South Australia on the breadline. The Government has not been game enough ta impose such a Steep increase on taxation which affects the motor vehicle industry and the general manufacturing area since then. However, it is bail enough that it has increased it by 21 per cent in the present Budget. Did not the honourable member for Lilley, his Government, his colleagues, his cohorts, call them what we will, realise that an increase such as that which they imposed on the earlier occasion on the manufacturing industry in South Australia was going to have the repercussions that it did have? Of course the imposition had repercussions and because today in South Australia there is a government of a different political climate to the Commonwealth Government, the Government is up to its old tricks. However, it was not game enough to attack that industry to such aa extent as it did before. Let us consider what can happen to the wage and salary earners and to those who are more privileged because of this Government's actions. Has the Government ever given any consideration to the shift worker who works in the automobile industry and who perhaps resides in an area where there is no public transport available and who has to use his own vehicle? This situation applies to a lot of newcomers to Australia who have been brought here to work in the automobile industry. Has the Government considered allowing such people a taxation concession for travelling similar to that which is allowed to the upper strata poppies who sit in big buildings in Melbourne? Of course they are allowed a taxation deduction for the car that is supplied by the company and which is sometimes chauffeur driven. But for the worker at the lower end of the line the Government does nothing, and does not intend to do anything. The honourable member for Lilley has the hide to stand up here and talk about economic growth. I suggest that if he keeps talking like that, the halo that he thinks he has above his head may surround his neck. His values are completely astray and false. He says that the Government, by making certain grants to the States, is playing a magnificent role. Who does he think he is kidding? He is not kidding me, and I am not an economist. In some public departments in South Australia-and no doubt this is the same in every other State in the Commonwealth-for every $5m loaned by the Commonwealth Government it gets back almost an equivalent amount in interest charges. Is that right? So whom does the honourable member think he is fooling? I would like to quote from a publication that I have here. It states: In recent years there has been considerable trafficking in company losses. This has had the effect of enabling taxpayers to reduce their tax liability by transferring profitable businesses to companies which they have taken over with accumulated losses. Even the shareholding restriction on private companies is not effective, because original shareholders in such companies can be allowed to retain shares with 25 per cent of the voting power after the takeover, or they can be required to give an option to the acquiring shareholders to enable the latter to purchase the shares with the 25 per cent of voting power within 7 years. No doubt honourable members on the Government side have seen this document before. I knew of its existence. Within if are quoted ways and means for the upper strata to evade thousands of millions of dollars in taxation each year. But someone in the lower income bracket who mis-states his income or small business people who do not pay provisional taxation because of unforeseen circumstances that may arise in business from time to time are really given the axe. What right of appeal do they have? They have some rights of appeal within the structure of the Taxation Branch. I have written to the Taxation Branch in Adelaide on behalf of some people merely seeking an extension of time to pay the moneys that they owed to it. I made a plea in the case of one small businessman who as a result pf an accident was completely and totally blinded. Was any humanitarian treatment accorded to this individual? Of course not. Mr Robinson-Spea k up. We cannot hear you",63
124,Mr FOSTER,APPROXIMATE DIVISION INTO DECTILES,"A member of the Country Party says that I ought to speak up because members of the Country Party cannot hear me. They did not have the courage yesterday to go out and let some of their constituents hear them in front of Parliament House. Members of the Country Party have been standing up in this chamber from time to time since I have been here bellowing, bleating, bawling, moaning, groaning and adopting all sorts of attitudes in an endeavour to have the farmer let off the hook in all fields of taxation, to have his telephone connected to a more modern type of exchange and all sorts of other things. I agree with the honourable member who preceded me in this debate tonight. This Government is not even prepared to glance at the matter of price control any more than it is prepared to look at profit control. During the Government's term of office the number of companies that control the welfare and the destiny of millions of people the has fallen remarkably. The Minister for Immigration, who is sitting at the table, may be making, a rough note that the small businesses make up the number. But I am speaking in terms of big employers. What are they paying towards the development of this country by way of taxation compared with what the smaller people pay? This Government, by means of taxation and by manipulating certain funds, is denying benefits to aged people who have paid a tax all their working lives. They will not receive one penny from the Government unless they are almost destitute. Honourable members opposite can talk about the Government's means test as much as they like. They can moan and groan. In comparison with what the company director has at hisfingertipson his retirement and the perks and the lurks he has, the battler has become almost destitute. Honourable members opposite should turn their minds to that matter instead of making stupid comparisons, as the honourable member for Lilley did tonight, between 1949 and 1970 and complaining about a previous Labor Government. Let me say, almost in conclusion, that during the term of office of the last Labor Government, when we were fighting a war, we did not have to go into the area of overseas finance to the extent that this Government has in peace time. Honourable members opposite will not deny that, nor can they do so. They ought not to be making comparisons between 1949 and 1970, because there can be no comparison, as I have endeavoured to point out. Motion (by Mr Giles) put: That the question be now put.

138,Mr STEWART,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY,"This Bill provides for an increase in licence fees for radio communications stations. The Bill is entitled 'A Bill for an Act to amend certain regulations under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905-1967'. The licence fees for these telecommunications stations have not been increased since 1924 when they were fixed at $2. Radio communications stations are graded into 5 categories-land , mobile, fixed, amateur and receiving. The licence fees for land and fixed stations are to be increased from $2 to $10; licence fees third time. - for mobile, amateur and receiving stations are to be increased from $2 to $6; but the $2 fee will continue to apply to stations operating as outpost services. The category of outpost services includes services associated Witb 'Schools of the Air', the Flying Doctor, aerial ambulance and those services in which a radio is the only means of public communication. The $2 fee will also continue to apply to mission stations in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea as well as to ambulance services and rural fire brigades. It appears to me that careful consideraChamberlain tion has been given to the breakdown of stations into the varying grades of fees. The Opposition acknowledges the strong arguments for the increases in the licence fees for these radio communications statance tions. As I have said, the fee of $2 been in operation since 1924. Until 1950 only 5,115 stations were in operation and the costs of technical supervision and administration were not a burden to Government. But since 1950 the number of stations has increased to 136,000 and a substantial number of extra stations is being added each year. The present annual deficit from this section to the Postmastersince General's Department is $800,000. This too much for the Department to carry. The new range of fees will return approximately $620,000 in 1970-71. This will still leave fairly large deficit of $180,000. The Opposition offers no objection the increases. I have received no criticism from any member of the public or any cultural member of an organisation which conducts one of these radio communication stations. No member of the Opposition has menassistance tioned to me that he has received any critibounty cism from any member of the public. The Opposition believes that the increases are in 1966. fair and just. I conclude by saying that it is the first time that the Government has shown such commendable patience before increasing a tax or charge. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill.

139,Dr PATTERSON,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY,"The Bill before the House is designed to provide additional assistance to the tractor industry in Australia, particularly to the two main manufacturers of tractors, Industries Pty Ltd and International Harvester Co. The objective of the bounty is to provide financial assistance on sales made of bountiable tractors on and from lst July 1970. The additional assiswill be given only in respect of trachas tors manufactured at premises registered under the Australian Tractors Bounty Act of 1966. This legislation has been introduced as an emergency nieasure to meet the what must be regarded as a crisis in Chamberlain Industries, in particular, and in International Harvester Co. of Victoria. This system of bounty payments has been in operation, 1 think from memory, 1922. It is in line with the classical is tariff or bounty arguments which are advanced, that assistance should be given to Australian industries to help them to bea come established and viable, particularly in the face of dumping or cut-throat comto petition from other countries. In 1966 the Tariff Board published a report on agritractors in Australia. In that tariff investigation various arguments were advanced for and against the giving of by way of tariff or by way of to assist the Australian industry. The same arguments apply today as applied At existing prices and without assistance the local tractor industry would be unable to compete effectively against exports made by the large volume producers, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. It is also argued that there is in Australia-and this must be recognised- a potential for the saving of overseas exchange if the local tractor industry is expanded. It also must be accepted-and this of course is behind the Government's reasoning in providing this additional bounty-that Australian manufacturers are at a cost disadvantage in respect of labour, materials, and other production costs because of the comparatively small number of tractor plants in Australia. It must be quite clear that the same principles regarding cost of production criteria apply to the agricultural machinery industry as apply to, say, the motor xar industry. Countries producing under mass production techniques have a decided cost advantage over smaller countries like Australia, particularly where there is fragmentamultiplier tion of factories. A further point is that decentralisation the Australian tractor industry justifies special consideration, and in this respect, Chamberlain Industries, which is located in Western Australia, is faced with serious transport costs in marketing its products in the eastern States of Australia; Australia being a relatively large country. Another argument is that imported tractors are at present supplying most of the Australian requirements and that increased tariffs would therefore impose a considerable cost burden on using industries, and particularly on primary producers. One of the arguments used here is: Why not put a tariff on imported tractors? Why provide a bounty? Of course, this can be explained by referring to the economic principles involved in a tariff as opposed to a bounty. It should be quite clear that a tariff on imported tractors would only cause an increase in the price of tractors in Australia, whereas a bounty, which is more appropriate in this case, would not have the same effect. I believe that that is the fundamental reason why the Government has in fact taken action to pay a bounty rather than impose a tariff. Of course, the Opposition agrees 100 per cent with this reasoning. One must examine very closely the reasons why the tractor industry in Australia is in trouble. I think this is the fundamental issue which we should be discussing tonight. We should be discussing not so much the machinery provisions which are used to provide the bounty, but really why the bounty is necessary. One must come to the conclusion that the critical condition of primary industries throughout Australia is now starting to affect seriously secondary industries located in the cities. I have been hammering in this House for many years the fact that city people have to realise that their economic prosperity is directly depen- dent on export income earned from the sale of rural products. It is quite apparent now that the lag in sales of rural products which has occurred over the last 3 years due to drought, low wool prices, problems in the wheat industry and other economic conditions, is now catching up in terms of the theory as it affects secondary industry or the supplying industries. I believe this is the first serious warning to the of Australian economy. Because primary industries are in a critical condition there has been a slackening in demand, and one has only to look at the White Paper which was presented with the Budget to realise this. Over the last 5 years there has been an actual decline in net farm income compared with a 40 per cent increase in income in secondary industry over the same period. When we consider that approximately 60 per cent of our export income is derived from products of primary industry, it is quite obvious that something has to go before very long. Of course, the first secondary industries which must go are those which are directly supplying primary producers, which is the area in which demand has fallen. For example, I refer to the agricultural machinery industry-the tractor industry, the equipment industryand to the chemical industry. The tractor and agricultural implement industries are in such a desperate position now that wholesale sackings are taking place in Australia. It is obvious that the Government has to go further than this bounty. Emergency Federal assistance in addition to this bounty will need to be granted or may need to be granted in the future if these Australian companies are to be kept viable. In addition to the agricultural tractor manufacturers I refer to those suppliers of component parts-the sub-contractors, we might say. Many of them are being bankrupted. We do not hear much of them. They are not major firms. They may only be supplying ballbearings, some part of a front end or whatever it may be. But these firms are in serious financial trouble also. Honourable members may like to refer to them as backyard firms. Perhaps the only sector of agriculture Australia today where stability exists in a major industry as far as maintaining demand for tractors and agricultural implements is concerned is the sugar industry. Our major export industries include the wheat industry, the wool industry and the dairy industry. The sugar industry is the only major industry today where stability of demand exists. In fact, a degree of prostractors perity is to be found in agricultural indusance tries in the rural sugar towns. Mr Chipp-Because of sound Government policies?",67
140,Dr PATTERSON,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY,"Because the sugar bounty industry is the best organised agricultural export industry in Australia today. The decision by Massey-Ferguson (Aust) Ltd tractors. to dismiss a large proportion of its work force in Victoria reveals the seriousness the problem. I am not attempting to make any emotive speech. These are facts. Mr O'Keefe-What percentage did it put off in Victoria? . Dr PATTERSON-It has put off 500 this men out of 2,500 employees. That is per cent. Those are official figures. Out a work force of 2.500, 500 men have dismissed. Those are the figures for one firm only. There is more to come. These .men are not necessarily all skilled workers; economy. but, nevertheless, most of them are men with families. This firm also has announced in the last 9 months a loss of $2m which is accumulating. The International Harvester tainly today Co. of Australia Pty Ltd in Geelong has been forced to sack 300 men. The proportion there is much higher. In addition to the serious decline in demand, Australian agricultural manufacturers have shown the Government that they are being hit by rising costs also. On the one hand, they have a slackening of demand caused by drought and other conditions in primary industry. They have creased costs of production. Against those Bill? factors, they have increasing pressures from overseas competitors through the importation of tractors and agricultural equipment. Because of rising costs, local firms are being placed at a serious disadvantage regarding competition with imported tractors. As I said before, the tariff in this instance is not the most satisfactory method in of protecting local manufacturers because such a measure must lead to a higher price being asked for Australian tractors. This is what we must guard against. If this means a higher price, a further slackening of demand for agricultural machinery and tractors in Australia will result. In such circumstances, bounties to a local manufacturer on production and on the sale of are more appropriate than assistby tariff duties. I congratulate the Government on making this bounty applicable to sales of tractors. Up to now the bounty has been applied to the production of tractors. This Bill provides for the to be paid on the sale of tractors. It is being applied of course in relation to the specific brake horsepower of individual The point that I wish to make and to of stress very strongly is that the serious financial position of agricultural machinery industries is the first major warning that secondary industries in the cities will be affected if the prolonged depressed state of primary industry continues. Indirectly, must affect other firms. For example, 20 the sacking of 300 men in Geelong will of affect their families and in turn will create been a slackening in demand with grocers, butchers, bakers or whoever the supplier may be. The effect spreads through the Imports are still running at record levels. But these imports must be financed. CerMr Chipp-Import s of what?",69
141,Dr PATTERSON,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY,Import s from overseas. Mr Chipp-But not of tractors?,69
142,Dr PATTERSON,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY,"No . I am talking about imports Mr Chipp-Wit h respect, what has this into do with the Agricultural Tractors Bounty",69
143,Dr PATTERSON,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY,"1 will show this. I am speaking about what has caused the slackening of demand. It is the critical condition of primary industry. Now, imports are running at record levels. These imports can be financed only by export income which is earned basically from primary industry,, minerals and secondary industry. Of these, primary industry is the major net contributor to export income. Any major failure in primary industry must lead to some counter device on imports with inevitable consequences of unemployment. We saw this happen in 1961. So, this is fundamental to the whole argument. This bounty is to assist an Australian agricultural industry and certainly an Australian agricultural manufacturing industry. But it is fundamental to the whole argument that the Government must take measures to make certain that primary industry, whether it be on the agricultural manufacturing side or on the production side, does not fail. If primary industry does fail as far as export income is concerned it must have adverse effects on secondary industry in general. Secondary industry is the main user of imports. The widespread economic stagnation in the rural sector which has shown no positive increase in the last 5 years is, as I before, in sharp contrast to the gross national product of the non-farm income which has shown an average increase of -8 per cent per annum over the last 5 years. In other words, a serious imbalance is starting to show itself now in the cities or, particularly, the provincial cities. That is all that J wish to say. The Opposition supports this measure. It is an emergency measure. Through no fault of their own, the International Harvester Co. and Chamberlain Industries Pty Ltd are in serious financial difficulties due on the one hand to a definite decrease in demand caused by thefinancialsituation in primary industry and on the other hand by rising costs. However I ask the Government to have a closer look at this whole problem because it is what we might call the warning. It is not only agricultural manufacturing industries which will be in trouble. Indirectly this condition will spread. As anyone in the country or in country towns knows, once the nucleus fails, the first people to be hurt are the farmers, then the workforce, tben the industry supplying the farmers and so it spreads indirectly through the community concerned. The same thing will happen with magnified effect in the cities if the chaotic conditions existing in primary industry and spreading through primary industry are not halted.",70
144,Mr GRASSBY,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY," I rise particularly to echo the sentiments put forward by the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) in relation to this measure. It has been said by the Government that this is a temporary additional bounty to local manufacturers currently producing bountiable tractors. The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr MCEwen) in his second reading speech described this bounty as an urgent short term measure, tie also indicated that the Government bad received from the 2 Australian manufacturers of tractors eligible for bounty evidence which indicated that the industry was facing serious damage from import competition. Of course, he a|so added that investigations carried out by the Government indicated that there had been a substantial downturn in total sales of agricultural tractors in Australia. Of course this was a recognition of the crisis which exists said in the countryside at the present time. It was an acknowledgment of the difficulties which are being experienced internally. While I support the measure, a question that bas to be posed to the Government tonight is whether it is satisfied that this measure will restore some stability to the Australian agricultural machinery industry. In view of the fact that it is a component of rural industry and that the crisis in the countryside has now spread to the cities, we should place it on record in this debate that the Australian agricultural machinery industry faces the retrenchment of 14,000 men this year as a result not only of imports but of the continuing rural crisis. In 1967-68 28,000 people were directly and indirectly employed in the agricultural machinery industry, together with 12,000 country dealers and representatives or distributors. It is estimated by the industry that in the currentfinancialyear only 9,000 will be left of the labour directly and indirectly employed, and that 7.000 dealers and their individual representatives may well be out of business. This is an incredible situation. We are looking at the possible demise of the Australian agricultural machinery industry against a background of history in which this industry led the world in so many directions. It led the world in its evolvement of new machine parts, new machines and new approaches. Yet if the present crisis is allowed to continue it could mean the complete extinction of the Australian controlled agricultural machinery industry. T say that with due weight and seriousness, because the components of the industry have said that they are feeling the weight of the crisis in the countryside and they are feeling the weight of interests that would be quite happy to take them over Australia exports neariv $8m worth of agricultural machinery. Australian production overall last year amounted to $131,808,000, but this year it will be cut by half. The contribution that agricultural machinery has made to agriculture generally may be gauged by the fact that the value of the machinery on our farms amounts to more than $400m. This gives an indication of the size and importance of an industry which today comprises 7 local manufacturing companies of major size- I stress thatand 8 overseas companies. They are the national figures. When one examines the machinery firms across the nation one finds, as I have found in one centre in the south west, a situation where there has been a firm which regularly has been the major factor in employment in that town. Its turnover has always been adequate to maintain a work force on which the town has relied to a major extent. Today its turnover is down by half and its work force is rationed as far as employment is concerned because of the situation and the crisis which exists in the countryside. The challenge to end the crisis in countryside is clear and urgent, as my league the honourable member for this Dawson has pointed out, not only in the interests of the countryside itself but in interests of city workers and city industries such as we are talking about at the present time. This opportunity must be taken by subject the Government. The Minister carries the burden tonight of showing whether he betime lieves that this measure is adequate to vent the extinction of an independent Ausmetaphorically tralian agricultural machinery industry. That is the issue before us at the present time, not just tractors and not just imports. I would enter a plea, on behalf of all those who are concerned, that the Government might now examine urgently the plight of Australia's agricultural machinery industry with a view to extending a further helping hand to prevent it being bought out by overseas interests. As 1 pointed out, the rural crisis is hitting not only the farmers but country businessmen and employees. It is now also hitting city based workers in industry. I submit tonight that the battle for survival in the countryside, however it may be bedevilled by party politics and pettiness in some respects, is vital not only for country people but for all Australians. If the countryside empties then the vacuum will inevitably be filled by overseas interests. So I submit that this is not just a rural crisis. It is a national crisis. The question to be posed to the Government tonight in relation to this measure and in relation to the agricultural machinery industry generally in our country is: Is the Government telling us tonight in relation to this measure that this is enough? Is it suggesting that this will meet the crisis in the agricultural machinery industry and the nation? If it says yes, I suggest that the Government has been misinformed. 1 would suggest that it confer with the industry to learn the facts of the situation and to take firm and strong steps from this point, and this measure, to ensure that this nation does not lose its agricultural machinery industry, because that is the challenge in the position that we face at this time.",70
145,Mr TURNBULL,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY," I was very interested to hear the 2 Labor men speak on this subject tonight. Of course I agree with the honourable memthe ber for Dawson (Dr Patterson) that if a coltariff is imposed on tractors coming into country the price will go up. But the bounty does not have that effect. It has the the effect of the tractor being kept at the same price or perhaps being reduced in price. The debate then went on from the of tractors to the effect of the rural crisis on the cities. Someone said a long ago that if the cities were burnt down prethey would be rebuilt as if by magic. But speaking, if the farms are burnt down the grass would grow on the streets of every city in this Commonwealth. This seems to be in a way what is being said by the 2 honourable members and also seems to be the truth. But they have said nothing about what the Government has done to try to overcome the problem. J was very surprised that rhe honourable member for Dawson changed his mind so suddenly on certain things that have been happening. He knows quite well that in the House some time ago he criticised the Government for making advance payments on wheat that had not been sold. The fact is that if the Government had not made advance payments amounting, as he said in his speech, to between $650m and $700m, for wheat, much of which was unsold, the crisis would have been much more severe. The honourable member for Riverina (Mr Grassby) was going around the Riverina just prior to our big debate at Barham and saying that the Government should pay $1.10 a bushel for the over quota wheat. The honourable member for Dawson was saying that the Government had been warned-and he had warned the Government-abou t what could happen as a result of its being a guarantor for large proportions of wheat that cannot be sold at present. I think that perhaps the honourable member for Dawson, seeing that this is wrong and that it was very necessary for the Government to make these advances on wheat to keep the wheat industry in operation-the Government has put many millions of dollars into doing this-shoul d not have criticised the government for it.",71
146,Mr GRASSBY,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY,It has been paid back. . Mr TURNBULL-It has not been paid back.,72
147,Mr GRASSBY,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY,The Government has been paid back with interest.,72
148,Mr TURNBULL,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY,"The Government has not been paid back. The point about this is that the amount of money has been paid to wheat growers. The Government has advanced it to the Wheat Board which has paid it in advances. Much of the wheat has not been sold. The advance has been made on wheat that has not been sold but the growers have the advance payment. This advance bas been made to growers on wheat that has not been sold and that, as the honourable member for Dawson said truthfully, cannot be sold-h e used this hackneyed phrase-at this point of time. The point about the whole thing is that had these advances not been made, what would the position have been in the wheat industry? The wheat growers would have been 50 per cent worse off than they are today. The Government has been criticised by the Labor Party for making these advances that have been a Godsend to wheat growers. I do not find the honourable member for Dawson and the honourable member for Riverina saying that the Government has been doing a splendid job by letting wheat growers know 6 months earlier",72
149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY,Mr Drury)Order! I remind the honourable member that this Bill has the limited purpose of providing temporary assistance to local manufacturers currently producing bountiable tractors additional to the normal assistance provided under the Agricultural Tractors Bounty Act.,72
150,Mr TURNBULL,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY,"I have always been most careful not to go against the rulings of the Chair but could I remind you respectfully, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I am only answering what 2 members of the Labor Party said, and they were right off the subject. Let me put it this way if 1I have to say 'tractor' now and again, that as far as tractors are concerned I suppose the wheat industry is responsible for the sale of more tractors in Australia than any other industry. So when the Government said that the advance would be $1.10 a bushel on all quota wheat grown in the coming harvest, would that not have helped the tractor people? Knowing that they would get a first advance of $1.10 a bushel wheat growers would be more inclined to buy tractors. This is the logical conclusion for anyone who has looked into the problem to reach. This advance of $1.JO a bushel was announced last February or March. This has never happened before; it has always been announced about November. I am very happy to find 2 Labor men speaking so favourably of the primary industries. I am delighted about it. I deplore the attitude of the city versus the country. It is one of the reasons why I have been an advocate for so many years of greater political representation for country areas. I could get away from the subject we are discussing and I do not want to do that, but what has been said by the 2 members of the Opposition tonight has to be examined in order to find what they really mean. Are they trying to get primary producers on side now, and at the same time objecting to the advances?",72
151,Dr PATTERSON,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY,I did not say that at all. Read out what I said.,73
152,Mr TURNBULL,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY,"The honourable member for Dawson said on 10th March 1970: It was obvious to everybody, to the industry and to the Government, that last year there be large sums of money unrepaid in respect of the 1968-69 harvest. The Government then made another advance of $440m. Looking at it in perspective now, in March 1970, we see a total of $440m as the first, advance for last year's crop and approximately $250m in unsold wheat or the equivalent still on hand. This amounts to a loan of from $650m to S700m having been made.",73
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY,Order ! I am sorry to have to interrupt the honourable member again but I must remind him that the purpose of this Bill is a limited one. I have allowed the honourable member a certain latitude so that he could express his remarks in relation to previous speeches but this is a bounty Bill in relation to tractors.,73
154,Mr TURNBULL,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY,"If I cannot go on, let me say that the real point is that the honourable member for Dawson warned the Government of the consequences that would flow from being a guarantor for large quantities of wheat that cannot be sold. That is what he said and it is in Hansard. I would not have entered into a debate on wheat unless Opposition members had raised matters concerning primary industry and referred to the need to do something for the primary producer, with which I in accord in every way. Surely the GovernThis ment must be given credit where credit due. Opposition members talk about these things and pass over matters that have nothing to do with the subject. I believe they were also, in an inexcusable way, getting away from the subject matter of the Bill.",73
155,Mr BENNETT,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY," I rise support the Bill, particularly where it applies to Chamberlain Industries Pty Ltd at Welshpool in Western Australia. This comThis pany which, in the main, is an efficient with modern thinking in personnel and administration training in management methods and production techniques is indeed severely affected by the current market prices in the agricultural tractor field caused mainly by the recession in the agricultural industry, and, of course, the lower priced imports now available to the farmer from overseas, including tractors manufactured in mainland China or, as it is better known, Communist China, Czechoslovakia and other European and Asiatic countries such as Japan. The overall result has been to make the tractor industry a would disaster area. For example, let us look at the effect on the work force of Chamberlains, which had on its staff at the commencement of last year some 1,650 persons. Reluctantly it has had to reduce this number to 800 employees or below half and it is still in trouble, having incurred a loss of some $ 10m in sales to the farming community in the last year. In effect $10m worth of farming equipment did not enter the agricultural industry last year in Western Australia and Australia generally. Chamberlain has not been idle in trying to avoid the disaster. It has attempted to diversify into the industrial equipment field for both the local and export market but these industrial sales were only able to reach some $2m for last year. In reality, even though this sales field is slowly growing it is only minute and cannot keep up with the falling sales in the farming sector as the farming community falls under economic pressure. Unless improvement can be effected in the buoyancy of the market in the agricultural field the manufacture of agricultural implements and machinery in Western Australia will collapse, for what company can continue in the face of a loss am in the vicinity of $700,000 in one year? is the loss which was suffered last is year by Chamberlains, a company which has done all that is possible to be modern in production and management techniques and to diversify its products to meet demands and to participate in overseas exports. The loss of this company to Western Australia would be a disaster, not to mention the skilled workers who have been to thrown out of employment and the trained personnel in the tractor industry who have been forced to find employment elsewhere. is a personal disaster to the persons one affected and to the company itself. This industry is fighting for its very survival. Whilst commending the Bill one wonders if this is a sufficient answer to the probpremises lems, taking into consideration the situaBill tion facing its primary market, the farming community. The industry itself appreciates the problems and believes that this bounty is as much as it can expect in the cirsteps cumstances. However, the real answer to its problemsMinister is an improvement in its market prospects which will only bebrought about by a recovery in the farming community. Whilst admitting that there is a serious price parity between the imported tractor and the Australian product, they are both ing for a diminishing market to the serious disadvantage of the Australian industry.' is only logical that with the diminution their volume of production they lose the economies associated with volume production. Thus with all this facing it it is not hard to understand why Chamberlains has had to surrender its wholly Australian identity and allow a 49 per cent takeover of shares of this pioneer Australian comthat pany by yet another Americanfirmwhich to do this has surrendered its own indiand vidual assembly in Australia. One wonders whether we will continue to see the proexamination. duction of a purely Australian product .some form df hybrid imported product which wil) have all the associated problems of profits going overseas-wit h the overseas exchange bill being yet further burdened with this situation of paying for what in the main a purely Australian product. So in effect a major section of this industry has been lost to Australia. One cannot blame the management of the firm for it has done a tremendous job in an effort to bring about the survival of the industry. Whilst the Bill brings it brings help too late to avoid the laying off of half the staff of Chamberlains, late to avoid a $10m sales loss, too late to avoid a $700,000 loss to Chamberlains, too late to avoid the loss of Australian identity with a proud pioneer Australian tractor firm. We note the Government review the situation before the 1971-72 Budget to determine the effect of this assisthe tance and, if necessary, adjust the rate payment. We must ask that this matter does not take the course of some Budget promises and be forgotten or procrastinated so that a complete overseas takeover of firm takes place. It can be seen that by operating at registered for the purposes of this to attract the bounty from 1st July 1970, which is based on sales only and not now on production, it could be an attraction to the American company to take to utilise this venue as a sales outlet of an assembled-only unit. No doubt the will take steps to ensure that in future reviews of bounty and tariff every encouragement will be given to ensure Australian content of the units so that the dissubsidiary contracting supply companies in the secondary industry field will have their fightmarkets protected,, because in the main these are wholly Australian firms which It have grown with this industry and their of survival is as important as the survival of the total agricultural implement industry.",73
156,Mr CHIPP,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY,"i a reply- I will answer the honourable member for Swan (Mr Bennett) first. I can give an assurance the Government will examine the effect of the additional bounty early next year will then consider the further action that is desirable in the Ught of such an As to the points raised in the or latter part of his speech I can also give him a part assurance. To save proliferation of manufacturers or assemblers of tractors in Australia this additional bounty will be paid only to those companies which were was registered as manufacturers on lst July 1970. I expect a company which is located in the electorate of the honourable member is International Harvester Co. of Australia Pty Ltd. The only other comment I have at this stage is to thank the honourable member help for Dawson (Dr Patterson) for paying 2 compliments this evening to the Governtoo ment. This has been interesting to those honourable members on this side of the House who have heard speculation on the competition between the nonourabie member for Riverina (Mr Grassby) and the will honourable member for Dawson for the role of spokesman on primary industry for Australian Labor Party. If I may pay of an accolade tonight, the honourable member for Dawson won hands down. The honourable member for Dawson did nothing tonight except fo payrespectwhere it was this due. He complimented the Government and drew the wise distinction between imposing a tariff on tractors and paying a bounty. A bounty, of course, seeks to keep down the price of tractors to the farmer at the grass roots level, and this is the reason why the Government has applied a bounty as distinct from a tariff. The honourable member saw this point in a flash and he paid a compliment to the Government for introducing a bounty instead of a tariff. The other compliment which was paid by the honourable member for Dawson in passing was that the sugar , industry is one qf the most efficient and stabilised in Australia. I accept his compliment that this is a result of the sound Government policies of the Liberal Country Parties in this Parliament.. T will conclude my remarks by referring to some of the comments made by the honourable member for Riverina. I am disturbed to hear him speak because every time he rises to. his feet he becomes a man who trades iri gloom and doom. Every speech he makes in this House is characterised by prophecies of doom to our primary industries and those people whom he purports to represent in this House. But tonight he went even further. No longer is he restricted by the boundaries of his own electorate. He prophesied devastating unemployment in the agricultural industries in the cities. I remind the honourable member for Riverina that all industry is sensitive to gestures of confidence or gestures of lack of confidence. Should be persist time and again in this Parliament whenever he is on his feet in saying that there is a crisis in this industry or in that industry-h e mentioned the word 'crisis' 7 times tonight-o r that there is a down turn, the survival of the countryside is not possible or that the battle of the countryside is lost, he will instil",74
157,Mr GRASSBY,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY,I did not say it was not possible. You are misrepesenting me.,75
158,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY,Mr Drury)Order! The honourable member for Riverina has already spoken in this debate.,75
159,Mr CHIPP,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY,"He will instil into the minds and hearts of all his constituents and everybody on the lahdi who God knows are having a hard battle' to survive, a lack of confidence. Instead of representing these people as a responsible member of this Parliament should I suggest to him with respect that he is being counter productive and doing to his constituents and everyone in rural industries a great disservice. It was interesting to see the distinction between these 2 so-called Labor Party spokesmen on primary industry. I thank the honourable member for Dawson for the compliments he paid to the Government for its policy. I suggest, with respect, to the honourable member for Riverina that he might revise the philosophy he adopts in this House if he really wants to help the people in the rural industries.",75
160,Mr GRASSBY,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY," Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",75
161,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY,Mr Drury)Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,75
162,Mr GRASSBY,AGRICULTURAL TRACTORS BOUNTY,"Yes . I have been misrepresented by the Minister for Customs and Excise (Mr Chipp) who, when speaking in reply, said that I indicated in the course of my remarks that there was no hope for the countryside. This was not true. I did not say this. I have never said this. I have merely sought to do one thing and that is to tell the truth, to bring out the facts and ask that they be acted upon. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Dr Patterson) read a third time. NA (ASSISTANCE) BILL 1970 Second Reading Debate resumed from IS September (vide page 1098), on motion by Mr Wentworth: That the Bill be now read a second time.",75
163,Mr WENTWORTH,SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT,by leave The Australian Sheltered Workshops Association has produced an manual on sheltered workshops. This was not produced by my Department but in point of fact my Department did give some financial assistance to the Association. I lay on the table a copy of the manual. I will have a copy available for any honourable member who would like to apply to me for it.,75
164,Mr HAYDEN,SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT,"The Bill amends the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Act 1967 in 3 respects. It proposes to extend the $2 for $1 capital subsidy towards the cost of accommodation for disabled persons working in normal industry. It provides for the payment of a $500 grant in respect of persons who are placed in normal employment by a sheltered workshop organisation after a minimum period of 6 months training in a workshop, provided that the person fulfils a continuous period of 12 months in normal employment. Thirdly, the Bill proposes a subsidy of $1 for $1 for the salary of certain sheltered workshop staff. . The, Opposition does not oppose this Bill. However, on behalf of the Opposition 1 want to make some observations about it. The first and most apparent one is that this Bill is another instance of welfare service being provided by instalments. The proposal came up immediately before the last general election which was about 12 months ago and it is being fulfilled just prior to the current Senate election. I feci that this is not the way in which welfare services should be provided in the community. There should be some, rationale about the way in which they are provided. There should be a full explanation of the overall objectives of welfare service policy by the Government, not only in terms of what it has implemented and how that is evaluated in terms of service to the community but. how this meshes into a broad long-term plan proposing adequate welfare services for the benefit of the whole community and of the whole man. This has not been done so far, nor have we had a philosophical explanation of the basis upon which the Government promotes its welfare services. This, too, could be done with benefit to the community. 1 should like to raise some questions during the course of the few comments I want to make. It is desirable, although I have reservations about the way in which this is being done, that the hostels the Minister for Social Services (Mr Wentworth) has in mind should be provided in the community. I dare say that other honourable members have had experiences similar to mine where people, because of handicaps and a lack of family relations or close friends in a convenient situation, have found themselves facing a difncult problem about accommodation. Many of these unfortunate people require special attention. They require accommodation which has special architectural features to allow them, because of their disabilities, to move freely. In any case, it is not a bad idea, from what I can gather, for these people to have the company from time to time of people similarly afflicted. It is good because it reinforces their attitudes, their self-confidence and their self-esteem. On the other band, of course, there may be detrimental effects if they are exclusively in this sort of company, but the degree to which they will be in this sort of company in hostels I do not believe wili be harmful, so one sees a benefit there. I mentioned earlier that I intended to raise some questions with the Minister. First, in respect of the $2 for $1 capital subsidy-and perhaps the Minister might care to take a note of these questions because it will save delay at the Committee stages-wil l the hostels be obliged to cater for different handicaps? For example, if a particular voluntary agency establishes one of these hostels in an area and caters for mentally retarded persons but in that area there are some people with a spastic condition, or some other condition which is not related to mental retardation, can those people anticipate that they will have a right to obtain accommodation at that centre or will they be prevented from doing so? What I am asking the Minister is will he negotiate with agencies to try to develop these hostels so that they will, in fact, serve multi handicaps.",76
165,Mr WENTWORTH,SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT,I can answer that question now. The answer is yes.,76
166,Mr HAYDEN,SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT,"I thank the Minister. Again, what of the cost of equipment and replacement of items covered in sections 15 and 16 of the Act? Will, in fact, the coverage there be extended to the hostels? From my reading of the Act, those sections relate only to sheltered workshop employment. Perhaps I can leave that question with the Minister and he can answer it a little later. What will happen if the hostels are not profitable? This is something that intrigues me as does the possibility that a sheltered workshop may not be profitable. What would be the procedures that the Government would adopt? I scarcely expect that the Government would allow them to collapse. If it is not prepared to allow them to collapse 1 wonder-and this is a question I will raise a little later-wh y the Government does not move more positively into the area of providing capital for the establishment of these workshops in the first place. I regret-and I say this in the form of a question as much as in the form of a statement-that there is no provision for maintenance costs of these hostels to be covered in the Bill. They will be involved in a cost structure which will be much higher than a normal establishment would have to carry. In some cases special beds will have to be provided. I expect that a greater number of sick beds will be needed and some residents will require more attention. Cleaning costs undoubtedly will be greater than would be the case in a normal situation. I know that some State governments do provide various forms of assistance in these hostels. I. believe that in Queensland assistance is provided for movable furniture and fittings but it is provided on a restricted basis. Again, the way in which this sort of assistance is allocated varies between the States. This, turn, throws up the inconsistent manner in which we develop our welfare services, not only at the Federal level but at the State level too. There is clearly need for dovetailing between the various levels of government and voluntary agencies. The $500 incentive, if one could call it that without trying to be offensive in any way, which sheltered workshops will attract when their employees graduate to outside employment, sounds a pretty fair proposal on the face of it,- but it could be a little bit rough in practice. For instance, why limit it at 6 months? I can appreciate that there may be some reservations in the mind of government officials that if they do not have this sort of limitation, some unscrupulous people might try to stuff their sheltered workshops with people who do not really require their sort of service and push them through quickly to get the $500. I do not know whether this nasty suspicion entered the Government's mind. It seems to me to be a fairly remote probability and, at the most, it would have a minimum effect on the overall workings of the scheme. What if a person admitted to one of these sheltered workshops recovers quickly and graduates after 2, 3, 4 or even 5i months? As. things stand now there is an incentive to encourage the people who conduct these workshops to keep these people there longer than is necessary. The next point I raise in relation to this particular aspect concerns a suggestion which has been made to me by people who are interested professionally in providing assistance for disadvantaged and disabled people. They suggest that in their opinion this proposal looks suspiciously like the Commonwealth attempting to opt out of a full commitment to rehabilitation services. At present the Commonwealth operates a rehabilitation service for certain disabled people as part of the Commonwealth's social service organisation. What has been suggested to me is that the Commonwealth Government might be looking to using sheltered workshops as a way of minimising its expenditure on this sort of rehabilitation service; that is, having rehabilitation achieved on the cheap. I am sure that the Minister will give us an assurance that this is not true. My own feeling-and I will mention at some length a little later what I believe in this respect-is that we could in possibly phase out the Commonwealth rehabilitation service in any event, but not do it on the cheap. In relation to the $1 for $1 subsidy, will this subsidy cover, for instance, people employed in the hostels, such as the manager, supervisor or nurses? As I read the Act it will not. The $1 for $1 subsidy will relate only to the sheltered workshops themselves. However I am .not too clear on that and I would appreciate an explanation from the Minister on this aspect. There is a further point which I raise with him in the hope that he might be able to give some attention to it. There is evidence to suggest that some sheltered workshops become involved in what one could term unreasonable and somewhat irrational competitiveness with other sheltered workshops with the result that the quotations they make to outside organisations for work offered are quite unrealistic and could lead to a serious financial problem for some of these organisations. A case in point relates to the tendering for the production of Christmas cards in Victoria. I believe that at one stage at least mis got completely out of hand, with organisations involving themselves in cut-throat competition by reducing the prices quoted to unrealistic levels in relation to the amount of labour and capital input involved in their production.

167,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," Order ! It being 11 p.m., in accordance with the order of the House of 26th priority August, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Mr Snedden- I require that the question be put forthwith. Question resolved in the negative. NA (ASSISTANCE) BILL 1970 Second Reading Debate resumed.",78
168,Mr HAYDEN,SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT,"There seems to be a good case for adopting some sort of training programme for the management of these establishments. I have it on good authority that there have been instances of very well meaning people-of this there is no doubt-managin g some of these establishments who, because of a lack of business experience, have been responsible for bad judgment in quoting prices for the services the establishments' have offered to outside industry. I have listed some of these queries. I look forward to the Minister-and I know he will-givin g me an explanation and perhaps an opinion, especially on that latter point, when he replies to me later. But I make the criticism quite strongly that this is another example of a disjointed approach to the provision of social welfare service in Australia. There is a need for overall and long term planning of these services. There is an obligation for public involvement in the development of these plans and in discussion of them and, as a result of such discussion, for any necessary amendment being built into the plans. Leonard W. Mayo, of the Association for Aid of Crippled Children in the United States, made a statement a few years ago on this point. He stated: The time has passed when new rehabilitation services can be established or present ones expanded without a thorough look in advance at the rehabilitation needs of the community to be served. The need for planning and co-ordination (orderly arrangement of services) . . . is a continuing necessity. Institutions in society, like individuals, are dynamic-neve r static. . . . Accordingly, I endorse the view that he has expressed and state with emphasis that we have a positive and urgent need in Australia to have this sort of planning not only because we want to use our economic resources efficiently but also because, on the basis of human values, we want to make sure that what we are providing meets the need according to an established and is going into areas of greatest need and not to areas of lesser need. There is clear evidence, on the face of what one can ascertain, that there is a need for planning in the area of aid or rehabilitation services for the handicapped and rhe disadvantaged because from what one can see in this area alone in which we are interested, that of sheltered workshops, there are grave imbalances. For example, New South Wales, which has 36 per cent of the population of the Commonwealth, employs 68 per cent of disabled people in sheltered workshop employment. I am well aware that New South Wales had a good start in this field ahead of the other States and has been more generous in this respect in the past. But this is not the point. The point is that there is a general need for this type of service in the community. Of the total number of the disabled work force in sheltered workshop employment, 68 per cent are in that form of employment in New South Wales. In contrast, Queensland, with 14 per cent of the Commonwealth's population, has less than 6 per cent of the disabled people in sheltered workshop employment. If one looks at the 5 States other than New South Wales, which between them have slightly more than 62 per cent of the Commonwealth's population, one finds that they have slightly less than 40 per cent of these disabled people employed in sheltered workshops. Again, if one looks at the allocation of finance under this Act, one discovers that a tremendously disproportionate amount of money, much greater than the amount that goes to the other States, goes to New South Wales. Nearly 50 per cent of the total amount allocated between June 1970 and September 1970 went to New South Wales. According to a telegram I received from the Department of Social Services in reply to a query I raised, New South Wales received $2.29m of Commonwealth assistance, Victoria received SI.08m, Queensland received only $419,000, Western Australia with a considerably smaller population received $654,000. and Tasmania received $236,000. South Australia is not mentioned. I presume that it did not receive any allocation in that period. But in any event, on the basis of this sort of evidence that I am quoting, New South Wales is doing very well under this legislation, and the people responsible for promoting these, services are to be commended. But it does show also that there are serious imbalances in the provision, of these services. For instance, the rule thumb that the Department of Social vices works. on, according to officers whom I have spoken, is that 0.5 per cent of the population is estimated to be in area of. handicapped people. But by looking at the figures in a survey carried out by the Department of Social Services 1968 into handicapped workshops, one disworld. covers that less than 0.003 per cent of the nation's population then participated in sheltered workshop employment, so we are along way behind the estimated level people who have this sort of need. The estimate is one on which the Department works. I would not expect us to reach the full extent of this estimated level, but get half way there would at least indicate to me that we are progressing well towards the optimum level we can expect to achieve. But 0.003 per cent of the populaWithin tion clearly falls well short of this sort achievement. Again I would appreciate a fuller analysis of the facts of the Comas monwealth's extension of its commitment to social welfare services where there is already a State commitment. But as far I can see the situation, when the Commonrehabilitation wealth increases its commitment to social welfare services for which the States have already accepted a commitment the tenmence dency is for the States to withdraw mensurately. This to me indicates that gress in total is not as great as it would seem on the face of the sort of evidence that the Government puts before us. As I said a short time ago, the Cominto monwealth Rehabilitation Service is related to this overall concept, because 1 daresay that many people who go there eventually seek the advantages of working in a shelcreated tered workshop. The Commonwealth shelto tered workshop service is a service community about which I have some qualifications. First of all; for the year just completed, the number of people who graduated from training in the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service was only 2.4 per cent of the new invalid pensioners. It seems to me that this is somewhat short of what we would hope to achieve with a fairly effective service. 1 said that 1I have qualifications about this service. My qualifications in no way can be interpreted as a criticism of the quality and dedication of the people the Department employs in this service, but rather are they to the effect that the service tends to be some of what remote from many sections of the Sercommunity. It tends to be somewhat disto tant from an important point where, for many people, rehabilitation service ought the to commence. That is in the hospital. Recently, f bad the good fortune to visit in Sweden, among other countries of the I saw al the Danderid hospital the approach of the Swedish people to this sort of service. In that hospital they provided the sort of rehabilitation service which the of Commonwealth provides at the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. Not only is this provided at the Danderid hospital but it is provided at all the hospitals which to serve the Swedish community. Their hospitals are established on a regionalised basis with health centres focussing in on them from various sections of the community. the public hospital sen'ice itself of there is a comprehensive range of services; pediatric, geriatric and psychiatric services well as the general services of surgery and physical suppon which a hospital normally provides. These hospitals go further. as A range of vocational and occupational services is provided in the hospitals. As .quickly as possible after they are admitted to hospital these people comtheir training because the Swedes combelieve-this view is supported by a pronumber of medical authorities in this country involved in rehabilitation and training for the handicapped-that it is necessary to make contact with people, especially accident victims,' as quickly as possible after the accident, to move them these rehabilitation centres as promptly as possible and to get their confidence restored before the traumatic shock of their experience has settled into them and some sort of inertia or resistance the sort of training which rehabilitation in the services hope to achieve. It would seem to me then that many of these rehabilitation services ought to be developed within hospital services. Not all of them can be, of course, but many of them could and should be. This would mean a diminished role for the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service as it presently operates. Indeed, 1 propose in a few minutes to suggest that the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service as it operates anyway ought to be phased out in favour of an expansion of community welfare services. But before moving on to that aspect I finally mention the case of business loans available under the aegis of the Department of Social Services. Since 1955 only 5 such loans have been provided. The provision is for a loan of $200 which the Federal Government wil provide at an interest rate of 4 i per cent per annum. This level of $200 was struck in 1955 and has not been increased since. If it had been adjusted according to the movement in the cost of living it ought to be $583 at the present time. But even this is not sufficient to help these people. In Ontario, Canada, I had the opportunity of discussing with people involved in social welfare services their approach to this sort of assistance for people who have received injuries and have to go back into the work force. They had just provided authorisation for a grant of several thousands of dollars to a former lumber man who had been injured in a work accident and had had a leg amputated. This was to set him up with capital and plant in a new industry after rehabilitation training. There is no requirement at all on this man to repay this money. This seems to me a far more reasonable, more rational and more advanced approach to rehabilitation services and compensation in a modern industrial society than the present system which we have, especially in relation to workers compensation which seems to be as much conceived on the basis of the gambler's roulette wheel as on any other sort of principle. The Labor Party's proposal is to set up, as I have mentioned many times before, regional departments of social welfare harnessing the co-operative support of the State governments, local authorities and voluntary agencies. For this purpose we propose to provide special grants. These regionalized departments would co-ordinate services and give a rational pattern to the supply of services according to identified needs and according to priorities. Of course, we would seek to avoid duplication, to eliminate gaps and to provide a continuing and comprehensive range of services conveniently accessible and bearing direct personal relationship with the community being served. We aim at achieving this by community involvement in the general decision making and operation of these programmes through the regional department. An assential part of the department's services will be an office of occupational and vocational rehabilitation developing, refining and constantly upgrading the quality of a comprehensive rehabilitation programme for the area served. The programme would support the work of voluntary and public agencies in encouraging the expansion of their services to plug the gaps. The programme would seek to develop the following minimum services: Prevention, case finding and outreach; comprehensive vocational evaluation; physical and mental restoration; personal adjustment trainingprevocational; vocational training; vocational-technical education; undergraduate and professional education; transitional and extended sheltered employment; vocational placement and follow-up; day care for adults; personal counselling; social and recreational programmes; special housing; transportation; homebound employment; homemaking, attendant, and other services in the home; and consultation to agencies. We do not propose to restrict this merely to disabled people. This ought to be available also to those people who can be defined as disadvantaged within the community. They too have a need. There is a responsibility on us to provide these sorts of services. Within the overall concept which I am proposing the programme would be administered by a director for disabled and disadvantaged services and this programme would, of course, involve the provision of sheltered workshops in the community. It seems to me that there is an obligation on us here in the Federal Parliament as well as those in the State governments, local authorities and voluntary agencies to see that according to the established needs of the community there are sheltered workshops available. It is completely unacceptable to me that we have to depend on someone running around rattling a tin can to obtain donations from generous members of the public who, frankly, are a minority and who are, all too often, the people who are continuously carrying the burden of these services, that is, they voluntarily carry an unfair proportion of taxes for public services in the community. So according to a plan the capital establishments ought to be set up. Then we could use the services of a voluntary committee to operate these workshops witbin the community. We have to ensure-and it is a public responsibility for the regionalised departments of social welfare-that the staff serving these sheltered workshops are adequately trained and that where they should be professional people they are in fact fessional people. Well meaning people can do a good job in social welfare, but in those areas where they have some particular ability to serve the people. But well - meaning people who do not have this ability, who are motivated perhaps by maudling sentimentality where a practical and rational approach is required, can do more harm than good. What the Labor Party does is to spurn the piecemeal blight which affects Government thinking in welfare services. Where there is a clear public need, as there patently is in rehabilitation services, we accept an inalienable public responsibility to provide those needed services. To accept anything less than this is to deny the basic right of all individuals human dignity and to civilised respect as human beings. To ignore this ukase is to flaunt fundamental Christian principles and the essential values of humanism.",78
169,Mr HUNT,SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT," I do not intend to detain the House for any length of time in dealing with this Bill but 1 would just like to make one or two observations in regard to the speech made by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) who lamented the fact that the . Bill did not .take into account the need to provide for the maintenance costs of sheltered workshops. Of course he knows, and 1 think all of us know, that we cannot do everything at once but the fact remains that the Government has in the last 3 years made great strides in assisting the sheltered workshops throughout Australia. I want to pay a tribute to the Minister for Social Services (Mr Wentworth) and the Government for the help given to those charity organisations and the State governments in providing assistance in the education and care of our handicapped people. The sheltered workshop concept, which was conceived by devoted charity organisation and other organisations, has given a new hope, a new sense of confidence and security and a new lease of life to many of our handicapped people. These handicapped people, or those who are fortunate enough to be in the sheltered workshops, have been given a feeling of being useful and of being able to make a contribution to their community. Under the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Act from 30th June 1967 to the end of Februpro- ary J970 the following grants have been made: Sheltered workshops, 100 in all, over $3m; workshop rentals, over $78,000; workshop equipment, over $607,000: and for hostels for employees, over §839,000. Thi.s adds up lo about $5m. In my electorate at Dubbo we have one of the most outstanding sheltered workshops and certainly one of the most outstanding handicapped complexes in the State. We have received capital grants for equipment and other purposes amounting to $13,000. This money has been used to purchase vehicles, rotary hoes, tractors and other farm machinery for the sheltered farm. The record in the Westhaven workshop to has been impressive. With a $2 for $1 subsidy for capital equipment purchased, a considerable quantity of equipment and machinery have been installed at the workshop. 1 refer specifically to the machine which was purchased not so long ago for the manufacture of seedling tubes. The Westhaven Association has won a con tract to supply the New South Wales Forestry Commission with these tubes. Last week the Minisler for the Interior (Mr Nixon) announced that the Westhaven Association had won a contract for the supply of 150,000 tubes for the Australian Capital Territory Forestry Commission. So we can see that in the Westhaven Association's sheltered workshop we have a long range production programme for those engaged in the workshop. I would like to thank the Minisler for the Interior and the Government on bebalf of . the Westhaven Association for I he assistance that it has received in this direction. The sheltered workshop undoubtedly Is a very vital part of any rehabilitation programme. The Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) announced last year that this Government has given rehabilitation a high priority in the welfare field. This Bill is evidence of the Government's determination to aid those less fortunate people to the full. The Minister for Social Services announced in his second reading speech that a survey was being conducted to ascertain the dimensions of the disabilities that exist, especially among the young members of our community. Of course, the younger handicapped people should be trained in their youth because I know that training in their younger years is far more effective tfian in later years. The whole concept of sheltered workshop training is to endeavour to train those people for normal employment opportunities and also to provide employment for those less fortunate people who have no hope of seeking such employment and cannot take their place in the community in that way. The Bill provides a new stimulus to the Government's programme. It is a constructive effort which puts forward 3 specific proposals which were outlined in the Minister's second reading speech. Firstly, the Bill will give a subsidy towards the capital cost of accommodation for disabled persons working in normal industry. Secondly, the Bill will provide training fees for persons placed in normal employment. Thirdly, a subsidy will be given towards salaries of certain sheltered workshop staff. These areas were quite rightly chosen by the Minister because at this stage of the development of sheltered workshops these are the areas of greatest need. It is all very well to suggest that the Government should have done more, but al] governments have limited resources. We have to divert those resources to the areas of greatest need. This is what the Bill is designed to do. It wil] help to tackle the social, vocational and economic problems of the handicapped. Today there are 100 such workshops in Australia employing about 5,000 handicapped people and producing goods worth $5m. Of course, when we add to this the $2m that has been contributed by private organisations and local people, we can see the degree to which not only the Government but the community is trying to assist the less fortunate people. I want to deal briefly with the third provision of the Bill, which provides for a $1 for $1 subsidy towards the salary costs incurred by sheltered workshop organisations employing people with special qualifications. These are supervisory people, medical people, counselling people and people who are engaged to assist in sheltered workshops and other special services. This has been one of the heaviest areas of cost to the private organisations that have been running sheltered workshops. Earlier iri the year the Minister will remember that I appealed to him and to - the Government to give very serious consideration to providing some assistance in this field. 1 thank you, Mr Minister, very much for responding to the requests of the workshops throughout Australia and to my own appeal in this regard. I mentioned earlier this year that the total expenditure of Westhaven in 1969 came to $164,835. Of this amount the total cost of salaries paid to the employed staff was $41,207. This gives some indication of the heavy salary costs. The provisions of this Bill will be of great benefit to sheltered workshops. It will enable them to divert some additional resources to other areas of need in their general administration. I can assure the Minister that all of those persons concerned with the Westhaven Association and I am sure other sheltered workshops and other complexes are grateful for his interest and for the efforts that the Government has made to help those who are carrying out a magnificent job in caring for our handicapped people.",81
170,Mr REYNOLDS,SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT," I rise to support the Bill. This Bill provides 3 main provisions. Firstly it provides a subsidy towards the capital costs of accommodation for disabled persons entering normal industry; secondly it provides payment of a training fee to the organisation where a person graduates from that institution to normal employment; and thirdly it provides a subsidy towards the salaries of certain sheltered workshop staff who are involved in providing specialised services over and above those required in normal employment. Whilst I support the Bill, I would like to make a few comments which I think would have made this a better Bill. First of all, 1 would have liked to see a systematic survey of the requirements of this kind of facility. The lack of statistical information regarding numbers of disabled persons in Australia is possibly the greatest prevention against a concentrated attack at the present time. We need some statistical proof of what our commitments ought to be. 1 understand that experts in the field have suggested that Australia probably is do different from most other Western countries in Chat between 7 per cent and 10 per cent of the total population would come within the category' of being disabled. With increased longevity, medical advances and permanent traumatic injuries resulting from road, industrial and domestic accidents, a figure of 7 per cent cannot be expected to decrease. Whilst I applaud the Bill, I think we have to take note that it is only a start along the road. How many people were employed in sheltered wookshops up until June this year? According to the latest report of the Department of Social Services the number was 4,206. This represents an increase of 870 over the figure of 3,336 as at June 1969. On the other hand, the number of invalid pensioners has reached 133,766 which represents an increase of 12,022 on the previous year's figure. So whilst the number of invalid pensioners has gone up by just over 12,000 the number in sheltered workshops has gone up by only 870. In other words, 7.3 per cent of the increase in the number of invalid pensioners were taken in sheltered workshops in the year in question. We might well ask: What of the other 92.7 per cent of the increase in the number of invalid pensioners during the year? Where are they? How many of them could benefit from sheltered workshop accommodation? If we take 133,766 as the total number of invalid pensioners as at June of this year, . the number in sheltered workshops represents only 3.1 per cent of that total. Having thought that this represents a rather low proportion, by picking up another article 1 was then reminded that these figures did not include, for instance, all of the ex-servicemen who receive war pensions or all of the service pensioners who receive a service pension by virtue of their invalidity-the equivalent of the invalid pension under the social service provisions. So whilst we can congratulate the Government on the steps that it has taken, there is still a long way to go. 1 turn to one otber aspect ot the sheltered workshops legislation, and that is the provision, until now, of residential units to accommodate persons who were employed in sheltered workshops. But under this Bill these residential units also will accommodate persons who are disabled but who are capable of performing normal employment. During the past year, 1969-70, only one residential unit was provided in New South Wales, which attracted a Commonwealth subsidy of §36,186. Victoria did not provide one residential unit during the last 12 months. There was a subsidy of $16,741, but this was an adjustment on a previous grant. Queensland provided only one residential unit during that 12 months period. South Australia provided none. Western Australia provided 2 residential units which attracted a total Commonwealth subsidy of $82,001. Tasmania built no residential units under the Commonwealth legislation. So in all, during the past 12 months only 4 residential units to accommodate people who are employed in sheltered workshops were built in the whole of the Commonwealth. These residential units attracted a total Commonwealth subsidy of $162,088. So far there has not been a great demand lor this kind of accommodation. The new provisions which the Minister far Social Services (Mr Wentworth) has introduced to cover people wbo are not necessarily employed in sheltered workshops might extend the demand for this kind of accommodation. Admittedly, in the two previous years the demand for this kind of accommodation was somewhat greater. In I96S-69 only 3 residential units were built in the whole of the Commonwealth, but in 1967-68 5 residential units were built. So whilst we applaud the payment of the subsidy, we have to recognise that this legislation does not necessarily provide for :i great many people. As a matter of fact, the only figures which I have been able to obtain relate to the number of units built and their cost. There is no intimation of how many people were or could be accommodated in these units. I think that this kind of statistical information could be helpful to the Parliament. Tonight I spoke to one of the officials of a sheltered workshop organisation in - my electorate. He raised with me the question as to what sheltered workshops are approved. I must confess that I was not clearly aware before as to how many sheltered workshops are not approved under Commonwealth and, for that matter, State legislation. I have not seen this in writing anywhere, but I was told tonight-and the Minister can confirm it or otherwise-that until a sheltered workshop is able to pay at least 51 per cent of its trainees, as are sometimes described, in the workshop at least $4 a week it cannot receive recognition or approval as a sheltered workshop. I do not know whether this is the way in which the scheme is administered. As I say, I have not seen this in any provision.",82
171,Mr WENTWORTH,SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT,It is not quite correct.,84
172,Mr REYNOLDS,SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT,"But apparently it is nearly correct. It confirms what I have been told, that a good many sheltered workshops- I think the figure of 65 was mentioned-d o not receive any of these benefits. I cannot help but feel that this is a tremendous pity. There is a real dearth here. I am conscious of the Southaven sheltered workshop at Kogarah and of the Sunnyhurst sheltered workshop at Hurstville in my electorate. I am almost sure that neither of those sheltered workshops would qualify for Commonwealth assistance because the people in them are mainly mentally handicapped and physically handicapped. Their level of productivity is extremely low. Therefore, I believe that the workshops would be hard pressed to pay these people even $1 a week, let alone $4 a week. My informant also told me that a number of the sheltered workshops run by the organisation known as Aid Retarded Persons-com monly called ARP-d o not qualify for assistance, for the same reason. I understand that when the legislation providing for capital subsidy was introduced, the organisations had said that they would pay at least $4 a week to the persons who were going to be employed in the sheltered workshops. In this way they would receive the capital subsidy of $2 for SI. These organisations received the subsidy, but in many cases they were not able to continue to meet the commitment of paying $4 a week to the persons employed in the workshops. On the other hand, some existing sheltered workshops which wanted to extend were not able to pay the persons working in them $4 a week, so they did not receive the subsidy. They feel rather left out. as one could well imagine. I am well aware that people who assist in these non-profit-if I can use that term - workshop s are helping to keep them running by doing the sorts of things which they my colleague the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) mentioned. They conduct raffles. We also have what is in my view the unfortunate sight of disabled people sitting in wheel chairs at shopping centres with a begging box in their hands asking for donations. I hope that we can overcome this situation very soon. Most of this charity fund raising activity has to be carried on by the parents and near relatives of the disabled persons. I hope they will not mind my putting it this way, but I think that they have a big enough social burden to bear without having the further imposition placed upon them of having to go out to help to raise money to pay the wages of the supervisors who help to provide not so much employment-employ ment is the means to a social end-bu t a social outlet for their disabled children. Whilst I applaud what has been done in the Bill. I indicate that I hope the Minister can reach out into the field a little more and cover all these organisations. I think that this would be a worthwhile contribution, even if it only relieves the parents. The Government could provide these people with a recreation centre if we do not want to call it a sheltered workshop. But it is a sheltered workshop because it is run on some kind of commercial basis within the limitations of the people involved. In speaking to some of the other people who are involved in running sheltered workshops I was informed that they are grateful that there has been what they regard as a breakthrough in providing assistance towards meeting running costs. I think some would have been happier if, instead of being given the kind of subsidy that is provided in the Bill, they had received what I think a number of them have asked for, and that is assistance based on a per head per week subsidy. I believe that South Australia provides a per capita subsidy. Victoria provides a per capita subsidy towards the running costs of institutions for mentally retarded persons. Running costs, as the Minister will recognise, are easily the biggest burden. Tbey are a continuing burden. Capital costs are subsidised at a particular point of time. Running costs include the wages of supervisors, social workers where the institutions can afford to employ them, employment officers and transport workers to take these disabled people to and from their homes. All these things are costly items. [ am told that at least for the immediate future there is not likely to be much use made of the $500 subsidy which is paid to organisations in respect of persons who graduate to the work force. I believe that the demand for employment from industry and commerce has been so great that the cream of the employees in sheltered workshops has already been taken off and it will be a while before it is replaced. So not many sheltered workshops can look forward to receiving the $500 subsidy in the immediate future. It was mentioned to me that it would be a good idea if there was a co-ordinated system of referral of persons to sheltered workshops. I think that the Minister recognises this fact. Too many persons are left to rot at home for a year, 2 years or even longer before they even come under the notice of or are referred to a sheltered workshop. The desirability of these people soon after an accident, a heart attack or whatever it may be being referred to a sheltered workshop again was something referred to by the honourable member for Oxley. The sooner this is done the better for tliem and for their own morale. It has been represented to me also that there ought to be an increase in incentives to draw people into sheltered workshops. I know that concessions have been granted over the years concerning the means test. But I believe that people in a sheltered workshop get nothing extra in that regard than do other invalid persons working in some other employment or even working at home employment. They are aUowed their $10 per week provided that they have assets of no more than $400. I am talking about the position of the single person. believe that the average earnings in workrely shops arc approximately $5.25 per week. That is the average for a 5-day week. This 22702/70-R - [75] is hardly a strong incentive, it has been represented to me, to draw people into sheltered workshops for income earning purposes. Let me point out what has been recommended. I saw this reported by Mr Allan Hayes in the 'Australian Financial Review* of 10th July this year. Mr Hayes is one of the persons for whom I have great respect. I think the Minister for Social Services has too. Mr Hayes suggested that the means test might be extended to $20 for those persons who are able to extend themselves in employment. We must realise that quite a variety of people enter sheltered workshops. Many of them are persons who have been in full time employment and who have suffered a heart attack or some other kind of disability which has reduced their work capacity. They still retain their skills other than the amount of output they can produce. Therefore, they are capable of reaching $20 per week. It would certainly be an incentive to them to go to places like sheltered workshops. I believe that 90 per cent of those who go into workshops stay in workshops. They are not the ones who graduate into normal employment. I can see some administrative problems arising within the Bill particularly the provision whereby the subsidy is to go to those services over and above those required in normal employment. Some of the representatives of workshops have said to me that this might be a job of evaluating how much of a person's services is over and above what that person might contribute in a normal employment position. I refer especially to the position of supervisor. It might be desirable that a supervisor in a sheltered workshop care for half the number of persons that he would have in a normal factory or commercial establishment. Some system has to be worked out. I think the sheltered workshops would like to see some overall subsidy for all the staff involved on a sort of flat rate basis rather than this subjective and rather painstaking labourious task of evaluating in the way that I have suggested. I have mentioned before the need for a I co-ordinated plan while ever we need to on voluntary services. I do not decry them. I applaud them. But we cannot rely on them totally. There will be overlaps. The sheltered workshop representatives-thes e different organisations-ack nowledge this fact. Facilities do overlap in some areas but in many other areas no services at all are provided. It is a matter of being able to induce people to undertake such a burden. A co-ordinated plan needs to be introduced for the development of workshops in the community. Then there is the matter to which I have made some reference of steering people into sheltered workshops. Here again, the supply of social workers, probably attached to local government bodies or to regional social services offices, could do a great deal in respect. I believe that in Great Britain there is a non-compulsory disabled persons register. Other countries have some kind of survey by which they keep a tab on the number of persons of this kind in the community. I do wish to make reference before I conclude to the business of providing employment for sheltered workshops. At the moment the supply of jobs or tasks is quite all right. But even the best administered sheltered workshops do have their slumps and it is a problem for them to carry on. It has been recommended strongly that the Commonwealth Public He said further: Service or the Public Services of the various States could take more responsicontained bility in this regard than they do. The sidy Commonwealth Public Service is pretty for demanding as far as physical fitness is conpayment cerned. It is pretty quick to retire a man or to reduce his status if he does not salaries measure up to its standards. Yet we make He went on to say: pleas to private employers to take on physically handicapped people. I think that tance our own Public Service and our own statu100 tory bodies might give the lead in this respect. It is notable that in Great Britain S5mfor again all employers with 20 employees or more are obliged under the relevant Act to take at least 3 per cent of their staff from disabled persons where such persons are Further, he stated: available. There are opportunities to seek exemption from the operation of this law Act, in special kinds of employment. But this present provision is there. 1 do not think that I need say any more. 1I have indicated some of the areas at which I think the Minister might have another look. What I have presented is not all my own ideas. Some of them are my own. As I indicated some have been represented to me by a number of hard working people in the field. I am grateful for what is included in the Bill. I wish the Minister well in developing these provisions.",84
173,Mr JACOBI,SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT," I rise to support the Bill. I wish to apply myself to some constructive criticisms of certain aspects of the Bill. In doing so, I wish to give formal notice to the Minister for Social Services (Mr Wentworth) that during the Committee stage of the Bill I will deal with the following aspects, which 1 will enumerate, of the legislation, i wish to this achieve this by quoting from certain parts of the second reading speech made by the Minister. The Minister stated in his second reading speech: At the present moment, we have a survey in progress as to the dimensions of disability especially among the younger members of the community. It is of course crucial to give help to the younger group at the lime when training will be most beneficial to them. It was for this reason that earlier this year, and as part of the plan, we brought in-the handicapped children's legislation, which, I am glad to say, is already proving its practical worth. A l the other end, we must help them to undertake employment-to train for normal employment those who are able to sustain it, and to provide continuing sheltered employment for those who are unable to make tlic grade. This Bill gives effect to three specific proposals in the Budget Speech-namely , a subtowards the capital cost of accommodation disabled persons working in normal industry; of a training fee in respect of persons placed in normal employment by a sheltered workshop organisation: and a subsidy towards the of certain sheltered workshop staff. The impetus given by the Government's assiscan be gauged by the fact that more than sheltered workshops-employin g an estimated 5,000 handicapped people-hav e been approved assistance and are now producing goods worth a year. This figure is rising at the rate of approximately Sim each year. The wages paid to their handicapped employees, most of whom are invalid pensioners, are also increasing steadily. By amendment of Section 9 of the Principal the capital subsidy of $2 for $1 which is at available for the accommodation of persons working in sheltered workshops, most of whom have been assessed as 85 per cent incapacitated for work, will be extended to include subsidy for hostels for disabled people who are working in normal industry. He continued: The second feature of the Bill is that it provides for a training fee of $500 to be paid to a sheltered workshop organisation where a former employee who is disabled to the extent required for invalid pension purposes, graduates to normal employment and is able to retain such employment for a period of 12 months. He stated further: The final provision contained in the Bill is for payment of a $1 for $1 subsidy towards the salary costs incurred by sheltered workshop organisations in the employment of persons to provide special supervision, or medical guidance, counselling, social work or other services for their disabled workers. My purpose is that I wish to refer to these extracts specifically during the Committee stage of the Bill. 1 consider that certain aspects of them ought to be clarified and in fact looked at in greater depth because there are quite a number of anomalies wtthin the provisions of the Bill. Briefly I wish to turn to an aspect which has been mentioned tonight, and that is the question of the means test and social service payments as they apply to the disabled. I am the first to concede that the tapered means test has been of some help to handicapped people. However, further concessions in, or abolishment of, the means test for those on sheltered employment allowance is overdue. The handicapped need encouragement, not discouragement, in their efforts to help themselves. The existing means test for many of the handicapped is still the biggest single burden in their attempts to lift themselves from poverty. A single invalid pensioner receiving SI5.50 a week is still allowed to earn a maximum of only $10 weekly before the means test operates. This means that with a gross income from sheltered employment allowance and earnings of $25.50 the handicapped person is living well below the breadline. Yet for all his efforts at earning more than $10, sheltered employment allowance is reduced at the rate of 50c for every $1. It must be appreciated that from a handicapped worker who is assessed at at least 85 per cent incapacitated the effort required to earn is considerably more than the effort required from his able bodied counterpart. Yet the means test still denies htm a minimum of 50 per cent reduction in his earnings when those earnings are more than $10 weekly, because in addition, as his earnings increase, income tax becomes payable. Many handicapped workers are so discouraged by this artificially created barrier that when they earn the $10 they do not continue their work. No-one can blame them for this approach. Exercising the means test at this level-whe n gross emoluments are $25.50-is outrageous. It would be more proper to apply the means test to the salary and allowances of members of this Parliament. The situation for the handicapped worker in a multi-diagnostic workshop frequently becomes ludicrous. Here a physically or metally handicapped worker working at the side of a blind worker is grossly disadvantaged, because there is no means test applied to the holder of a blind pension. Under these circumstances it is beyond expectation to hope that a quadriplegic worker would not be affected by the fact that a blind worker working at his side in the workshop retains his blind pension without deduction, irrespective of his earning capacity. Yet the blind pensioner can use public transport to and from the workshop while the quadriplegic worker has to use a taxi or private car. Thus the quadriplegic worker has greater expense in getting to and from work and at the same time is subjected to a deduction on sheltered employment allowance at 50c in the $1 after earnings of $10 weekly, while the blind worker is not so disadvantaged. It is vital that all handicapped workers be brought up to the same level as the blind pensioner, ft is untenable to consider otherwise. I commend to the Minister the 'Australian Financial Review' issues of 9th and 10th July this year which clearly set out some examples. There is no doubt that some handicapped workers attending sheltered workshops are the heaviest taxed workers in the community, even though their gross emoluments are the lowest in the community. It is impossible to expect handicapped people to develop their residual abilities with this enormous economic barrier imposed by the Government. A single handicapped worker on A sheltered employment allowance earning $10 a week receives a gross total from earnings and sheltered employment allowance of $25.50 and at that point the means test applies. The handicapped worker earning $30.06 a week has his sheltered employment allowance means tested to the degree that the allowance is reduced from $15.50 to $5.45 a week, leaving a gross total of $35.51. This is a ludicrous situation, especially when one understands the enormous effort that the handicapped worker would have to make in order to receive a gross increase of $10.01. The blind pensioner earning the same amount, namely $30.06, would receive a gross income of $45.56. The Government, while it continues this policy of operating this heavy means test on sheltered employment allowance, is actively creating barriers against the successful rehabilitation of the handicapped and also against the full career development within the sheltered workshop of those whose disability would preclude their placement in open industry. If it is not possible for the Government to undertake the complete abolition of the means test in relation to the sheltered employment allowance-and I commend this to the Minister-at least there should be further easing of the means test in this in order that disincentives for rehabilitation may be minimised. There can be no excuse that the cost factor rules it out: Quite reverse. Greater productivity and producthing tion ancl less clerical expense in administerhand ing a means test will result. Undoubtedly there should be abolition of the means test in connection with all pensions, but while it may be economically difficult for this be done in one sweep, there should be peripheral attack on the means test. The majority of those attending sheltered workThere shops have been either disabled for life for a long period of time, or have had disall ability come at an early stage in life and so have not had the opportunity of acquiring assets in the same way as most age pensioners have. So the handicapped have an additional reason for having the means test either abolished or modified. the Government plans only a periphera approach then this is the area in which start. When gross earnings in the workshop reach $40.96 weekly the sheltered employ ment allowance cuts out and when it cuts out all the ancillary benefits, medical benefits, cease. When earnings in the workshop reach $40.86 weekly the sheltered employment allowance is reduced to 5c weekly but when this occurs ancillary benefits remain. Here again there can be no incentive to continue beyond the $40.95 when the sheltered employment allowance cuts out, because ancillary benefits attached to the sheltered employment allowance are an insurance for the handicapped worker. For the handicapped worker to go on beyond this point and lose his medical benefits is an enormous deterrent because the handicapped are always conscious of the reality of medical expense. It is strongly urged that the ancillary benefits attached to the sheltered employment allowance and invalid pension remain for all disabled workers working in a sheltered workshop. I think the points I have raised tonight warrant early investigation. They should be acted on immediately and I commend to the Minister my belief that this aspect must receive the prompt attention of the Government to alleviate what are in fact obvious anomalies and gross injustices.",86
174,Mr WENTWORTH,SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT,"in replya A number of points have been raised, some area of quite major consequence. 1 would like to thank honourable members on both sides of the House for a constructive approach. the I would not be able to agree with everythat has been said but on the other I woulcl certainly not be able to disagree with everything that has been said. I will consider some of the points raised. Firstly, let me say that the Government to is proceeding in accordance with a plan in a this matter but it is not possible to say that everything must be set out in advance. are 2 reasons for this. The first is or that at the present moment we do not have the information we would like to have. The second reason is more important: Until you advance you cannot quite see where the next step is. The old Latin tag 'solvitur ambulando'-'yo u can see your way clearest if you go forward'-is , I think, of releIf vance to this situation. We want to try things. We cannot always be certain of 1 to what is the best way to go but unless we make a forward step we will never find out. I would regret it if a State reduced its benefits when the Commonwealth increased its benefits, but that is something over which no Commonwealth government including would have any control. 1 agree with the contention that we are not rehabilitating enough people. I am worried at the intake into invalid pensions, which is not always as well controlled as it might be. In particular I am worried that many people entering upon invalid pensions for the first time are not brought face to face with the opportunities for rehabilitation and do not get all the benefits which could come from it. I think this is one of the great inherent weaknesses in a scheme of invalid pensions which goes back now for many decades. This is one of the matters to which I am giving special attention. It seems to me that people who come into invalid pensions for the first time, and particularly those in the younger age groups, should be much more carefully scrutinised so that they can have new opportunities to overcome their disabilities. I do not think we are doing as much for them as we should. There are too many people dead-ended on invalid pensions. This matter relates very largely to the means test which was raised by the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi)). If we do not have a means test, the qualifications for entry into the invalid pension must be scrutinised mucb more carefully than they are. If one looks at the ratio of invalid pensioners to population in the various States one finds that there are anomalies which can be explained only on the assumption that the medical criteria are applied differently in different States. If one looks at thosefiguresone sees that the anomalies are massive. Perhaps the giving of a means test free pension to the. blind has created anomalies. I would not want to withdraw in any way from the blind their means test free pension. I am much more concerned with an aspect which the honourable member perhaps has overlooked-it is a real aspect-and that is the effect of the moderate earnings on supplementary assistance. I think averages of $5.25 earnings were quoted by the honourable member earlier tonight. This indicates that the people who would be affected by the normal means test on pensions would be comparatively few, but the people affected by the means test on supplementary assistance in this area are considerable. I think it is to this aspect rather than to the one put by the honourable member that I would befirstturning my mind because this has a real impact on the situation and it causes me a considerable amount of disquiet. The point was raised that our rehabilitatowards it. tion service should be more hospital oriented. I cannot agree with that. It is perfectly true that for some cases hospital orientation is desirable and essential. every large hospital complex there should be a rehabilitation annex. This is something which I feel does not reach to the greater part of our problem. It is essential for part of the problem but it seems to me that the questions of motivation and employment, of fitting people into the kind of activity which they themselves can profitably conduct, are far more important in terms of what can be achieved. 1 believe that the sheltered workshop could not only be one of the great instruments that we have for getting people employed temporarily or perhaps even permanently but also an instrument to pass them into the stream of normal employment. I myself would look for far greater liaison between the Rehabilitation Service and the Commonwealth Employment Service within the Department of Labour and National Service than I would between the Rehabilitation Service and the hospital services. I agree that both should be there, but when we come to look at their proportionate importance I am inclined to think that the weight goes the way I suggest. 1 say this particularly because I remind the honourable member that when we looked at the intake of our invalid pensions at the bottom of the age scale we found that 61 per cent were mentally retarded. The more dramatic case is the quadriplegic or the paraplegic or the person who has lost a limb in a motor accident. I know that these are the most dramatic cases. They are important cases but they are not in number the bulk of the cases. Whereas we want to help both types we have to look at this proportionately and see where the needs are. This is part of the way in which I think we are working towards a co-ordinated programme. Although we are taking il a step at a time it does not follow that we do not have a fairly clear idea of where we are going. Of course, this is subject to the inevitable qualification that I have made that until the first step is taken we cannot be quite certain as to what the next step should be. Rut do not let us dither and do nothing because we do not have a complete plan. Let us see the general direction in which we are going and take steps I agree with the contention of the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) For that there are imbalances between the various States. The sheltered workshop has been developed much more in New South Wales than in other States. On the other hand, aged persons homes are developed much more in South Australia than they are in New South Wales. I would remind the House that our programme here is in a sense open-ended. We have never rejected a worthwhile application on the grounds that we do not have funds. If an application for sheltered workshop assistance is made we will find the funds for that assistance to be given, irrespective of where the application comes from. Let us have more facilities in South Australia or Victoria or Queensland, but do not let us say that we want less in New South Wales.",88
175,Mr HAYDEN,SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT,I did not say that.,90
176,Mr WENTWORTH,SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT,"No , but it might be implied from what the honourable member said. There is an imbalance because there is not the same aptitude to take this up in other States. Let us commend New South Wales here and try to get the other States to come in. Let us correct the balance upwards and not downwards. As I said, the Government's programme is open-ended. Let me come to one or two of the things that were said about detail. I will deal firstly with sheltered hostel equipment. This is subsidisable if it is a fixture but the hostel is not entitled to a subsidy if the equipment is not a fixture. In regard to the subsidy for salaries clause 16D. states that the subsidy is payable as follows: Where(a) a person is employed by an eligible organisation wholly or partly to provide services of a supervisory, medical, counselling or other kind in connection with the employment of disabled persons ih sheltered employment provided by the organisation; The hostel is subsidised because it is necessary for living purposes and if the living is connected with the person's employment then the specialised services in the hostel would be subsidisable for those in sheltered workshops.",90
177,Mr HAYDEN,SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT,But not for those outside.,90
178,Mr WENTWORTH,SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT,But not for those outside. I would tbink that most of them will be in sheltered workshops but we will have a look at this as and when it comes up. The normal running staff of a hostel would not be subsidisable.,90
179,Mr HAYDEN,SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT,If you have 80 per cent of sheltered workshop people accommodated at the hostel it would apply to the 80 per cent.,90
180,Mr WENTWORTH,SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT,"Some such administrative arrangement will be made. The details have not been worked out but 1 tbink that I have spelt out the general principle which will be applied. We are not- 1 think that the honourable member for Oxley asked me to deny this und I do deny it-tryin g to use sheltered workshops on the cheap. We regard them as very efficient instruments and we are looking at them in a way that will ensure that we can get the maximum amount of benefit for handicapped people. In that sense they are being used as he suggested but we are not trying to do things in a pinch-penny way which would cut down the benefits. In point, of fact I believe that the voluntary organisation gives a benefit in a way which the Government organisation as such cannot do as efficiently. There would be very few people-probabl y no more than 1 case in a year in the Commonwealth-wh o would be kept in sheltered workshops unnecessarily to meet the 6 months qualification. I do not think that this is a matter of very great consequence. There is some substance in the point made about competitive quotations and things of that character. The Government has already taken steps to do something about this. I do not know whether I have mentioned this before in the House so I will mention it now. The Government is proposing to subsidise a couple of industrial consultants who will be looking for contracts for sheltered workshops and wbo will be trying to find appropriate jobs, appropriate prices and helping in the management of them. I do not think that these people will be Government employees. I am hoping that they will be subsidised by the Government and attached perhaps to the Australian Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled or perhaps the Australian Sheltered Workshops Association. I think that the honourable member is quite right when he says that there is proper scope for doing this kind of thing. Perhaps I have taken up too much time on this matter but I believe it is one of immense interest to honourable members. I thank honourable members on both sides for their constructive approaches and I assure the House that the Government is looking for ways and means of developing even more satisfactorily the system that we now have. Our present system is only 3 years old as far as the Government is concerned but it is older than that as far as voluntary organisations are concerned. We want to extend it fairly rapidly. I hope that with the assistance of honourable members we will do so. Earlier tonight I referred to the availability of a manual on sheltered workshops. I think that if they will look at this, perhaps in their own electorates they will find an organisation which could be helped and which would benefit by their assistance. By so doing they would be helping handicapped people in their own electorates and, indeed, throughout Australia. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee The Bill. Progress reported. Thursday, 15 October 1970 NA Laevo-dopa - Primary Producers Demonstration-Exercis e of Conscience - Charte r Flights for Migrants-Whea t Motion (by Mr Wentworth) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.",90
181,Dr KLUGMAN,ADJOURNMENT," I should like to speak for just 5 minutes and to raise a problem arising out of the testing of a relatively new drug. I will have to give some technical details to make the point, but basically this is a human problem, as will appear later. Very briefly, the substance concerned is Laevo-dopa, which is the metabolic precursor of dopamine, a transmitter substance present in the basal ganglia of the brain. In a disease called Parkinsonism the concentration of dopamine in these areas of the brain is diminished. This forms the basis for the effectiveness of L-dopa as replacement medication in the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson's syndrome, particuarly rigidity and immobility, not so much of tremor. If honourable members have seen people with Parkinsonism they are probably aware of the symptoms. Treatment with L-dopa, being replacement therapy, is essentially long term. In other words a person must keep on with the substance. Once he goes off the substance the original symptoms reappear. There are many potential side effects. In overseas trials improvement occurred in approximately two-thirds of the patients. This has varied from slight to spectacular but a leading article in the 'British Medical Journal' of February of this year states: Initial improvements may be entirely subjective-increase d vigour and well-being, greater clarity of thought and memory, and a general feeling of increased mobility. Soon unequivocal and sustained evidence of benefit may become apparent I emphasise the word 'may' so as not to give anybody the idea that this works in every case. The article continues: A long immobile fades may become animated, a sparkle returns to the eye, and the gait, posture, dexterity of the hands, speech, and balance may all improve. Particularly convincing is a renewed ability to perform movements which have been lost for several years such as rising from a chair or a lavatory seat and turning over in bed. This renaissance may extend to tasks such as shaving, typing, knitting, playing the piano, and even completing the football pools. An early physical sign of response is that silent dentures, hitherto fitted snugly in an immobile face, rattled freely. In exceptional cases patients confined to bed and wheel chair have walked independently. This drug has not yet been released for general marketing in Australia and its supply is limited to clinical trials. Three companies are importing the drug into Australia. I come now to the reason for raising this question tonight. I understand that applications have been made to place this drug on the list of pharmaceutical benefits. In the first instance, at least, its use would probably be restricted to specialists and hospitals. These seem reasonable restrictions and reasonable delays, looking at it from the point of view of the Government and especially the Department of Health but-and I emphasise the but-wha t happens? A patient who has been treated ineffectively with the usual drugs for years is admitted to clinical trials where the drug is supplied free and he improves. Twothirds of the cases improve dramatically. They are then told: 'We havefinishedour trial. If you want to continue the treatment you must buy the drug yourself.' But to do so would cost between $7 and $10 a week, depending on the source of the supply and the amount of the drug which is used in each case. Having to pay $7 to $10 a week would place a tremendous burden on many elderly people, many of whom are pensioners. Even if they are not pensioners it is a large amount of money for them to have to pay out. 1 appeal to the companies concerned, the clinics taking part in the trials, that the large public hospitals, and the Department of Health to co-operate in order to enable patients who have been helped tc obtain the drug free until it is formally added to the list of drugs available undei the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. To my miud it is bad enough to have a degenerative disease such as Parkinsonism, but when the condition of a patient who has been helped worsens because finance is lacking, it is much worse. I am sure that only a small amount of money woulcl bt involved at this stage, although in the long run it is hoped that the 10,000 sufferers of this disease in Australia may be helped. I ask the Minister for Health (Dr Forbes) to take the appropriate steps to make it possible for the companies and clinical units which are taking part in this work to continue treating with the drug, until such time as the Government makes a final decision on whether it will admit it to the free list, those people who, for financial reasons would be unable to continue to finance their own treatment.",91
182,Dr FORBES,ADJOURNMENT,"Unfortunatel y I was not present when the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) commenced his speech, but 1 assume that he was referring to the drug L-dopa.",92
183,Dr KLUGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,That is right.,92
184,Dr FORBES,ADJOURNMENT,"Perhaps I should inform the honourable member of the situation as I know it. The honourable member referred to the fact that limited quantities of the drug have been imported up until now lor the purpose of clinical trials, which is the normal method of introducing a new drug of this nature. Quite a number of patients have benefited from taking pari in the clinical trials which have been conducted under the control of specialist neurologists. Whenever my attention or the attention of the Department of Health has been drawn to the position of patients who could benefit from treatment by this drug we have put them in contact with the doctors or institutions undertaking these clincial trials. I think it was last month, although it could have been earlier, that the general marketing of the drug in Australia came up in the normal way for consideration by the Drug Evaluation Committee. Two drug is, manufacturers had made application to market L-dopa. One product was approved for general marketing. Consideration of the other company's application was deferred until the company provided additional information about its drug. The position now is that, through the normal processes, the drug has been approved for general marketing. I understand that the company which has obtained approval of its product for general marketing will not be in a positiou to place the drug ou the market before November of this year. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee will be considering the question of listing L-dopa as a pharmaceutical benefit at its next meeting in November. So. if the Committee makes a favourable recommendation in respect of listing, this will coincide more or less with the availability of the drug for general marketing. That is all the information I have in my head, but it may be of interest to the honourable member ancl the House.",92
185,Dr KLUGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,The only point 1 wanted to raise is whether anything can be done in the meantime to cover people who have finished the trials and who do not have the money to pay for the drug until November.,92
186,Dr FORBES,ADJOURNMENT,"Unles s they continue in a trial they cannot, as 1 understand it, get the drug because it is not available. But I will look at that question and see whether there is some way of ensuring continuity between now and November for the people who have benefited from the trial.",92
187,Mr GRASSBY,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to rectify an injustice which has been perpetrated by the Government against people in the Australian countryside who have had the temerity to believe that we have a crisis in the rural sector and that the Parliament should know about it and perhaps apply itself to rectifying it. I refer to the deliberate campaign of sabotage that was waged against the farmers rally in Canberra yesterday. Once it was announced that this rally was to take place, members of the Government in the countryside went into action very well and very efficiently. Let me pay a tribute to those members of the Government and their machine. It is still strong, enduring and capable of convincing people in the countryside who are going bankrupt that all is really well. I want to tell the House of the efforts of a lonely and dedicated primary producer who has been libelled in a quite shocking way by some members of the Government. I refer to Mr Bob Hudson of 'Cowary', Wilcannia, who was the convenor of the rally in Canberra. He acted out of motives of pure loyalty to his family, his neighbours and his colleagues. He gave a lead, and he talked and pleaded with members on all sides of the Parliament for a better deal for country people. He was not member of any political party and he member. never at any time mentioned any party politics. All he wanted was for the Commonwealth Parliament to know and to bull to me. understand what the problems were and to take some action. He sought the support the Edenhope Agricultural Bureau for rally, and i l gave support willingly. sought the support of fellow farmers other States, and they agreed. He invited no fewer than 20 ministers and members of the Government to address the rally. invited only 3 members of the Opposition. Every Government member had some the excuse for not being present, some valid and some not. The 3 members invited from the Opposition benches willingly accepted. The Minister for Primary Indusment try (Mr Anthony) was in Fiji; Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) was at lunch; the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) was at lunch. In some honourable exceptions, they all seemed to be eating. This was the public attitude of the Govinterjection. ernment towards a rally by people who had problems. There was no doubt in my mind or in the minds of the people who did the job that in the background there was a campaign of sabotage led by those freedom fighters for the countryside, the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King) and the honourable member for  labelled the Edenhope Agricultural Bureau, the one body without fear or favour or politics, a body that had stood firm. The organisers of the rally were stooges, according to one Press release. The Government, of course-let us be quite bluntlargely succeeded in its sabotage and its aim. It attempted to discredit a man who had put his time and money into a protest against the present crisis in the countryside. One Government member is reported as having stated to Mr Tom Connors of the 'Australian Financial Review' that he was very pleased to report that he had stopped one busload of farmers on their way to Canberra. He just told them that it was not necessary. Mr King-Who was that?",92
188,Mr GRASSBY,ADJOURNMENT,"Well , Mr Tom Connors has not said, but it is published, and if there is any refutation to be made. I hope it will be made. That was the confidence a that was given to him by a Government",93
189,Mr COPE,ADJOURNMENT,It sounds like Winton Turn,93
190,Mr GRASSBY,ADJOURNMENT,"I would not know. The of South Australian delegation apparently was the betrayed by a man who sold his farmer He neighbours out for political endorsement. in He was able to spirit them away from the rally and to receive a personal and private blessing from the Prime Minister. Then the He Government came forward today with perhaps the ludicrous statement of all-that rally was organised by the honourable member for Riverina. Tonight 1 say lo the Governinent that if 1 want to organise a rally I will do so and I will let Governsupporters know about it. I am quite the Acting capable of managing it. Mr Holten-The honourable member fact, with does not fook like it.",93
191,Mr GRASSBY,ADJOURNMENT,"I am sorry, I did not hear the Minister for Repatriation. If he has something to say I will wait for his Mr Holten-The honourable member did not get many there.",93
192,Mr GRASSBY,ADJOURNMENT,"As the Minister for Repatriation said, it was not a case of 1 did not get too many there, but that the Government's campaign of sabotage succeeded. I hope the honourable members are proud of themselves. I have not heard the honourable member speak in this House on any of the problems of the countryside. But he will have an opportunity tomorrow night when I will take him up on his challenge. Holten challenges Grassby on wheat policy. I say to the Minister: Come into the chamber tomorrow night and we will have a discussion at your convenience. I did not rise tonight to defend myself. Mr Holten-Le t the honourable member defend Labor's policy on wheat.",93
193,Mr GRASSBY,ADJOURNMENT,"I invite the honourable member to come into the Parliament tomorrow night for a change and discuss the policies of the countryside. Accept the challenge. We will be delighted to meet the honourable member on the adjournment. I want to say in relation to the people and Mr Bob Hudson in particular and the Edenhope Agricultural Bureau that it is true they were let down by people. It is true that there was some betrayal, some sabotage, but that does not detract from the good will and good intention of those people. 1 was proud to have assisted them. I have assisted farmer rallies before, even rallies presided over by a Country Party senator, Senator Tom Bull in Narrandera. I have supported and encouraged rallies which were presided over by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) because they seemed to me to have some merit and good intent on behalf of people and not petty party politics. On this occasion I gave my support. Tonight I repeat in the House of Representatives that I was delighted to do so. think it was a miserable action to try to label and to denegrate a man who gave his time and his dedication only for his family and his neighbours in the countryside. I refer to Mr Bob Hudson particularly. I cannot understand how men who come in from the countryside in crisis can turn their backs on people of good will who are doing their best. This was not an attack on !,..„., - nV member for Riverina. It e was an attack on people who had a desire in sonicining better done. The people who were responsible for the labelling and sabotage should be ashamed of themselves. I stand in this House proud of my effort to stand alongside people who were good in their intent and in their intention on behalf of their people.",94
194,Mr JARMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Deakin) (12.34 a.m.)Yesterday in this House we heard Opposition speakers talk about the rights of conscientious objectors. They were not satisfied with the provisions of the National Service Act which gives exemption to genuine pacifists and to those who have a conscientious objection to fighting in all wars. They wanted and they asked for provision for exemption for those who refuse on ground of conscience to fighting against the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Communists in South Vietnam. I do not intend to argue the rights or the wrongs of the case put by the Opposition. I think its arguments were adequately disposed of yesterday. But I instance them here because I wish to point out the inconsistency of the Labor Party and the organisations on its side of politics. Tonight in the South Australian Parliament a censure motion will, I believe, have been moved against the South Australian Labor Government's Minister for Roads and Transport over departmental letters apparently signed by him threatening dismissal of government employees who refuse to join a union. 1 understand that in the past 3 weeks the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, Mr Steele Hall, has twice produced letters to departmental heads to this effect. From Press reports I understand that the Acting Premier of South Australia, Mr Corcoran has said that Mr Hall was correct in his quotation from them. According to the Press Mt Hall said that a departmental letter threatened some Government employees with I dismissal if they refused to join an appropriate union. But here lies the inconsistency and the insincerity of the Labor Party. What about those who, as a matter of conscience, are unable to join a union? Surely to be consistent the Labor Party must make an exception in the case of conscientious objectors to unionism. But as we see from the letters reportedly sent out by the Minister in the South Australian Labor Government, such is not the case Surely if exemption is to be granted to people who have a conscientious objection to fighting in a particular war, to be consistent we must agree to the proposition that anyone who has a conscientious objection to joining a union should also be exempt. On Monday a young lad from my electorate",94
195,Mr COPE,ADJOURNMENT,What about,94
196,Mr JARMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Of course, honourable members opposite do not like hearing these sorts of things. On Monday a young lad from my electorate. Peter Stratford Hocking of 35 Laburnum Street. Blackburn, Victoria, who had gone to Wodonga to take a job with Lamson Paragon Printers, was sacked from that job because, due to pressure from the unions on that firm, the firm has adopted a closed shop policy against anyone who is not a union member. Peter Hocking had conscientious objection based on religious grounds against joining a union and believed that according to his interpretation the teaching of the scriptures would not allow him to do so. He signed a statutory declaration to this effect. As his father said in his letter to me: When approached by shop stewards, he explained that as a believer in the Lord Jesus .and governed by the Word of God he had a conscience about joining the union and being party to its activities and outlook. Now, no matter what one thinks about this lad's religious beliefs",94
197,Mr COPE,ADJOURNMENT,What do you want us (o do about it?,95
198,Mr JARMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"No matter what the honourable member for Sydney thinks about this lad's religious beliefs it is a fact that he had a genuine conscientious objection to joining a union, based on religious grounds. The boy's father spoke to the Assistant Secretary of the Printing and Kindred industries Union nowhere. He then spoke to a Mr Garrett, the Manager of Lamson Paragon Printers and Mr Garrett said, and J quote from Mr Hosking's letter: . . . while Peter was performing his duties satisfactorily and they would be sorry eo see him go, they felt they had to stand by their policy of 'closed shop' and would not alter their decision. The letter continues: Representation was then made to Mr L. Hills, solicitor, of Sydney who contacted Mr Fogarty, the Assistant Secretary of Labour and Industry, Victoria. Following moves between the Company and the Printing and Allied Trades Employers' Federation, a stay of one week was given Peter as it was found that the Country Printers Award covered the position and while embracing a preference to unionists clause carried the provision for application to the Industrial Registrar for a certificate of examption. This was lodged on Sth October 1970. But on Monday Peter Hocking lost his job for no other reason than his conscientious objection on religious grounds to joining a union. How hypocritical does it make the cries of the Opposition for the rights of conscientious objectors against particular laws when they raise no cry of protest for the rights of conscientious objectors to joining a union. Peter Hocking's father has asked me to ask the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Snedden) to see whether a provision can be incorporated in the Graphic Arts Award to this effect: Thai a person who is prevented from being a member of a union on the ground of conscientious beliefs be able to be engaged under the Award, and if already employed not to be dismissed, injured in his employment, or deterred in his position by reason of his circumstances relating to his conscience. I shall place this matter before the Minister as I have been requested to do. But this is not the only instance of this kind of thing. Several weeks ago in Tasmania there was a case of certain men in, I think, Burnie, who for certain reasons, wished not to join a union. The editorial in the Launceston 'Examiner' of 2nd October took this matter up and I will quote it because it is very typical of what people feel about the Labor Party in this matter. It states: The individual has rights, and in a world increasingly indifferent to liberty and individualism, a man's remaining rights must be respected. How this is to be achieved must remain one of the greatest challenges to democratic parliaments. But while it poses as the standard-bearer of conscience, the Labor Party must be consistent in its attitude to compulsory unionism. I would like it to be known to this House and got that I believe a grave injustice has been done to this lad. I believe that Lamson Paragon Printers and the Printing and Kindred Industries Union- I know that members of the Opposition who are interjecting do not like this, Mr Deputy Speaker-stan d indicted for their actions. If Mr Virgo, the South Australian Labor Government's Minister of Roads and Transport, has his way it looks as though we will bave many more cases similar to that of Peter Hocking.",95
199,Mr CHARLES JONES,ADJOURNMENT,The speech we just heard from the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Jarman) shows what a hypocritical humbug he is.,95
200,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT, Order ! I suggest to the honourable member for Newcastle that he withdraw that phrase.,95
201,Mr CHARLES JONES,ADJOURNMENT,"I withdraw it, Sir. The speech we have just heard from the honourable member is a clear indication of what hypocrites and humbugs Government members are",95
202,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order ! I suggest to the honourable member for Newcastle that in the circumstances he also withdraw that remark. The honourable member for Bendigo will remain silent. Mr Kennedy- A point of order,96
203,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order ! The honourable member for Bendigo will resume his seat. Mr Kennedy-Why ?,96
204,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order ! The honourable member for Bendigo will resume his seat. The honourable member for Sydney will resume his seat.,96
205,Mr COPE,ADJOURNMENT,I am taking a point of order.,96
206,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Sydney will resume his seat. The honourable member for Newcastle used a phrase when referring to an honourable member in this House. I then asked the honourable member for Newcastle to withdraw that phrase, which he did. The honourable member for Newcastle then used the phrase in general terms referring to all members of the Government.",96
207,Mr CHARLES JONES,ADJOURNMENT,That is correct.,96
208,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"As the honourable member for Newcastle is aware, in the ordinary circumstances of general comment the Chair does not ask for that phrase to be withdrawn. However, I suggest to the honourable member for Newcastle that it was used immediately after asked him to withdraw it in relation to an individual member, the inference being exactly the same. I suggest to the honourable member for Newcastle that, although this may not be witbin the normal province, in the circumstances he withdraw the remark he made.",96
209,Mr BARNARD,ADJOURNMENT,On the point of order,96
210,Mr CHARLES JONES,ADJOURNMENT,"I am not speaking to any point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.",96
211,Mr COPE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.",96
212,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order ! The honourable member for Newcastle is on his feet.,96
213,Mr COPE,ADJOURNMENT,I am taking a point of order.,96
214,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Th c honourable member for Sydney.,96
215,Mr COPE,ADJOURNMENT,"My point of order is that your ruling does not coincide with that of Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker consistently has told us that we cannot refer to any single member of the Government as a Fascist but we can refer to the Government as Fascist. Vice versa, honourable members on the Government side cannot refer to us individually as Communists but they can call the Opposition Communist.",96
216,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order ! I accept the point of order raised by the honourable member for Sydney. I explained why I asked the honourable member for Newcastle to withdraw. His remark followed immediately after my original request to him to withdraw. I suggested to the honourable member for Newcastle that his second remark was partially a continuation of the remark that he made in relation to an individual member. I have not given a ruling but I have made a suggestion to the honourable member for Newcastle.,96
217,Mr CHARLES JONES,ADJOURNMENT,"You asked me to withdraw a certain remark I made about an individual member. I have withdrawn that. I knew that I had to withdraw it or go out-and he is jipt worth going out over. The Speaker in this place has consistently ruled that generalised statements such as I made are not required to be withdrawn. I remember an occasion on which a Minister sitting at the table called I members of the Australian Labor Party Communists. We debated the whole subject for several hours one Friday or Thursday, and finally the ruling of the Chair was upheld. I say to you that on the basis of previous rulings of the Chair I am not obliged to withdraw my statement. If you are going to be consistent, please be consistent.",96
218,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,1 do not want to take up the honourable member's time. I have already said that I suggested he withdraw the statement. I did not ask him to withdraw it but because of the circumstances I suggested that he do so. The matter is in his hands.,96
219,Mr CHARLES JONES,ADJOURNMENT,"Beggin g your pardon, Sir, you are wasting my time and already 5 minutes of it have gone. I wish to bring forward a matter concerning the snide operations of certain migrant organisations made up of certain people who are setting up clubs and are chartering aircraft to take people overseas. In the very limited time available to me now I would like to put on record a letter which I have received from a Greek naturalised Australian in which he said: Since August this year certain Greek travel agents with their organisations have been charterare ing Qantas aircraft one way to Alliens, Greece the fare of which is $312.50. The poor Greek migrants have been taken for a ride and have been robbed of hundreds of dollars above the right fare. Apart from the 2 charters that have already left, one left on 4th August 1970 and the other on 23rd August 1970, and there is another departing from Tullamarine this Sunday, 20th September 1970. The poor migrants have been openly robbed and/or at this moment also with this charter on 20lh September 1970. These travel agents are charging from $390, $400, $425, $450 and even as much as $500 and $567. They are doing exactly as they did with the previous ters and if they are not stopped they will continue to do the same. As a Greek naturalised Australian I am disgusted and ashamed that these things should be allowed to take place in Melbourne. I have already written lo the honourable Ministers for Civil Aviation and Immigration and as well to the General Manager of Qantas but as yet I have not received any reply. In the time that is available to me I cannot put on record the whole of this man's letter. But the facts are these, and honourable members can check them out with the airline operators. I have found out that the normal full economy fare is $567. Because of charter arrangements the airline operators charge 55 per cent of the full economy fare which means that the correct fare for a charter flight is $312.50. But as this man has said, some of the agents are charging fares as high as $500 and $567. Qantas Airways Ltd is aware of these facts but there is not a great deal that this organisation can do. The point is Ihat Qantas should be taking more positive action than what is being taken at the moment against people who are forming what, in my opinion, are bogus clubs. These people are forming clubs to get people to travel overseas by aircraft. The clubs are charging all sorts of prices and are making exorbitant profits. I believe that the Department of Immigration or the Department of Civil Aviation, if need be, should be investigating these agents. Under no circumstances should the departments be doing any business whatever with them. They should be forcing them out of business, l f need be, they should be letting it be known throughout the trade just what should be done to stop these people. For example, on most authorative advice, I beheve that the Hermes Travel Agency in Lonsdale Street, Melbourne, is a bunch of crooks who have been responsible for taking down people in this category. These facts are known to people in the airline industry. I hope that people who interested in chartering aircraft will have nothing whatever to do with the Hermes Travel Agency in Lonsdale Street, Melbourne. There is much more that I would like to say; but in the few seconds that are left to me let me say that it. is time the Department of Civil Aviation made a full inquiry into these fly by night agencies that are being set up to trap people and to create situations such as the one reported in the Melbourne 'Age' of char- 7th September under the heading Tour Tickets are No Good'. That is a case in which 100-odd Australian citizens are overseas and cannot get back here. They have had to send home for more money so that they can pay their fares from Greece or London back to Australia. It is time the Department of Civil Aviation and the Department of Immigration did something to protect and to assist people in this category.",96
220,Mr GILES,ADJOURNMENT,"f n the brief time at my disposal I wish, first of all, for about 2 minutes, to try to answer the contentions- I think that is as high as I can put them-of the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Grassby). The best way I can do this is to say, firstly, that I was not invited to the rally- I presume, possibly, because he organised it; secondly, that if he did organise it he is not a very good organiser; and, thirdly, that I spoke to Mr Hudson, who is the norminal organiser, the night before. Of course, he lives a long way out and quite plainly he was relying on people who live closer into do a lot of the organising. The point I want to make is that the large South Australian delegation of 3-no t 2, as is commonly supposed-cam e over the night before. T read their remarks from the Adelaide 'Advertiser'. They said that they came to Canberra the night before to 'sniff the political breeze'. The honourable member for Sturt (Mr Foster) is interjecting. I do not think they sniffed him, so he should not get excited. They continued: We came here with an open mind, but after careful consideration we came to the conclusion at 9 o'clock this morning that the rally was not for us. That was a Press statement. It was put in moderate language.",97
221,Mr GRASSBY,ADJOURNMENT,It was put in your language.,98
222,Mr GILES,ADJOURNMENT,"It was put in moderate language. I know very well the language that they use when talking to me. Perhaps it would not have done the Adelaide 'Advertiser' much credit if it had publicised that. This is what happened to a rally that was organised as a political stunt. It is of no use for the honourable member for Riverina to stand up and say, with his hand over his heart: ' I went out and stood with these sincere farmers'. They probably are sincere. But if the honourable member for Riverina had anything to do with the organisation of the rally, one can depend on its having had a certain amount of hokey-pokey about it. That was the attitude of the South Australian members.",98
223,Mr FOSTER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to order. Why does not the honourable member for Angas resume his seat? My point of order is that this man, when on his feet in a debate this afternoon, referred to me as a scab on my mates.",98
224,Mr GILES,ADJOURNMENT,It was not a debate.,98
225,Mr FOSTER,ADJOURNMENT,It does not matter. You made the statement in this House.,98
226,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Lucock) vice - Order ! The honourable member will resume his seat.,98
227,Mr FOSTER,ADJOURNMENT,When can I take order?,98
228,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member for Sturt will resume his seat. The honourable member for Angas also will resume his seat. The ence by the honourable member for Sturt to a matter in an earlier debate in this House has no relevance at the present stage. So there is no substance in the of order.,98
229,Mr FOSTER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise another point of order. Would you be good enough to inform me of what rights have to raise the matter of the scurrilous attack that was made on me this afternoon or this evening in this House? Surely I have some rights here as a member.",98
230,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order ! The honourable member for Sturt will resume his seat. If he has been misrepresented there is a time and place in the proceedings of the House for him to raise the matter. The honourable member for Sturt has no right at this moment to interrupt another honourable member who is speaking and to refer to something that happened earlier this evening.,98
231,Mr FOSTER,ADJOURNMENT,The point of order. I raise,98
232,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member for Sturt will resume his seat.,98
233,Mr FOSTER,ADJOURNMENT,"This is the matter on which you have just spoken. 1 respect your ruling, but why did it not apply to the honourable member for Angas earlier this evening?",98
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! . The honourable member for Sturt cannot refer to what happened earlier this evening.,98
235,Mr GILES,ADJOURNMENT,"I hope that the Opposition will not get too fearful and continue to take points of order because if it does I will take the view that it is frightened of hearing what I am about to say. The point I got up to make tonight arises from a question that was disallowed, with respect, by the Chair at question time. The question was aimed at dealing with the complete inconsistency on the part of the Labor Party which, on the one hand, takes a great interest in the matter of conscientious objection in relation to national serand, on the other hand, in one State anyway, shows a complete disregard for the private liberties of an individual. May a point of I just prove the point? Today in the South Australian Parliament a censure motion was moved against the Minister of Roads and Transport for taking action to force compulsory unionreferism in South Australia. An amendment was moved by, I think, the Premier, or by someone in the Government, saying that >n the opinion of the House support should point be given to the Government's policy of employment preference to unionists. We have had preference to unionists in South Australia and everywhere else for a long 1 time, and I for one am open minded enough on this question to say that T think there is some merit in that stand. But this is not what has occurred in the last week in South Australia. The Minister of Roads and Transport. Mr G. T. Virgo, has given 2 directions which are today public knowledge. It is no use people saying that they are incorrect. They are in public view in South Australia at this point of time for people to look at. The first was a letter to his own Department, the Highways Department, saying that in order to avoid the difficulties of employing non-unionists and in order to avoid the difficulty of direct contact in each instance with people who may or may not be unionists, he would like to arrange to appoint a liaison officer-and I notice that the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia referred to this officer as a political commissar, with some merit, 1 thought-who m unionists can contact should difficulties arise. He was dealing in this letter with workers on the job and also with those applying for a job. However, that is not so important as the next sentence. The next sentence is literally, I think, correct. It is: It is my intention that such an oflicer woulcl contact the employee concerned and offer him' necessary motivation to join the union by ultimatum. Taking into account that it is ungramrights matical-and there is the double use of a word with the second one slightly more insincere. onerous in its emphasis than the first-this is a matter to which one can justly object. The letter is signed by 'GTV, Minister Roads and Transport'. I will not worry the House tonight with the second letter, which is also public property. But this was the key to the probtonight, lem involved. The principle of unionism contrasts strongly with the principle enunciated by the Federal Opposition Leader (Mr Whitlam) when recently he counselled national servicemen to refuse to serve in Vietnam. He said that a should obey the law only as far and as long as his conscience allowed. The analogy between compulsory unionism and comor pulsory military service is close. The prinmoment. ciple involved is the same in each. In the unions membership is not only to be mandatory, but once a man is enrolled he is to for Boothby be tied to union decisions. He will not be able to elect not to join a strike to which he objects. He will not be be able to out of a strike, for instance, serviceman may opt out of service in Vietnam. It is a sheer lack of consistency, lt is the hypocrisy of members ot a party who have their policy dictated to them by people not elected by the Australian people that makes a farce of this situation, ft is farcical for honourable members opposite to act as minions obeying the dictates of people who are not elected. They are slaves to their own system. They have no sincerity and no possibility of saying in this House the things they really believe. What happens to individual liberties under a system like that, which has no provision at all for individual liberties?",98
236,Mr HURFORD,ADJOURNMENT,Where do you stand?,99
237,Mr GILES,ADJOURNMENT,I stand for individual liberties in one degree or another.,99
238,Mr HURFORD,ADJOURNMENT,What about Charles Martin?,99
239,Mr GILES,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member can say what he likes. I believe that national interests have to be taken into account. The sheer inconsistency of the policy of honourable members opposite should be made plain to the people of the Australia. In the name of morality they do way of not have the right to go around Australia saying that they are the upholders of the of individuals in this country. Their own actions prove that to be incorrect and,99
240,Mr FOSTER,ADJOURNMENT," I was hopeful that the Minister for Labour and of National Sen'ice (Mr Snedden) would be in the chamber to hear me speak tonight in the acljournment debate, because I wish to deal with a question that has been raised in a rather fictitious fashion, by 2 obligatory Government supporters. Mr MCLcay-Why do you",99
241,Mr FOSTER,ADJOURNMENT,I will deal with the honourable member for Boothby in a minute. young man I will deal with him first.,99
242,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," I suggest that the House come to order, the Chair will deal with somebody in a",99
243,Mr FOSTER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member,99
244,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member for Sturt will control himself. opt I suggest that both sides of the chamber as a national come to order.,99
245,Mr FOSTER,ADJOURNMENT,"1 inquired of the Minister for Labour and National Service whether the National Service Act contains any provision for exemption on compassionate grounds of members of the community called up for national service. He told me that there was no such provision. On my return to South Australia. I sent the Minister a telegram in regard to this matter. He replied by telegram, which I now have much pleasure in reading. It states: There is no provision whereby exemption callup may be granted in the circumstances have outlined. I will now explain the circumstances 1 outlined. They relate to a widow with 8 children whose husband died suddenly about 12 months ago. Her 19-year-old lad was about to matriculate, but abandoned his education to serve as a counter jumper in a departmental store in Adelaide in order to supplement the family income. A second member of the family similarly cut short her education. Five children of the family are attending school and another child is due to commence in the coming school year. This Government has been so neglectful of the problems of the community that, it has made no provision whatsoever for a lad to be exempted on compassionate grounds. I turn now to another case, lt concerns a woman with 3 sons, 2 of wbom have already served a 2-year stint in Vietnam. A minister of religion and a doctor have said that if her third son has also to serve it will most certainly be extremely detrimental to her health and could mean the loss of her life. Once again there was no ground on which this lad could opt out of service. The Minister will say that this lad must go to the courts with an overbearing attitude. I will have more to say about this matter in the House unless the Minister, on behalf of the Government, is prepared to look squarely in the face some of these human problems which confront the electorate. I invite any honourable member in chamber tonight to put himself in the position I was in, in my 10 feet by 12 feet office with this widow who was asking me for advice on this matter. Was I to stand there, look out the window and say: 'Look, you will comply with what the Governa ment says'. I suppose that I should have turned to the lad, from the point of view of this Government, and said: Look here, son; the penalties of the Crimes Act will be inflicted upon you unless you leave this office with the full knowledge that you will serve your time in Vietnam or anywhere else because a neglectful Government says this to you and this is what you must do'. That is as much as I will say on the matter at this time. Let me deal now with the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Jarman) and the from honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles). you An honourable member who is interjecting was sitting in the chamber a while ago eating a chocolate which was made by trade unionists, carted by trade unionists, sold by a trade unionist and apparently consumed by a renegade. I wish to say this to the honourable member for Angas: What does the Chamber of Manufactures do in South Australia if in fact a small manufacturer wishes to commence business there and he does not join that chamber? Supplies of raw materials such as steel and carpentry requirements are chopped ofi' completely from him. Is this not so? The profit of the chamber each year is $2m and for that they produce nothing and do nothing. They are a burden on the community. You support them. You whispered to your mate, the honourable member for Deakin, on this matter thi* morning when you were sat down, aud properly so, by Mr Speaker. Let me inform you that you have your values completely mixed up in regard to this question. You have the hide to stand here and try to",100
246,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT, Order ! I call the honourable member for Stuart to order. I remind him that he must address the Chair and not direct remarks to a member of the House.,100
247,Mr FOSTER,ADJOURNMENT,"1 thank you for directing my attention to that fact, Mr Deputy Speaker. The fact is that they have their values hopelessly mixed up and muddled. Here we have 2 men who purport to be this responsible people and whom I would describe by saying that truculence is a characteristic of small people. They stand in this chamber and say that a kid who is told by an employer that he must join a union or else, must be considered to have conscientious belief. These honourable members opposite say that we on this side of the House ought to support that young person. They say that we have not supported him. They try to draw a comparison and to say that if we are fair dinkum we on this side of the House ought to be taking a different attitude from the one that we take concerning conscientious objection on the part of those whom this Government wishes to send to be slaughtered with resultant sorrow to widows and mothers. Our troops ought not to be in Vietnam. Nor in my belief was there ever any defence strategy with respect to Vietnam. Anyone on the Government side who still continues to believe that there i* a need for us to be in Vietnam is somewhat foolish. He is not looking at the realities and he is not reading the signs around him in this country today and in the Asiatic region generally. I also wish to talk about",100
248,Mr GRASSBY,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member for Boothby.,101
249,Mr FOSTEK,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes , the honourable member for Boothby. Where is he? He has left the chamber. Here is a man in business in South Australia whose firm has had no compunction in going to the waterfront and causing stevedoring operations to cease whilst it uses a ship, that ship's gear and its cargo, that does not belong to it and is not imported for it, for the purpose of making television advertisements. Yet the honourable member stands in this chamber and speaks against trade unions. He is always talking about Communists and labels the particular trade union that he used as a Communist dominated organisation. But when it suits his business purposes, the honourable member for Boothby permits the trade union to be used. That advertisement is still played on television in Adelaide under his firm's name. So much for their hypocrisy. It is sickening, is it not?",101
250,Mr GILES,ADJOURNMENT,Tell us about compulsory trade unionism.,101
251,Mr FOSTER,ADJOURNMENT,"As far as compulsory trade unionism is concerned, there is Government legislation on the books in this House which in fact says that in some industries if a person is not a member of an appropriate trade union that person does not work. It followed the Hursey judgment. Do Government supporters remember, or have they short memories? There is Government legislation. The honourable member may ask his colleague, the Minister tor Labour and National Service (Mr Snedden), who is not in the House at the moment. If the Minister knows enough about his Department, I am sure that he will confirm what I have said. General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd has a closed shop agreement. Myers in Melbourne, I believe, has a closed shop agreement. Many such firms have. Is there anything wrong with that? - A closed shop agreement operates in the medical fraternity. The honourable member for Deakin, I understand, is in a professional organisation. If he was not in it, he probably could not practice his profession. He has no compunction about that. Let him get up and test the principles of conscientious objection with his own organisation and within the realms in which he may move from time to time. The Government talks about loyalties and the question of conscience. What did the Government do to a former member of this House who dared stand in this House and seek an inquiry on a matter in which he thought justice had to be done. On his own conscience, mark you, he demanded that the Government make another inquiry into the 'Voyager' incident. What did the Government do to Mr St John. Where were the Liberal Party's fine, upstanding principles on individual rights on that occasion? They floated completely out of their convenient minds or their miuds of convenience-put it which way you like. I inform members of the Liberal Party that it is no good their coming into this House after crawling around the corridors all day thinking how they can get these matters before the House on the motion for its adjournment, believing that their alley is good and that their halos above their heads are such that they have nothing to fear, when their own house is not in order. So far as the matter in South Australia is concerned, Mr Corcoran, the Deputy Premier of South Australia, who was mentioned by the honourable member for Deakin did not, I am quite certain, put the matter in the terms in which it was put in this place tonight. He did not do this at all. Nor did the Minister referred to by the honourable member for Deakin put the matter in the exact terms in which the honourable member for Angus put it in this Chamber tonight. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the people who sit on the Government side have done nothing but use subterfuges for about 20 years to hoodwink the electors. They do not hoodwink the Opposition. That is most certain. If they want to continue in this vein and if they want to accept a challenge in this respect, as far as I personally am concerned in this matter or any matter, I will be only too happy to accommodate them.",101
252,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT, Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,102
253,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT," I want to correct a misconception of the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Turnbull), who in this House this evening made certain allegations against me regarding wheat. It has come to my notice over a period of time that the honourable member for Mallee has been running around the countryside telling producers that I have been opposed to paying $1.10 a bushel as a first advance to wheat growers within the quota. This has come to my notice on several occasions. Mr Kennedy-Would you say he was a liar?",102
254,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"If I say that, it will be unparliamentary. He has attempted to justify this tonight by quoting from a speech I made. I have had the privilege now of reading that speech. Not one sentence in that speech justifies his contention. What he is trying to say or maliciously imply is that I am opposed to paying wheat farmers $1.10 a bushel for the first advance, despite the fact that in this ment on behalf of the Opposition I supported the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Anthony), f have supported that statement many times in public and yet the honourable member has the temerity to say this outside many times. I assume that he will deny it. I have heard from other sources that he said it. In this House again tonight he attempted to say it.",102
255,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT, Order! I would suggest to the honourable member for Dawson that he cannot revive a debate that has been held in this House previously.,102
256,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I am just referring to it. What I said is quite clear. I assume would have the backing of every sensible member of this Parliament. With regard to the moneys being made available by the Commonwealth or through the Reserve Bank to the Wheat Board for advance to farmers, this is the accepted principle of making a first advance payment. What I said was that where you have a position of surpluses, where you have a position of uncertainty, you have to be extremely careful in the upper limit of what is advanced. That is entirely what the Minister for Primary Industry also said, in more blunt language than I used. This is what I said: It is obvious to everybody, to the industry and to the Government, that last year there would be large sums of money un repaid in respect of the 1968-69 harvest. The Government then made another advance of $440m. Looking at it in perspective now That is in 1970 we see a total of $440m as the first advance for last year's crop and approximately $2S0m in unsold wheat or the equivalent still on hand. This amounts to a loan of from $650m to $700m having been made. The disturbing thing of which Parliament must take note This was also stated by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Anthony) is the very serious economic problem of the consequence of making large advances to anyone when that money has been spent and the product for which it has been advanced has not been sold. In other words, how long can we continue to do this? This is the basis of the quota system-a n upper ceiling on the amount of Commonwealth liability. All I was doing was warning the Government, which the Minister for Primary Industry did and I Parliawill later quote what he said. I said: The Government has now been warned about what can happen by being a guarantor for large proportions of wheat that cannot be sold at this point of time. The Minister for Primary Industry said even more than that. He in fact warned the industry that if it went above that ceiling he would reduce the $1.10. I do not think the honourable member for Mallee has even done his homework. I. wiil now quote what the Minister for Primary Industry, his office boy as the honourable member has referred to him, said Mr TurnbuU-That is completely untrue.",102
257,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"You know that is the it truth. This is what the Minister for Primary Industry said on 30lh April 1969: 'The limit of $440m must be observed. The amount is a large one. As honourable members know, the industry, through the Wheat Board, is now heavily indebted to the Reserve Bank and is likely to have an overdraft of as much as $200m at the time when advances on the next crop will be around their peak. In other words, there may be as much as $640m advanced to the industry in the early months of 1970.' That is exactly what I said. I suggest the honourable member for Mallee listen to this. The Minister continued: 'Let me make it clear that the sums I have mentioned will not be exceeded'. A warning. The Minister continued: 'If quotas are not implemented and if the quantity delivered to the Wheat Board exceeds 357 million bushels, then the first advance will have to be something less than $1.40'. This is far more than I ever said. Is the honourable member for Mallee going around the countryside saying that the Minister for Primary Industry said they will get less than $1.40? I ask the honourable member for Mallee to have some respect for the spoken word. He knows full well that what I said was a complete endorsement of Government policy on this, - because we argued in this Parliament for most of last year on the wheat crisis that there had to be some control on production and if the industry had a larger peak it was obvious that the first advance payment would have to be reduced. At no stage have I ever indicated, as the honourable member has been alleging about the countryside, that I am opposed to paying $1.10 as a first advance to wheat farmers. It is an untruth and he knows it.",102
258,Mr TURNBULL,ADJOURNMENT,"Mallee) (1.18 a.m.)First of all I take exception to the last words of the honourable member son (Dr Patterson). The words were: It is an untruth and he knows it'. I cannot talk to the new members in the House but I million can talk to the older ones who have been covering here for years. If the new members talk to the older members they will find I have actual never been accused of not telling the truth bushels, in all my years here. Before I refer to what has been said- I can prove that what big money. 1I have been saying is true- I want to deal with what has been said about the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Anthony). The of honourable member for Dawson could not madetheanother help but say what he did. Perhaps he tried to control his remarks. After all, the first and best victory he could have is the victory of self control. He tried to control himself, but he had to say-h e knew that I had explained this before-that I called the Minister for Primary Industry an office boy. The circumstances of what happened need to be explained. I spoke at a big meeting of wheat growers at Bendigo. I said that they should go to Canberra and arrange to meet the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr MCEwen), the Treasurer (Mr Bury) and the Minister for Primary Industry in a panel. Someone said that this would be impossible but I had done it already for the dried fruits industry. I said: 'What you are doing is seeing one Minister, say the Minister for Primary Industry, and then you may see the Prime Minister or the Treasurer. You will be seeing different Ministers but you will be putting your case chiefly to the Minister for Primary Industry. He will be going backwards and forwards to Cabinet and you will have him running about like a messenger boy. I said 'like a messenger boy'. I did not say 'office boy*. That is completely wrong. I hope that the honourable member for Dawson did not know the truth because I would like to think that he tells the truth. [ had been going around the country and I was just as ashamed of the statement. I am about to quote as the honourable member should be. The only place I quoted it was in the debate I had with the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Grassby) at Barham. I had already quoted it in the House some time prior to that. Hansard will verify that. Let me read one or two things that were said by the honourable few member for Dawson in a speech made on for DawI Oth March. He said: The Minister gave an estimate with respect to the 1968-69 wheat harvest of deliveries of 435 bushels which involved the Reserve Bank the first advance and expenses of $509m. That estimate was sadly wrong. As we know, the deliveries were in excess of 500 million and the loan from the Reserve Bank to tlte growers had Co be increased. Provision was made for a loan of up lo S634m, which is very Il was obvious to everybody, to the industry and to the Government, that last year there would be large sums of money unrepaid in respect 1968-69 harvest. The Government then advance of $440m. Looking at it tn perspective now, in March 1970, we see a total of $440m as the first advance for last year's crop and approximately $250m in unsold wheat or the equivalent still on hand. This amounts to a loan of from $650m to $700m having been made. The disturbing thing of which Parliament must take note is the very serious economic problem of the consequence of making large advances to anyone when the money has been spent and the product for which it has been advanced has hot been sold. This is the very serious problem with which we are faced now and with which we will be faced this time next year. In anybody's logic it economically to provide large loans or finance for anything that is difficult. The money has been spent but the wheat which it represents has not been sold. 1 will go further. The honourable member for Dawson later stated: The Opposition gives warning that if this state of affairs arises next year very serious consideramake tion must be given to it. The Government has now been warned about what can happen by being a guarantor for large proportions of wheat that cannot be sold at this point of lime. The point that I make is that the honourable member for Dawson is condemning the advance of money on wheat that has not been sold.",103
259,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,Rubbish .,104
260,Mr TURNBULL,ADJOURNMENT,Of course he is. I will read the passage again. It reads: The Government has now been warned about what can happen by being a guarantor for large proportions of wheat that cannot be sold at this point of time. During his speech just now the honourable member for Dawson said: ' I will quote what the Minister for Primary Industry said'. But honourable members will notice that he did not quote it at all. I challenge him to quote it in the words that appear in this document.,104
261,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,I did quote it. I have it here.,104
262,Mr TURNBULL,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member said he would quote it but he did not.,104
263,Dr PATTERSON,ADJOURNMENT,I did quote it. I read it out.,104
264,Mr TURNBULL,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member did not quote it on the lines that I have here. Let me go further on this matter. The honourable member for Dawson in making his speech got himself into a very serious position. There is no doubt about that. Honourable members opposite may laugh if they wish, but what would have been the position of the wheat industry if the advances had not been made? The advances for this coming year were announced 6 months before it was to be made. It was announced in about March. Previously we have always found out about it in November. Supposing the Govis wrong ernment said: 'We have been warned by the the honourable member for Dawson of the consequences of making these advances. We must take notice of this warning because he is the shadow Minister for Primary Industry. We must take notice of what he says. Therefore we will not the advance on this coming harvest of $1.10 a bushel because there is too much money out at the present time and we have been warned by the shadow Minister for Primary Industry.' This would be a very dangerous situation. I and this fine body of men behind mc in the Country Party believe that these advances are justified. We believe that the advances have to be made this year-as they are being made-and we believe that they will have to be made next year and the year after that. If a time comes when quotas disappear and we return to normal and we find that an amount of $300m or $400m is owing by the wheat growers for these advances on wheat that was not sold, then I believe that whatever government is in office should wipe the slate clean. ] say this because we know-and it has been said by members of the Labor Party in this place-that primary industry is the very basis of the prosperity and progress of this nation. Primary industry is the main factor in our national life. The clipping of the golden fleece, the harvesting of the golden grain and the cultivation of countless other products of the soil are so important lo this country that we will not take any notice of the warning that I have quoted and which appears in Hansard and which was issued by the shadow Minister for Primary Industry, the honourable member for Dawson.

The rates for these royalties and rents are determined by or under Northern Territory Legislation. Royalty payments from the Groote Eylandt Mining Company Pty Ltd operation are payable as determined by the Northern Territory Mining Ordinance 1939-1969 and are at double the normal rate that applies outside an Aboriginal reserve. The total amount paid into the Trust Fund from this source was $576,090 at 30th June 1970. The Company also pays by private arrangement special royalties approximating half the Government royalties to the Church Missionary Society. These funds are used for the benefit of Aboriginal residents on Groote Eylandt. The Groote Eylandt Aboriginal Trust, the executive members of which are all Aborigines, exercises the power of disposihave tion of royalty payments made to the Society. Royalty payments from the bauxite operation at Gove, Arnhem Land, are payable as set out in Clause 3 of the Special Mineral Lease appended to the Agreement which was approved by the Northern Territory Mining (Gove Peninsula Nabalco Agreement) Ordinance 1968 and which is published as a schedule to thut Ordinance. No payments are expected from this source before 1971. Royalty payments from the Western Nuclear (Australia) Pty Ltd operation are payable as determined by the Nonhern Territory Mining Ordinance 1939-1969, and are at double the normal rate. Royalties on this operation are not yet payable. An amount of $3,379 has been paid into the Trust Fund up to 30lh June from royalties from various other timber operations on Aboriginal reserves. in no case has the legal title to the land within an Aboriginal reserve been vested in the Aboriginal people. Legislation has been passed by the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory to enable leases of land within Aboriginal reserves to be granted to individual Aborigines or to Aboriginal groups for pastoral, agricultural or misceilane«.is purposes. Under this legislation land within un Aboriginal reserve can only be leased to Aborigines, and leases cannot be transferred to non-Aborigines. Burdekin River Project (Question No. 1380)",105
267,Mr WHITLAM,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"the Prime Minister, upon notice: What has been the (a) date, (b) nature and (c) outcome of any communications between the Commonwealth and Queensland concerning the Burdekin River project since his answer to me on 19th September 1969 (Hansard, page 1713). Mr Gorton-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In my answer to Question No. 1754 on 19th September 1969 I said that the tuning, nature and extent of the Commonwealth's participation in the reappraisal of the Burdekin River Scheme were to be worked out by appropriate Commonwealth and State officials. On 20th August 1969, the Secretary, Department of National Development asked the Queensland Co-ordinator-General of Public Works if he would arrange for an inventory to be provided of the information held by Queensland authorities on the natural resources, agricultural and engineering investigation findings and development programmes relative to the Burdekin. In response, material was provided by the Coordinator-General on 2nd and 9th March 1970. In a letter dated 5th June 1970 from the Secretary of the Department of National Development and a reply dated 10th June 1970 from the Co-ordinator-General, it was agreed that a group of senior Commonwealth and State officers will confer to discuss the material which has been collated, in addition to the correspondence referred to, there been several discussions between Commonwealth aud State officials on points of detail. The purpose of these communications has been to determine the overall extent of the reappraisal and the further work which will be necessary with a view to reaching agreement on the timing, nature and extent of the Commonwealth's participation in the reappraisal. Civil Aviation: Australia-Unite d States (Question No. 1452)",107
268,Mr WHITLAM,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (1) Between which airports in the United States and Australia does any United States airline provide, but Qantas not provide, direct services. (2) When will Qanias be permitted to provide services between those United States and Australian airports.",108
269,Mr SWARTZ,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"Th c Minister for Civil A v i ation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Los Angeles at the present time. (2) Bilateral Air Services Agreements normally permit an airline a free choice of points in its own country but stipulate the precise points that it can serve in the territory of the other party anrl this applies lo the Australia/USA Air Agreement Currently, Qantas can exercise trallic rights al Honolulu, San Francisco and New York. An amendment lo the Agreement to enable the Australian airline to serve other points in the United Suites is not being contemplated at the present lime. Civil Aviation: AustraliaYugoslav Services (Question No. 1453)",108
270,Mr WHITLAM,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: Wby does Qantas not yel provide services between Australia and Yugoslavia which has now become the Ihird largest source of migrants to Australia.",108
271,Mr SWARTZ,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"The Minister for Civil A v i ation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The feasibility of introducing a scheduled service catering for the regular travelling public between Australia and Yugoslavia has recently been studied by Qanias. It was concluded that the amount of normal traffic with its origin and destiaircraft nation in Australia and Yugoslavia is not sufficient to commercially justify the introduction of a viable scheduled service on this route at the present lime. The amount of traffic available between Australia and other countries, including Yugoslavia, is reviewed from time to time by Qantas as part of the airline's continuing assessment of the need to develop further its services. In recent months, Qantas, and the Yugoslav airline JAT, have commenced operating charter flights out of Belgrade to provide for Yugoslav migrants travelling by air to Auslralia. JAT has also operated several affinity group charter flights under the Commonwealth Government's charter policy. Civil Aviation: A i r c r a ft Noise Services (Question No. 1493)",108
272,Mr MORRISON,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (1) Did recommendation No. 5 of the Interim Report from the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise presented in June 1970 recommend that the Department of Air and the Department of Civil Aviation institute an extensive investigation of complaints into the effects of overflying aircraft on structures so as lo establish the cause of damage. (2) If so, what steps (a) bnve been taken, and (b) are intended to be taken by the Department of Civil Aviation to implement this recommendation.",108
273,Mr SWARTZ,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"The Minister for Civil A v i ation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) All complaints received by my Department concerning .damage to buildings allegedly from the effects of overflying aircraft are investigated. In the absence of precise data on the strength of vibration, wake turbulence and engine exhaust velocity at the disturbances between aircraft and Ihe buildings concerned it is difficult to establish the effect, if any, of the overflying aircraft on the buildings. In many cases, the cause of damage lo buildings has been directly attributable to sources other than the overflying aircraft. On Ihe initiative of my Department, the University of Sydney was requested to carry out a study on the strength and behaviour near the ground of wake turbulence left behind aircraft during take-off. Although this work produced useful data it simultaneously indicated the complexity in predicting with any accuracy the strength of the turbulence at any point in given circumstances. This has been confirmed by more extensive research conducted overseas on the subject. Although this work was motivated by consideration of safety for following aircraft, it does have application to the possible effect on structures on the ground. As aircraft increase in weight and size the effects of wake turbulence and possibly engine exhaust velocity could increase. Whether or not have been responsible for property damage in this country up to the present time or whether or not damage claims are likely to increase as aircraft increase in size, I believe Ihat the matter is quite important and that the Select Committee's recommendation should he pursued. The course of action that would appear to be appropriate from this point, I believe, is for the Department of Air and my Department to refer the matter of further research to an existing establishment, such as the Aeronautical Research Laboratories in the Department of Supply and I have already written to my colleague the Minister for Air in this regard. The honourable member will appreciate, I am sure, that my Department of Civil Aviation has neither the expertise nor the necessary equipment to undertake a study such as the Select Committee has in mind and, although I cannot speak for my colleague the Minister for Air. I would think that much the same situation would apply in his Department. In summary, what 1I have suggested to my colleague is that we make a joint approach to the Minister for Supply asking whether ARL could make a proper study of the possibility of damage to buildings, dwellings, etc., being caused by trailing vortices, vibration, sonic booms and the like.

277,Mr SWARTZ,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"The Minister for Civil A v i ation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) Insofar as my Department of Civil Aviation is concerned, I can assure the honourable member that the spirit of the Select Committee's recommendation will be met in the future as it has in the past. As I have pointed out on numerous occasions my Department is extremely conscious of the aircraft noise problem in all its aspects and I believe it would be true to say that all of the items listed in paragraph 6.3.3 (a) to (f) of the Select Committee's Report have in fact been receiving my Department's 'continuing attention' for some considerable time. However, the recent establishment of a new Noise Abatement Branch in my Department's Central Office will enable it to pursue an even more active role in the investigation and evaluation of aircraft noise problems and to plan, develop and establish standards and procedures for aircraft noise abatement on a Commonwealth-wide basis, thus ensuring no relaxation of effort in the perpetuation of Recommendation 10.

278,Mr MORRISON,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (1) Did Recommendation 11 of the interim Report from the House of Representatives Select Conimittee on Aircraft Noise presented in June 1970, recommend that at Sydney during the hours of curfew (i l p.m. lo 6 a.m.) movements be confined to operations over Botany Bay except in cases of emergency.

279,Mr SWARTZ,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"The Minister for Civil A v i ation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (0 Yes. (2) On the basis that the Select Committee envisages the term 'emergency' to include those occasions where use of the north-south runway is precluded because of operational reasons (which would, ot course, include safely), I believe I can slate wilh every confidence that the Committee's recommendation is already being met by my Department and will continue to be met in the future. My Department's air traffic controllers at Sydney (and elsewhere for that matter) have very explicit instructions in respect of adherence to noise abatement procedures and they do not permit operations other than over Botany Bay during the hours in question unless valid operational reasons such as strong crosswinds, low cloud base and/or visibility preclude such an arrangement. In summary, therefore, 1 believe I can assure the honourable member that this recommendation is already being met in every respect. Civil Aviation: Aircraft Noise (Question No. 1499)",109

(2) if so, what steps (a) have been taken, and (b) are intended to be taken to implement this recommendation.",110
281,Mr SWARTZ,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"The Minister for Civil Avipublic ation has provided the following answer to demand. the honourable member's question: (t) Yes. (2) Recommendation 12 deals with a most difficult aspect of the aircraft noise problem that the Select Committee requests that the criessential teria authorising jet movements in curfew hours be applied more stringently to ensure the preserable vation of the original intention of the regulation. As the honourable member will is a curfew imposed on jet aircraft operations at a number of our major capital city airports. shall From time to time approval is sought by the operators to either continue an off-schedule operaapproval tion into the curfew hours or to conduct flight, some or all of which is to be carried out during such hours. In the case of off-schedule operations, either my Departmental officers or myself are faced with the problem of weighing the inconvenience caused to the residents living in the vicinity of ports in question, versus the inconvenience upon notice: caused, in the case of a single aircraft, to upwards of 100 airline passengers who, were they not able to continue to their ultimate destination, could be faced with the possibility of being stranded without the necessary items normally carried by the overnighting passenger-in many cases the situation is likely to be much more serious because of medical problems. Additionally, the companies would be placed in a very difficult sible. position and the travelling public seriously inconvenienced if aircraft were not available for positioning at the appropriate departure points for commencement of each day's operations because mendation. of enforced overnight stays at some intermediate point. In the case of the special flights, these my specific approval and are very carefully considered from all aspects. Normally, they are granted during holiday periods such as Christmas, Easter and certain school vacation periods when the overall public need for seating availability exceptionally high. The honourable member will appreciate that the airlines normally operate with a limited number of aircraft, most of which ticularly the jets) have a very high utilisation involving quite high load factors, i.e. compared with many overseas countries. It will be seen, therefore, that the most practical and economic way to meet the minimum public need during the peak periods mentioned is to permit a cenain number of special flights to operate during the curfew hours-eve n then, many persons wanting to fly interstate are precluded from doing so because of the non-availability of aircraft seats. There are two alternatives to the current arrangement, neither of which I believe would be acceptable in the overaU public interest The first, which would be completely unrealistic as well as grossly uneconomic, would be to have the companies equip themselves with sufficient aircraft to cater for the peak holiday period loadings outside curfew hours, a situation which would result in a considerable amount of excess capacity in what is recognised as a notoriously high capital cost industry. Higher fares doubtless would be only one of the penalties. The remaining alternative would be to ban special flights altogether, thus failing by a signi6cant margin to serve the overall interest during periods of high travel In essence, therefore, the approval of special flights is a matter of judgment on my part, but 1 believe I can say with conviction that I approve in of no more special flights than are absolutely to meet the needs of the air travelling public as a whole, many of whom are still not to travel when they wish during peak holiday periods as it is because of the particularly high be aware, there demand for air travel. I can assure the honourable member that 1 continue to judge each special flight application in its merits as 1I have in the past and shall only be given for such flights in a special cases of genuine necessity.

283,Mr SWARTZ,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"The Minister for Civil Aviation has provided the following answer to require the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) Whilst appreciating the Select Committee's opinion that even a minor variation in the flight is path of an aircraft may produce a marked relief for people living in noise-sensitive areas around airports, nevertheless there is a limit to the extent (parthat my Department can or should go, having rate regard to safety, by way of requiring large, heavily-laden aircraft to manoeuvre close into an airport. The flight path is very largely governed by the requirement to approach straight in from a distance of some 5-7 miles, or even more, especially when an ILS (instntment landing system) or other approach aid is used. Similarly, except in low density traffic conditions, departure tracks are governmed by separation requirements which do not permit a great deal of flexibility in the choice of such tracks. However, 1 sbould like the honourable member to be' aware that my Departmental officers are continually re-appraising all aspects of aircraft operations in the vicinity of airports with a view to keeping aircraft noise levels to a minimum at all times and, in view of the Select Committee's specific recommendation, f bave asked all concerned to pay particular attention to the express wishes of the Conimittee as set out in Recommendation 13.

285,Mr SWARTZ,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"The Minister for Civil A v i ation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) Generally, airspace is at a premium in mosl of our major terminal areas because of the met. conflicting requirements of civil and military airspace. However, in view of the prominence now given to the aircraft noise problems as a result the Select Committee's activities, it may be sible to influence the military authorities, through the local Air Co-ordinating Sub-Committee, to accede to any future requests my Department may have for additional airspace, or for more flexibility in the use of shared airspace, if it clear that such action would provide worthwhile improvement. I think it would be fair comment to say that, even in a busy and complex terminal area such as Sydney, my Department has an extremely good of working arrangement wilh all military authorities, particularly since a special interdepartmental review of airspace within 100 miles of Sydney Airport was made in 1963. It would also be true to say, I believe, that re-arrangement of the airspace in the Sydney terminal area would not see any significant alleviation of the aircraft noise problems. The current civil/military air traffic control working arrangements, particularly since the establishment of a RAAF Sector in the Sydney Area Approach Control Centre, leave little to be desired traffic rarely is denied access to military airspace. This is not to say that matters would not be made easier from an air traffic control point view in terms of greater flexibility where more Australia. airspace allocated for civil purposes, mil, a -< the main source of noise at Sydney (and al other airports, too, for thut matter) is from aircraft either in the approach or departure phases within, say, 10 miles or so f/om the airport, I can envisage lillle or nu noise alleviation resulting from the allocation of more airspace for civil purposes. in any event, the honourable member has my assurance that my Department of Civil Aviation will follow up the spirit of the recommendation wilh a view to effecting further alleviation of the aircraft noise problem whenever possible.

In 1945-46 a grant of $2,000 was made available to the United Nations Association, the successor organisation to the League of Nations Union, in 1948, the Australian National Committee of United Nations was formed, to include sentatives of a number of voluntary organisations including the United Nations Association. The be(4) Australian National Committee of - United Nations and the United Nations Association continued to receive annual grants. In April 1950 a new body, the United Nations Association of Australia, was formed by the amalgamation of the United Nations Association and the Australian National Conimittee of United Nations.

(3) Has his attention been drawn to the stated aims of the Asthma Action Society which seeks An to support Dr James in the expansion of his work through (a) establishment of a central clinic to combine the training of medical personnel in the James system of asthma management with the treatment of asthmatics by these methods and (b) the stibsequenl foundation of district asthma clinics using the James system of asthma managereprement in centres throughout Australia. If so, what Commonwealth Assistance can given towards the fulfilment of these aims.",112
290,Dr FORBES,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Yes. The National Health and Medical Research Council conducted an investigation and reported in November 1969, that: '(1) The available evidence suggests that the methods used by Dr James have been notably successful in cases of asthma treated by him. However, there is no evidence $ before the Council to suggest that greater success could be expected using Dr James' methods than could be achieved using other accepted methods, including physical methods, in treating asthma. (2) There is nothing sufficiently unique in Dr 15,000 James' methods to warrant conducting a full-scale, objective, clinical trial. (3) The good results achieved by Dr James emphasise not only the value of physiotherapy in the treatment of asthma, but also the importance of gaining the patient's full confidence and co-operation. (4) Dr James' methods have now been well documented and could be made available to medical practitioners who may wish to use them. There should no longer be concern that the knowledge of Dr James' methods will be lost.' Dr James has subsequently claimed that the 1950 1960 1970 Council was not fully aware of ail the details of carriedhis treatment at the time the assessment was out. The Council, in consequence, asked Dr James to provide full documentation of his and an objective report on the results he has achieved, so that any information not available for the original investigation can be further considered by the Council. Dr James has provided this information, and this will be discussed at the .. 195,000 next Session of the Council in late October, 1970. . . 97,500 (3) Yes. (4) The provision of medical and hospital services to the community is primarily a State Government responsibility. Each State must therefore determine its own policy in regard to this or any other form of treatment. Man-made Fibres (Question No. 1674) Dr. J. F . Cairns asked the Minister for Trade and Industry, upon notice: (1) Have representations been made since the enactment of the Customs Tariff Bill 1970 for changes in Schedule 13 of that Act, or for action to offset or modify the effect of that Schedule. (2) If so, what were these representations, and what action has been taken as a result of them. Mr MCEwen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The tariff changes followed adoption by the Government of a Tariff Board report on man made fibres and yarn. Firms in the indusiry, and the Textile Council of Australia, have made representations to the Government expressing concern about a number of issues raised by the adoption of this Report in April of this year. The industry believed that the lower rates of duty which followed the adoption of the report could be damaging to the entire textile and apparel industries. I indicated to representatives of the indusiry thnt the Government could not consider taking action merely on the expressed disquiet of the parties involved. There was an obvious need for the Government and the industry together to watch the effects of the new duties on the Australian industry, l f it could be shown from the evidence available that serious damage was occurring, or was likely to occur, then an application could be made for a reference to the Special Advisory Authority. The Authority has the power to recommend temporary duties. A Liaison Commiitee consisting of members of the Textile Council and officers of the Department of Trade and Industry was established shortly after the new rates were introduced. Special arrangements were made to supply the Textile Council with statistics on imports and these figures have been regularly discussed with the Commiitee, along with trends within the Australian industry. I am informed that to date there is no evidence of any upsurge in imports, but the position will remain under close watch. The industry also sought a review of existing and proposed by-law procedures. As you know, the administration of by-laws is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Customs and Excise. I am informed that the Liaison Commiitee has had useful discussions on this issue, and as a result by-law entry has been accorded until the end of this year on yarns which were previously dutiable at non-protective rales or admitted under by-law. This decision was welcomed by the industry, and discussions are continuing to determine the longer-term position under the by-law situation. Taxation: Works of A r t (Question No. 1695)",112
291,Mr WHITLAM,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"the Treasurer, upon notice: What would be the loss to revenue which would result if (a) deductions were allowed under the Income Tax Assessment Act for gifts for works of art to be exhibited in parks or squares or buildings open to the public and (b) exemptions were granted under the Estate Duly Assessment Act for works of art devised or bequeathed for exhibition in parks or squares or buildings open to the public (Hansard, 21 April 1970. page 1379). Mr Bury-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Gifts of S2 and upwards to a public library, public museum or public art gallery are allowable under section 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act as deductions for income tax purposes. Deductions are also available under this provision for gifts to such institutions of property purchased by the taxpayer within 12 months immediately preceding the making of the gift. No statistics are available that would enable a reliable estimate to be made of the loss to revenue that would result from extending the range of gifts deductible for income tax purposes to cover all gifts of the kind mentioned in the honourable member's question. (b) Bequests of works of art lo public libraries or religious institutions are exempt from estate duty whether or not they are for exhibition in buildings or areas open to the public. Bequests of works of art to public museums and public art galleries in Australia are exempt from estate duty at bequests for public education purposes. No information is available on which a reliable estimate could be made of the loss lo revenue that woulcl arise if the range of bequests exempt from estate duty were extended to cover all bequests of the kind referred to in Lhe honourable member's question. Kangaroos (Question Nn. 1704) Dr JF CAIRNS asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: Will he, in the hope thut it will guide action to ensure preservation of all species of kangaroos in Australia and of pastures at the same time, arrange for discussions with State Ministers and his own Ministers particularly those who have presented petitions asking for protection for kangaroos and prohibition of export of kangaroo meat and skins, to see if a cease fire in the killing of kangaroos in Australia can be decided upon and enforced until the report of the Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation becomes available. Mr Gorton-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As the honourable member will be aware, the direct responsibility for the conservation of wildlife lies with the States except in respect of those Territories administered by the Commonwealth. The shooting of kangaroos is either forbidden or controlled in the Commonwealth Territories. The Australian Fauna Authorities Conference, which met in Darwin last May, discussed the widespread public, concern that the kangaroo was in danger of extinction and expressed its confidence that there was no such threat. In the light of this view, further discussions with the Slates would appear unnecessary at this juncture. Nevertheless the position will be kept under review. The Government's desire to ensure the preservation of all species of kangaroos and other wildlife has been clearly demonstrated through the establishment of the House of Representatives Select Committee to enquire into these matters. The matter will be given further consideration in the light of that Committee's report. (Question Nn. 1717) Mr Enderby asked the Minister for the Interior, upon notice: (1) Has he stated that the Govermnent does not recognise traditional Aboriginal land rights; if so, what is the explanation of, and what are the reasons for, this policy. (2) Does the Government have any alternative to the granting of land rights to Aboriginals. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government's policy was explained in my statement in the House of Representatives on 3rd September 1970-se e pages 967 to 973 of Hansard. (2) Aborigines can and do own land. As mentioned in the statement referred to in (1) above, the Government believes that they should secure land ownership under the system that applies to the Australian community, and not outside it. (Question Ni>. 1721) Mr Wallis asked the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice: (1) Has there been any approach to the Office of Aboriginal Affairs for financial assistance in the purchase of Mount Arden Station, near Port Augusta, South Australia, for development by Aborigines as a rural property. (2) If so, were any feasibility studies carried out by any section of the Office of Aboriginal Affairs to determine whether this property could be developed as (a) a viable property which could be successfully worked or (b) a training area for Aborigines in pastoral indusiry requirements.",113
292,Mr WENTWORTH,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) A request was received through a Bank in Port Augusta on Sth June 1970 for a Capital Fund loan to purchase and stock Mount Arden Station. It was intended that a small Aboriginal co-operative be formed to own and operate the property. From information provided by the applicant, the Bankers and the selling agents an assessment of the proposal was carried out. The assessment was based on known income/expenditure figures for sheep raising in similar conditions to those found at Mount Arden and the proposal was found to lack viability and long term prospects of success. In this case it is doubtful whether surplus income would have been sumcient to provide loan repayments, without considering any benefits for the members of the proposed co-operative. Since the formation of the Capital Fund my Office has carried out a great number of investigations un rural proposals; it has been found that wilh the larger type ventures it is difficult to demonstrate that sufficient income can bc generated to service 100 per cent plus borrowings. My Office is awaiting the views of the South Aboriginals Australian Department of Aboriginal Affairs as to whether Mount Arden would have value as a training school for Aborigines in pastoral requirements. Armed Forces: Married Quarters (Question No. 1752)",114
293,Mr HAYDEN,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"the Minister for Defence, upon notice: Is he able to say whether married officers of the British and United States Armed Forces are provided with married quarters in which all furnishings down to cutlery are provided by the Government.",114
294,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Investigation shows that the British Armed Forces have both furnished and unfurnished married quarters. Whilst it is understood to be the aim to provide service housing for all those who require it, ihere are currently waiting times of up Aboriginals to 6 months. Furnished married quarters are provided with all furnishings down to cutlery. This however reflects in the rental, which is higher for a furnished married quarter than for an unfurnished one. The United States Armed Forces provide married quarters only when housing is not available in the local community. These quarters are not normally provided with furniture or furnishings by the Government, though certain basic items of furniture are often supplied as fixtures or Sitings. Smaller items, such as cutlery, are noi provided. Rental is charged for service quarters, although a basic quarters allowance is paid to each member whether he rents service or private quarters. Nuclear Weapons (Question No. 1762) Mr Hurford asked the Minister for External Affairs, upon notice: (1) Did Australia abstain from voting on United Nations resolution 2602A which appeals to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America as an urgent preliminary measure to declare a moratorium on further testing and deployment of new strategic nuclear weapons systems: if so, why. (2) Did Australia abstain from voting on United Nations resolution 2602C which seeks effective methods of control of nuclear weapons that maximise radio-active effects and asks the United Nations Conimittee for Disarmament to inform the General Assembly at the next session the results of consideration of this subject; if so, why. (3) Did Australia.. in company with Portugal and the United Slates, vote against United Nations resolution 2603A which opposed any chemical and biological agents used in war, and yet in resolution 2603B voted for wider distribution of U Thant's chemical and biological warfare report (A/7575); if so, why. (4) Is Australia in favour of convening a conference on the law of the sea to review the regimes of the high seas which lie beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, namely, resolution 2574; if not, why not. Mr MCM a h o n - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Australia, together with 36 other countries, abslained because it was considered that the General Assembly should not lake any action that might impede the progress of the SALT talks which were then in session in Helsinki. Moreover, resolution 2602A singled out one aspect only of the many complex issues being considered hy the United States and USSR at SALT. In the First Commiitee on 28th November 1969, the Australian representative said that the Australian Government welcomed the opening of SALT and expressed the Government's view that a balanced and verifiable agreement on limitation of strategic arms would bring greal benefits to all peoples. (2) Yes. Australia, together with 36 other countries, abstained because it was considered that this request was premature at a lime when the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament already had several incomplete items on its agenda which demanded priority and were likely to require more than the time available before the 25th session of the General Assembly.

Mr Chipp-The Minister for Works has provided the following answer to the ourable member's question: (1) It is Commonwealth policy to adopt the applicable local government regulations unless the Commonwealth's requirements in respect of buildings make the application of these impracticable. However, there is a lack of uniformity in the policies and practices of the various local ment authorities and also in their applications to specific projects. This means it is not practicable to supply a simple measure of the extent to which the requirements of those authorities are met in respect of car parking facilities for new Commonwealth buildings. Each new project receives individual consideration. (2) T'he Department of Works has not made any contribution to enable local government orities to provide off-site parking facilities. Enquiries made of the Departments of the Treasury and Interior show that they are not aware of any contribution having been made for this purpose.

(2) Did he say in answer to question No. 1556 that the editors did uot express the view that the Judge exhibited some rather dubious reasoning in his judgment in the abovemenlioned case; if so, why.

The remarks of the Judge appear in his judgment in Commonwealth Steamship Owners Association v. Waterside Workers Federation of Australia (1960) 2 F.L.R. 328 and it is ihis case to which the editors refer when they say that the Judge's remarks were 'obviously going too far'. On page 380 of the .same edition, the editors express the view that the judgment of Mr Justice Dunphy in Commonwealth Steamship Owners Association v. Waterside Workers Federation of Australia (No. 2) (1963), 5 F.L.R. 103 'exhibits some rather dubious reasoning'. (2) Yes, because, as will be seen from the above, the editors do not express the view that the judgment of Mr Justice Dunphy in the 1960 case at 2 F.L.R. 328 'exhibits some rather dubious reasoning' as suggested by the honourable member in his question No. 1556.
