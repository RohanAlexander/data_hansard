1,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Scott) took the chair at 09:00, made an acknowledgement of country and read prayers. Sugar Research and Development Services Bill 2013 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Sidebottom. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
2,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,Unknown,"BraddonParliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (09:02): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Australian sugar industry, comprising more than 4,000 farms across Queensland and northern New South Wales, is an important contributor to regional economies in these areas and the Australian economy in general. It produces on average 34 to 38 million tonnes of cane per season, which equates to approximately 4.5 to 5.5 million tonnes of raw sugar, with a gross value of production of $1.5 to $2.5 billion. More than 80 per cent of this sugar is exported, making Australia the third largest raw sugar supplier in the world. As with all industries, particularly those that are heavily export dependent, research and development underpins competitiveness of the Australian sugar industry. It drives productivity improvements and ensures the economic viability of the industry. It also generates significant flow-on effects to the broader community and economy in terms of regional development, exports and employment opportunities. It is vital that research and development is delivered in the most effective and efficient manner. With this in mind, the Australian Sugar Industry Alliance undertook a review of research and development arrangements and BILLS recommended reform of these arrangements to best meet current and future needs. On 22 September last year, it submitted a proposal to the Australian government asking it to restructure research and development arrangements. Under these reforms, the Sugar Research and Development Corporation , or SRDC and BSES Limited will be wound-up and their assets and research and development functions, along with the research coordination activities of Sugar Research Limited, transferred to the industry owned company Sugar Research Australia Limited, which was established on 8 May 2013. Under the proposal, the statutory levy will increase from 14c per tonne to 70c per tonne of sugar cane that is processed or sold for processing, shared equally between growing and milling businesses. Thirty-five cents a tonne will be paid by the growing business and 35c a tonne by the milling business. While this is a significant increase, the new statutory levy will also replace the BSES Limited service fee for both growers and millers. In considering the proposal, the government looked at other options, including continuation of existing arrangements. It also took account of the objections received during the formal sixweek objection period, of which there were eight, and other representations on the issue. The government determined that, on balance, this proposal represents the best mechanism for long-term delivery of research and development to the sugar industry. This view is supported by the industry itself. All levy-paying businesses had the opportunity to vote on the new arrangements, including the increase in the levy, in a all levy-paying businesses run by the Australian Electoral Commission in a poll in August 2012. Eighty-four per cent of those growers who voted supported the proposal. This represents 64 per cent of all cane growers. Seven of the eight milling businesses also voted in favour. The changes will build on, rather than replace, current arrangements. The knowledge and expertise of BSES Limited will not be lost but will transfer across to the new industry owned company. Similarly, the research and development knowledge that has been facilitated and funded through SRDC will remain publicly available, as will that generated by Sugar Research Australia Limited. Operating one industry research body should deliver increased efficiencies. The new company should have the capacity to better integrate and avoid duplication of research and development activities across the sugar industry supply chain, leading to a wider range of research opportunities and increased industry and public good benefits. Incorporating the existing sugar statutory levy and voluntary contributions under a new statutory levy will eliminate free-rider problems, as all industry members that benefit from research and development services provided by Sugar Research Australia Limited will now contribute the same amount to its operation through the new statutory levy. The change should, therefore, create a stronger national research and development capability, establish equity in the industry in relation to financial contributions to R&D and provide certainty to growers and millers about their liabilities and the amount of funding that will be available for research and development. There will also be reduced compliance poll of costs for levy payers with growers and millers paying fewer individual levies and fees. The bills before you today, the Sugar Research and Development Services Bill 2013, and its companion bill the Sugar Research and Development Services (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013, provide the mechanism to implement key elements of reform of sugar R&D arrangements. The bill, which commences on the day after it receives royal assent, provides the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry with the power to enter into a funding contract with an eligible company, currently proposed to be Sugar Research Australia Limited, to enable it to receive and invest levies collected by the Commonwealth for research and development. It will also allow it to receive the Commonwealth's matching funding for eligible research and development expenditure up to a determined funding cap. Once the funding contract is in place, and the minister is satisfied that Sugar Research Australia Limited will comply with its contractual and statutory obligations, the minister can declare the company with which the contract is made to be the industry services body. The companion bill makes consequential amendments to a number of acts and regulations to ensure the new arrangements operate, as intended, in respect of the imposition and collection of the levy, including provision for the increase in the levy rate on 1 July 2013. It also covers matters arising from the transition to a new industry services body such as the transfer of assets and liabilities from SRDC to the industry services body and the wind-up of the SRDC on 30 September 2013. While the government supports the proposal, it is also conscious of the need to make sure that appropriate governance arrangements are in place and, where appropriate, are reflected in Sugar Research Australia Limited's constitution. In this regard, the government has made sure that issues such as accountability to government and members, protecting the rights of levy payers, appropriate consultation and the operation of Sugar Research Australia Limited as both a funder and provider of research have indeed been addressed. The government worked closely with the Australian Sugar Industry Alliance in the development of the constitution for Sugar Research Australia Limited to make sure it supports, among other things, a suitably skilled and independent board and the rights of all levy-paying members to be treated equitably. Sugar Research Australia Limited will be unique among rural research development corporations as both a purchaser and provider of research. Sugar Research Australia Limited's constitution requires it to ensure the sugar industry is supported by research capability from a range of providers. In addition, and noting the potential for conflict of interest, there will be explicit governance oversight of this issue by the Audit and Risk Committee of Sugar Research Australia Limited. The contract between the Commonwealth and Sugar Research Australia Limited, commonly referred to as the Statutory Funding Agreement, will also play a key role in achieving this objective. The Statutory Funding Agreement will set out the expectations of the government in relation to the prudent management of industry and Commonwealth funds and the development of strategic and annual operating plans. The Statutory Funding Agreement also requires the development of an agreed industry consultation plan and priority setting process. It is important that this is in place to both guide and ensure a broad industry consultation process. It is appropriate for all industry levy payers to be consulted on the operation of the company and to contribute to its priority setting processes. In line with government policy, the Statutory Funding Agreement will require Sugar Research Australia Limited to identify extension pathways that will facilitate the adoption of its research and development outcomes. Every three years, it must undertake a performance review to assess the company's effectiveness in meeting the priorities, targets and budgets outlined in its plans, and its performance in meeting the obligations of the funding agreement. Final and performance review reports will be publicly available. With the Statutory Funding Agreement and the revised constitution, the government is confident that the governance arrangements for the new organisation will satisfy transparency and accountability requirements and support an efficient and effective organisation. This, in turn, should contribute to increased productivity and profitability for the sugar industry. Debate adjourned.

3,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,Unknown,"BraddonParliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (09:13): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Sugar Research and Development Services (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013, is the companion bill to the Sugar Research and Development Services Bill 2013. These bills provide the mechanism to implement key elements of reform to sugar research and development arrangements. The Sugar Research and Development Services Bill 2013, which comes into effect the day after it receives royal assent, provides the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry with the power to enter into a funding contract with an eligible company to enable it to receive and administer levies collected by the Commonwealth for research development. It will also allow it to receive the Commonwealth's matching funding for eligible research and development expenditure. Once the company has entered into the contract, and the minister is satisfied that the company will comply with its contractual and statutory obligations, the minister can declare the company to be the industry services body. This bill makes consequential amendments to a number of acts and regulations to ensure the new arrangements operate, as intended, in respect of the imposition and collection of the levy, including the increase in the levy rate. It also covers matters arising from the transition to a new industry services body such as the transfer of assets and liabilities from the Sugar Research and Development Corporation to the industry services body and the wind-up of SRDC on 30 September 2013. The SRDC will continue to operate until this date to finalise wind-up activities such as its annual report, but its R&D activities will be transferred to the new industry services body from the date it is declared as such. This bill also amends the imposition of the levy to ensure that all future uses of processed sugar cane will be captured by the levy and the possibility of avoiding payment of the levy will be eliminated. The bill also introduces an instalment system for payment (R&D) of the levy to correspond more closely with how sugar cane payments are made in the industry. These amendments will start taking effect from 1 July 2013 with the increase in the levy rate. Industry has requested Sugar Research Australia Limited be declared as the industry services body by 1 July 2013 which is dependent on a funding contract between the Commonwealth and Sugar Research Australia Limited being in place. and The research and development activities of the Sugar Research and Development Corporation, and 75 per cent of its assets, will be transferred to Sugar Research Australia Limited on the date it is declared as the industry services body. This will ensure there is no break in existing research projects. The remaining assets will be held by the Sugar Research and Development Corporation to cover wind-up costs until it is abolished on 30 September 2013. Any remaining Sugar Research and Development Corporation assets and liabilities will be transferred to the industry services body on 1 October 2013. Debate adjourned. Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Garrett. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",22
4,Mr GARRETT,Unknown,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (09:18): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Through the comprehensive amendments I introduced yesterday to the Australian Education Bill 2012 the government is enshrining in law a new nationally consistent approach to funding school education based on the needs of schools and students. This is the government's commitment to ensure that the nation supports our schools so that every child gets the best possible start in contains life. This legislative framework will make certain that Australia's schooling system is fair, appropriately supported and based on a culture of improvement and good practice. We are ensuring that there is a plan for our children to be taught well in schools that are funded well. This new national approach to schools funding is in response to the first comprehensive review of Australian school funding in almost 40 years. Through the Australian Education Bill 2012, the government's purpose is to ensure a high-quality and highly equitable schooling system for all students, to achieve a national goal of being placed in the top five countries in reading, science and mathematics, quality and equity in recognised international testing by 2025. For the first time all recurrent Commonwealth funding for participating schools will be delivered through fair and transparent needs-based arrangements, providing new investment linked to reforms that will help to improve each student's achievements at school. For participating schools, additional investment will support the evidence-based reforms in the National Plan for School Improvement that are focused on quality teaching, quality learning, transparency and accountability, meeting student need and empowering school leadership. No matter how rich or poor your parents are, the school you attend or the circumstances of your birth, school funding should be based on what it takes to ensure every student gets an excellent education. The Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 would amend certain Commonwealth laws and transitional arrangements consequential to the enactment of the Australian Education Bill. It forms part of the government's national school education reform agenda. The government has agreed that Commonwealth recurrent funding for all Australian schools and capital funding for non-government schools will be provided under the proposed Australian Education Act from 1 January 2014. This includes funding for schools participating in the reform arrangements and for government schools in states or territories that choose not to participate. The Australian Education Bill when enacted will succeed the provisions for recurrent funding under the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 for government schools and recurrent and capital funding under the Schools Assistance Act 2008 for nongovernment schools. Commonwealth funding to states and territories for the administration of school systems and their associated recurrent expenditure, the national specific purpose payment for schools, is currently provided under section 11 of the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009. The funding is determined on a financial year basis, indexed and apportioned between the states and territories by determination by the Treasurer under that act. The estimated financial year payment, based on the latest available estimates of relevant growth parameters, is paid to the state in advance under section 19 of that act. By convention, and consistent with the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations, these payments are made in monthly instalments. The minister makes a final determination after the end of the financial year and any adjustment is made in the subsequent financial year. Schedule 1 of the bill would repeal section 11 of the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 in relation to national specific purpose payments to schools and transitional provisions would enable a smooth transition from a financial year appropriation under the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009, to a calendar year appropriation under the proposed Australian Education Act. Schedule 1 would also amend the Schools Assistance Act 2008 to cease calendar year funding for non-government schools for capital purposes under this act from the end of the 2013 calendar year. Commonwealth capital funding for non-government schools is currently appropriated under the Schools Assistance Act 2008 through to December 2014 but is intended to be appropriated under the proposed Australian Education Act from January 2014. Schedule 1 would also repeal a number of provisions of the Federal Financial Relations Act that deal with the total amount of financial assistance for the 2008-09 financial year, as these provisions are spent. Schedule 2 of the bill contains transitional provisions, including providing for certain approvals and determinations required by or referred to under the Australian Education Bill to be deemed to have been made in reference to schools and authorities existing prior to 1 January 2014. These provisions will ease transition and reduce the administrative burden for existing schools and systems moving to the new arrangements. Specifically, these provisions would allow an approved authority for a non-government school or system under the Schools Assistance Act 2008 as of 31 December 2013 to be deemed an approved authority under the proposed Australian Education Act as of 1 January 2014. A similar provision applies in relation to block grant authorities who administer capital funding for nongovernment schools. The minister will also be taken to have approved a state or territory to be the approved authority for government schools located in their state or territory. Further, these transitional provisions also suspend requirements for an approved authority to be a body corporate and have a school improvement plan for each school until 31 December 2014, meaning compliance is not required until 1 January 2015, rather than immediately on 1 January 2014. The changes in this bill support the implementation of the government's schools funding reform and the National Plan for School Improvement. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. NA The SPEAKER (09:26): Just before I call the member for Scullin, I want to report back on two matters of privilege. Yesterday two matters of privilege were raised. The Minister for Trade and Competitiveness raised a matter concerning the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The basis of his complaint was that the Deputy Leader had made a personal explanation on 3 June which was, the minister said, contrary to statements that she had made in an interview that she had given to The Guardian Australia. The Leader of the House's complaint arose from a report in The Australian of 31 May that the Manager of Opposition Business had written to Independent members in connection with a possible motion of no confidence. The Leader of the House said that at the time the letters in question had not, in fact, gone to any of the members involved, and that there was an issue in respect of the veracity of the reported statements and the responsibilities of the crossbench members. These matters, like the matter raised last Thursday by the leader of the Nationals, reflect the concerns that members have about statements and actions of other members. The deliberate misleading of the House is a recognised category of contempt, as is any improper interference with the free performance by members of their duties as members. I understand the concerns of the ministers, and of the leader of the Nationals last Thursday, but I think also that members accept that Speakers have required prima facie evidence of a contempt in order to justify giving precedence to motions for the referral of such matters to the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests. In my view it is in the interests of the House that this position be maintained and that members use other processes to pursue matters that I accept are important to them. NA Homelessness Bill 2013 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Butler. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",23
5,Mr BUTLER,BILLS,"Port Adelaide-Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Minister for Housing and Homelessness, Minister for Social Inclusion and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Mental Health Reform) (09:28): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill is aimed at increasing recognition and awareness of people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. It is not acceptable in Australia, a relatively wealthy country, that so many Australians remain homeless. A home is the foundation on which a person builds their life. Without stable homes, people struggle to live healthily, stay in training or education, and find and keep jobs. This Labor government has made homelessness a national priority. Our white paper, The Road Home, outlines how we intend to reduce homelessness-through a program that will require sustained effort by governments, business and the broader community. We have set clear targets-to have the rate of homelessness by 2020, and to provide supported accommodation for all rough sleepers who need it. These targets will be achieved through a significant boost in spending, new agreements with the states and territories, and an overhaul of the existing legislative framework. Already, we have seen progress, including through early intervention to prevent homelessness. The community based early intervention service, Reconnect, has helped more than 67,000 young people to get back with their families and into school or training. The Household Organisation Management Expenses Advice Program has given advice and assistance to many families-struggling with rent and mortgage payments during times of personal or financial crisis-helping them to stay off the streets. We have seen our Personal Helpers and Mentors program, or the PhaMS program, prevent people with mental illness from becoming homeless-by giving them support to build social networks, gain employment, and learn to manage their illness and live independently. We have moved towards integrating mainstream and specialist homelessness services by improving the responses from 'first-to-know' agencies and providers-such as headspace, working with young people with mental health issues, and Job Services Australia-providing tailored assistance to homeless job seekers. These are just some of the ongoing practical initiatives that will help break the cycle of homelessness for vulnerable people. The homelessness legislative framework was the subject of a comprehensive inquiry during 2009 by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family, Community, Housing and Youth. The committee's report, Housing the homeless, has been vital in shaping this bill introduced today. With the exception of a legislative right to housing, which is outside current government policy and, in practice, would be significantly dependent on the actions of the states and territories (which are responsible for housing), the committee's recommendations have been incorporated into this bill to the best extent possible. This bill complements a broader reform process to reduce homelessness, incorporating substantial co-investment with states and territories to expand and implement a range of practical measures to support, and improve outcomes for, Australians facing homelessness. The bill underpins the need to sustain this effort into the future. The bill draws national attention to the experience of homelessness, and voices the aspiration that all Australians have access to appropriate, affordable, safe and sustainable housing. This is in line with the objective expressed within the National Affordable Housing Agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories, and local government. The bill acknowledges the direct relationship between addressing homelessness and social inclusion. It sets out a range of service delivery principles to which the Commonwealth is committed, and the strategies we see as necessary to reduce homelessness. The bill also confirms the Commonwealth's commitment to cooperation and consultation in reducing homelessness, and promotes the human rights of people facing homelessness. This legislation that is introduced today has been strengthened through a two-month public exposure period in mid-2012-and we express our gratitude to those many people who lodged written submissions on that exposure draft. All suggestions made have been carefully considered, and the bill has been refined as a result. In particular, the definition of homelessness has been improved in light of comments from a number of stakeholders. We have now clarified that people staying in crisis accommodation (such as a refuge or shelter) cannot be ruled out of the definition through any concept of 'choice'-we know all too well that people do not choose homelessness by living in accommodation. The definition of 'homelessness' now also recognises that safety must be recognised as a vital element in a person's living circumstances. Some people may be homeless because they have no safe place to live, even if they do have a usual address. For example, a person who is living temporarily with friends or relatives and cannot return home safely because of domestic violence will now be recognised by the legislation as experiencing homelessness. This preserves an element of the previous legislative definition particularly valued by stakeholders. Stakeholder feedback has also been reflected in the bill in important matters such as the range of factors recognised as contributing to homelessness, and in the Commonwealth's aspiration for Australians to have access to appropriate, affordable, safe and sustainable housing. This new legislation will replace the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994, which set out important principles and guided the Commonwealth's response to homelessness in Australia for many years. That act recognised people who are homeless as one of the most powerless and marginalised groups in society. It made clear the parliament's view that support should be provided in a way that respects people's dignity as individuals, enhances their selfesteem, is sensitive to their social and economic circumstances, and respects their cultural backgrounds and beliefs. The new legislation preserves the best features of the 1994 act. The Homelessness Bill 2013 gives us the opportunity to retain in law the important statements about homelessness, the partnerships, effort and strategies that are needed to tackle it, and the treatment and support that vulnerable crisis Australians deserve. The 1994 act was primarily a vehicle for providing funding to states and territories to administer the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program-the SAAP. However, new arrangements were introduced in 2009 under the federal financial relations framework, superseding the funding mechanism under the 1994 act. This current funding framework for Commonwealth, state and territory efforts to reduce homelessness-with funding provided through Commonwealth-state mechanisms such as the National Partnership on Homelessness and the National Affordable Housing Specific Purpose Payment-will continue. That funding framework is the vehicle for the practical steps Australia is taking in support of its international obligation to realise all progressively the right to adequate housing. This bill is therefore complementary to the comprehensive funding arrangements already in place, and is not a funding instrument in itself. The Gillard government continues to work with states and territories on the best possible funding outcomes under the existing framework and the substantial measures that flow from it. Similarly, the bill is just one part of a bigger policy program of support to people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The issue of service quality is being pursued by working with states and territories to develop a non-legislative Homelessness National Quality Framework. This framework is being developed with the benefit of consultations and workshop sessions with service providers and stakeholders and individual interviews with homeless people. The framework will be the primary strategy for the white paper goal of ensuring quality services. The Australian government has committed around $5 billion in new funding since 2008 to provide support services and programs to help people who are homeless or at risk. Under the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness, the Australian government, together with the states and territories, has committed $1.1 billion to provide new and better integrated accommodation and support services. The agreement is delivering over 180 new or expanded services across the country to tackle homelessness, as well as 600 homes under the A Place to Call Home initiative. Increasingly, we are in a position to progress against the homelessness targetsusing tools such as robust census data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and information collected by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. These data will be supplemented by the first national longitudinal study of homelessness in Australia, Journeys Home, and research supported by our $11 millioninvestment on the Homelessness Research Agenda to help drive the development and implementation of evidence-based policylooking at matters including the experiences and needs of particular vulnerable groups such as families, children and victims of domestic violence, the effectiveness of homelessness programs, and how to end rough sleeping in cities around the country. The Australian government remains committed to improving outcomes for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness. Ensuring that people receive high-quality services and get every chance to move out of homelessness, or avoid it altogether, is key to the government's policy agenda in this area. The welfare and safety of our fellow Australians matter a great deal. There can be no more worthy cause than doing all that we can to help reduce homelessness, and this bill is a clear statement of our commitment and values in this vital policy agenda. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Homelessness (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2013 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Butler. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",25
6,Mr BUTLER,BILLS,"Port Adelaide-Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Minister for assess Housing and Homelessness, Minister for Social Inclusion and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Mental Health Reform) (09:39): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This is a companion bill to the Homelessness Bill 2013, which is aimed at increasing recognition and awareness of people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The Homelessness Bill draws national attention to the experience of homelessness, and records the principles underpinning the Commonwealth's effort to address homelessness. The new legislation will replace the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994. This consequential amendments bill repeals the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act to make way for the new legislation. A consequential amendment is also made to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. This is to replace the definition of homeless person that applies in the provisions about including itinerant electors on the electoral rolls. A person in Australia, who is not entitled to be enrolled in any electoral subdivision because he or she does not live in any subdivision or is a homeless person, may nevertheless apply for enrolment and be enrolled in a suitable subdivision. The inclusion of these provisions in 2010 supported a commitment in the Australian government's white paper on homelessness, The Road Home, to increase civic participation and voting by people experiencing homelessness. At present, the definition of 'homeless person' partly relies on concepts drawn from the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act. That element of the definition needs to be removed because of the repeal of that The new definition of 'homeless person' will ensure that these provisions will continue to apply simply and clearly so that people who are homeless can still effectively participate in electoral activities in the Australian community. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. NA Human Rights Committee Report",28
7,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights I present the committee's seventh report of 2013 entitled Examination of legislation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011: bills introduced 14-16 May 2013, legislative instruments registered with the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments 20 Aprilsubject 17 May 2013. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",29
8,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' seventh report of 2013 sets out the committee's consideration of 29 bills introduced during the period 14 to 16 May 2013, 122 legislative instruments registered with the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments (FRLI) during the period 20 April to 17 May 2013 and eight responses to the committee's comments in various previous reports. The committee has identified 15 bills that it considers require further examination and for which it will seek further information. The remaining 14 bills do not appear to give rise to human rights concerns. The committee has identified six legislative instruments for which it will seek act. further information before forming a view about their compatibility with human rights. The committee has decided to consider one instrument as part of its examination of the Migration (Regional Processing) package of legislation. The remaining 115 instruments considered do not appear to raise human rights concerns and are accompanied by statements of compatibility that meet the committee's expectations. The committee notes that the general standard of statements of compatibility for legislative instruments has improved significantly in recent months. In this report the committee has continued its consideration of the human rights implications of appropriation bills. I drew the attention of the House to the committee's initial views in this regard when I tabled the committee's third report of 2013. Appropriation bills, like all other bills, are to the requirements of the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011. In its third report of 2013 the committee noted that it does not anticipate it will generally be necessary for it to make substantive comments on appropriation bills. However, the committee stated that it would find it helpful if the statements of compatibility that accompany appropriation bills identify any proposed cuts in expenditure which may amount to retrogression or limitations on human rights. In its consideration of appropriation bills in this seventh report of 2013, the committee recognises the technical and particular nature of appropriation bills and the fact that they frequently include appropriations for a wide range of programs and activities. The committee notes the minister's advice that the explanatory memoranda to appropriation bills address technical aspects of the operative clauses of the bills, not the policy aspects of proposed government expenditure. The committee accepts the minister's explanation that the detail about specific appropriations is mainly contained in the individual agency's portfolio budget statement, rather than in the appropriation bill itself. The committee considers that while appropriation bills may not create any statutory rights or duties, they may nevertheless have an impact on the implementation of international human rights obligations, including the obligation to progressively realise economic, social and cultural rights using the maximum of resources available. The committee therefore considers that statements that routinely conclude that appropriation bills do not engage any human rights may not be accurate in a strict sense, particularly where specific appropriations may involve reductions in expenditure which could amount to retrogression or limitations on rights. The committee recognises that in many cases relevant questions of human rights compatibility are likely to have been taken up under the legislation to which appropriations relate, although this may not be the case where the legislative framework predates the commencement of the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011. The committee considers that the most practical way to address the compatibility of appropriation bills is to ensure that human rights are appropriately incorporated in the underlying budget processes. The committee encourages the government to consider this proposition, not least as it would be consistent with the government's policy objectives in implementing Australia's Human Rights Framework to ensure appropriate recognition of human rights issues in policy and legislative development. On behalf of the committee I would like to thank the Minister for Finance and Deregulation for her response to the committee's comments in its third report of 2013. I would also like to acknowledge the constructive discussions on this issue between her department and the committee's secretariat and I thank the minister for her offer for departmental officials to brief the committee. While the committee's commitments may not permit it to take up this offer during this parliament, it considers that there would be benefit in continuing this dialogue in the next parliament. I commend the committee's seventh report of 2013 to the House. Education and Employment Committee Report",29
9,Mr SYMON,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Employment I present the following advisory reports, incorporating dissenting reports, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee: Fair Work Amendment Bill 2013 and Fair Work Amendment (Tackling Job Insecurity) Bill 2012. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the reports were made parliamentary papers.",30
10,Mr SYMON,COMMITTEES,"by leave-On 21 March 2013 the House Selection Committee referred the Fair Work Amendment Bill for inquiry and report. The reason for the referral was: The bill makes changes to the Fair Work Act that will have an impact on each employee and employer in Australia. it is important that the parliament be fully aware of this bill and identify any unintended consequences. The bill proposes to amend the Fair Work Act 2009 in six broad areas:  expanding existing family friendly arrangements;  amending the modern awards objective to provide a fair and relevant minimum safety net of terms and conditions;  introducing new anti-bullying measures;  amending right of entry provisions;  amending the functions of the Fair Work Commission; and  providing some minor technical amendments. The bill incorporates a second tranche of amendments to the Fair Work Act, based on recommendations of the Fair Work Act Review Panel. The parliament passed the first tranche of amendments, recommended by the panel, in 2012. The amendments contained in this bill seek to alleviate some of the pressures on Australian families and to encourage people with family responsibilities to participate in the workforce. It also ensures that a pregnant employee can transfer to a safe job where one is available, irrespective of the length of their service. The bill amends the modern awards objective to require that the Fair Work Commission take into account the need to provide additional remuneration for employees working outside normal working hours. The bill also provides the commission with greater power to deal with disputes about the frequency of right-of-entry visits. It also provides greater clarity about the location of interviews and discussions in situations where employers and employee representatives cannot agree. The committee was particularly pleased that recommendations made in its previous inquiry into workplace bullying are included in the bill. On the conclusion of that inquiry, the committee recommended to government that workers who are targeted by workplace bullying be provided with an individual right to recourse through an adjudicative process. This bill provides such a mechanism through the Fair Work Commission. A worker who has been the target of workplace bullying will be able to apply to the commission for an order to stop the bullying. This mechanism will represent a significant step forward in combatting a phenomenon which the Productivity Commission estimates costs the Australian economy up to $36 billion annually. The committee recognises that there are opposing interests and views about the desirability of the measures proposed by the as bill. However, in light of the extensive consultation that has taken place on the proposals put forth in this bill, the committee is of the opinion that it provides an appropriate balance in addressing the policy intent of the bill. Accordingly, the committee recommends that the House pass the bill. I thank all those who provided evidence the inquiry or attended the public hearing, my committee colleagues who participated on the inquiry and, of course, the hard working secretariat. I commend this report the House. Mr Deputy Speaker, the second matter is that I present the Standing Committee on Education and Employment's advisory report on the Fair Work Amendment (Tackling Job Insecurity) Bill 2012. Those minutes of proceedings and evidence have already been tabled. On 29 November 2012, the House Selection Committee referred the Fair Work Amendment (Tackling Job Insecurity) Bill for inquiry and report. The reason for the referral was: To determine whether the bill adequately addresses the nature and effects of insecure work in Australia. The bill intends to amend the Fair Work Act 2009 to grant casual and rolling-contract employees, and their unions, the right to request a 'secure employment arrangement' from their employer at any time before or after they have commenced employment. The inquiry received 20 submissions from unions, employer associations and a range of community organisations. On 24 May 2013 the committee held a public hearing in Melbourne to explore concerns raised in submissions with stakeholders and officials from the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. The committee recognises the bill's focus on addressing insecure work, an issue which was raised repeatedly by unions. However, measures to address insecure work should not be legislated without comprehensive analysis of and consultation on the issue, with consideration given to the intended and to unintended impacts such legislation would have on employers and employees alike. The committee shares the concerns raised by stakeholders that the bill's unclear to terminology and inconsistency with current Fair Work legislation, enterprise agreements, and modern awards could create confusion and potentially damage employers' and employees' confidence in Australia's industrial relations framework. The bill, by proposing that the Fair Work Commission be able to impose secure employment orders, would alter the objectives of the workplace relations system as provided by the Fair Work Act 2009. The committee does not support the bill and recommends that the House not pass the Fair Work Amendment (Tackling Job Insecurity) Bill 2012. Again, I would like to thank all those who provided evidence to the inquiry and attended, or attended the public hearing, as well as my committee colleagues who participated and, once again, our very hard working secretariat. I commend the report to the House.",31
11,Mr RAMSEY,COMMITTEES," by leave-The Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012 is a wide-ranging bill, with many clauses covering many different things within industry. It must be said that the members of the coalition are not able to support the majority's recommendation that the bill be passed. And I must express our disappointment that clauses recommending family-friendly measures are mixed up in this bill with a number of clauses entrenching union power and reach into the workplace even further than it is already: in particular the right-of-entry clauses, which cause us-and the industry, it must be saiddeep consternation and difficulty. I understand there are more than 100 bills before the parliament at the moment and I do not concur with the chair's view that the committee did have sufficient time or ability to fully study the implications of this bill. There were 41 submissions and we had one half-day hearing in Melbourne, with three roundtables. Considering that was the sum total of the ability to contribute and considering the raft of clauses in this bill will impact on every workplace in Australia, the coalition members do not believe this was sufficient. We believe there was a poor case made for change; in fact, it is quite clear this legislation flies in the face of earlier commitments made by the Prime Minister, who actually said in 2007: 'We will make sure that the current right of entry laws stay.' I noted the chair's comments on the areas considering the anti-bullying measures. I was a part of that inquiry as well. It was a deeply moving inquiry; it was quite confronting. There were 23 recommendations made from that inquiry and, largely, the coalition members' views coincided with those of the government members in the final report. There was one recommendation, though, which we did not support and that was recommendation 23, which called for this individual right of recourse, unspecified. We did not support that because we felt that there was too much room for exploitation for other purposes by other parties. That premise is fully explored within the report. It is unfortunate, I think, that the government has chosen to pick up on just that one recommendation when in fact there were 22 others in the report and I would have liked to have seen some moves right across the spectrum. It is done in isolation and tucked in amongst the clauses in the bill which call for greater power for unions in the workplace. I think it is unfortunate these clauses have been presented in one bill to the parliament. There was widespread concern across industry that this raft of legislation was going to cause great difficulty for industry and at a time when we are losing jobs. Every day we open the paper and find out another business has closed its doors. We think it is inappropriate these bills should be passed at this time and we recommend that they not be.",32
12,Mr BANDT,COMMITTEES," by leave-I rise to make a brief statement regarding the report on the Fair Work Amendment (Tackling Job Insecurity) Bill, which was a bill I introduced. I thank the Education and Employment Committee for conducting public hearings into the bill and for its consideration of the bill. The motivation for the introduction of the bill was borne out by the evidence given to the committee during the hearings. We have a growing problem in this country when one in four people do not have any paid leave. That is having an increasing impact on people and their livelihoods and on those who are close to them. During the hearing it was confirmed that Australia is one of the worse offenders in this respect and that we are second only to Spain in the OECD in the number of people we have on temporary work-and Spain, of course, has a huge rural workforce. The committee heard that this problem is particularly acute in the education sector. The bill, as the committee notes, provided exemptions for small business. The committee also noted that on many occasions casual and contract employment is completely legitimate, and it did not seek to regulate that. But what the committee heard was that in some industries, tertiary education and schools in particular, where there are no peaks and troughs of employment, where you always know you are going to need teachers and lecturers, nonetheless there was an extraordinarily high preponderance of casual employment. In the tertiary education sector, for example, where there is significant federal government regulation and significant government funding, the committee heard that, with about 200,000 employees in the sector, only 70,000 were on some kind of permanent arrangement-and by 'permanent' we do not necessarily mean tenure for life; we mean just that you have got an ongoing part-time or full-time role. Of those 200,000 the committee heard that 45,000 are on fixed-term contracts and 70,000 are on some form of casual hourlypaid employment. The committee heard that this has enormous personal implication for people. The committee heard from one individual, Sharni Chan, who has been working as a researcher for 10 years as a casual. So since 2003 she has had no paid sick leave. This is someone who is a highlyqualified early-career academic. She says: Being a casual is not something that gives me flexibility to balance work and family, rather I have had to make my whole life flexible in order to meet the demands of casual work, which can mean intermittent demand for your work. She went on to say that it was having implications on her personal life. She said that her partner has been in casual work for the past eight years: We've recently decided that despite the insecurity we would get married, but we cannot imagine how we could possibly have children or raise a family when we do not have work for a period of time. I am in my 30s so this is something been core in my decision to try to work my way out of the sector. This bill was an attempt to strike the balance between the legitimate needs of employersespecially small businesses-to have casual and non-secure employment when it is needed, and the need to address the fact that we are affecting people's lives now. They do not know whether they are going to have a job from month to month or from year to year, especially when they are working in sectors where they are teaching our kids or federal lecturing our students. We have a problem. This bill was an opportunity to address that problem. As is revealed in the dissenting report, it has widespread support from community organisations, welfare organisations and unions. I am very disappointed that in this parliament, when we could have had the opportunity to tackle this growing scourge, we have seen no legislative action and now have Labor and the coalition saying, 'Don't pass the bill!' It is very likely that this parliament will rise without having taking one single step to tackle the scourge of job insecurity. National Capital and External Territories Committee Report",33
13,Ms BRODTMANN,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories I present the committee's report on the visit to Norfolk Island on 29 and 30 April 2013, together with the minutes of proceedings. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",34
14,Ms BRODTMANN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The committee visited Norfolk Island very briefly from 29 to 30 April this year. It followed up on a visit made in May 2011 and was to that has assess how Norfolk Island was managing under the road map that was introduced in December 2010 by the former minister for territories, Simon Crean. Many people know about the challenges faced by Norfolk. They are many and varied. Essentially, they are in a pretty difficult situation. The recent economic situation has shown a real deterioration there. Economic activity, as of September 2012, was down 20 per cent on the previous year, about 40 per cent of shops had closed, about 25 per cent of the male population aged between 25 and 50 had left the island since August 2011, the overall population had dropped by 9.4 per cent since August 2011 and tourism trends had been variable throughout the year. We were keen to go and get an assessment of how things are going, because the road map that was introduced by the minister in 2010 involved a great deal of reform to the central underpinnings of a strong and sustainable economy and society. There were reforms in governance, reforms in financial management, reforms in FOI and reforms in transparency. During our visit, the purpose of which was to examine recent progress under the road map, expectations of further progress and the current state of Norfolk Island's economy and government finances, we held discussions with the Administrator, Commonwealth Finance Officer, Chief Secretary, the Norfolk Island government that had just been elected in March this members of the assembly, CEO of the Norfolk Island administration, representatives of the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce and Government Tourist Bureau, the Accommodation and Tourism Association and representatives of a variety of women's and social welfare groups. During my own visits to the island as well as those of the committee, we have always been keen to connect with the social, community and local women's groups to get a sense of what is actually happening on the ground. The committee found its brief stay on Norfolk Island worthwhile. We thank all those who met with the committee, particular the new Administrator there, the Hon. Neil Pope, and his staff. The focus of our discussions was to get a readout on where things stood with the road map, a readout of where the economy was at and a readout of where the governance arrangements were at. But we were also keen to focus on what Norfolk Island were doing in the area of revenue raising. The ultimate aim of the road map is to get the underpinnings in place to allow Norfolk Island to integrate with the Australian tax system and so get the associated benefitshealth services, Medicare, PBS and a range of other services. But it is a journey along that road and a number of elements need to be put in place before we can reach that point. We were therefore keen to get an understanding of what Norfolk Island were doing, given that they are in this difficult economic situation, to put in place the revenue-raising vehicles needed to underpin and sustain their economy. So a lot of our focus was on revenue raising, particularly on the notion of municipal rating or land rates. We came up with a number of observations during the visit. The main thing we are keen to underscore is the fact that the year, Norfolk Island government maintains its commitment to the road map and to the fulfilment of its obligations under the road map. We believe that they are an essential requirement of Norfolk Island's success and progress. We made just one recommendation following our visit. We recommended that the commitment of the Norfolk Island government and the Australian government to reform should be documented in a joint statement and timetable. This timetable should document the legislative changes required of both the Norfolk Island and Australian governments to improve governance and administration and to integrate Norfolk Island into the Australian taxation and welfare system. Any timetable should be predicated on the Norfolk Island government introducing its own revenue streams, such as municipal rates, reforming its immigration system and divesting its government business enterprises. In closing, I again thank all those who met with the committee. I also thank my fellow committee members, who have taken a long standing and keen interest in Norfolk Island. I particularly thank the the work they did in organising our visit, in conjunction with the Administrator, and in writing the report. NA Australian Education Bill 2012 Consideration in Detail Debate resumed.",34
15,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," The question is that the amendments be agreed to.  Opposition Business) (10:08): Now begins a long a process in the House of considering in detail the 71 pages of amendments the government dropped into the parliament yesterday. I say at the outset that the sheer incompetence of this government in trying to implement a new school funding model has been quite breathtaking. It has been like watching a passenger jet slamming into the deck of an aircraft carrier which has just hit an iceberg. The Gonski report was handed to the government in late 2011. It was published in February 2012. We are now in parliament in June 2013 with the school funding model due to run out on 31 December this year, yet the government is still trying to get agreement to a new school funding modelsix months before it is supposed to take effect. It is quite impossible for this government to implement a new school-funding model competently in the time that it has given itself. If this government were competent, if it understood good public policy, if it were not obsessively inwardly focused, it would have been doing this last year. It would have been going through the process methodically and calmly like adults in the room, rather than threatening and shouting with megaphone diplomacy to the states and the secretariat for non-government sector. In this particular instance, late last year the government introduced a nine-page bill, a bill full of platitudes, called the Australian Education Bill-a nine-page bill with no detail-which they expected the parliament to debate and which we have been dutifully debating. Yesterday, without any notice to me as the shadow minister, without giving me the courtesy of delivering these amendments to my office, they dropped 71 pages of detailed amendments into the parliament which they expected to debate of and pass at five o'clock last night. The minister insists that my office had these amendments delivered to it. It did not. There is no record in my office of these amendments appearing at any point yesterday. In fact, to get access to these amendments, my office had to download them from ParlInfo so that I had access to them. So, whatever the department or his office is telling the minister, I have no record of ever receiving these amendments. There are 71 pages of detailed amendments introducing a complicated new funding model-much more complicated than the model we have had since the year 2000. There is so much detail in these amendments that it is utterly outrageous for the government to expect the parliament to consider them and pass them in a matter of hours. The normal process, if this government had not given up governing already, would have been to have introduced these amendments, to have consulted with the shadow minister and to have given at least a week or two for the Independents and the coalition to consider these amendments and come to a position. Instead, this government has given up governing. It is just trying to tick boxes and it thinks that an asinine debate about a new school-funding model rushed through this chamber will somehow repair its stocks with the public. What would repair its stocks with the public is a government of adults that actually governed for the good of the country rather than an inwardly obsessive government worried about its own political survival. I will over the course of this debate go through in detail many of the concerns that the coalition has about this new schoolfunding model. But, before I get to the detail of the amendments, which I will go through, I will mention another part of the process, and that is that the sector itself has been down with confidentiality agreements that would make the Committee of Public Safety in revolutionary France blush with its heavyhandedness and its draconian measures. The non-government sector has not had the opportunity to speak to its sector, as any government would expect it to do, because of those confidentiality agreements.",36
16,Mr IRONS,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Australian Education Bill 2013 consideration in detail. We have just heard from the shadow minister about process. There is no process in this particular bill, as we have seen since it was first brought to the chamber back in late 2012. Since then we have been preparing speeches, and I finally got to speak on it on Monday. I am seriously concerned about the shadow minister's health. I know he has been running around trying to deal with this bill, deal with the minister and deal with all the schools and the stakeholders involved in this, and I am seriously concerned about the process that he has had to deal with. I am sure he will be up to it and I am sure he will make sure that he takes the argument to the government and makes sure that all the stakeholders involved in this bill are greatly represented in this chamber. I know Deputy Speaker Oakeshott is big on representation in this chamber. The government's handling of this bill has been chaotic and shambolic-a debacle. As I said in my speech on the second reading speech, the bill had no proper detail and would have been better suited as a press release rather than a bill in this place. As we heard from the shadow minister yesterday, at five o'clock 71 pages of amendments were produced. The document is that large that we cannot even download it through ParlInfo. Through that process, we have gone from a bill with no detail contained in it to a situation where the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth is shut moving detailed and complex amendments to the bill at the eleventh hour-it is probably nearly the twelfth hour. It is good that the minister took the coalition's advice on board and introduced more content into the bill. But he should have done so from the start and not at this late stage of consideration. We now have these detailed amendments in front of us that the House has had very little time to consider. This means that coalition members have had no opportunity to talk with our local communities, to schools or with state governments about the amendments moved by the government. It is particularly disappointing that I will not have the opportunity to speak with local schools in my electorate of Swan in Western Australia, about these changes because, as usual, with anything to do with this government, Western Australia comes out the worse. I know that parents and students at Lathlain Primary School will be disappointed that I have not had an opportunity to talk with them when they will lose, according to reports in the local papers, $466,316 in funding, thanks to the government's proposed changes. I hope that the minister will come to Western Australia, go to Lathlain Primary School and tell them why they are going to loss $466,316 out of their budget because of this bill. These tactics are symptomatic of this government. It is always about politics rather than achieving well-thought through and lasting reforms to our education sector. When the minister treats the parliament like this, it is clear to schools, parents and students-like those at Lathlain Primary School-that they are the ones who lose. Parents and students at Wesley College, Penrhos College, Como Secondary College and the East Victoria Park Primary School are all reportedly under threat of losing large chunks of funding under these changes. I see the minister smiling; I am sure that they will not be happy about losing their funding under this particular system. I am sure that they would all like proper scrutiny of these changes, especially when it is their futures that are under threat. The government has still refused to hand over individual school information to the sector for the years 201415 and 2015-16, despite repeated requests. There is simply no excuse for the chaos and no excuse for the government to be ramming through these changes without proper scrutiny from the parliament and all stakeholders. The only strategy here is getting through the election. There is still notional agreement on these changes. This is important, as it is the states and territories that run our schools. But the federal government, which does not run any schools and does not employ one teacher, thinks that it is okay to ram through changes like this without the support of the states. That is farcical. The Premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett, said, 'Why would I want to hand over control of the schools in Western Australia to the federal government?' Victoria have allocated no money in their budget for these new measures. South Australia, a Labor state, have refused to confirm if they will allocated money in their budget today for these measures. The budget papers give us an insight into Labor's true plans for education. What the government does not want the Australian public to work out is that most of the money being promised under this new model will not flow until two or three elections away. The new model is less transparent than the old model and, given the track record of the government when it comes to keeping their promises and telling the truth-especially when it comes to budget figures-the states and territories and the Australian public can be forgiven for being highly sceptical of the government's proposals. I repeat my invite to the minister to come to Western Australia and to Swan and talk to the schools in my electorate that are going to lose out.",37
17,Mr GARRETT,BILLS,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:18): The first thing to say is that this is a truly important day for the parliament in terms of education reform. It is a day when we will see enshrined in legislation a new needs-based funding model for schools and students across Australia. In relation to the debate that we are having here, it ought to be a debate that focuses on why it was that the Gonski no panel made the recommendations that they did; how the government has responded to those recommendations after significant consultation and discussion with states, territories and non-government organisations; how crucial and critical it is that we put in place these funding arrangements to meet the needs of students and schools around Australia; and how urgent it is for other states and territories to work closely with the Commonwealth as we deliver this significant reform. In relation to the spray that we just had from the member for Sturt, I remind the member that the amendments were circulated at 1.20 yesterday afternoon. If it is the case that your internal processes are so poorly organised that they do not get a single amendment to you then I do not think that you can come in and blame us for that particular issue. That responsibility lies your party in this parliament. It should organise itself properly. Those amendments were circulated. I want to make clear that we have also now made available draft regulations for the bill for consideration at this time as well. But we should not be surprised by the spray from the member for Sturt, because he has sprayed from day one. Not only did he walk out 22 or 23 minutes after the Gonski panel brought down its recommendations and its findings and dismissed them out of hand but, when the New South Wales government agreed with the approach that was taken by this government to work to those recommendations to deliver a new national plan for school improvement, he then went on to say that in fact the New South Wales Premier had been conned. The use of colourful language by the member for Sturt is recognised both here and further afield; after all, he was the one who described the goal that is set and that we have enshrined in the National Plan for School Improvement, which is to be in the top five of education nations by 2025, as mad. At no point in the debate over a period of more than 12 months has he ever participated constructively in moving this reform through the parliaments of Australia through their budgets to be delivered to the 9,350 or so schools and 3½ million students or so for whom it is intended. There has not been a single instance on the record where we have had construction engagement from the opposition on education. The shadow minister gets up and says, 'We're trying to reach agreement.' I will remind him that we have reached agreement with New South Wales. The Liberal Premier was very clear about it: he signed up to the deal because 'it provides additional resources, fairer distribution, to deliver higher standards and better outcomes in with schools across New South Wales'. That is what he said. The education minister likewise said, 'It's wrong to suggest'-as the shadow minister on a couple of occasions'that indexation under the present model would be high.' The fact is that the New South Wales Premier and the New South Wales education minister looked at these propositions, spent the time-as we have with other states and territories and non-government school organisations-in working through what a new funding model would look like and then committed to it. They did that because there is more money, money that is provided in the budget to deliver this reform. It does not matter how many times the shadow minister runs his lines out, either here or outside, the fact is that it is in the budget. That is the offer that is on the table from the Prime Minister. And it is a two-for-one offer for states and territories. I say to the member that this is an important piece of legislation and that these amendments not only reflect the discussion, consultation and consideration that we have had of this issue for a considerable period of time but also finally provide for once and for all the opportunity for schools around Australia to be funded on the basis of the needs of their students, whatever school they are in, wherever they live, however much money their parents earn.",38
18,Mr BANDT,BILLS," The Greens are also working through the amendments that were tabled yesterday. We share the sense of disappointment that it is being debated in one of the final weeks of parliament. This is something that, as I said during my speech on the second reading, ideally we would have done years ago. The funding model of former Prime Minister John Howard was an unfair funding model. It grew the gap between public and private schools. As we know, public schools are where you find the most disadvantage being addressed, so that was a model that needed to be changed. To repeat the point that we made previously, someone who started primary school in the year that former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was elected will have finished primary school under that unfair John Howard funding model, despite there being several years of a changed government. And they are probably going to finish high school before the full impact of this new package. That leads to one of the concerns that we have had and that we will continue to pursue, which is reflected in an amendment that I circulated, which is that we are very concerned that, as we get closer to election time, we want to make sure that any model that finds its way into legislation is one where-especially if it is being back-ended for budgetary reasons-the money goes first of all to those who most need it, and that is the most disadvantaged public schools. In the light of the substantial amendments tabled by the government, it is not immediately clear how our proposed amendment in a technical sense would relate to the amendments proposed by the government, so I just want to indicate to the House and to the chair that the Greens will not be pursuing the amendment here. We will pursue the issue in the Senate after we have had a chance to digest how our amendment might relate to the proposed amendments of government.",39
19,Mr FLETCHER,BILLS," I am very pleased to rise to contribute briefly to this consideration-in-detail debate. The minister in his earlier remarks outlined a series of noble-sounding aspirations, and that is all very well. But I think it is perfectly reasonable for those of us on this side of the chamber to adopt the very sound principle that was articulated by former United States President Ronald Reagan when he said, 'Trust, but verify.' The purpose of a consideration-in-detail debate is to engage in that verification process, to see if the words and language of the bill before us give effect to the noble aspirations which have been stated by the minister and by the government. Based upon the experience of this government's performance in the time that it has been in office, you would be naive and credulous in the extreme if you took the government's representations at face value and failed to go through a detailed process of scrutiny of the actual provisions in the bill, consistent with the very purpose of a consideration-in-detail debate. So I hope the minister will not be offended if, while noting his statement of lofty aspirations, we on this side of the House insist on the opportunity to test the wording and detail of the bill so that we may understand its actual legal effect. With that, I come first to amendment (1) on the government's list of amendments which has been circulated. That amendment would have the effect that, in the preamble on line 8, after the word 'succeed', we insert the words 'achieve his or her aspirations'. At the moment, as members would be aware, the relevant paragraph of the preamble reads: All students in all schools are entitled to an excellent education, allowing each student to reach his or her full potential so that he or she can succeed and contribute fully to his or her community, now and in the future. the The amendment which has been proposed would insert after the word 'succeed' the words 'achieve his or her aspirations'. I am interested to understand the drafting intention behind the addition of the phrase 'achieve his or her aspirations'. I am interested to understand from the minister what the difference between 'succeed' and 'achieve his or her aspirations' is. I am interested to understand the government's thinking in the extent to which the preamble as presently worded is deficient in not including the words 'achieve his or her aspirations' and the benefit which is derived by adding the words 'achieve his or her aspirations' to the preamble. I am also interested to understand from the minister: what is the legal effect of including these words? On the other hand, what would the legal effect be if these words were not included? I am also interested to understand the minister's perspective at perhaps a deeper level. I am interested to hear from the minister whether it is his view, underpinning the approach that has been taken in the drafting, that it is possible to succeed without achieving your aspirations. I am interested also to understand, conversely, whether it is possible to 'achieve your aspirations' without 'succeeding', because I think it will assist the House in its assessment of the minister's drafting intentions in adding in the words 'achieve his or her aspirations' if we can understand the minister's view as to the difference between succeeding and achieving your aspirations. I am also interested to understand from the minister the extent to which the present legislative and regulatory framework in the area of school education impedes students from, on the one hand, succeeding and, on the other hand, achieving their aspirations. I am also interested to understand from the minister-given that he is clearly a believer in legislation through the use of noble statements of intent-why he has not chosen to include such adverbs as, for example, 'fully succeeding' or 'comprehensively succeeding' or 'comprehensively achieving your aspirations' or, indeed, 'spectacularly'. Why has the minister not considered using the word 'spectacularly'? Finally, I am interested to know why the minister thinks it makes sense to include these lofty aspirations in a bill. (Time expired)",40
20,Mr HAWKE,BILLS," I want to raise some points with the minister about this matter because, even as I have been sitting here right now, I have received a letter emailed to me from a Catholic school principal in my electorate. I have not even had time to read it but I want to read the questions that Mrs Helen Kingsley from Our Lady of Lourdes Primary School in my electorate has raised about this matter in a letter to the Prime Minister that has just been sent to me. Mrs Helen Kingsley asks for clarification about the following outstanding issues: When will the final financial outcomes for each of the six years of the rollout, 2014 to 19 inclusive, for each of catholic school (both Catholic Education Commission and nonsystemicly funded) be known? Minister, can I have the answer. The second point she raises with the Prime Minister is: Can you explain your claim on Sunday 19 May that the average non-government school in New South Wales will lose $800,000 if the new funding model is not at adopted? I would like an explanation too, Minister. The third point Mrs Kingsley raises is: What guarantees do we have that the full funding for the model will actually be found or delivered by 2019? A very important question indeed, Minister. The final question Mrs Kingsley asks is: How can the Commonwealth predict funding for 2016 at this stage given the 2015 review of indexation? These are the concerns we are hearing all around the nation at the moment because of the lack of detail in this bill. I was on the inquiry into this bill and I want to record for the House that we had 10 pages in that bill to inquire into, which basically said, 'We believe that children are our future; teach them well and let them lead the way.' Minister, we all agree that is a great proposal for education in this country. But you have put forward 71 pages of amendments. All of the detail that matters to schools in this country is in that 71 pages. And you said 1 pm yesterday is enough time for Mrs Kingsley of the Catholic system in my electorate to consider the detail of your amendments. I can tell you, Minister, it was not. My further question to you in this matter is: will you now allow the House to conduct a further inquiry into the actual detail of bill, because every single witness that came before our inquiry said, 'We do not have sufficient detail'? You can read the dissenting report from our members here on this side, which explain to you that with 10 pages every single witness could not identify how the funding model would affect their system, their school or their sector. Every single witness said, 'We cannot talk to you about it because we are in confidential negotiations.' Every single witness came forward and said, 'Sorry, we do not have the detail about what will happen to school funding in Australia under this bill.' That is because they did not have the detail available to them. So that inquiry was a complete farce, and we were required to report before the 71 pages were made available. You required that inquiry to report to this House before we had seen the 71 pages of detail. Minister, tell us: how can anyone in this chamber vote on this bill without having had a proper inquiry into the detail? I have already started to look through the 71 pages. I can tell you they are very complex. It would be unfair of me to ask you to explain the detail of your amendments, because I am sure at this stage you could not explain to this House the detail of those amendments on how the funding model works and how it affects each sector: the independent sector, the Catholic sector and all of the different education sectors affected by this bill. Minister, if you cannot explain the amendments to this House and if we cannot explain then because we are just reading them for the first time today to understand what the loadings are, what the indexation is and how these affect each sector, and if the sector itself is writing to me as we speak in this chamber and asking serious questions about what the funding will mean for themwhat these amendments will mean for them-how are we supposed to cast a vote this on this bill? How are we supposed to cast a vote on this bill without a proper inquiry into its detail? You have provided significant detail on the funding, and we need the time to consider it. We need much more time to consider how it will impact on all the different schools in all of our electorates around the country. Minister, if what you say is true and this is an important matter and it really means a lot to you-I noted in your second reading speech that you said 'right a moral wrong'then certainly what you are doing is not the only goal. How you are going to do it is the purpose of legislation-how? And the 'how' you have not explained to this House. We have not had sufficient time to consider the amendments. The detail already appears to be quite complex. It is very complex for the schooling systems around Australia, and that complexity has been noted in media reports this morning. So, Minister, I have asked all of these questions, but will you allow for a further inquiry so that this House can consider the detail?",41
21,Mr GARRETT,BILLS,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:35): I am mindful of the fact that we are hearing some commentary from coalition members on the other side of the House, and so I think it is useful for me to provide some context and information in relation to the matters that have been raised by members. I am happy to note the member for Melbourne's comments and to basically provide the assurance to him that the new schooling resource standard model, with the loadings that are identified in this legislation, provides the clearest possible commitment and delivery to students of need in our nation. The fact is that the Gonski panel findings were an absolute challenge to us as Australians. They were a challenge because our school system was not in a position to deliver the best education to all students enrolled. It was a challenge because the gap between children from less well-off backgrounds and those from better backgrounds is very wide-in fact, it is the widest of equity gaps amongst comparative nations. For Australia, this is a crucial and important challenge, and the model which is identified clearly in these amendments goes to that very matter. The member for Bradfield made an extremely confusing contribution around preambles and aspirations, and then asked me for my perspective on these matters. I am pretty happy to share my perspective with him, I have to say. The first thing I would share of my perspective is that the coalition, under the opposition leader and the member for Sturt, has shown no appreciable interest in, or commitment to, education reform by way of both investment or policy during the terms of the last two parliaments-and I include this parliament. Previously, we had commitments from them to cut education. They wanted to cut the teacher quality national partnership; they wanted to take $425 million away from it. They wanted to abandon the computers in schools program because that was a total waste of money. The program has been delivered by this government. In fact, this government has delivered more than the numbers originally contemplated. The coalition want to cut the trades training centre program. They want to take money from our neediest schools. We are in the process of delivering reforms like the national curriculum-which I know the member for Aston is aware of, although the opposition leader seems to think it has not been implemented. There is the My School website for greater transparency. There are the professional teaching standards and qualities. There has been nearly a doubling in appropriation investment by this parliament compared to the years when the coalition were in government. We have provided the resources, and they can be seen in schools right around the country and are no more than was provided during the Building the Education Revolution. I go to many schools, so let me share my perspective of that with the members opposite. I have not been to a single school in this country where a principal or teacher has said to me anything other than, 'We are absolutely grateful for the fact that finally a federal Labor government has decided to invest in the infrastructure of our schools'such as the covered outdoor learning areas and the improved science laboratories. With every single facility in those primary schools improvement has occurred. How many of you would go to those schools and gainsay that investment now? Very few, I would dare to suggest. This was one of the most significant public infrastructure investments in education that we have ever seen, in record time, keeping this country from recession. That is what this government did, and at the same time delivering significant reforms, working with stakeholders, establishing an institute of teaching and school leadership, curriculum and reporting authority whose rigour members opposite know delivers to students in this country the best possible curriculum that they can have. These are the sorts of commitments that this government has made and we have backed them up in the budget. We are willing to do the last and most important piece of work, which is a needs based funding system for students and schools around Australia. The fact is that no school-no schoolwill be worse off as a consequence of our investment in A National Plan for School Improvement. Schools will be worse off only if the opposition leader tears up the agreements that we have already reached and seeks to block the agreements that we are currently engaged in and wanting to deliver for the good of students in states and territories right around Australia.",43
22,Mr Hawke,BILLS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order. I seek leave to table letter from Our Lady of Lourdes Primary School to the Prime Minister in relation to this education funding system model. Leave not granted.  Opposition Business) (10:41): I now put on the record what a swindle these amendments are and this legislation is in attempting to pretend that it is introducing the recommendations of the Gonski report. The Gonski report required $6.5 billion of new spending each year to implement Mr Gonski's recommendations. Over the next four years, over the forward estimates, that would be $26 billion of new money. This government is delivering a $326 million cut to school funding alone in this budget over the forward estimates. This government is, in fact, taking money from schools over the forward estimates and in the never-never, in year 5 and in year 6, is attempting to get a credit for apparently rivers of gold that will flow to schools in years 5 and 6 that are not even in the forward estimates. To believe that, you have to suspend everything you know about the Prime Minister and this government. You have to suspend all the broken promises in the last six years to believe that in five or six years, outside the forward estimates, this government will be re-elected three times and will deliver rivers of gold to schools. What we do know is that in the next four years there is a $326 million cut to schools. That is not including cuts to universities, cuts to apprentices and traineeships and cuts to early childhood education. That all adds up to $4.7 billion. So the total cut to education in this budget is $5 billion. To claim that the government is trying to introduce Gonski reforms is a fraud and a swindle. That is the reason that David Gonski has been so silent on the government's legislation and a amendments, because he does not want his good name to be associated with amendments that are not even close to, that are a pale imitation of, the Gonski reforms. If they were implementing the Gonski report they would be costing $26 billion over the of forward estimates, but this government is delivering a $326 million cut to school funding over that time. Do not just take my word for it. The whole sector is up in arms about the shemozzle that this minister is presiding over. Bishop Fisher, the chair of the Catholic Education Commission in New South Wales, wrote to the diocesan directors and principals of congregational schools, and he said: This is a most unsatisfactory situation and this dissatisfaction has been strongly expressed by the National Catholic Education Commission to the Commonwealth government. Further: Compared to present funding mechanisms, the new model itself has become extremely complex and annually variable. It is made even more difficult for schools to predict future funding levels because so much of the model is based on loading which themselves involve poor or imprecise measures of student needs. That is the Catholic Education Commission of New South Wales speaking on behalf of the National Catholic Education Commission. The member for Mitchell has read into the Hansard record a letter from one of his local schools. I asked the minister last Thursday to answer a question that Mary MACKillop College in my electorate asked. It was a very simple question: how much in additional funds will Mary MACKillop College receive in 2014, 2015 and 2016? His answer was so vague that I gave him an extension of time that the parliament granted, over the objections of some of his colleagues, so that he could answer in the 4½ minutes he was given to answer that very simple question: how much money in additional funds will schools receive next year, when they have to pay their bills? They will not get to pay their bills in five years or six years. But this minister was entirely incapable of answering that question. Hearing the minister answering that question was a little resonant of their pink batts disaster. It reminded me of his handling of the pink batts disaster. Now, 101 days from the election, he has his hand on the levers again. (Time expired)",44
23,Mr TUDGE,BILLS," At the beginning of this debate about these amendments, the minister said that these 71 pages of amendments provide funding certainty for our schools. That is the claim that he made. I would like to put on the record that these amendments do no such thing. It is an extraordinary claim for the minister to make, because if these amendments did provide funding certainty, as he claims, then he would be able to tell every school in the nation exactly how much money they will receive next year and the year after and the year after and the year after that. But he cannot do that. As the shadow minister, Christopher Pyne, pointed out, the minister was asked specifically in parliament only a few days ago, just in relation to one school, to inform the parliament what that one school would receive next year or the year after. Again, we do not know. When you look through these 71 pages of amendments, a framework is outlined and there are a lot of words. There are great complexities, formulas are introduced, but there is no detail for any school to determine how much money they will receive. The reason for this is that there is so much complexity and there are so many loadings which have no consequential numbers attached to them. For example, there are supposed to be loadings in relation to location, in relation to the size of schools, in relation to disability and in relation to the capacity to pay. There are additional loadings for new and old per student amounts, but there is no detail. We do not know what those are. All we are given in these 71 pages of amendments are the base amounts. But for most schools that is just the beginning. If they were only to receive those base amounts then they would be significantly behind. That is particularly the case for the more remote schools. In your electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore, some of the remote schools will have per student funding of $50,000 or $60,000. There is no indication in these amendments that those schools will not have their funding slashed. All this document gives is an initial per student amount as base funding. Perhaps we could be satisfied that there is not sufficient detail at this stage if it were very beginning of the process towards school funding. But we are not at the beginning of the process. Far from it, we are 100 days from the next election, six months before the new school year and schools have to plan for their budgets. And, what is more, we have had a House of Representatives inquiry and we have had the Gonski inquiry going on for 18 months. But the most damning point in relation to this is that this has actually been a nine-year process, because nine years ago was the last time that the Labor government-that the Labor Party-had a school-funding model. Nine years ago! We have waited nine years to get to this point. Nine years, so that schools would know what they would be entitled to under a Labor government. We know what the policy was nine years ago: that was laid out very clearly in election documents-incredibly clearly for everybody to see. It was known as the 'hit list'. But at least they were upfront and honest then in 2004. They said, very specifically-they were upfront honest-that these schools would have their funding cut. Now, nine years later, we are still waiting for what the policy will be. And in those nine years they have bagged the current policy up hill and down dale. Almost every year, every month, every week and every day they have criticised the SES funding model, but they have not come up with an alternative. And so we have been waiting. And when the minister tabled the 71 pages of amendments yesterday, we thought, 'Finally, we will be able to see.' Finally! One hundred days before the election-six months before a new school year and 18 months after Gonski and our House of Representatives inquiry, we will finally get the details'. But there are no details here. Schools still do not know, and if the minister the does know the answers then perhaps he can get up now and say how much money individual schools will get next year, and the year after and the year after that, because at the moment the only certainty we know is in the budget papers, and the budget papers say a funding cut of $345 million over four(Time expired)",45
24,Mr GARRETT,BILLS,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:51): I do want to take the opportunity to respond to some of the erroneous claims that have been made by the coalition in the course of this debate, and to reflect, as it were, on the fact that up to this point in time we have not seen any commitment from the coalition to education reform of any kind. Neither have we seen any commitment from the coalition to investment in schools. In fact, what we do have is a commitment to a broken funding model-identified as broken by the Gonski panel itself. I was invited by one of those opposite to talk about and where it is in the amendments that we give effect to the Gonski recommendations. Quite clearly, the amendments are about a schooling resource standard, plus loadings to be delivered to approved authorities-states and territories and non-government school bodies. I will just read the recommendation of the Gonski panel itself. It is very straightforward and very clear in what it says-in particular: The Australian Government and the states and territories, in consultation with the nongovernment sector, should develop and implement a schooling resource standard as the basis for general recurrent funding of government and non-government schools. The schooling resource standard should:  reflect the agreed outcomes and goals of schooling … … … …  include amounts per primary and secondary student …  complement and help drive broader schooling reform to improve Australia's overall performance and reduce inequity of outcomes. students. That is absolutely what sits in these amendments to this bill. That is literally what it is about. For the member for Sturt to come in here and say that, when in the budget papers there is quite clearly additional appropriation in the budget over time-considerable appropriation, that would see $14.5 billion delivered over six years on a two-for-one basis of effective partnership between the Commonwealth and the states-and to maintain that it is anything other than an increase in funding for schools is literally laughable. The shadow minister will say anything at all-that is true. There is one other point that needs to be made here, and that is that we have, and we will continue, to be in constructive negotiations with states and territories and the non-government school sector, who stand to benefit considerably. For the independent school sector there is around $1 billion and for the Catholic system there is around $1.4 billion. My expectation is that as we reach agreements with those sectors over time, as we should, then we will be in a position to make clear what the benefits are for this National Plan for School Improvement. When I hear those opposite assail the government on the basis of delivery in education, I think they must be living in a parallel universe where negativism is inherent and where no clear or rational thinking in a debate of this kind is actually delivered. I can see some students watching us here. I look for an example of how this legislation works. The example has been made public, but it is a useful one. Members have been shouting at us, asking, 'How does it work; what does it mean?' I am very happy to share it with them. Let us look at an inner regional independent primary school of some 220 You take the school's characteristics, you look at the base SRS amount and you then see whether the loadings that are inherent in this model would be applied-loadings for low socio-economic background, disability, the size of the school, its location and whether or not it has students who require additional support for English language proficiency. That is what is included in this legislation that is before the House and which we are now debating. But the fact is that the shadow minister just wants to oppose-that is all the coalition can do-for the sake of opposing. It does not go to the heart of what this will mean for schools and students around Australia. If we as a nation lock in a funding model which meets the needs of students both now and into the future, we are not only locking in equity and fairness but driving the whole of the appropriation. Yes, there is additional investment, but it is about every single dollar and cent that we as governments spend on education, on a model that is focused on student need. The government have articulated those things which we think are necessary. We have reached agreement with the New South Wales government. We know that those bilateral agreements will reflect A National Plan for School Improvement and we know that those resources will be put to the best possible use they can.  Opposition Business) (10:56): Just to continue the theme of the government trying to swindle the Australian public on this so called national agreement, we are debating 71 pages of amendments in the House today on the basis that two jurisdictions out of eight-New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory-have apparently agreed to this national agreement. Before the parliament rises, we will be passing these bills because the government, I assume, has the numbers. We rise on 27 June and, by 30 June, other states and territories may sign up. But there is no national agreement. We are being asked to pass bills on the basis that the minister is claiming that there is a national agreement to introduce a new school funding model. There is not. The non-government schools have not come out and said that they want this new school funding model. The Catholic schools in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and elsewhere have all raised specific concerns. The Independent Schools Council, the AISs in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and other states have all come out and raised concerns. Western Australia has indicated that they will not sign. Queensland, Victoria and the Northern Territory have all indicated that they will not sign. The South Australian budget is being handed down today. It will be very interesting to see whether there is any money in the South Australian budget to meet the expectations of the federal government of signing this national agreement. My hunch is that there will not be. So there will not be a national agreement. The non-government schools are not on board; the states and territories are not on board. Yet the government intends to ram these bills through the House and gag the debate today, when we have only had since yesterday to consider 71 pages of amendments. It is no surprise that the government would want to do that, because what is hidden in this new school funding model? It is referred to in part 7 of the amendments that we received yesterday, under the heading 'Implementation plans,' and it is also explained more clearly in the explanatory memorandum: The amendments also provide the Minister with a residual power to give approved authorities directions in relation to their implementation plans, for example, where an approved authority is not undertaking the activities it has committed to. In deciding whether to give such a direction the Minister must have regard to any relevant education agreement that the approved authority is a party to such as the National Education Reform Agreement or the National Education Agreement. What does that mean in layman's language? It means that any state or territory or nongovernment school sector that signs up to this national agreement, and which is implemented, will be handing over the most unprecedented powers to the federal minister for education in Australia's education history. No wonder the Labor government wants this bill to go through, because then the federal minister for education would love to be able to tell the states and territories how to run their schools. He would love to be able to say to the Catholic systems, which Labor has always hated and opposed violently since 1963. They did not introduce the funding of non-government schools, the Menzies government did. And ever since then, ever since 1963, every bit of Labor government policy when it has been in power has been to try to undermine the funding of nongovernment schools, particularly Catholic schools. This legislation, these amendments, will allow the minister for education to say to the Catholic systems: 'If you intend to vary the national model we have established, you need to get agreement from the federal minister for education.' So if the Catholic systems want to say that St Ignatius' Riverview will cross-subsidise St Monica's down the road in their system, they will have to get agreement from the federal minister for education. And every time they vary their system, they will have to go to the federal government to get agreement to do that. If I was a Catholic principal, if I was a Catholic educator in one of the Catholic education commissions, I would not be handing over my power to the federal minister to distribute amongst the Catholic schools in the way they have done for decades so that local parish schools can be cross-subsidised by wealthier, high-end Catholic schools. It is not just for the Catholic schools though, of course. Every independent school is handing over this power to the federal minister for education, and every state and territory. And that is one of the reasons they will not sign up. (Time expired)",46
25,Ms MARINO,BILLS," I see the minister for education sitting at the table. Minister, I am the member for Forrest, and that is in the south-west of Western Australia. My schools today would be looking at these amendments, if they can download them, and they would find, like so many in this chamber, that basically this group of amendments to them is as clear as mud. It is as clear as mud for them. This does not give them any certainty at all. In fact I repeat: gives my schools in the south-west of Western Australia no clear idea of what you are intending; this is as clear as mud for them. We have had these amendments for such a short time. Bunbury Catholic College would be really interested; they would be flipping through this saying, 'You know, what does this actually mean for Bunbury Catholic College?' I defy them to be able to send me an email right now and tell me exactly what this means for them. At the Georgiana Molloy Anglican School, a very good school in my electorate, I know the principal there, Ted Kosicki, would be looking through this and he would be saying, 'What does this actually mean for Georgiana Molloy Anglican School?' I am sure that is what he would be thinking-well, I am not really sure, according to this. I cannot find a list that says this is what GMAS is going to receive. There is nothing in here for my schools. And yet-after what is an absolutely shambolic process that we have seen herelet us face it, Minister: government is supposed to be about process. That is what we understand on this side-that is, that good government is about good process. But we have had six years of a shambles and a circus, a circus and a shambles, and it is almost, to me, as though this is just a dreadful indictment on a very serious issue. We on this side take education extremely seriously, but in dropping these amendments on the table just yesterday, a short time away from an election, I ask: how important is education really to this government? They come in here and make incredible statements, but when you look at the facts the opposite is the case. The government could have done this, as we know, such a long time ago. Gonski, that they talk about this so much: we hear that it has gone from a noun to a verb and back-that is interesting for schools-but what we do knowMr Fletcher interjecting",49
26,Ms MARINO,BILLS,"Yes, it is an interesting thing for schools to debate about Gonski: is it a noun, is it a verb? And that seems about the extent of the government's concern about education in this nation. To introduce this at this point shows contempt, as does throwing 71 pages of amendments at us, the opposition, and saying, 'You have to pass this.' I would liken it to this: what is our duty of care to our schools? It is to actually scrutinise this in detail, as the shadow minister needs to do; to look at this and say, 'What exactly does this mean for every school in our country?' But we are not being given the opportunity to do so. Clearly this government does not place that value on our schools, and certainly not on the schools in my electorate. There has been such a complete lack of detail and it is truly, as we have heard from the shadow minister, a swindle. We know that the funding is not in the forward estimates. The funding is simply not there. The Australian people, they understand this government; they understand that you cannot believe a thing that this government says. So why on earth would you believe anything that they would say about educationparticularly when you look at the process the government has used? Gonski was delivered at the end of 2011. Here we are, almost two years later, on the eve of an election with a couple of weeks left of parliament, and the minister comes in and says, 'There's 71 pages and we want you to pass them now.' But for my own schools in the south-west of Western Australia-and I suspect some of them will be watching this debate with no idea what any of this mean for them-it is as I said: when my principals in my schools read these documents they are as clear as mud, and yet here we have a minister who is saying to us, 'Tick and flick.' That is not the schools in this nation work, and it certainly is not the way that we as an opposition work, Minister. We do not tick and flick because we know there is nothing that this government says that can be trusted, and we certainly know, in looking at the budget figures, there is no money in the budget for what you are proposing.",49
27,Mr FLETCHER,BILLS," I respond to the comments made by the minister who dismissed my previous contribution in relation to the first amendment to this bill, the Australian Education Bill 2012, that the government has moved and who, in a hand-waving way, described it as 'confusing' and had nothing more to say. The point that I am making is that the minister has included, within both the bill and now the amendments, many pages of worthy aspirations. It would seem from the amendments that the government is moving that it was not satisfied with the first several pages of worthy aspirations and wanted to add some more. In my view, this is a meaningless exercise with no legal validity. The inclusion of these many pages of statements will not affect one iota the way that a court interprets the substantive provisions of the legislation. As I read the bill I see that is also the government's view, because proposed section 10 of the bill-prior to the amendments being moved-states: This Act does not create rights or duties that are legally enforceable in judicial or other proceedings. I have two specific questions for the minister, because I have not been able to work them out myself in the time available. Will proposed section 10 still stand after the amendments are moved, assuming they are accepted? Will proposed section 10 stand in relation to every provision of the bill or, as I presume is more likely, in relation to the how preamble and some other clauses? I would like an answer to those questions. More broadly, the question I am asking the minister to address, which to date he has simply dismissed by describing my contribution as 'confusing', is: what is the substantive point of the many pages of wafty and lofty statements of aspiration contained in the original bill which are expanded upon, in ways I have already commented on, in the amendments? Also, what is the work which is done by the further amendments to these statements of high-minded and desirable aspirations? To put the question another way, in language that lawyers often use, what work do these words do? If you put language into a contract, if you put language into a bill, you do so because it is intended to have a legal effect. The words are intended to do some work. I do not know whether the minister practised as a lawyer but I know that he has a law degree, so I assume he will understand the point I am making. What is the work which these words do? Could the minister explain it to the House and could he explain further the effect of the amendments? If the government has moved amendments it presumably thinks they are intended to have a purpose. Therefore, in a consideration in detail stage the minister ought to be able to explain to the House what that purpose is. He ought to be able to explain to the House why he considers it is appropriate that the parliament should pass into law a bill which contains these words. There are many serious concerns we on this side of the House have about the bill the 70-plus pages of amendments which are before the House. We have very serious questions about process; we have very serious questions about the government's bona fides; we have very serious questions about whether this bill does what the government claims it does. Our concerns are only heightened by the appalling process in which the government has dropped 70 pages of amendments on us with only a few hours to analyse them. I also have-as I am sure my colleagues have-other serious questions, and one of my serious questions is: what is the purpose of this high-minded statement of aspirations when proposed section 10 of the original bill says this act does not create legally enforceable obligations? Could the minister please explain how that clause will now apply in relation to the preamble and other parts of the bill? Could the minister please explain the purpose of these high-minded provisions and how precisely the government expects the court to interpret them? Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (11:12): I rise to speak on the Australian Education Bill. This is what it has come to with this government. All that time telling the people of Australia about the education revolution has come down to a nine-page bill and a 71page amendment. The sum total of consultation or committee for this series of amendments is zero. After six years in government, with education at the core of what our current Prime Minister said was at her heart, this is what the government has given us. This government should hang its head in shame. Education funding is already very complex, and this makes it ridiculous. I always found in sales meetings that the sales guy who had not made a sale or who had nothing to add always went on with the most detail. These amendments show that this and minister has not been across the detail. He has not made the sale. Otherwise, he would be able to come in here and explain these things to us. His legacy will be one of failure. I have some questions for the minister. Can the minister tell me what additional funds individual schools will get in 2014 as compared to 2013? If so, can he supply a list of my schools and get me those numbers? If not, why not, and how can any school budget for anything next year? What does the National Plan for School Improvement do that the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority could not do or does not already do? In an era of quality control and best practice, how does this bill address the issue of teacher performance in areas of: (1) classroom management; (2) content delivery; and (3) monitoring and feedback of student progress given that research identifies that the teacher-that is, teacher quality-is a key factor for student success? Should my son's school principal or the Principal of Mundingburra State School apply for a loan now on the strength of this funding model for the dollars the minister says will come after three more elections? If the government were a bank would it take on the loan on the proviso that the principal and interest will become payable only if the government comes good with its funding? If not, why not? As an organisation, how much extra funding can the Townsville diocese of Catholic education expect in funding from this government each year from 2014? If a teacher is performing above and beyond what is reasonably expected, how does a principal in this model reward that teacher? If a teacher is not performing anywhere near the standard required, how does a principal in this model counsel that teacher? And, inevitably, how does he get rid of that teacher if they are not suited to the work? Does this bill make that easier? The minister before raised the issue of computers in schools. I would also like to ask the minister what provision in the budget has come for the replacement of those schools that were bought out? What provision has come for the replacement of all those computers that you put into high schools in Queensland-or have you just passed that on to the state government for them to pick up? What should you do? We have seen what they have done to the home insulation business. We see what they are doing to the telecommunications industry at present. Please: let's pull back from here, because this is folly. This is untested. This is partisan politics at its worse. Not one state education minister has seen this document. The private, Catholic, Christian and independent schools have not seen this document, and neither have their concerns been answered by this increasingly erratic and desperate minister. We should be building communities of learning. Instead you are ripping $2.8 billion out of the university sector and you cannot tell me if the money raised by the parents at St Joseph's The Strand's Beach-A-Thon will count against them in this rubbish amendment. The problem we have here is that you are not giving any certainty. Schools are not the place for an experiment. Schools are not the place to experiment with funding models. We must have certainty. Schools must have certainty. Go into my son's school or Mundingburra State School and explain to the teacher's aide that their funding next year or the year after has been cut, because that is what the principal has to do. Of course when you go to a school everyone is telling you what a good job you have done. Bloody hell! You have to look beyond that to what is actually happening out there. This minister should hang his head in shame.",50
28,Mr RAMSEY,BILLS," I have spent three months on an inquiry with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Employment looking at the Australian Education Bill 2012-the first version, or the version without amendments, it must be said; the 1,400 words, the aspirational bill-and I have not come across one person, including the members of the coalition, who seriously disliked the bill. But, of course, it was an aspirational bill, and largely there is nothing in it. So we have had three months looking at a bill that said nothing, and now, at the eleventh hour of this parliament-some could say, in fact, five minutes to midnight for this parliament-the government brings in 71 pages of amendments to that bill, still with no clarity about what it means in individual dollars for individual schools. It does have funding formulas in there; but, of course, we cannot fill out the Xs and Ys in an algebraic fashion to know exactly what that funding means. We are given no time at all to discuss, to discover, to explore what these amendments mean for Australian schools. I consider it my responsibility as deputy chair of that committee to make sure that legislation we do not fully understand is not passed through this place. It is the committee's job to explore the bills so they can explain to the parliament what it is that changes markedly, that changes the way we do business in Australia-in this case, the way we do business in the education sector. Quite seriously I cannot give that advice to the parliament. Our dissenting members' report, for instance, highlighted the lack of detail and lack of good process where the government seem to be virtually thumbing their nose at the parliament, saying, 'We have the numbers.' That is the only thing that matters at the end of the day. 'We have the numbers,' and we presume that sometime today the government are going shut off the debate on this bill and use those numbers to push the bill through the parliament when we do not know what it means and neither does any school in Australia. It has been a great frustration to the committee throughout that inquiry that, while some of the leading educators in Australia have come to speak to us, those very few that were inside the beltway and had some idea of where the negotiations were going were not at liberty to discuss those negotiations with the committee that is supposed to report to the parliament and give advice on how this bill is going to affect their everyday lives. The rest of the contributors just do not know. They do not have any idea. There is absolute confusion out there. Most of those in the education sector are being asked to take the government at trust. If the last three years have taught us anything about this government, it is that you cannot trust them. You cannot trust their word. They say not only 'Trust us on this bill, and it will be alright on 1 January next year' but also 'Trust us; we're going to take $300 million out of education, but you're going to be better off in five years time.' That is the kind of trust the government is asking schools and the education sector to take them on. Quite clearly the members of the coalition on the education and employment committee could not recommend that this bill be passed on that basis. We asked that the bill lie on the table until the detail is provided. Apparently about 12 hours ago the minister provided the detail, but we have not yet had the opportunity to have a look at that detail. As we expressed in our dissenting report, we believe strongly that, once that detail is provided, it should come back to the education and employment committee to reconsider and not have a 24hour, 48-hour or three-day inquiry as many of the bills in the education and employment sector that are being referred back to that committee in this time are. It should have a genuine inquiry that will give the educators and the schooling systems of Australia the opportunity to fully explore what this legislation means for them-what these amendments mean. As of today, as far as I know, they do not know, and that is a very serious concern for all educators in Australia. Mrs MARKUS (Macquarie) (11:21): All of us in this place would agree that the greatest asset of our nation is our young people. The current generation and future generations deserve nothing but the best. We would all agree that their future and reaching their fullest potential will depend on many factors and one of these factors is their education. We all agree on the significance of education for their future, but it is about priorities. It is about how money is spent. The focus ought to be on teacher quality. It ought to be on pedagogy. Teachers and educators in my community in the electorate of Macquarie are telling me on a daily basis that it is how teachers are trained and mentored and how they are connected with the teaching environment once they are trained. The minister is saying that drawing out the best of future generations-the gifts, the talents, the abilities and the strengths-is about more money. Well, all of us in this place, having looked at the budget closely, understand that that there is no additional money in the budget; in fact there is less. how can the minister come into this place and claim that he is committed to the future education of our people? I do not think so. The current bill does not cater for the diversity in the non-government sector. We have moved an amendment to supplement the definitions in this bill, to define both systemic and non-systemic schools. We have not seen the minister respond to these issues adequately. Looking at these amendments, there are some more questions. The 71 pages of amendments to this bill actually raise more questions than they give us answers. The minister talks today about buildings. He mentioned how significant the buildings revolution, as he called it, was. However, again let me focus on what the educators in my community are telling me. While buildings may be of assistance, they do not really bring change. It is the people inside the buildings that bring change, and that is where the investment ought to go. What is deeply concerning about the bill here is that there are a number of sections that give power to the minister in a way that we have never seen before-power for the minister to intervene in school systems that distribute money according to the various needs of their students and their schools. The minister again says today that he is concerned about meeting the needs of students, but how can a minister in Canberra really know what is needed across a particular system? The Parramatta diocese, which looks after the students in the Catholic schools in my electorate, understands the needs of all its communities. It has new schools, large schools, smaller schools, isolated schools-the list goes on. But there are some sections about giving the minister power that are deeply concerning. Proposed section 81 in division 2 talks about variation So or revocation of approval on a minister's own initiative, and this is very deeply concerning. I will just read proposed subsection (2) of that, because I think the minister needs to answer questions about what this means for individual schools and individual systems: Without limiting subsection (1), the Minister may vary an approved authority's approval by making the approval subject to one or more conditions, and the approved authority must comply with those conditions. Please clarify all the conditions that could be imposed or removed. What is important here is that there needs to be a level of trust, firstly, in the government-well, there is none. With all due respect to the minister, we do not trust what you or your government say, and the people of my electorate, the electorate of Macquarie, do not either. You have broken so many promises. Dollars have not added up, and this is no different. Then you introduce a bill with no transparency, no consultation and no opportunity for us to consult with our local schools and our local communities. You expect us to read it in a brief period of time while we are standing here about to debate, and then you want to interfere in schools' autonomy and their ability to make decisions. (Time expired)",52
29,Mr GARRETT,BILLS,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (11:26): I just want to take the opportunity to respond briefly to some of the contributions that we have heard from the coalition and to clarify some matters for them, as it is clear that they have not been paying attention closely. That is a pity, because this is a very important piece of legislation which is an expression of the desire of this government to see students funded on the basis of need across our schooling sectors. Very quickly, I say to the member for Bradfield, who raised the question about the legal capacity that we might have to understand those matters that are in front of us: I assure you that we do. It is a great pity that the member for Bradfield did not take more time to read these amendments carefully before he started producing spurious and slightly dubious legalistic arguments from the other side of the House. But I just take him to amendment (12) on page 21 of the amendments that have been delivered to him, where the omission of clause 10, the 'not legally enforceable clause', is provided for. I am sorry to point this out in such a basic way to the member, but if he is going to stand up in the federal parliament and start playing bush lawyer then he had better be across those matters to which he is referring. He clearly was not in this case. In relation to the questions that were put by the member for Macquarie and others, on the issue of ministerial discretion and direction under the bill, I just make the point that, firstly, similar to the Schools Assistance Act, the Australian Education Bill does give the minister power to make decisions and determinations and give direction, and they are necessary powers to give full effect to the legislation. But as a safeguard, where the minister has these powers, decisions are not made without regard to what is defined in the bill as relevant arrangements. The point is that that is defined in the bill. It is a written arrangement between the Commonwealth and an authority. It relates to the grants of financial assistance provided in accordance with the act. For a participating government school, it is the National Education Reform Agreement, and that is absolutely straightforward. For non-participating governments, it is the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations. For the Catholic sector, for example, it would be a memorandum of understanding agreed with the state-based Catholic education commission. Remember that states and the non-government sector are afforded added protection through the appeals and review process in the legislation. It is considerably more robust than existing arrangements, so you actually have more safeguards in this bill. So I really query the point that is being made by those opposite. It may be that we have a bunch of political cliches searching for a solution here, but you have to read the amendments to understand that and look at it closely. This is a consequence of stakeholder engagement. I say this to the shadow minister: significant additional concessions have been given to address the concerns that stakeholders had by adding the requirement for the minister to have regard for relevant arrangements when exercising certain powers. By the time we went through the second consultation process, the reference to the requirements had been made more extensively and now appear at section 22, section 58, section 59, section 65, section 73, section 81, section 106 and section 110. The fact is that in this legislation the powers of the minister are now clearly set out in the legislation as opposed to the current arrangements where the minister has broad discretions under various of funding arrangements. So, these new arrangements, I say to those opposite, increase transparency and give stronger legal protections for the funding recipients, and that is as it should be.  Opposition Business) (11:30): There are a few more issues that need to be ventilated before the government attempts to gag this debate. I have heard that they intend to gag it in about four or five minutes from now. It would be an absolutely extraordinary act to gag a debate on 71 pages of amendments that the opposition and the Independents received yesterday after less than an hour and a half's debate. I hope that rumour is not true. In the agreement that the government has signed and has proposed that other states sign, the National Education Reform Agreement-in schedule H-there is a very interesting measure that is called the capacity to contribute. It says: The anticipated level of private contribution will be based on a school's SES score until a new, individual measure of parental capacity to contribute is developed. We know that this is to be developed by 2017 for implementation in 2017, so an individual measure of parental capacity to contribute will replace the SES score in 2017. And individual parental capacity to contribute can only mean one thing-that is, that parents of children in non-government schools will be means-tested to see what their capacity to contribute is to their local school. When I raised this issue, the minister said that what that meant is an aggregate of parents' capacity to contribute. But if it is an aggregate of parents' capacity to contribute, why doesn't it say an aggregate of parents' capacity to contribute? It does not say aggregate, because it is not aggregate; it is individual, and individual parental capacity to contribute can only be a means test on parents of non-government schools. The minister can duck and weave and spin his wheels as much as he likes. Parents, of when they hear 'individual parental capacity to contribute', hear means test. So I say to the Independents and the Labor members who intend to support this new school funding model and I say to the states and territories who have signed up to it or are thinking of signing up to it: understand you are signing up to a national reform agreement on schools that requires you to be a party to meanstesting parents in non-government schools. No amount of spin and obfuscation from the minister can deny the fact that, if this was meant to be an aggregate of parents' capacity to contribute to the schooling of their children, then it would say aggregate. It says individual because that is what the government means to implement-a means test from 2017. I know there are members of the Labor caucus who support Catholic schooling, in spite of their party's long standing opposition to non-government schooling, because they believe in choice for parents. They are signing up-John Murphy in Reid would be one of them; he is being asked to sign up to a new reform agreement that will introduce means tests on his parents in nongovernment schools. The sector is so concerned about what the government is proposing that in an article in The Sydney Morning Herald on 5 June, Geoff Newcombe, the executive director of the Association of Independent Schools of New South Wales said: The data is so rubbery. We're going to do a quality assurance on the data with the government to try and fix where it's obviously incorrect This is six months from when the new system is designed to be implemented. I have already talked about the National Catholic Education Commission and Mary MCKillop College in my own electorate, and most members would have letters from Catholic schools. The Australian Parents Council have expressed their concern. The Independent Education Union expressed their concern, and we have the Catholics, independents, the Independent Education Union, the Australian Parents Council and individual principals all asking for more information, all asking to delay the process so they can get it right. But the government is deaf to them, and the minister has said in his rebuttal to my points that the argument that they are cutting is not true. I asked a question three weeks ago about this particular chart. It shows education",55

36,Mr GARRETT,BILLS,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (11:37): I want to finally respond to some of the additional misplaced and incorrect contributions that we have heard from the coalition, and in particular from a very heated member for Sturt. The first thing to say is that the preamble expressly identifies, recognises and acknowledges non-government school systems. So those views that have been put by members opposite on that matter are incorrect. The fact is that, if there is or threat to funding for government and nongovernment schools, it lies in a continuation with the current broken funding model that would see $16.2 billion less going to schools over time. That was recognised by Minister Piccoli when he said specifically-and after all he is a National Party education minister-that the status quo would see New South Wales worse off. In the absence of any real policy for the future, what we have now is very clearly in front of us a bill that enshrines what we have been talking about and working on with state governments, territory governments and the non-government school sector for a considerable period of time. The fact is that the community has moved on from sectoral debates; it has moved on from the kind of half-hearted scare campaign about alleged means-testing in the model-which is not there at all. The community has moved on, and this bill enshrines what we have been talking about as a government; making sure that every student gets the support in their education that they need and deserve. And we have been prepared to back it in the budget with over $9 billion of investment. If you add that to the states, who want to see this National Plan for School Improvement, we would see $14.5 billion in investment going to schools in the future. I note that even today Mr Innes Willox of the Australian Industry Group is reported as recommending the principles of the National Plan for School Improvement, the Gonski recommendations. He said that they are fundamentally sound and he wants to see governments deliver them. That is a rational response; not like the constant cavilling, carry-on and caterwauling that we have heard from those opposite. This bill is about better schools for all Australians. That is what we want to see any risk happen right now. That is what the parliament will vote on, and that is what the parliament will deliver.",57
37,Mr OAKESHOTT,BILLS," Equity in education matters. And this is a really important contribution to that principle of equity. I have been chased up hill and down dale about a certain 17-minute speech, but anyone who listened beyond about the 10-minute mark would have heard me talking about the importance of equity in education and the clear failures in the education data around rural students, Aboriginal students and low-SES families. So I am thrilled that we are actually seeing that education data being addressed in a substantive way. That is why this legislation does need to progress through this chamber. That is why state sovereignty as promoted in the budget in reply should be protected and endorsed in an agreement between New South Wales and the Commonwealth, and that is why my judgement call is that this should progress through this chamber relatively swiftly this morning. I am listening to this debate and I am seeing people get up for a second and a third time and in many ways repeating messages of a political kind rather than drilling down on the detail. It is a pretty simple proposal before the House. We either accept the education data or we do not. If we do accept the education data, we are accepting a massive failure of public policy. So, righto; if we accept there is a problem, what is the solution? The Gonski process identified an 'intolerable link' between the education data and the funding formula. So either we accept that link or we do not. We accept that it is tolerable or intolerable. Once we have got across that very simple hurdle, we accept loadings and a new funding formula or we do not. We can complain about 70 pages and we can complain about what schools know what level of detail, but in the end it is a pretty simple question before the House: is there a problem in our education data? Yes. Is there an intolerable link that has been identified? Yes. Is the solution to put in place loadings specific to regionality, Aboriginality and to socio-economic status? That is the question before the House. I think everyone has had a crack at second reads; everyone has had a crack in this debate this morning.

Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",60
46,Ms ROWLAND,PAIRS," I rise to strongly support the Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013, and I do so as the Chair of the former Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government and as a former Deputy Mayor of Blacktown City Council, the most populous local government area in New South Wales. The road to financial recognition of local government has been long and it has been hard, but it has gained momentum in recent years due to a number of factors. These include, but are not limited to, a number of High Court decisions, which have in themselves cast some doubt on direct Commonwealth funding to certain entities. These cases include those of Pape and Williams, which I will explore later, which have placed some uncertainty around the way the Commonwealth can and does fund our local communities, including the roads, libraries, childcare centres and sporting facilities built and maintained by local councils and shires across Australia. In local government circles and, certainly, in the wider community and amongst people who are interested in issues of constitutional reform, this issue has been on the agenda for decades. Anyone with a local government background would know this. The Independent Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government, chaired by the Hon. James Spigelman AC, QC, was appointed in August 2011 by the Australian government to consult with the community on whether Australia's Constitution should be changed to include local government. It reported to government in December 2011. The expert panel did two very important things. Firstly, it specifically recommended that recognition of local government in the Constitution should take the form of financial recognition. It expressly ruled out other forms of recognition, such as symbolic recognition, or recognition through federal cooperation, which were two other forms of recognition that were explored. Secondly, the expert panel recommended the form of words that should be added to section 96 of the Constitution, which are: … or to any local government body formed by State or Territory legislation … This means that the proposal would change section 96 to read: … the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State or to any local government body formed by State or Territory legislation on such terms and conditions as the Parliament sees fit. Following on from the work of the expert panel, the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Government, established under unanimous remit of this place, was established by the parliament on 1 November 2012, and received full membership on 28 November 2012. The committee assessed the likelihood of success of a referendum on financial recognition, amongst other things, and in March this year the committee handed down its final report, making one recommendation that: Taking the major finding into consideration, the Committee recommends that a referendum on the financial recognition of local government be put to Australian voters at the 2013 federal election. Finally, on 9 May this year, the Prime Minister announced that the government is planning to hold a referendum on 14 September to recognise local government in our Constitution. The government has proposed wording based on the wording suggested by the expert panel, and subsequently endorsed by the committee. The issue then arises: why vote 'yes'? At the time of drafting the Constitution, local governments were not included in the section 96 Commonwealth funding head of power. The financial arrangements that were outlined in the Constitution over 100 years ago reflected the financial arrangements that existed at that time. The colony governments, soon to become state governments, were relatively independent and guarded that independence jealously. From a financial perspective they held the majority of the revenue-raising ability compared to the Commonwealth. Over time, this situation has of course changed. The Commonwealth is now the main revenue raiser in the nation and distributes its revenues to the states directly, as well as to local community and other projects, which includes local government. The Local Commonwealth has been providing the substantial funds to local government for over two decades or, indeed, over four decades if you include factors such as the Regional Employment Development Scheme, which began in the 1970s. What has been common practice for the benefit of local communities should indeed be recognised in the Constitution. This was a key issue that was considered in the joint select committee process. We heard from a variety of constitutional experts, including Professor Anne Twomey, Professor George Williams, Professor Alexander Brown and the Chair of the Legal Practice Section of Law Council of Australia, Ms Maureen Peatman, on whether these forms of funding could be at risk. The committee also heard from Mr Ronald Williams, who brought the school chaplains case before the High Court, which found, amongst other things, that funding by the Commonwealth of the school chaplaincy program was unconstitutional. As noted by the committee in its preliminary report, the High Court's decision in that was likely to bolster the confidence of people willing to challenge the Commonwealth on constitutional grounds. As was noted in the initial report, the question arose as to whether it would not be a matter of 'if' but 'when' the presently understood ability of the Commonwealth to fund local government would or could be struck down. It was also noted in that interim report that those High Court decisions did create some uncertainty with regard to ongoing direct funding of programs such as Roads to Recovery, with some experts appearing before the committee giving views that it would most likely be found unconstitutional. As all members would be aware, in response to this case the parliament passed remedial legislation, the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment (No. 3) Act, in June 2012 to remedy the decisions arising from these cases. Importantly, the reason I mention this is that, from the evidence given to the committee by Mr Williams, it was quite obvious that he expected to take these issues back to the High Court and again challenge the school chaplaincy program on constitutional grounds. As he said, 'While I was listening to parliament live'-on the financial framework legislation amendment debate-'I made my decision that we must take this back to the High Court.' In light of all this evidence brought before the the committee, we were determined to make an evidence based decision, and that we did. While opinions for and against the referendum varied, the 173 submissions from local government bodies and seven from local government associations were resoundingly in favour of holding a referendum to effect financial recognition by amending section 96 of the Constitution. The issues of constitutional cases are not, I case believe, the most compelling reason to support this bill. As I mentioned previously, the role of local government has evolved dramatically over the past few decades, and a big part of that is the changing nature of the federal/local government dynamic. As someone whose first experience in public office was as a local councillor, I find few things give me greater satisfaction than delivering on things that make a tangible difference to people's lives, such as a new sporting field, a new playground, a new girl guides hall and even a new long-jump pit. That is because financial recognition of local government goes to the very heart of what it means to be a federated nation and people's expectations of what their government should provide for local communities. In my local community this government has partnered with local councils to achieve great outcomes and I will just name a few: $7 million to Blacktown City Council for the Roads to Recovery program from 2009 to 2410; $450,000 to upgrade to the CV Kelly Park, in Girraween in Holroyd council's area, which has been welcomed greatly by the local community including the Girraween Little Athletics Association and many other sporting groups; $250,000 to upgrade International Peace Park in Seven Hills specifically for the benefit of Seven Hills Junior Rugby League Club and their clubhouse; and $4.5 million for the upgrade of Burdekin Road in Quakers Hill. And I am pleased to be on a unity ticket with the Liberal Mayor of Blacktown, Councillor Len Robinson, who has said on the issue of financial recognition of local government and the proposed referendum: If we are not recognised in the Constitution, we won't have access to federal funding streams as the Roads to Recovery and the Black Spot programs. This will cause a noticeable reduction in the work we are doing on our local roads. This is an issue with widespread community support, and recent polling tells us that. It is also an issue with widespread political support, and I know that at the federal level. I wish to acknowledge the presence in the chamber of the member for Ryan, a former councillor for the largest council area in Australia, that of Brisbane City Council, and also one of the other speakers on the list, the member for Parkes, who has a great recognition of the important role federal funding plays in his area, particularly when it comes to regionally focused funding programs. I also welcome the Leader of the Opposition's support for constitutional recognition of local government and I encourage him to lobby some of his state colleagues on the matter. In my home state of New South Wales, Premier O'Farrell's government once did support constitutional recognition, when they were in opposition. Since coming to power, unfortunately, they have walked away from this. As noted by the committee, and I think this is a very important thing to address, the support of the states would greatly enhance the prospects of the referendum's success. I would encourage all members of this place and all state members of parliament to campaign with their local councils in support of this. Local councils expressed their great support to the committee and I am reminded of the evidence provided by the Mayor of Mount Isa, the Hon. Councillor Tony MCGrady AM, who told the committee: ... the reality is that any politician who came out against this proposal would have to answer to his or her peers. I am quite confident that a campaign led by local councils would guarantee support for and the success of this referendum. As I mentioned, in my local community this such federal government has worked with local governments to achieve some fantastic outcomes for residents. I do fear that outcomes are at risk in the future, whether or not in the immediate future but certainly in the long-term future, unless this referendum is successful. Since 2009 the federal Labor government has provided $2,896,500 to local councils in my electorate to fund a variety of projects. In addition to those I have mentioned, they include road upgrades, playground upgrades, sporting upgrades and much more. I know there is a campaign for the 'no case' underway. One of the things that I have seen mentioned in that no case is the issue of funding. I think that there are three important points to note in the issue of funding, and again I would acknowledge the member for Ryan who raised the issue of civics education in this. The three things I think we should be aware of are: firstly, it is the fact that if there is a no vote in either house by a member it would trigger the requirement for the Electoral Commission to produce both the yes and the no pamphlets, which will go out for any referendum. There is also the question of funding for partisan cases. It is always a government decision on the proportion of funding that would be given to the yes and no cases, but this is always informed and assisted by the vote in the parliament on the matter, which I think is very appropriate. In addition, there is a national awareness education campaign so that people are aware of this proposed Constitutional reform, what is happening, what it would actually propose and what it would actually mean. We live in a democracy. People can make up their own minds about whether to vote yes or no, but I think that it is very important for people to know the facts about these issues, and I am sure that no-one in this place would disagree with that. In conclusion, I would like to note that unless specific programs are supported by a head of power in the Constitution, then funds would need to be channelled through the states and through the states only if they are to reach local communities. I am concerned that any flexibility that the Commonwealth and local government enjoy could potentially be lost in the future. As I have said, I think that is a factor and it is certainly the evidence that we took in the joint select committee. It was the evidence that we heard. But more importantly, I think that it is very important to recognise that this is a modest change. We are recognising that we have three tiers of government in 2013 and we have had three tiers of government and of partnering between the Commonwealth tier and the local tier for a very long time. We need to recognise that our Constitution is a living entity. I think that it is important for the community to be ready to talk about the Constitution again. Sometimes we do it with regard to campaigns that have been often on the agenda and we need to remember that the last time we actually voted in a referendum was in 1999 on the issue of an Australian head of state. At that time, we did not have the same mechanisms that are available to us today to disseminate information, to conduct campaigns and to conduct them more quickly, and to involve so many more people. The advent of new technology since 1999, quite frankly, is beyond belief. I think that the more people we engage with, the more people we can let know about the relationships and partnerships enjoyed between the federal and local level that are important to our everyday lives, the more that people will come to understand how important it is to vote in this yes case. So I am very pleased to support this motion before the parliament and for everyone to be aware and to have their say and make an informed choice on this matter on 14 September. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (12:10): I rise to speak on the Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013, and I would like to start by acknowledging the very recent comments and contribution made by the member for Greenway. Local government is the real lifeblood of Australian politics. It is without doubt the level of politics closest to the people. That is not just a slogan; those words sum up a patently obvious reality. I make this observation as someone who has spent many years as a local councillor and member of civic cabinet in Australia's largest council, the Brisbane City Council. Being in this place emphasises the importance of local government, because the reality of federal and state politics is that parliamentary responsibilities take you away from your electorate so often. So it is against this experience that I have made my judgement about this matter. Happily, my judgment coincides with the coalition's policy on this issue. This bill includes the official wording to be put to the Australian people to amend section 96 of the Constitution. The referendum to be considered at the federal election would amend section 96, to read: During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, the Parliament may grant financial assistance to State, or local government body formed by a law of a State, on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit. This bill has been a long time coming during this session of parliament. In August 2011, the government formed the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Government, the 'expert panel', to identify options for the Constitutional recognition of local government and to report on the level of support for such recognition among stakeholders and in the general community. I was honoured to be the coalition representative on that expert panel and to hear many submissions from people all over Australia. The expert panel's final report in December 2011 stated: The majority of panel members support a referendum in 2013 subject to two conditions: first, that the Commonwealth negotiate with the States to achieve their support for the financial recognition option; and second, that the Commonwealth adopt steps suggested by ALGA necessary to achieve informed and positive public engagement with the issue, as set out in the section of this report on the concerns about a failed referendum. Steps include allocating substantial resources to a major public awareness campaign and making changes to the referendum process. As such, the expert panel was supportive of a 2013 referendum on financial recognition of local government through a change to section 96 of the Constitution, provided two conditions were met. The first condition was negotiation with the states to achieve their support for the government's proposed question and, secondly, to take steps as recommended by Australian Government Association to informed and positive public engagement with the issue. And what did the federal Labor government do? They did nothing. They sat on their hands. They did not engage with the a states and they set this referendum up to fail. Then in November 2012, the government dallied and delayed further and then formed the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government. It took this government until 29 May 2013-17 months after the expert Local panel's report-to finally introduce a bill to allow a referendum on the Constitutional recognition of local government at this year's federal election. What are the issues that underpin this debate? Firstly, there is no doubt that there are issues with funding for local government. Indeed, the constitutional challenges to federal funding in the Pape and Williams cases demonstrated that there are issues going forward. As it stands, the door is open to legally challenge funding programs such as Roads to Recovery, Regional and Local Community Infrastructure, Pathways to Adaptation, Regional Partnerships and the Regional Development Australian Fund. This is, therefore, an important referendum. By including local government in the Australian Constitution it will confirm the federal government's ability to provide funding directly to councils and give local communities certainty about funding for vital infrastructure and community services. More generally, as Professor AJ Brown said in his comments to the hearing held in Sydney earlier this year, this constitutional change should not be seen as anything more than a new conduit for funding to local government. It is not about taking away the rights of state governments; it is more about funding local government to provide specific Local services on the ground. Professor Brown's achieve report states: ... this is a mechanism for local government to get a larger agreed share of the total financial pie. That is what local government is legitimately looking for and that is what it should be looking for. State governments are incrementally allowing local government a larger share of responsibility and resources in the federal system as a whole, as is the federal government. When anything major happens, the first thing that both federal and state governments agree on, (once they have agreed that they need to do something,) is who is going to do it, and more often than not local government plays a huge role. I think we have all seen that over the years. We have seen the shifting of responsibility from state and federal governments down to local government. Because local government is closer to the people, because it does have that community contact, they are in a place to deliver programs and projects more efficiently, more effectively and, quite frankly, with better financial value than many of the state and federal governments. Dare I say it, if local government had delivered the pink batts scheme, it would have worked. You are never going to achieve something like that from the federal government level. Speaking to local government representatives in Queensland, they are very aware of the disparate relationship between revenue and service delivery. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has previously confirmed that Commonwealth government taxation revenue represents 80 per cent of taxation revenue for all levels of government. Approximately 16 per cent of revenue is collected by the states, with a mere four per cent going to local government authorities. If we talk about actual service delivery, those figures are reversed: the vast majority of services are provided by local governments. Once again, it is all very well shifting the jobs onto local government, but we need to be able to fund them so that they can do it effectively. Local governments now do everything from running the bus and transport system to providing libraries and child care. Councils are responsible for making their regions better places to live through arts and cultural programs, recreational facilities, events and festivals, youth development programs, and healthy environments. Through economic development initiatives, councils help create jobs in their communities. In fact, local government is one of the largest employment sectors. In Queensland, more than 40,000 people work for councils as full-time, part-time and casual employees and apprentices and trainees. Because they are closest to the people on a day-today basis they pick up the need in the community because they see and understand it. They know what their communities want. We need to be able to fund them effectively. Federal funding for local government projects has been particularly important. The Roads to Recovery program has delivered $356 million in roads funding to Queensland communities since 2009; the Regional and Community Infrastructure Program has delivered more than $146 million since 2008-09; and the Regional Development Australia Fund has provided $54.1 million since 2011 to Queensland communities and councils. In recognition of these successful programs, it is no surprise that local government organisations, including ALGA, LGAQ and the myriad of individual councils across this country, support financial recognition of local governments. They have worked constructively with federal governments in the past, but they need certainty that our Constitution will allow the federal government to continue this cooperative relationship. It is therefore crucial that we discuss how to supplement local government revenue, given the inherent constraints they face in raising revenue. As Professor Brown said during the committee hearings: So we really need to recognise that this is increasing, in a planned, sustainable way, the financial flows of resources to local government-growing them, even though that should occur necessarily as a result of both federal government and state government being prepared to share those resources with the third tier of government more effectively. That is what this is about. The other issue that Professor Brown highlighted, and with which I agree, is that any change that could possibly pass as a referendum would need to leave regulatory control over local government with state governments, as it is currently. Once again, I highlight that this is not a conspiracy to wipe out state governments. We all agree that regulatory control over local government should be left with the states. Constitutional recognition will not change the status of local government, its powers, or its relationship with the state government. Councils will remain the responsibility of state governments. The states will still be able to amalgamate councils, de-amalgamate councils, change council boundaries and dismiss nonperforming councils. However, it is true that Commonwealth funding via state governments is inefficient, ineffective and can result in a reduction of the money flowing to local government. The referendum will simply formalise what has already been happening for more than ten years. This is about providing a more effective and efficient conduit for financial delivery for the states. The coalition supports this referendum. A successful outcome will provide local governments across Australia with the financial security that allows for proper and sensible planning. That planning will, quite simply, provide for more effective local government with better outcomes for local communities. It will also reflect the reality that the implementation of most decisions about regarding our nation's infrastructure are carried out at a local level. This reinforcement of the role of local government will provide for better, more informed decision making as local government's role is constitutionally recognised and legal certainty as to funding and the role of the Australian government's support of local government is provided. This is a win-win situation. Local government will work more effectively. The states will retain their role. The federal government can provide financial support in response to the needs identified by those closest to the people. Most importantly, the real beneficiaries will be the people of Australia-better served, better represented and with better outcomes through more informed local input through effective local government.",60
47,Ms OWENS,PAIRS," I am pleased to stand to speak on the Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013, which is a bill to alter section 96 of the Constitution to specifically state that the Commonwealth may grant financial assistance to local government bodies formed by a law of the state. The bill simply recommends the introduction of 17 words to section 96 for consideration at the referendum on 14 September. Those 17 words essentially put into the Constitution what is already happening in our system of governance in this country. When the Constitution was first drafted 100 years ago, the role of councils was significantly different compared to now. The roles of the states were incredibly important. They were the principal governing bodies and they are well and truly recognised in the Constitution. But the role of councils, which were very new, was essentially to grade a few roads to keep them clear for horses and to deal with rubbish collection and not much more than that. So we had councils which were never recognised in the Constitution. Perhaps at the time there was no reason to do so, as the federal and state relationship was the major one that needed to be dealt with. Now, of course, our local councils are remarkably different to that. I have two councils in my electorate, Holroyd and Parramatta, that cover most of my electorate but Auburn and Hills have little bits on the edges. All are remarkably different councils but they all provide an incredible range of services, from child care to sporting fields to rubbish collection to footpaths to road maintenance, coordinating and assisting a whole range of groups from bushcare groups to people who help the homeless. In fact, so great is the role of local councils that when I am door-knocking-and I do a lot of door-knocking; I managed to pass the 70,000 houses mark a couple of week ago but unfortunately half of them are in another electorate now due to a redistribution-it is the local council issues that are most often raised. It is the state of a road, whether a local road is being used as a major thoroughfare or whether a footpath needs to be replaced. It is the things that affect daily lives of people. These are the things where the people of our community interact mostly with government and in the most cases their major interaction is with local government. I find when I am dealing with community organisations, particularly the grassroots organisations, so strong is the influence of council and the support that council provides those organisations that they tend to fall within council boundaries. So the bushcare organisations in the Parramatta area will fall under the umbrella of the Parramatta City Council and they will all know each other, or they will fall under the umbrella of the Holroyd City Council and they will know each other. People who work with the homeless, and particularly the grassroots organisations, will tend to work within one council area or another as the level of financial and other kinds of support given by councils leads to this sort of separation along council lines. Federal governments over time have recognised this and increasingly we are seeing federal governments contribute directly to local governments. In the past five years alone, the Commonwealth has partnered with local government to deliver over 6,000 community projects which range from things such as libraries, indoor and outdoor sporting facilities, pools, walking trails and bike tracks to bridges, in virtually every single community right across Australia. The practice of the Commonwealth government providing funding directly to local councils is a long standing one that is well received at local council level and by our local communities. In the electorate of Parramatta there have been some extraordinary projects funded. In fact, there has been over $2.3 million given for 17 black spots across the electorate since 2007 when I was elected. I had been out to a number of those spots and talked to residents before the funding was given. I had gone out later to see the effects on the local community of that funding. We have received several grants to improve energy efficiency. Our local council of Parramatta, in particular, received more than $550,000 for the upgrading of lighting, heating, cooling and ventilation and the building management system at Riverside and for new lighting in a number of council car parks in the area. If you then look at sporting and recreational facilities, there was $450,000 the Kelly Park upgrade-the park playground equipment. That was funded directly in Merrylands. The MJ Bennett Reserve upgrade provided playground equipment and a memorial wall and resurfaced the basketball court. There have been a number of national bike path projects through Parramatta. Most people, including the Attorney-General, know that I am a cyclist and I have ridden over those bike paths probably three to four mornings a week for most of the last 10 years. Every time another bit of it turns up, there is a major celebration. We have an extraordinarily beautiful river in the Parramatta River, if you are down there at full tide early in the morning or late at night when the river is calm and full. The bike paths that have been funded through that project have opened up some of the most beautiful parts of our foreshore and well and truly linked incredible infrastructure like great parks at Homebush to Parramatta right through to Richmond now. It is important. We cyclists have well and truly enjoyed that. The bushcare groups tell me they like it as well because it lets them get into some areas that they could not get into and replant seagrass and such things. There is also an upgrade of Sturt Park, upgrades of parks and reserves at Carlingford and Epping and improved access for a pedestrian path at Harvey Murray Park. There was also quite extensive funding for disability access to buildings and to bus stations which again form an incredibly important funding flow for our local community. So what does this change actually mean? We have a terrible history in Australia of voting for referendums. I and my local councils really hope this one will be significantly different. The change in many ways is a minimal change. It is the smallest for change you could possibly make in order to capture in the federal Constitution what is already happening. The change is worth talking through. The section 96 heading is 'Financial assistance to States'-because, again, a hundred years ago that was the relationship between state and federal governments and councils were mostly very small organisations at the time-and it changes the heading to 'Financial assistance to states and local government bodies'. So the change adds four words-'and local government bodies'. The next paragraph, as it is now, reads: During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State … I am wondering whether we could lose the words 'During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth', the Attorney-General, because I think the 10 years has passed. The change adds another 13 words. It adds 'or to any local government body formed by a law of a State'. So it would then read: 'During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State, or any local government body formed by a law of a State'. I point out again that the provision of financial assistance to a local government body formed by a law of a state is something that already happens and has happened for many years, and I have outlined already some of the projects funded under that practice which is currently in place. This minimal change leaves alone any question of Commonwealth involvement in the management of councils. That is well and truly a role for the state. States form councils, they can amalgamate them, they can abolish them and they have oversight of them. This change to the Constitution leaves that as it is. There is no change to the relationship between the Commonwealth government and local council, except that it recognises that Commonwealth governments do provide financial assistance to local councils. This is an incredibly minimal change that recognises the reality of the levels of governance in Australia. I should also add that these words were developed in incredibly strong consultation with local councils. They are, in fact, the choice of local councils. As a person who spends a lot of time trying to remove words from every document I ever write, I have to say that this is an incredibly efficient way make a minimal change that simply recognises the existing relationship between Commonwealth government and local councils in terms of funding, and leaves alone the responsibility for local councils with state government. I commend the bill to the House.",67
48,Mr COULTON,PAIRS," I rise here this afternoon to speak on this bill, Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013, and to add my support for the referendum to recognise local government in the Constitution. In February 2008 when I made my very first speech in this chamber, I mentioned local government and the important role that it plays in local communities and the relationship between local government and the federal government. It was my involvement through local government that found me leaving my former occupation as a farmer and coming down here. While local government is the government closest to the people, quite often it is the decisions that are made here and in different state capitals around the country that impact on local communities. So that relationship between federal, state and local governments is very important. I would like to say from the outset that I am disappointed about the process. I believe that we are undertaking this process at five minutes to midnight. Indeed, going back to the hearing of the committee that was set up to look at the success of this referendum, three back in January the Electoral Commission said that they believed that optimally they would need six months to conduct a referendum. I will not go into the reasons why that was delayed, but to have it announced when it was, four months out, is going to make it that much harder. But, having said that, the decision has been made to to have this referendum, and therefore the Australian people need to get behind it. I represent 17 local government areas in the electorate of Parkes. One of the issues is that in regional areas the relationship between the federal government and the local entity is more important than in the larger metropolitan areas, because a lot of the services that are taken care of by either state or federal governments or, indeed, private enterprise in a large metropolitan area are left to the local councils in regional areas. Professor Anne Twomey, back in January when she addressed the committee of which I was a member, spoke in opposition to this referendum. One of the reasons she gave was that she believed this change would unfairly favour local governments in regional areas. Indeed, that would be one reason why I would be supporting it. But I think that this is minimal. In some ways I believe we should be going further, because what we have here is a minimal change. It has been very frustrating that some of the state governments and some quite well known commentators and ex-members of this place have been very vocal in their opposition to this. Their position in opposition was before the wording was even known. I wonder how you could be strongly opposed to something when you do not even know what was being proposed. When the wording did come out, this was seen as a minimal change. The previous speaker, the member for Parramatta, indicated that this is a minimal change. It is basically fixing up the loopholes that would make direct funding vulnerable to a High Court challenge. I believe the Williams case on school chaplaincy and the Pape case on the stimulus program, which are well-known challenges in the High Court, have put the relationship between the Commonwealth and local government in jeopardy, and I do not believe that we can be sure that we can continue on with the programs we do if we are subject to another High Court challenge. This is not a change to the relationship between state and local government. Local government is the creature of the pretty well wholly and solely owned and controlled by the states. This change does not alter that. Some of the website comments I have seen-that this is some sort of power grab from Canberra-are nonsense. The great conspiracy theorists of our country are coming out and speaking about Agenda 21 and a whole range of other quite bizarre movements as being behind this. I find that a nonsense. This is a bit of housekeeping-a minimal change-and should be seen as that. Historically, some successful programs have come out of this place. In the previous Howard government my predecessor in the now abolished seat of Gwydir, John Anderson, was very much involved in the Roads to Recovery program. It has been a very successful program right across the country. All but maybe three of my councils would be unviable without that program. In more recent times, there has been the rollout of funding under the stimulus programs during the global financial crisis. There has been a lot of discussion about how some of those programs were disasters-look at the pink batts program and at the mismanaged school halls program. But I can tell you there is one program that was rolled out under the Rudd government which you do not hear any complaints about, and that is the funding for regional infrastructure that went out to every local government in the whole 500-odd local government areas in Australia. I have not heard any complaints that that funding was not spent in a timely manner; and it also leveraged other funding in those communities. That funding, which came from the federal government during that period, was multiplied to great effect. I can take you right around my electorate to see programs that were rolled out under that program at that time; programs that were a success because they were under the management of local government. We states; it is should acknowledge that. During the time that I was a former mayor of Gwydir Shire Council, the council ended up having two medical centres-one in Bingara and one in Warialda-that were partly funded by the federal government. Indeed, when I was mayor, the Warialda centre was, I think, funded under the health infrastructure fund under the Regional Partnerships program. That was a program that was very well regarded in regional Australia, despite the attempt by the current government during 2008-2009 to try and destroy the reputation of that program, and Regional Partnerships was a very effective program. Indeed, if you go right around Australia you will see some magnificent pieces of community infrastructure funded by that program. But going back to the medical centre, towns like Warialda now have doctors-because we have a community-owned medical centre that was funded by the local council with assistance from the federal government. In many regional areas, the local healthcare facilities are owned by the council. I have quite a few of those in my electorate. That is another relationship where the federal government directly funds local government through health care. I could go on and on about how that is needed. I find it very frustrating that we seem to be getting into a philosophical argument on this without an understanding of the practical ramifications. One of the positives of the programs that go straight through to the local government is that they do not have to deal with the state bureaucracy; the local government can target the money to where it is needed. I am not sure what the Roads to Recovery program involves now but I understand that when it was established there was only a handful of bureaucrats that managed that program, and pretty well every cent of the money ended up being laid out as roadworks, and not gobbled up by state bureaucracies. Mr Deputy Speaker, the Australian people do have a decision to make on 14 September: as well as deciding who is going to be the government of the day, they need to decide where they stand on this. I believe that the short time frame, every council right across Australia should be campaigning to make their residents aware of the importance of this referendum. They need to calm down-hose down-the conspiracy theorists and they need to point out to people that the sporting fields that they train on, the local pool that they use, and the local medical centre that they attend have all been possible because of a relationship between their council and the federal government. This is a bipartisan referendum, and I will acknowledge that it is the policy of the coalition, as it is of the government, that we support this referendum. Indeed, I believe that all members in this place should be doing that. Australia does have a poor record when it comes to supporting referendums. I would just ask that the Australian people look at this and realise that it is a minimalistic request; realise that it is not going to change the balance of power or the relationship between the three levels of government; realise that it is just going to give certainty to programs of which they would be aware and from which they are gaining benefit in their communities; and get in and support this referendum. Dismiss the nay-sayers, dismiss the conspiracy theorists and dismiss those who may be trying to find their time in the sunshine again and get a public profile over an issue. This is basic housekeeping, it is not major reform, and not only should this House get behind this referendum but, indeed, everyone in Australia should support this. It is just common sense.",70
49,Mr LYONS,PAIRS," I rise in the House to add my remarks to the proposed Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013. The Australian Constitution is the nation's founding political and legal document, and was developed in a series of constitutional conventions in the 1890s. It due to came into effect at Federation in 1901. Australia has changed significantly since then, and it is quite sensible to recognise local government in that document. It is notable that in the last five years the Commonwealth has partnered with local government to deliver over 6,000 community projects to generate local employment and provide long-term benefits for local communities. These are in addition to the repair and upkeep of roads that have taken place at 16,000 road sites across Australia under the Roads to Recovery scheme. Working with local government, we the Labor government have invested billions of dollars in constructing sporting grounds, libraries, ovals, parks, gardens, town halls and community centres. In my electorate of Bass this partnership evident in many projects. During May this year the federal government announced Black Spot funding and community heritage grants. In the last five years, federal Labor money has gone to Aurora Stadium, to the regional tennis centre, to the regional swimming centre and to many other sporting and cultural facilities. The federal government and the local government have worked together to build infrastructure during the global financial crisis and to keep jobs in local communities. To give some background on this particular issue, local government is now recognised in all state constitutions. The Commonwealth Constitutional Convention, established by the Whitlam government, recommended at a number of sessions between 1973 and 1985 that local government be given recognition in state constitutions and/or the Australian Constitution. As a consequence, all states recognise local government. Proposals to recognise local government in the Australian Constitution have twice been put unsuccessfully: by the Whitlam government in 1974 and by the Hawke government in 1988. This issue is once again on the agenda and in August 2011 the government appointed an Independent Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition for Local Government. I was pleased to attend one of those hearings in my electorate of Bass on 25 October 2011. I am, however, alarmed that the opposition seem a bit divided on this issue. At a local meeting in Bass, the Liberal candidate for Bass followed and agreed with Olga Scully in saying that there should not be constitutional change to recognise local government. Indeed, those opposite seem divided on a number of issues lately, including paid parental leave and electoral is funding. On the big issues, it seems that they just cannot get their act together. In December 2011, the expert panel presented its final report, concluding that financial recognition of local government through an amendment to section 96 of the Constitution was a viable option in 2013. In 2012 the parliament established a Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government. The lasting committee released its final report in March this year, and the committee recommended that a referendum on the financial recognition of local government be held in the 2013 federal election. The alteration to section 96 would specify that state and Commonwealth 'may grant financial assistance to local government bodies formed by a law of the state'. The financial assistance can be for a wide range of services and facilities and, without limiting the generality of the specific provisions, the long title of the act refers to grants of financial assistance for community and other services typically provided by local government bodies. The Prime Minister, on 9 May, announced that the government was planning to hold a referendum on 14 September 2013 to recognise local government in the Constitution. The terms of the proposal were publicly released on 16 May. This is a modest but important change to ensure our Constitution remains relevant and reflects all spheres of government in Australia. If you know how to swim today, the chances are you learnt to swim in your local pool. If you kick a footy with your mates on weekends, the chances are you learnt to do that on the council-run oval and of course there is the example we all know of, when you pull out of your driveway, the chances are that the street you are on is maintained by your local council. Many of these facilities are provided in partnership with federal government. Despite this modern reality, the Constitution is silent on the role of local government. We are asking the Australian people, on 14 September, to support a modest change to the Constitution. It is a common sense change, which should be supported. It is about saying 'yes' to retain important community benefits; it is about saying 'yes' to our communities. But I would not like to see this change that is being proposed in any way diminish the role of states with regard to administration of local government. Recognition in the Constitution does not alter the fact that local governments are created by and are accountable to state governments. Constitutional recognition has never pretended to address the issue of financial sustainability. Local governments remain responsible to the states. From time to time, the Commonwealth continues to contribute in the form of financial assistance, grants and other support. I thank local councils in my electorate for the work they do in making our community a better place to live. I enjoy a great working relationship with the councils in Bass. Local government is important to Australia and that is why I support this change to the Constitution. It is time for a sensible, modest change to the Australian Constitution to reflect the reality that, for many years, the Commonwealth has partnered with local government to deliver services and infrastructure that are essential to our local communities. Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (12:52): I rise to speak on the bill: Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013. Our Australian Constitution is not just another piece of legislation; it is the document that the heart of our very democracy. In drafting our Constitution, our forefathers well understood the dangers of centralisation of powers. They understood that decisions about how our nation is governed are best decided by those closest to the coalface. So our Constitution was designed with built-in checks and balances, to limit the power of politicians and government bureaucrats so that no particular person or group had total control. It has served our nation well for over 100 years. Therefore, we should not make any change to our Constitution lightly. I suppose it is the sceptic in me but I believe that, when considering any change to our Constitution, no matter how small or how superficial, we should apply the Adam Smith test. Over 200 years ago Adam Smith warned in The Wealth of Nations: The proposal of any new law or regulation … ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never to be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention. And that is the test that we must apply to any proposed change to our Constitution. These changes that are being proposed are being marketed under the slogan of recognising local government. 'Recognising' is certainly an emotive word-everyone wants to be recognised-and with some notable exceptions the majority of our local councils are doing a very fine job. The electorate of Hughes, which I represent, overlaps three local council areas: Liverpool, Bankstown and Sutherland. All three councils are doing a fine job in very difficult circumstances. They are providing a wide array of services: child care, sporting fields, swimming pools, libraries, local roads, disability programs, arts festivals and galleries, buses and more. We would all like is to see our local government recognised for the great work that they are currently doing. But, coming to the proposed changes, the word 'recognised' does not actually appear in these proposed legislative changes. Section 96-excluding the short preamble-of the Constitution currently states: … the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as Parliament thinks fit. The proposals will see 13 words added to that; so, if amended, it would read: … the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State, or to any local government body formed by a law of a State, on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit. So the word 'recognition' is not in these changes. There have been two previous attempts to pass constitutional changes regarding local government, and both have been defeated. If we all agree that our local councils are doing such a good job, despite two previous questions being defeated, why is there a need for change and why is there a need for change now? I understood that the central argument underpinning the yes case for this proposed referendum question being put arose from two recent High Court cases, Pape v Commissioner of Taxation and Williams v Commonwealth of Australia, and that the High Court's decision in those cases brought into question the legality of direct federal funding to local governments. At first glance, it seems that these High Court decisions gave an overwhelming reason to support the yes case. However, what I found surprising is that these very central arguments about these two court cases, which apparently brought the legality of direct federal funding into question, were not even mentioned anywhere in the explanatory memorandum; nor was this argument used or were these two cases mentioned even once by the Attorney-General when he delivered his second reading speech. So it was with great interest that I read the comments of Anne Twomey, professor of constitutional law at the University of Sydney. The professor has noted: … neither case threatened, at all, the capacity for the the Commonwealth to fund local government, as this may still validly occur through s 96 grants. ……… … The Pape and Williams cases appear to be being used to manufacture a ‘problem' which constitutional amendment can purportedly fix. … Whether there is a genuine ‘problem' … and whether an amendment will give rise to any tangible benefits … remain matters of debate. The professor continued: It is difficult to argue that the potential unconstitutionality of such grants is the ‘problem' that needs to be ‘fixed' by a referendum, when there is another, clearly valid, way of giving the same amount of money to the States for the same purposes without the need for a constitutional amendment. In effect, there is no ‘problem' – merely a perception of a problem … So what appears to be the very central argument of this referendum appears to carry little weight. The so-called threat to local council funding, according to one of our most respected constitutional experts, appears to be a furphy. The second argument for the yes case appears to be the thought that local councils will end up with more money in their coffers. According to the ALGA submission to the expert panel on this bill, it appeared to be based upon the assumption that simply changing the Constitution will result in more funding for local government and that funding will be secure. It is simply not clear how this would result from this amendment. If the yes case were successful, the Commonwealth would still increase or decrease its funding to local government as it does now. As Professor Twomey notes: Arguments that constitutional recognition of local government is ‘required to guarantee Commonwealth funding of local government' are flawed, because the mere fact that the Constitution is amended to permit the Commonwealth to make grants directly to local government, rather than through the States, does not in any way guarantee that it will give more money, or indeed, any money. It is not an obligation to fund local government, or to fund it to a particular level. So, rather than more money for councils, could the opposite happen? Could councils get less money from these amendments? This is exactly what Professor Twomey warns-and again I quote: Most supporters of the campaign, who are by and large members of local government bodies, appear to think that constitutional recognition improve their status and the respect accorded to local government and that it will give rise to rivers of gold. … … … As for the rivers of gold, they might yet turn rivers of tears for local government bodies in the more populous areas if an equalisation approach to direct funding was taken by the Commonwealth as a consequence of a successful referendum. We need to be clear: there is the potentialthrough these amendments-that councils in New South Wales, in my electorate of Hughes, could end up with less funding and not more. There are other concerns but, on balance, although the arguments for the yes case at first blush appear to have merit, upon further analysis they simply do not stand up. So we must closely examine if there are risks of unintended consequences from such a change of little substance. This is exactly what former Prime Minister Howard warned of when he said: … even a casual reference to local government in the Constitution would end up having legal implications far beyond what might be advocated by the proponents of such a change. And there does seem to be the real possibility of unintended consequences. There appears to be the chance that this change could give more power to Canberra. So the first question would be: is this a good or a bad thing? There are certainly some on the other side of the chamber that would say more power centralised in Canberra is a good thing. I say it is not. I believe that our local governments know best how to undertake local projects-far better than any state government and definitely far better than any unaccountable bureaucracy in Canberraand we cannot risk that changing. In considering this proposed constitutional amendment it is import to consider the full will words of the amendment, which finish with: 'the money may be given on such terms and conditions as the parliament thinks fit'. This means that there are no limits whatsoever on the terms and conditions that the federal to government can tie to giving a grant. And as the old saying goes, 'He who pays the piper calls the tune.' So if a local council receives federal money to re-turf a local sporting field, a federal government could make it a term and condition of that grant that that local council had to provide greater power to the union movement-or any other term and condition that the federal government might like to come up with. Professor Saunders has rung the bell loud on these dangers. The professor notes: This is not constitutional recognition of local government. Constitutional recognition is about dignity. There is nothing dignified about receiving conditional grants under these kinds of arrangements. Professor Saunders warns that this proposed change may mean that federal bureaucrats will be running local councils. A yes vote could see cash-strapped local councils being bullied and dictated to and forced to spend money in line with Canberra policies and priorities-contrary to what is what is good for our local communities. Professors Aroney and Prasser in their submission to the expert panel also raised these concerns. They said: Affirming the power of the Commonwealth to make financial grants to local government, though superficially attractive, will not necessarily strengthen local government, every potential, especially in the long term, to increase the power of the Commonwealth … over local government. Local government may appear to benefit from a relatively greater level of independence from the States and from the establishment of a constitutionally secure source of funding, but it would do so at the expense of greater subordination to the Commonwealth, a much more distant government that is inherently less likely to be responsive to the concerns of particular local communities Funding would also most likely become tied to conditions that impose uniform Commonwealth policies on local government bodies, reducing their autonomy and their capacity to serve the particular interests of their own communities. That is definitely a serious concern about this proposed amendment. The other concern is that the panel itself accepted that there is a very real doubt about the constitutional validity of direct grant programs that do not fall under a head of Commonwealth legislative powers, but they acknowledged that they could be made under section 96. The panel further went on to note that one of the reasons it had been argued as to why this was needed was that the Commonwealth was more likely to fund local government if it can do so directly 'with all the political advantages that entails'. This is simply an argument in favour of the Commonwealth government pork-barrelling local councils. If bureaucrats in Canberra can be directed to direct the funding of our local governments based on political agendas and priorities of the Canberra based federal government, how is this in our nation's best interests? Another concern is that there are currently two lines of authority. Councils at the moment are agencies of the state; they take their directions from the state. But, if passed, this referendum would see local government bodies being in the invidious position of but have being slaves to two masters: being responsible to both Commonwealth government and state government. They would be subject to the conditions imposed by the Commonwealth on its funding, with conditions that could well extend beyond the use of the grants to any type of policy that the Commonwealth wished local governments to pursue, as well as being subject to state laws, ministerial directions and policies. We would simply have two masters that local councils would be responsible to. On balance, at best the yes case is weak. Even if direct Commonwealth funding of local government is in peril, which our constitutional experts question, exactly the same amount of funding can be given to local governments under section 96 grants. The problem with this referendum proposal is that it is difficult to find any compelling reason for it, other than it being symbolic. I am a great supporter of local councils. I want to see our local councils remain independent and strong. It is for this reason, due to the clear risks of the adverse unintended consequences and the potential that it may harm our local councils, as detailed by our most highly respected and recognised constitutional experts, that at this stage-and only by a very fine margin-I cannot support these changes to our Constitution. The process for the proposal that has been brought forward by this government has been deeply flawed. I have doubts about its merits. I know I am not alone in this. The public is yet to be convinced of its merits. Until there is momentum, this process should not go forward, so at this stage I cannot support the proposal. (Time expired) Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (13:07): With great pleasure I rise to speak on the Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013, which would provide a modest amendment to our Constitution for the recognition of local government for the purposes of financial grants from the Commonwealth to local governments. I listened with great interest to the member for Hughes in his contribution and was surprised to hear some of the claims that he made. I will deal with them first before addressing some of the substance of the bill. If you listened to the member the Hughes, there were two concerns raised in his contribution. The first concern was that somehow this was a massive overreach of central government into the affairs which have traditionally been the privilege of state governments and that this is somehow improper. We have seen similar claims made by a former senator for South Australia, Nick Minchin, and more recently by others on that side of politics. I find it very strange that these claims are made because they come from the only party, as far as I am aware, which has introduced laws and come to arrangements in this parliament, together with other parliaments around the country, which tie to grants made to independent organisations political requirements that those organisations do not speak out against the policies or decisions of the government of the day. If the member for Hughes or the former senator for South Australia were so concerned that financial grants via this or any other level of government would somehow tie, inhibit or constrain the political independence of a local government or any other organisation in this country then I suspect those concerns would be best voiced in their party rooms and not in the parliament. It is the Liberal and National parties in this country that have a track record of ensuring that there is political constraint on the grant finances to independent organisations, not those on this side of the House. If they are concerned about the political interference in independent bodies, raise them in their party rooms. Raise those objections, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland, but also in Victoria, where coalition governments in those states are including those constraints within their contractual arrangements with independent bodies at this very point in time. The second point that was raised by the member for Hughes was that he is a great advocate for local governments, particularly in our own state of New South Wales, and he wished them to continue in their independence, financially and otherwise. The member for Hughes has probably not picked up a newspaper or has not been following the raging debate that is going on in New South Wales, where there is a debate about the financial sustainability of local governments-and, I suspect, local governments in New South Wales do not have a monopoly on this issue. It goes to the nub of the issue. We know that there are financial constraints on local government. It is a part of what we like to call in public finances the vertical fiscal imbalance-that is, the imbalance between the responsibility for delivering services and the capacity to raise revenue to pay for those services. At no level of government is that constraint greater than in the area of local government. I know this very well in my own electorate, where we have the Shellharbour City Council, a fine council, with a relatively low ratepayer base and a great need for provision of new services-particularly new roads and infrastructure services to new urban developments within its local government boundaries. The Shellharbour City Council is faced with a situation where it can seek to increase rates-and there is a debate going on within the Shellharbour City Council about its capacity to do that. The ratepayers in this region are within the lower band of socio-economic status. They are not high wage and salary earners in that particular local government area. So there is a limited capacity to raise those rates. The other area you can turn to is developer levies-placing a levy on the developers who are proposing to put new subdivisions into a particular area. There are also constraints on the capacity to do that, particularly when you are trying to develop affordable housing within the electorate. So a council like Shellharbour relies on the grants that it can gain from other sources, whether that is direct financial grants from the state government or direct financial grants from the federal government. The member for Hughes in his contribution quoted some constitutional scholars, including Prof. Anne Twomey. Students of constitutional law would be familiar with the work of Prof. Anne Twomey, but she is not the only voice in the debate. Whilst I respect her expertise in this area, she is not the only voice in this debate. People who have been following this particular area of constitutional law would be very familiar that there is a big question mark over the capacity of the Commonwealth level of government to provide direct financial grants to local government. So if you are concerned about the political independence of local governments or you are concerned about the financial viability of local governments, as I am, in their capacity to deliver services, then you should be standing in this parliament and voting and speaking in favour of this bill and then going out to your community and talking in favour of this modest constitutional amendment. It is, if anything, directed at ensuring the independence and the political security of local government-but, more importantly than that, the financial security of local governments. Of the three tiers of government in Australia, local government and the services they provide are of closest proximity to us. We each rely on local government services every day as we go about in our communities. Local governments carry out a great service to our community that is simply beyond the capacity of any other tier of government-certainly Commonwealth and also state, in my view. Their services are broad and expanding. They include not only planning and development services and development approval but also parking, immunisation, public amenities such as toilets and parks, waste disposal and the cleaning and maintenance of local streets, footpaths and roads. There is also an extensive range of community services including libraries, public gardens and sports grounds. I am very pleased to be speaking on this bill today because the bill is directed at ensuring that local governments continue to have financial viability and that they can continue to grow and expand in the delivering of these services. Many Australians would be surprised to hear that local government is not already recognised in our federal Constitution. We are going to hear all sorts of things in this debate, and they need to be addressed headon. I have already addressed the concerns raised by the member for Hughes, but I simply say this: it is important to note at the outset that this bill does not give the federal parliament any power over local governments. It does not change the status of local councils and it does not intrude in the relationship between local and state governments. What it does do is provide certainty over the federal government's ability to provide funding directly to local governments such as already occurs through the popular Roads to Recovery program, a program initiated by the previous coalition government and continued by this Labor government. A short historical interlude: I understand that Adelaide-I see the member for Boothby at the table; he can probably correct me on this-claims the establishment of the first elected municipal council in 1840, followed by Sydney and Melbourne in around 1842. Local government in Australia preceded the establishment, obviously, of our own national government. It is true that the 1901 Constitution ignores the existence of local government and many might ask why local government was overlooked in the first place. According to a 1984 study of this matter by Chapman and Wood, it is believed that 'at none of the three constitutional conventions held in the 1890s was local government discussed; it was not important for the creation of the federation'. Despite the early establishment of local councils in our system of government, it is interesting to note that local government did not come under much consideration during the 1890s constitutional conventions that led to Federation. This is because many present at the conventions, such as Sir Samuel Griffith, saw local government as purely a domestic responsibility of the individual states which had no relevance to federal discussions. Alfred Deakin, a future Prime Minister, apparently suggested at the Australasian Federal Convention in 1897 that some individual 'localities' might be funded directly by the Commonwealth; however, another future Prime Minister, Edmund Barton, saw this as a risky financial proposition. I interrupt myself to say his concerns were about the financial viability the federal government, not about any political concerns about that tier of government funding the local governments. Barton's response reflected the consensus view that Australia's Federation was an agreement between the existing states to create a future nation on mutually agreed principles. It is interesting to note that some estimate that nearly 30 per cent of the first federal parliamentarians elected in 1901 had served in local government. A survey of today's federal parliament would probably yield a similar result. The proposal for this bill today to enable a referendum on this question has a lengthy period of consultation and deliberation behind it, led by this government. In August 2011 the government approved an Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government. In December 2011 the expert panel presented its final report, concluding that financial recognition of local government through an amendment of section 96 of the Constitution was a viable option in 2013. In November 2012 the parliament established a Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government. The committee released its final report in March 2013. The committee recommended that a referendum on financial recognition of local government be held at the 2013 federal election after a lengthy consultation process, engaging with the community-importantly, with all tiers of government as well as with the community-on the questions to be considered at a future referendum. The bill before the House today is a bill to alter section 96 of the Constitution to specifically state that the Commonwealth may grant financial assistance to local government bodies formed by a law of a state. Item 1 of schedule 1 alters the heading to section 96 of the Constitution by including of the words `and local government bodies'. Item 2 alters the Constitution by inserting in section 96, after 'to any State', the text set out in the schedule. As amended, section 96 would be as follows: Financial assistance to States and local government bodies During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State, or local government body formed by a law of a State, on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit. The alteration of s 96 would establish specifically that the Commonwealth may grant financial assistance to local government bodies formed by a law of a State. That is an important point. The Commonwealth would thus no longer need to rely on other, less specific sources of power to provide financial assistance to local government bodies. The wording was specifically designed to give assurance to state governments that, under the proposed change, local governments would remain the responsibility of state and territory governments. I know that is a matter of some concern to many local government bodies, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland where the authorities-some may say the tyranny of central authoritiesin Sydney and in Brisbane, and previously in Victoria with the central authority of Melbourne, have run roughshod over the views of local councillors and local citizens in either merging or demerging, or taking over, local government bodies and putting in place administrators. Nothing in this legislation will impair the ability of a state government to do, or not do, any of those things. It goes merely to the financial arrangements between the government and the local government. This bill provides long overdue Constitutional recognition for government. I commend it to the House. I urge voters in my own electorate of Throsby and across the country to support the proposition and to vote yes at a referendum to be held at the federal election on 14 September 2013. I commend the bill to the House.",72
50,Mr HAWKE,PAIRS," I rise to speak on the Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013. It is quite frightening to listen to some of the Labor Party's backbenchers, including the member for Throsby, and their lack of sufficient understanding about our Constitution and why it is structured the way it is-and, indeed, the role of local government in that Constitution. It is not accurate to say, as he said, that in New South Wales there is a financial problem with councils, and therefore the Commonwealth has to step in and fund them. It is accurate to say that the viability of very small councils is what is at stake, and the purpose of that report was to provide for mergers and acquisitions of two small councils, two small political units, and the mismanagement of those finances. The member for Throsby bells the cat when he says: 'It's just money. It's just finances. What's everybody worried about?' That is the attitude of a government that is heading towards $300 billion of debt, where money does not matter, because money always matters and who controls the money controls the power. It has always been thus. Changes to our Constitution that affect financial arrangements between our Commonwealth and state systems very much affect the power balance between the Commonwealth and state governments, and to imply differently is federal to either be disingenuous or hide a broader agenda. I oppose this change to our Constitution local because I believe it is another attempt to change the political conversation that this government has put forward, to mask from the Australian people what is really going on. I note the dissenting report from coalition members and senators, which particularly noted that the preconditions for success of this referendum, highlighted by the expert panel and other stakeholders such as the Australian Local Government Association, have not yet been met. I also record that this is the third time this referendum will be put to the Australian people. The governments that have put it before are: the Whitlam government in 1974, which saw a 53 per cent 'no' vote in all states except New South Wales; and the Hawke government in 1988, when 66 per cent said no and every state voted against it. Bad governments that are nearing an election should not distort our politics by trying to change our Constitution in this shameless way. I agree with Peter Reith, who says that the yes case will saturate the airways in the week before September 14, and the no case will be silent for lack of funds. The process is the ultimate constitutional fix and besmirches Australia's record of clean elections-more on that later. This is certainly a referendum that the government has set up to fail, and that the Prime Minister has set up to fail. Indeed, constitutional lawyer and vice-chancellor Professor Greg Craven said: This will be a rushed referendum on words drafted in haste for political purposes. I also turn today to the real essence of why I oppose this referendum. It goes to the heart of why I am a Liberal, and an argument we hear too little about in debates on modern governance-that is, correct political structure and how political structure is vital to providing the checks and balances inherent in protecting rights and liberties limiting the power of government. Any change to our Constitution should be made rarely enough to allow careful consideration and due thought. This is the inherent view of the Australian people, who have rejected the vast bulk of referendum proposals. An inherent scepticism of government politicians and requests for additional power is an essential precondition of a free society. It is a great virtue that Australian people have this understanding inherent in them, and it is something that I commend. I point to Isabel Paterson and her treatise on structure in government, The God of the Machine. She wrote about the importance of a society being correctly structured to balance power between levels. The balance was important, and must function correctly for the intended impact-in this case, the limitation of power-to function correctly. Simply put, in an Australian context what that means is that the balance between the state and the Commonwealth-that is, our federal compact-must be maintained. The reason I oppose this constitutional change is that it will alter the balance between the state and the Commonwealth. The balance will shift, again, towards the centre, this time through a level of government that can directly deliver services, duplicating that already available in our states in so many ways. That is why several premiers have argued against this referendum. It shows the threat that this constitutional change represents to state reform. Barry O'Farrell said directly: We do not support local government getting a financial power in the federal constitution because that can fundamentally change the relationship that local government has … Local government across Australia is set up by state parliaments, this financial recognition essentially changes the relationship, gives it a more direct relationship with the federal government. He is correct about that. Cheryl Saunders AO, a constitutional lawyer, said: Even more importantly, this proposal would increase not only Commonwealth power but executive power, exacerbating what already is prevalent a tendency for the Commonwealth to regulate through the expenditure of public moneys, using executive schemes. This goes to the heart of why we need this proposal now to change our Constitution. We had a national government, and our national government was formed for particular reasons-particularly the defence of our nation. Given that Defence expenditure-the reason for us having national governmentas a percentage of GDP is at its lowest level since 1938, I find it disingenuous for members of the Labor Party and the government to say we should be fixing potholes in local roads when we are starving our nation's Defence forces of funds. I find it furthermore wrong that our diplomats overseas are starved of the funds they need to do their vital jobs at the moment, and that posts are closing. They do not have the funds they need to adequately provide for Australia's interests in trade. Free trade agreements are not being conducted. Billions of dollars are being wasted in debt and deficit. And yet the priority of this parliament is to expand the ability of the Commonwealth to spend money on local roads and local issues-is that seriously the priority of this national government? Is now really the time to say: 'Let's loosen the purse strings of the Commonwealth. Let's let them spend money more easily. Let's let them spend it in more ways'? The pink batts scheme would indicate we need more limitations on the expenditure Commonwealth funds. The disasters this government has mismanaged would indicate we need more limitations, not more openings for the Commonwealth to spend more money. This argument by members, which is essentially 'Let's get our federal government into matters that are not its domain', is hardly compelling to me. It is, essentially: 'Let's fix too the state government's potholes. Let's fix the local government council's potholes. Let's not focus our national government on its real purposes-defence, administration of the federal law, diplomacy, trade-all of the things our federal government has done.' I accept that it might be a naive statement of many members here when they say they have no intention to wipe out the state powers of so many MPs in this place, but the intention here is not the same as the effect. MPs in this place saying that it will not do something bad to our political structure is not a sufficient protection. Changes to the Constitution which act to limit power in Australia must, of necessity, be checked for impact against that imperative. I would like to point out that local government is a creature of the state subject to state laws and governed by state ministers and state acts, and I believe it should remain so. There has been no case made by members today about why that should change. Why shouldn't local governments be the purview of state governments? Why shouldn't they be funded by state governments? What is the problem that exists such that the Constitution needs to be altered today? In fact, all of the projects that member after member have listed have occurred. The money has reached them. The Commonwealth has funded them. The objectives have been met already. There has been no articulate, cogent case made about of why the Commonwealth needs to more easily send money to this layer of government. Certainly I also believe that, as Professor Anne Twomey stated: Funding would also most likely become tied to conditions that impose uniform Commonwealth policies on local government bodies, reducing their autonomy and their capacity to serve the particular interests of their own communities. We have local government because it is local, because it responds to local voters in local electorates. To then tie these local government decision-making bodies to a Commonwealth grant which, as we heard from the changes that are proposed, will be subject to the decision of the executive on what, how and why they can spend money will remove that direct distinction of local government and why we have local government in the first place. It is certainly the case that I agree with view of our nation's second-longest-serving Prime Minister, the former Prime Minister John Howard, who said 'even a casual reference to local government in the Constitution would end up having legal implications far beyond what might be advocated by the proponents of such a change.' 'The Constitution is, of course, the founding document of our nation. It is unacceptable that politicians can abuse public money to change the Constitution that limits their power'-that was Julian Leeser. We have seen what has happened in this debate. We heard from the member for Greenway. I do not believe that the member for Greenway, in chairing her government panel, has convinced states, convinced stakeholders or made a public case for change to our Constitution. Instead, the member for Greenway listed the items of pork-barrelling that she thought were good in her electorate. But, if Australians had any doubt about what this is about, they should listen carefully to the contributions of members here. What is this really about? She did not list one project in her electorate that has gone unfunded because of the current arrangements. She did not cite where a local government would have done something if it had access to this constitutional provision. It is of course ridiculous for many members to go forward and say, 'If you learnt to swim, it was in your local pool and funded by a local government authority.' Surely our debate about constitutional change has not reached such a low juncture that we are debating local swimming pools. This is about the structure of the Commonwealth and states and balancing and limiting power, providing for the checks and balances that our nation needs to ensure we have limited government in Australia. I am also very concerned about the public the funding of this campaign. Currently, $21.6 million of public money for the 'yes' case has been allocated and zero has been allocated for the 'no' case. That is very concerning. Even before the campaign the 'yes' argument has been allocated three times the public funding of the 1999 referendum. If we are talking about spending public money, it does not seem this government has any problems already. No constitutional change is needed. It is certainly the case that, even with the High Court cases in relation to Pape and Williams, the federal government has now conceded that these cases do not justify a referendum. The case was not even referenced in the Attorney-General's second reading speech of the Constitution Alteration (Local Government) bill. If you do not even reference the case and do not need to make a case about it then why again are we pursuing this constitutional change? The Attorney General cannot come forward and reference why we are doing it. It is certainly the case that, when you look at this proposal before us, we have perhaps the worse government in Australian history. This is a government that spends money like it is going out of fashion. We have government members who in this debate have said, 'Why would money provide power?' I have to say to those members of parliament that this is not just about the money but it is 'just about the money' because who controls the purse strings makes a big difference to the power of government. It is a ludicrous argument for the members of the Labor Party to suggest that money does not mean power. Governments function through expenditure. One of the prime functions of a government is to deliver a budget which outlines its expenditure and incomings. And yet we have members of the Labor Party saying: 'Hey, don't worry about this. This is just about a few bucks-just so we can send some bucks down to the local government to spend.' We have a constitutional structure. We have a federation, and that federation has been critical to the success of our nation because it does balance the roles of government. It balances the role of states, it balances the role of the Commonwealth and it allocates to them different purposes and functions which, if they got on with and fulfilled themselves instead of trying to shift, would produce a better compact in this country. Look at what will happen if this referendum does not get up. What would be the consequence if this referendum failed, if what I am saying comes to fruition-that a 'no' case wins the popular vote and the vote in the states? There is no consequence. The federal government would still be able to fund local government. The condition, of course, would be that the money is paid by state governments as currently allowed by the Constitution and as has happened since the 1920s. Nobody can point to any other consequence that may happen, so why again are we changing the Constitution? I think we should listen to the voices of many experts in this field. I think we should listen to the voices of former federal minister Peter Reith, a Liberal minister, and former federal minister Gary Johns, an ALP Special Minister of State. Too often today there is a push in our nation to centralise power in Canberra. Too often there is a lack of understanding in this place of why a balance of power between states and the Commonwealth matters to the success of our society. But political structure matters. It matters in Australia as our federation hinges on a correct balance of power vested in states against the centre, the Commonwealth. Voting 'no' to this referendum will ensure that we retain that balance, we retain the best elements of federation and that competitive federalism continues to deliver great benefits. Local government can keep on doing the work it is doing beholden to the people it should be beholden to: its own local ratepayers.",81
51,Dr JENSEN,PAIRS," I oppose the Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013. Section 96 currently allows the Commonwealth to 'grant financial assistance to any state on such terms and conditions as the parliament thinks fit'. The referendum would amend section 96 so as to allow the Commonwealth to grant financial assistance to any state or to any local government body formed by a law of a state. The argument put by the government early in the piece was that decisions by the High Court in the Williams and Pape cases meant that there was a lack of certainty in the Commonwealth's ability to directly fund local councils under section 96, so it had to be amended. Senator Ryan queried this on 30 May in the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, stating: … one of the justifications for the referendum is so that the Williams decision has put the funding power the Commonwealth has direct to local government not using section 96 in doubt … The Minister for Sport, Minister for Multicultural Affairs and Minister Assisting for Industry and Innovation, Senator Kate Lundy, replied: … no, it is not one of our justifications at all. Therefore Minister Lundy has expressly admitted that other and ulterior motives are behind this bill. Similar referenda have been defeated before, in 1974 and 1988. However, two recent High Court decisions-the Pape and Williams cases-have elevated the issue. This whole debate should pivot on local communities being able to provide services based on local need, not Canberra's priorities. The 20 May edition of The Australian Financial Review reported a Nielsen poll showing 65 per cent in favour, but not actually in favour of the government's proposal-just in favour of 'recognising local government in the Constitution'. Back in 1988 the Hawke government went to the people. The Hawke proposal aimed to recognise local government but not to give the Commonwealth additional powers. The current question is completely different: there is no explicit recognition, but there is a new power for Canberra to fund local government directly, on such conditions as it sees fit. How can this not be an affront to the natural rights of the states? It is not coincidental that the few referendum questions that have been approved-the last ones were in 1977-have generally been those that cannot be represented as increasing federal power. The bill in question is clearly not in that category. The government has said that the amendment would only add 17 words to the Constitution. Words matter. What of but one word, 'republic'? The changes being proposed to the Constitution are significant in both practice and principle. Whether it is the Gillard government's intention or not, this referendum will permit further federal government expansion into affairs where it does not have original formal jurisdiction. This change to the Constitution would create new opportunities for Canberra to impose its priorities on the states. To echo the words of former Prime Minister Howard, this enabling piece of legislation would: … distort the Federal structure, give rise to unforeseen and unintended consequences and will lead to an eventual eclipse of the States and their eventual irrelevance as a balance against the centralist power of the Commonwealth. Currently the federal government provides approximately $2.7 billion to local governments annually. Around 80 per cent of this funding is channelled through state governments, but the remaining 20 per cent is direct funding from the federal to the local level and is used to finance programs such as Roads to Recovery and a number of other smaller infrastructure projects. This proposed referendum is a naked and insidious play to increase the power of Canberra and the central government. It is the antithesis of what a Liberal at heart is about. A true Liberal cannot stand for the slow creep of regulation over the rugged individualism and reason of self-determination-local people making local decisions about issues of local importance. The question is: why is Labor doing this, and why now? Labor at its core is about big government, higher taxes and higher spending. Labor is about government running people's lives. Labor is about having a greater say in all aspects of society. That is not the Liberal way and that is not the Australian way. This bill in essence is un-Australian. This bill would enable the diminution of local sovereignty and democracy, and no Liberal member should, or can, respectably support less democracy. There are several other issues to which I direct the attention of the House, the first being local knowledge and the present system of checks and balances. In my electorate of Tangney, we have two large councils. One council, Melville, works relatively well, whilst the other, Canning, has been endemically corrupt and is now under a commissioner. The major and indisputable advantage of having sole state responsibility for the council, apart from having a clear chain of command, is having a clear chain of control-a control that is strengthened by proximity to the councils and key stakeholders and actors, and unique local knowledge. I put it to any member of this place that oversight committees based in faroff Canberra will have no effective understanding or control of councils in my home state of Western Concomitantly, if I am to continue to represent Western Australia in this place then I must surely honour my contract with the people of WA. The people of WA have through the ballot box at the last federal election and the last state election voted overwhelmingly for a party that prides itself on telling Canberra to back off. It was Thomas Jefferson who spoke of education being the first defence against tyranny. I oppose this bill because of the inadequate time given to the AEC to educate on the substance of the bill. The AEC has said that it needs 27 weeks minimum to properly have the argument for the yes and no cases. The reality is that we will have only about eight weeks to debate the issue, as this issue will be completely drowned out in the heat of the election campaign. It is my belief that, if the government is to go ahead with this referendum, the first act of good faith and good practice would have been to invest in a Senate inquiry. Let the Senate fulfil its constitutional role before seeking to dilute and erode the constitutional role of the states. Another act of good faith would have been to give equal weight and, as a corollary, equal funding to both sides of the argument. This is particularly clear given that it is clear",85

The debate may be resumed at a later hour, and the member for Tangney will have leave to continue his remarks. NA Immigration Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Immigration and Citizenship) (13:45): I seek indulgence to advise the House of additional information that has Australia. been drawn to my attention following an answer I gave in the Federation Chamber during consideration in detail last night. I was advised that the former minister for immigration was not briefed on the matter of the Egyptian detainee. I was subsequently advised that the former minister's office received a submission relating to this matter on 28 September 2012. The submission was not signed by the minister. This submission related to the complex issues surrounding the detainee's capacity to apply for a protection visa. The department has advised me that the submission held by the former minister's office was not returned to the department by the then minister's office. I can confirm that this submission was not provided to me or my office upon appointment as Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. The department has also advised that this submission relating to this detainee's capacity to apply for a protection visa has not been resubmitted to me. No matters relating to the detainee were raised with me or my office prior to 17 April 2013, as I advised the parliament last night. The brief of 17 April 2013 related to the movement of this detainee from Inverbrackie to Villawood detention facility. I also advise the House that the detainee was always in detention for his entire period since arriving in Australia. Dr Southcott: Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the minister was quoting from a document, and I ask for him to table that document.",87

54,Mr RUDDOCK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Tonight there is an epic contest between New South Wales and Queensland, and of course I support the Blues. It is not in the State of Origin; it is in the Pie of Origin. Pie of Origin is the brainchild of Rob Pirina of Glenorie Bakery. It was first held last year and he raised some $20,000 for victims of floods in Queensland. He challenged Queensland to the best pie competition, and this year he is raising money for the victims of the Bundaberg flood-in the member for Hinkler's electorate-with money donated for each pie sold during the contest. The challenge has been accepted by Jon Quinn of Quinney's Pies on the Gold Coast, which the member for Moncrieff knows well. I am confident that New South Wales will be victorious in this epic bake-off: the Blues' pies are superior to those of their Queensland cousins. Let me just make it clear: while I commend this competition and the good cause, I commend the New South Wales pies for their superiority. I hope people will buy them. I hope they will participate in the good spirit of this contest. Go the Blues! Cervical Cancer Vaccine Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (13:48): I would like to pay tribute to the GAVI Alliance, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, that funds vaccines for children in the world's 70 poorest countries. It is fantastic that GAVI has recently negotiated to dramatically slash the cost of the vaccine used to prevent cervical cancer. Globally, 270,000 women die of cervical cancer every year. The vast majority, over 85 per cent of those, are in the developing world. HPV is an extremely common infection. One in two women will get it in our lifetime. In the developing world, it is more likely to persist and more likely to lead to the development of cervical cancer. In The countries like Australia, it costs $100 a dose to vaccinate against HPV. GAVI Alliance has changed the economics of access to this vaccine by driving a hard bargain with the makers of the vaccines. Because GAVI are buying for 60 per cent of the world's birth cohort and buying over multiple-year periods, they have been able to negotiate a bulk price for the vaccine. The new price per vaccine is $4.50. This means that millions more women can be vaccinated out of the pool of aid funding in developing countries. In many of these countries, women with cervical cancer die because, by the time it is diagnosed, it is too late for preventative treatment or the drastic therapy which cannot be obtained easily in the developing world. That is why, for women in developing countries, prevention through vaccination is a life-saving option. Well done, GAVI. Swan Electorate: Victoria Park Swimming Club",88

58,Mr IRONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to speak about the future of the historic Victoria Park Swimming Club, which sits in my electorate of Swan. I was recently approached by the swimming club for urgent assistance following advice from the Town of Victoria Park that they will have to pay thousands of dollars a year in new lane fees from July this year. The Victoria Park Swimming Club, one of Perth's oldest professional swimming clubs, was to be charged new lane rates, potentially totalling tens of thousands of dollars a year, and the club was worried they would simply not be able to absorb these new fees and have to pass them on. For members and their children it was an extra cost of $500 per annum. Fortunately, yesterday on 6PR with Howard Sattler I was able to discuss this issue with the mayor of the Town of Victoria Park, Trevor Vaughan, who I know is a deeply community-minded person, and it looks as though we might have been able to resolve the issue. The mayor has assured me he will look at the issue and try and sort it out. While we are talking about it, Jennifer Reilly, the dual Olympian, trained at Victoria Park. As is common, most swimming pools around Australia let Olympians in for free. The Town of Victoria Park wants to take that free membership away, which disappointing, but I will continue to work with the Victoria Park town council and the swimming club to achieve the correct outcomes. Moreton Electorate: Warrigal Road State School  Whip) (13:51): Tomorrow is Queensland Day, and let's hope that Queensland Day starts tonight. Today I have the pleasure of seeing Warrigal Road State School's year 6 students here in Parliament House. It was great to catch up with their hard working teachers: Bob Bekkers, Zoe Vorkus, Judy Ofa, Maris Cock and Kerry Mansfield. They came to Parliament House after I went to their classroom to have a democracy talk as part of the SOSE unit. They came into the chamber to see the historic legislation pass today-our National Plan for School Improvement. It is always great when students from across Australia come to our nation's capital and learn about our history and our democratic processes. Warrigal Road State School is one of the largest schools in my electorate, with a very multicultural school community. I have enjoyed visiting the school many times since becoming their local member in 2007. They also have one of the best fetes in my patch. Warrigal Road State School recently won the Queensland primary school category in the 'Safe schools are smart schools' competition, held on 15 March as part of the third National Day of Action Against Bullying and Violence. I want to use this very important opportunity to congratulate Warrigal Road State School for their positive work to create a respectful, inclusive and safe learning environment for their students. is I was also able to open their new multipurpose hall and classroom as part of the BER program. I thank the P&C members and all the hard working parents for their contributions there-these great 21st century facilities. I would especially like to thank the former principal Jeff Munce, who has been appointed up and away from the school. I also want to acknowledge the new acting principal, Hugh Good fellow, who has proven he has the qualities to lead Warrigal Road State School into the future. Pie of Origin",89
59,Mr NEVILLE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to support my colleagues in the clash of the pie-eating states. As you can see I have enjoyed the odd pie or two in my day. While my electorate of Hinkler has many great bakeries, like Chics, Targo Street Bakehouse and Nightingale Pies, it is Nightingale Pies which will be beneficiary of the competition which starts with tonight's State of Origin. Sadly this bakery, which has two outlets, in north and east Bundaberg, was severely damaged during the Australia Day floods. So the Pie of Origin 2013 challenge, which will involve $1 from every pie sold during the State of Origin series, will benefit Sue and Greg Burridge from Nightingale Pies. The Pie of Origin also highlights the 100th anniversary of Bundaberg rugby league-1913 to 2013. The Queensland State of Origin team, which will do battle for Queensland against New South Wales tonight, took time out from its training last week to come to Bundaberg for that momentous event. I am sure that the boys and Cam Smith will be inspired-if not by the competition tonight, certainly by Chics pies-to bring home the bacon in this first State of Origin game. I thank the founder of Pie of Origin, Robert Pirina, from Glenorie Bakery, and Jon and Tony Quinn from Quinney's Pies- (Time expired) Food Retailing",90
60,Mr KATTER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," The CEO of Coles, Ian MCLeod, has warned against further regulation in food retailing. He has said that parties such as me will be extremely detrimental to areas if Coles and Woolworths are in any way damaged. The spotlight is back on the supermarket giants who claim to be the farmer's friend, while helping fundraise for the mates at Animals Australia by importing cheap foreign fruits en masse while our farmers walk off the land. Yesterday we saw the arrogance of the supermarket giants-CEOs shining through, with their thinly veiled threat of a voter backlash; politicians who dare to speak up for Aussie farmers, suppliers, companies and communities against the might of this all the powerful oligopoly. We now suddenly have all of these politicians coming out of the cracks to lament the skyrocketing market share. This place put forward a committee and the committee said, in 1999, that there was no problem with the retail giants. They had 64.4 per cent of the market then, and they have risen at an average of two per cent a year. There was an AC Nielsen series, which was discontinued in 2002, which had 74 per cent of the market being held by them and 68 per cent in the ABS series. They have risen astronomically since then. (Time expired) Australian Education Bill 2012",90
61,Ms ODWYER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I thought I had seen it all in this place but, unfortunately, we have seen a new low in the parliament. We have seen a debate on education gagged by the Labor Party after only last night delivering and tabling 71 new pages of amendments to the Australian Education Bill and allowing less than 90 minutes for debate in this chamber to analyse and assess that bill. We know the reason. They do not want there to be any analysis of these amendments because within all the detail of the amendments that they dumped into the House last night, there is the notion of capacity to contribute, a new measure for parents to pay. It is a means-test on parents who choose to send their children to independent or Catholic schools. It is a new hit list on schools. The Prime Minister knows all about hit lists, because it was the Prime Minister with former Leader of the Labor Party Mark Latham who drew up a hit list on schools. She is now delivering that as Prime Minister in this place. It is a disgrace that we did not have the opportunity to fully debate the amendments. It is a disgrace that the negotiations have been conducted in secret and it is a disgrace that this Prime Minister will not stand up for strong educational outcomes for all Australians. Greenway Electorate: Victims' Rights",90
62,Ms ROWLAND,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," On 18 November 2011, a fire tore through the Quakers Hill Nursing Home centre in my electorate, tragically killing 11 residents. Some perished in the fire; others as a result of their injuries. At 4.22 am on 30 May 2013, the same week that former nurse Roger Dean pleaded guilty to starting that fire, the Victims Rights and Support Bill 2013, which has retrospective application, was passed through the New South Wales Upper House. News Limited journalist Ben MCClellan reported in the Blacktown Advocate under the headline 'Families furious over compo changes denying them funds': THE same week NSW's worse mass murderer pleaded guilty to the Quakers Hill nursing home fire, the NSW Liberal Government ushered in changes to its victim's compensation scheme that will deny half of the 11 murder victims families financial compensation. This move was defended in that article by Liberal state member for Riverstone, Kevin Conolly. This follows on from criticism from the Community Legal Centres NSW and Women's Legal Services, who say the bill that was passed by the Liberals actually runs counter to the UN's recommendations on reparations for women who have been subjected to violence. This is truly a sorry state of affairs. It is the worse single tragedy in Quakers Hill. I can understand why families are furious. They deserve dignity, justice and reparations. As one of the victim's family members said: 'We don't get a penny. Why kick us when we are down?' That is a very good question. Australian Education Bill 2013",91

65,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to revelations this morning that his own department now says that Australian government debt will reach $290 billion by Christmas this year and will breach the $300 billion limit next year. Given that the Treasurer told parliament just 12 months ago that 'we would be at the end of each year within the $250 billion cap', will the Treasurer now apologise for breaking yet another promise made to the Australian people?",91
66,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Once again we have had more fiction from the shadow Treasurer about debt. I want to go through all of the facts. The first fact is that net debt at 11.4 per cent is a fraction of debt levels of other countries right around the world. In fact, it is one-eighth the level of major advanced economies. I make that point because those opposite are on this fiscal fear week. campaign that somehow our debt levels are not responsible and not sustainable. We have very low debt and sustainable debt in this country and it performs a very important role. When events occur in the international economy, we support jobs and growth, and that is what this government is doing. Of course, those opposite do not want to do I was questioned by the shadow Treasurer on those matters in the House only a few weeks ago, the week after the budget, and I made a number of important points. I said that the borrowing limit did not need to be lifted in either this financial year, 2012-13, or next financial year, 2013-14. I did the face of the shadow Treasurer running around mixing up market value and face value-he did not know what he was doing at all. Mr Hockey interjecting",91
67,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney has asked his question.,92
68,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I said we will also review that in the usual way and amend it as required. Face value was never provided by those opposite when they were in government; it was never published. But today face value was provided to Senate estimates. I talked with the Treasury. It was the most open and transparent thing to do and it was provided to the opposition today. So the government has been completely open and transparent in providing the face value figures, which have never been provided by those opposite. The face value in 2012-13 and 2013-14 is below the debt cap. I also made the point that these matters are considered on a budget to budget basis in the usual way and we would review it in the usual way and amend it as required. That is actually what I told the parliament when these matters were raised with me in budget But what is this all about? What this is really all about is that debt is the Trojan Horse that those opposite are trying to use, trying to exaggerate its impact so that they will be able to justify if elected savage cuts to the bone when it comes to health and education and a massive impact on jobs and that. growth in our community. Debt in this country is low. Our public finances are in great shape, and the problem that those opposite have got is that this is what the rating agencies say about these matters. This demonstrates how those opposite want to talk down our economy day in, day out. This that in is what Standard & Poor's says about Australia: 'The government continues to demonstrate a commitment to prudent fiscal policy over the medium term given the low level of public debt in Australia.' This is what Moody's says about it: 'Australia's relatively low level of government debt has been one of the factors supporting the AAA rating.' (Time expired) Education",92
69,Ms ROWLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the government's plan to build a stronger and smarter economy and how the passage of the Australian Education Bill through the House brings us one step closer to this?,92
70,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Greenway for her question and I am absolutely delighted that today this House of the parliament passed the Australian Education Bill; that is, we endorsed for Australia's children a better education for the future. We endorsed a method of properly funding our children, our teachers and our classrooms for generations to come. And in saying yes to every child realising their full potential, this House today also said yes to a stronger economy in the future. First, to the member for Greenway, we do know from the education reforms that we have brought to date that we can improve children's education, we can make sure that kids get a better education and that student results are lifted. I point to examples like John's Primary School Auburn, with about 260 kids, most of them from a background where they speak a language other than English. We have invested an extra $915,000 in this school and year-on-year standards are improving. In year 3 reading is up five per cent. By year 5 it is up seven per cent, and numeracy is up a staggering 26 per cent. That is one example in one school where extra resources combined with new ways of working have lifted up the standards for our children and enabled them to achieve their full potential. And if you can do it in one school then you can do it in all schools. And if you do it across our schooling system and we achieve our year 12 attainment goals then that means a stronger economy, a gain to the economy of around $11.3 billion, or $416 per person. You would think that in this parliament there could be a moment of unity around replacing our broken system of funding schools at the moment with a system that will work for all schools for the future, getting it right for generations to come, enabling our children to reach their full potential, enabling our economy to be stronger for the future. But, unfortunately, today we did not see that moment of unity. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition voted no to better education for our children. They voted no to a stronger economy in the future. On this side of the House we understand that there is nothing more important to parents than their child's future: the quality of the teacher in the classroom, the access to specialist teachers, the access to equipment, the access to help if they need it and to programs for gifted children who are doing absolutely their best and achieving at the peak. That is what we are promising every Australian school, and we will continue to St fight for this funding reform in every school. (Time expired) Budget",92
71,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his statement just three weeks ago to the House: … it is not necessary to do anything about the debt cap at all … Given that we now know that the $3 billion debt cap will be broken next year as a result of the budget he delivered just three weeks ago, why will the Treasurer not accept responsibility for his actions and now increase the debt cap for the fifth time in just six years under Labor, instead of leaving it to 'someone else', as he said a little earlier this year? (Time expired)",93
72,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Can I say that I do welcome these questions. I hope I get 10 on this question, because what we have had now is further deception from the shadow Treasurer. What he has done is quote selectively from the Hansard. I went on to say: … we will review it in the usual way and, if it were necessary, we would lift it. That is the bit that he did not actually quote today, because this is part of the continuing deception. And the continuing deception is that somehow Australia has an unsustainable level of debt, when in fact net debt peaks at 11.4 per cent of GDP in 2014-15-about one-eighth of the level of major advanced economies. We have to stand back and look at where Australia is, because with our low and responsible levels of debt our economy has grown 14 per cent since the end of 2007. I will tell you what that means: 950,000 jobs! That is because we on this side of the House had the guts to support our economy, unlike those who came into this House and the Leader of the Opposition, who slept through the critical vote on the stimulus package and would not support jobs and growth in our economy. We are prepared to take the responsible decisions, as the ratings agencies have said, to have a low level of debt to support jobs, growth and employment security in our economy. What he is really saying today is that he is outing their hidden agenda, and their hidden agenda is to run a gigantic scare campaign about debt as their excuse for cutting to the bone.",93

75,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Both the finance minister and I spoke with the Treasury and said that it would be a good idea for them to put them on the record in estimates because these have never been provided in this way before. They were never provided by those opposite when they were in government. So, once again, another deception. It is all part of their fear mongering. What this is all about is an attempt to bully the Australian nation into the unwinding of the social safety net, and massive cuts to health and education a la Campbell Newman. His commission of cuts was all about hiding the truth before the election. What they want to do is go to the election pretending Australia has an unsustainable level of debt and that therefore there will have to be very big cuts to public expenditure after the election. Now, there are just a couple of problems with that. The rating agencies recognise how responsible our fiscal policy is, which is why we have a AAA rating from the three global rating agencies-with a stable outlook for the first time in our nation's history. That fact is very embarrassing for those opposite because we understand the importance of good, strong fiscal policy to support jobs and growth, unlike those who want to cut to the bone in health and education and to cut jobs.

79,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (14:12): I want to thank the member for Robertson for her question. She has been a strong advocate for education both in this parliament and in her electorate, with the delivery of over $77 fiscal million for some 97 projects-30 classrooms, eight multipurpose halls and five trade training centres-in the electorate of Robertson. She knows, as we all do on this side of the House, that this is a genuinely historic day in education in Australian history. It is a day that has been a long time coming, and I want to while I am at the dispatch box place my appreciation for the efforts of all those people in both the government and non-government education sectors, including Mr Gonski and his panellists, who provided the clear thinking and the recommendations that this government could take and work with for a new, fairer funding model for school education for all schools around Australia. That is why this reform is so substantial. Yes, there is additional investment that comes with this reform and we committed to it in the budget. But the key thing here is this: every dollar in education that any government spends under this framework in the legislation that passed through this House today is directed at the needs-the individual needs-of students in schools, government and non-government. That is a powerful, transforming reform and a improvement to the way in which we find schools now and the way that the Leader of the Opposition is still committed to. I do not have to go far afield to find support for this proposition. Only in the last day or so we had the Australian Industry Group standing up and saying quite clearly that the needs-based funding reform is an essential thing that we need to do-its principles are fundamentally sound. We had the education minister from New South Wales come down here and actively lobby his National Party counterparts on the other side of the House on that very measure as well. For people in the bush this is such a strong driver of economic vitality and social vitality. The fact is that the loadings in model recognise disadvantage wherever it occurs, whether it is in rural or regional Australia and whether it is in electorates that have a great deal of disadvantage. I know members on the Labor side of the House understand that only too well. This is an important day and it is a day which vindicates the significant reforms and high levels of investment that have been the hallmark of this Labor government ever since we came to office. We are pioneering and pushing forward reform which is aimed at lifting educational performance in every school around the nation and lifting the nation as a whole. This legislation passed through the House. The only people who do not want better schools for Australia are the opposition. (Time expired) Asylum Seekers",94

I remind her that 42,000 people, on 700 illegal boats, have arrived on this government's watch and that more than 10,000 have been released into the great community without comprehensive ASIO checks. Given that a convicted jihadist terrorist was held at a family facility in the Adelaide Hills for almost a year, through what officials called a clerical error, will the Prime Minister now concede that Labor's policies have made Australia less safe than it was under the former government?",95
81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister has the call. The last part of the question was out of order.,95
82,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the Leader of the Opposition: already so clearly in this question time we have seen the divide in Australian politics between this government that is building and investing for the future and this opposition that is trading in fear-trying to trade in fear this and make people worry about the economy, when they know that there is no cause to do so and the rating agencies have spoken. Then, with a question like this, it is trying to raise fear in the community when it knows, and the Leader of the Opposition knows, from answers that have been given in this parliament earlier this week that the person he refers to has always been held in detention. The Leader of the Opposition is out there trying to create fear and people might want to ask themselves why? Why would he be creating fear? Not because he has any answers, that is for sure. The Leader of the Opposition used to walk around saying: 'Stop the boats.' Mr Simpkins interjecting",95
83,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Cowan will leave the chamber understanding order 94(a). He cannot continue this behaviour. The member for Cowan then left the chamber.,96
84,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Now, of course, they have back-pedalled and back-pedalled. They might hope to make some difference in a few years time, if that is possible. Then the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is out there, effectively claiming that they have got an arrangement with Indonesia. Then she had to back-pedal, back-pedal and back-pedal. Then she was shamed into trying to stutter out the truth by The Guardian newspaperMr Dutton interjecting",96
85,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will return to the question.,96
86,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So all of this fear,96

88,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Dickson is warned!,96
89,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"raised by an opposition, which, if it were clear and if it were truthful would say that its policies amount to nothing.",96
90,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. You have, quite commendably, asked the Prime Minister to return to the question. I regret to say that she is defying the Speaker's injunction.",96
91,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister has the call and will refer to the question before the chair.,96
92,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am answering a question very broadly worded about safety and, in answering that very broadly worded question, let me give this answer. What this government will do is continue to be clear with people about the facts and the policy choices. We will listen to expert advice. Mrs Mirabella interjecting",96
93,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Indi might think that advice provided by the former Chief of the Defence Force is worth laughing at. We treat people who have served our Defence Force at the highest level with respect. We treat people with the foreign policy expertise of Michael L'Estrange with respect. We treat a man, like Paris Aristotle, who has devoted his life to working with refugees with respect. We of course are out there implementing the policies that have been recommended by those experts while, on the one hand, the opposition come into this parliament and try to raise fear and then, on the other hand, whenever they are called to do so come into this parliament and put up their hands for more votes, which is what the Leader of the Opposition has done time after time in denying the force and effect of the expert panel. Asylum Seekers",96
94,Mr WILKIE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. SBS report that no asylum seekers have been processed on Manus Island and that detainees are attempting suicide and self-harm. But who knows for sure, because journalists are not allowed access and SBS was stopped by DIAC and contractors? Prime Minister, your government claims that it is PNG that is blocking access, but the PNG Prime Minister and the centre administrator both deny it. Someone is lying here. Who is it, Prime Minister?",96
95,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The use of the word 'lying' of course is out of order. So I will the member for Denison to rephrase the last part and I will advise that, by now, everyone should know that the use of the word in any context is out of order. The member for Denison, on the last part.",97
96,Mr WILKIE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My apologies, Speaker. Someone is being very dishonest here. Who is it, Prime Minister?",97
97,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the member for Denison, of course PNG is a sovereign nation so it has the ability to control who gets visas and who enters PNG. I think that is self-evident. In terms of people who are in PNG and who then seek access to the detention centre on Manus Island, unlike the former Howard government, we have been in the business of enabling there to be transparency about what is happening in detention centres. That is why, for example, the Red Cross has been able to travel to that centre and it is why the International Organization for Migration has been able to travel to that centre and it is why, indeed, even Senator Hanson-Young in the other chamber has been able to travel to that centre. So in terms of openness and transparency, that is the track record of the government. When it comes to why we have people in offshore processing, it comes to the same answer that I just gave to the Leader of the Opposition, although I understand the member for Denison is coming at this from a very different perspective.",97
98,Mr Wilkie,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Speaker, I rise on a point of order: on relevance. It is clear that DIAC, the government's own department, has prevented journalists from entering the Manus Island facility.",97
99,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister has the call.,97
100,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, ask Speaker. I have made clear the way in which people have been given access to the centre, including a parliamentarian from this parliament. My point to the member for Denison is: the reason we have a centre in PNG, the reason we have offshore processing, is that it was recommended by the expert panel and we are implementing their recommendations. Of course, we have been prevented from doing so fully because of the negativity of the opposition, the opposition having consistently wanted to see more boats. Economy",97
101,Mr CHAMPION,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on today's National Accounts? What are the government's plans to keep investing in the big reforms to make our economy strong and keep our nation smart?,97
102,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Wakefield for his question because today's National Accounts confirm that Australia's economy continues to outperform the rest of the developed world0.6 per cent in the quarter, 2.5 per cent throughout the year. This is a strong result for Australia. It is a solid result which is testament to our economic resilience. Our economy is growing faster than just about every other developed economy in the global economy, three times faster than the OECD average. This has been achieved despite the fact that there is global uncertainty and of course despite the very big transitions that are going on in our economy. It comes at a time when we have seen recession again in Europe. We have seen something like six straight quarters of negative growth in Europe, the worse they have experienced since the Great Depression. Nine out of 23 advanced economies have reported March quarter results that have contracted during that quarter. So there is a very difficult global outlook. This also comes at a time when the dollar has been high, and it is certainly bearing down on many industry sectors as we are trying to make the transition from mining sources of growth to nonmining sources of growth. We say that this is a very solid result. The outcome of this is that our economy is now 14 per cent larger than it was at the end of 2007. So we have an impressive array of strengths-solid growth, low unemployment, contained inflation, a AAA credit rating and record low interest rates. What we have to do now is continue to get the big economic calls right, and getting the big economic calls right means making the smart investments for the future within a strong fiscal policy. That is why I was so proud that the parliament this morning passed the education bill. You could not get anything more fundamental to the future of our country than this education bill. It stands alongside other big reforms-the NDIS, the stimulus packages that we put in place back in 2008-09-and is a very substantial achievement for this parliament, a historic day for all our children in this country. We want to ensure that every child gets a good education and that none is left behind. The danger we have here is that people outside New South Wales are going to be left behind. They will be left behind in my home state of Queensland. We have got a big game tonight and the Maroons are going to do well. But what we want to see is Queensland kids doing well as well in the education race and not being left behind the students in New South Wales. There are only two people standing in the road of that-the Leader of the Opposition and the Premier of Queensland. They ought to get out of the way so that we can get this reform in place and decent education for kids right around our country. National Security",97
103,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. I refer the minister to his statement to the House yesterday that there has been no assessment in relation to the convicted Egyptian jihadist terrorist asylum claim. How does the minister reconcile that statement with this letter to me where he states, 'The assessment of the protection claim for this individual is being progressed by the department'? Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Immigration and Citizenship) (14:25): I thank the honourable member for his question. The reference in the letter goes to three particular persons that I was asked about by the honourable member, and I confirmed by way of letter that there was some progress. But in relation to the one individual, the one that was raised in question time yesterday, the assessment of that individual had not commenced. So the response in the letter went to three people; the question to me yesterday went to one person. And in relation to that person, his assessment had not commenced.",98

105,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Reid is not helping himself. The member for Lyons has the call. Education,98
106,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," question goes to the Minister for Regional Services, Local Communities Territories. Why is support for schools in regional and rural Australia so important for families, communities and the economy? Are there any issues to ongoing support?",99
107,Ms KING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Ballarat-Minister for Road Safety, Minister for Regional Services and Local Communities and Territories) (14:27): I want to thank the member for Lyons for his question. I know that he knows how much power education has for changing the opportunities for regional Australians. I know how important this government's education reforms will be for students right across Australia, reforms that have now passed this House despite being opposed by the opposition. The government's National Plan for School Improvement will deliver around $6 billion in additional funding for regional remote schools over the next six years. This is a critical investment in delivering a stronger, smarter and fairer Australia. making this investment because we believe every student deserves access to the bestquality education regardless of where they live. We know that from OECD studies there is a difference between the performance results of metropolitan and remote schools. Indeed, 15-year-old students enrolled in rural schools are the equivalent of 1½ years behind their city counterparts for reading, maths and scientific literacy. That is why government has a plan to make sure schools in regional and remote Australia will have the resources they need to overcome this disadvantage. Under the National Plan for School Improvement, education funding is delivered to those areas most in need. We recognise that schools in rural Australia face unique challenges because of their location and My often because of their size. Under our plan, smaller schools will receive extra funding, in and recognition that they need additional resources, so they can offer their students the same services as those in larger schools. That is why around 40 per cent of the additional investment in education over the next six years will go to regional and remote schools. Honourable members: Hear, hear!",99
108,Ms KING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Absolutely. The reforms that have passed the House today will mean that children in regional Australia will get extra help if they need it. The reforms will mean that regional students will have access to more resources, more skilled teachers who will stay in regional Australia-reforms that the opposition voted against-and money and opportunities that would never be realised under the coalition. The New South Wales Minister for Education, a member of the Nationals, who and represents the people of regional Australia, knows how important this is. I know there are National members who care deeply in We are this House about their communitiescommunities outside those major metropolitan cities that do not have access to the same educational opportunities as people in larger cities. I know there are National members who want students in their electorates to have the best chance of a great education. Sadly, they have tied themselves to the coalition's decision to deny regional and remote schools additional resources. the People in regional Australia will have an absolutely clear choice-a choice between an additional $6 billion over the next six years for regional schools or cuts of $16.2 billion under the coalition.

112,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. I refer the minister to the fact that ASIO informed the Department of Immigration and Citizenship of the presence of a convicted Egyptian jihadist terrorist being held in low-security family accommodation on 30 August 2012. Why didn't the minister know about this serious breach of security until April this year, when his predecessor had been told on 28 September, seven months earlier? Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Immigration and Citizenship) (14:31): I thank the honourable member for his question. I first refer him to the statement. I made just before question time in relation to those matters. As I made clear in parliament last night, I received information for the very first time with respect to this matter on 17 April. That brief went to the transfer of the person in question from one centre to the other. Of course, that was the appropriate thing to do. What I said throughout the course of the questions put to me in relation to this matter",100

114,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The minister has the call. Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR: What I have said in relation to this matter when being asked questions is that at all times our agencies have worked together-that is, ASIO, the Australian Federal Police and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. As a result, this person has been in detention at all times.",100
115,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Speaker, I ask a supplementary question to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. If the minister believes that the low-security facility in South Australia was appropriate for a convicted jihadist terrorist, why was he immediately moved to a highsecurity facility when the minister was advised of his presence? Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Immigration and Citizenship) (14:33): I thank the honourable member for his question. As I indicated, I was briefed for the very first time on this matter on 17 April and the brief went to the transfer of that person from one centre to a centre that was, indeed, a more secure centre. That was the appropriate thing to do by the department upon the advice of the agencies. Infrastructure",100
116,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, and the Minister for Regional Development and Local Government. Will the minister update the House on the new investments the government is making to build infrastructure in Queensland? How is this investment, improving productivity and safety, being received?",100
117,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (14:33): I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. She is a passionate advocate of investment in the Bruce Highway, particularly in her area of Queensland. Indeed, we have delivered, through work such as at Yeppoon, the works on the Bruce Highway as part of the announcement that we had in the budget of a $4.1 billion, 10year plan, bringing our total investment in the Bruce since we came to office in 2007 to some $5.7 billion-real money for real projects to make a real difference. The Leader of the Nationals, indeed, called upon us to match Queensland's billion-dollar commitment for the Bruce Highway. He said this in July last year: Campbell Newman has committed the incoming LNP government to an extra billion dollars for the Bruce Highway. Clearly the federal government needs to match that offer. Well, we didn't match it with a billion dollars; we have $4.1 billion on the table. I would have expected, in yesterday's budget by the Queensland government, to actually see some funds. But I looked for it in the budget and I saw the Queensland transport minister say that they will deliver a record $690 million for the Bruce Highway. I thought, 'Well, that's all right-$690 million. I wonder how much of it is Queensland money and how much is from the federal government?' I thought maybe half-maybe $395 million. Nah. Of the $690 million they claim, $587 million is from this Treasurer's budget. There is $103 million from Queensland-that's all. We are putting in 85 per cent of the funding and they are claiming 100 per cent of the credit. And they say that this is their big priority. But it gets worse, because they wrote to us about the Cross River Rail project. They said, 'If you put in $715 million we'll put in $715 million.' I looked for it. Not a zack, not a cent, for the Cross River Rail project. But it gets better, because today we find out they have an alternative plan for the congestion! They are going to rip seats out of the trains and make people stand up. That is the Newman government's solution to congestion on the rail system in Brisbane. That is austerity in practice. That is the position that this bloke, who has said he won't put one cent into the Cross River Rail project, endorses with his inaction. The combination is diabolical and it is a farce. Queenslanders deserve better. (Time expired) National Security",101
118,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Home Affairs. I refer the minister to the fact that the Australian Federal Police informed the Department of Immigration and Citizenship of the presence of a convicted Egyptian jihadist terrorist in low-security detention on 24 November last year. Why didn't the minister know about this serious breach of security until May this year?,101
119,Mr CLARE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Blaxland-Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Cabinet Secretary) (14:37): I thank the shadow minister for his question. The Australian Federal Police are an outstanding organisation. They do important work and they do it very well. I see in the gallery today Mr Mark Burgess who represents the Police Federation of Australia. He represents the police forces all across Australia who all do great work on our behalf. It is good to have him here today. As the shadow minister knows, and I told him this in parliament last night, there is a separation between operational work and policy work. I have confidence in the Australian Federal Police to advise me on the details that they think appropriate when they think that is appropriate. What I will not do is second-guess the Australian Federal Police on what the Federal Police think is appropriate to brief me on. When I was briefed on this matter by the Australian Federal Police, I asked them to work with DIAC on the review that they are conducting and that is ongoing and that, I think, is appropriate. Workplace Bullying",101
120,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Financial Services and Superannuation. Will the minister outline the consistent approach the government is taking to deal with the human and economic costs of bullying in Australian workplaces? Minister, are there other policies on creating fairer workplaces and what would be their impact?",102
121,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (14:39): I thank the member for Deakin for his question. For the information of the House, the member for Deakin has been working with the Panlock family who are constituents in his electorate. Their daughter tragically took her own life after being bullied at work. So this is a important issue to him. He believes-as I do and as this government does, and as I believe everyone in the House does-that everyone who goes to work should come home safe. There are no other sets of circumstances which would ever be supported. The Productivity Commission has estimated that bullying in the workplace costs somewhere between $6 billion and $36 billion. The Gillard government generally wants to address the economic and emotional cost of bullying in the workplace. I have worked with the Panlock family and others. There are no dollars possible to rate the cost of the loss of their daughter's life and the tragedy and the repercussions that continue on forever from that. We have provided the Fair Work Commission an extra $21.4 million over the next four years to help people who are bullied at work to get help quickly and affordably. I acknowledge that on 9 May My those opposite said that they wanted to address workplace bullying. I quote from their policy: Labor has promised to amend the Fair Work laws to include bullying. The Coalition will support Labor's proposed changes. That is good; a tick for that. The coalition said they would support the government's legislation which delivered a key recommendation of the parliament's bullying inquiry and which was an individual right of recourse for victims of workplace bullying. However, to my disappointment, I read in today's Australian Financial Review on page 3 that the coalition apparently is going to move amendments and excise bullying provisions. I am sad to report to the House that the Financial Review has reported that the decision to move amendments to strike very out tougher workplace bullying laws, which would see bullying complaints referred to the Fair Work Commission, is a surprise as the coalition's industrial relations policy document indicated support for the move. What I do hope here-and I mean this with all sincerity-is that there are some people opposite who just want to tackle the issue of workplace bullying. I believe that. I General, also understand that there is probably the pragmatic small-target brigade on IR within the opposition central ranks who probably want to silence some of the far-right-wing nutters who exist in the Liberal Party on IR. Either the Financial Review is lying or someone in the opposition is. Sorry, I withdraw that. That is unparliamentary.",102

I say again that the ongoing attack on our national security agencies by this opposition is outrageous. It is further indication that the only interest that this opposition has in national security is to use it as a political football. And rather than second-guessing our security agencies, rather than attacking our security agencies, which is what they are seeking to do, rather than second-guessing the briefings that they receive on our national security activities, they should explain how their cuts to the bone and their cuts to national security would affect the national security of our country.",103

131,Mr DREYFUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The recent review of the administration and expenditure of our security agencies and our intelligence agencies, tabled just last Monday by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, found that when it comes to visa security and to security checking the joint parliamentary committee was: … satisfied that the current regime for visa security assessments is the correct one. The fact is that this government has increased the resources that ASIO has to meet an increasing caseload. ASIO is managing those resources in an effective and efficient manner and it does this by determining, through a triage process, which cases should undergo a full security assessment. I want to quote someone else. This is what the Director-General of ASIO said at the recent Senate estimates hearing: In the circumstancesthis is the Director-General of ASIOI would submit that the triaging process is the most effective and efficient way of enabling greatest resources to be applied to the greatest potential risk. He went on to say: With a properly managed risk management system you can reduce the risk very considerably by focusing on real problems. If the opposition is saying that it knows how to manage national security assessments better than ASIO, then it should say how it would do it differently and what it would cost. It is very clear I cannot and will not comment on individual cases, but I would say it is important to note that the individual in question has been in detention at all times since he arrived in Australia.

Renewable energy up 30 per cent; highly-polluting power stations down 14 per cent. In fact, emissions in the national electricity market are down 7.4 per cent since carbon pricing began. That is an equivalent of 12 million tonnes reduced in greenhouse gas emissions. There is an industry report out todayClean energy Australia-that also demonstrates other benefits of the policies that the government has introduced. In 2012 enough renewable energy, for example, was generated to power more than four million homes. Under Labor, one million solar panel systems have been installed on rooftops around the country, compared to just over 7,000 under the Howard government in seven years. One million-achieved by this government. Employment in renewable energy has more than doubled in four years to 24,300. Wind-power-generating capacity has almost trebled since the government came to power. Australians now face a very clear choice on the issue of renewable energy. Our policies-carbon pricing, which is working; the legislated renewable energy target; the Clean Energy Finance Corporation; the Australian Renewable Energy Agency-all of these things are driving significant investment in renewables. On the other side the coalition wants to take a wrecking ball to the lot. In fact, on Adelaide radio recently, the opposition leader was complaining that the renewable energy target would lead to too much renewable energy. Those opposite are out there trying to bully the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, demanding that it defy the law, defy the parliament, defy the Constitution and stop investing in renewable energy and clean technologies. Their threats to remove the carbon price are destroying investment certainty and last week, when given the opportunity to explain his position on climate change, all the opposition leader could say about it and the science that underpins it was that 'something is happening'. We will tell you what is happening: greenhouse gas emissions are down under carbon pricing; the economy is strong; one million solar panels; renewable energy is up 30 per cent; there is a doubling of jobs in renewable technologies. That is what is happening. National Security",105
155,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. I remind her that ASIO had concluded in August last year that a convicted jihadist terrorist was being held low-security detention in the Adelaide Hills. When was the Prime Minister or her National Security Adviser informed of this serious security breach?,106
156,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the Leader of the Opposition's question I say no amount of spin or trying to raise fear changes the facts here. First and foremost-and I know that when faced with the facts a bit of screaming and distraction has to go on-the facts are these: the person he refers to was always in detention. The language that the Leader of the Opposition is using for these questions, and has clearly instructed others to use when they ask questions, is deliberately calibrated to give people another impression. This person was always in detention. On the facts of the matter I refer the Leader of the Opposition to the statement of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship shortly before question time. I also refer him to people who would know more than he does about security assessments, particularly the Director-General of ASIO",106
157,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Speaker, on a point of order: relevance. It was a very simple question: when was the Prime Minister or her office told? I think she owes it to the parliament to give us an answer to this question",106
158,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has the call.,106
159,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question asked contained wide-ranging imputations. Those opposite are out there trying to raise fear and I am going to answer them because I am not going to leave that uncorrected on the national record. Point No. 1 that the Leader of the Opposition has failed to say: this person was always in detention. Point No. 2 that the Leader of the Opposition has failed to say: I refer him to someone who knows in more about national security than he does, someone he may never have met because he has not availed himself of appropriate briefings-that is, the Director-General of ASIO. The Director-General of ASIO said about security assessments, 'The triaging process is the most effective and efficient way of enabling the greatest resources to be applied to the greatest potential risk.' The Leader of the Opposition does not know more about these questions than the Director-General of ASIO. On briefings to me: I was briefed after the matter was raised in Senate estimates. On briefings to the immigration minister: the immigration minister has dealt very clearly with that on the record today. On discussions in the National Security Committee, in which the Leader of the Opposition has never sat: if he had ever sat in the National Security Committee he would know that discussions in the National Security Committee are confidential. Community Services",106
160,Ms SMYTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Community Services, Minister for Employment and Economic Development and Minister for the Status of Women. What is the government doing to support low-paid working people?",107
161,Ms COLLINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Franklin-Minister for Community Services, Minister for the Status of Women and Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development) (14:57): I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. I know the member for La Trobe understands that this government has set aside almost $3 billion to meet our fair share of the social and community services equal pay decision. This investment today is delivering certainty not only to those workers affected by this decision but also to the community service organisations that employ them. We know that these workers are some of the lowest paid in Australia. Many of usincluding the member for La Trobe-are aware of the dedicated work that these professionals do, day in and day out, in their local communities. But for far too long this work has been undervalued, and for far too long it has been seen as women's work. As a result the community sector has been underpaid. This government has been working hard to turn this around. Fair Work Australia's historic equal remuneration order last year means that social and community service workers right across Australia are already getting paid more. Indeed, their salaries were increased from 1 December last year. These wage increases will lift the salaries of workers in this sector by between 23 and 45 per cent over the eight years of this decision. We know that the social and community service workers in this industry are predominantly female, and 120,000 of the 150,000 workers in this area are women. We know that this is a long-overdue victory for the community sector, and a significant advance for the Indigenous equal pay of women. This government wants to ensure that Australian social and community service workers have their proper reward secured now and into the future, and that is why this government has already met its obligations to its own funded programs. But I would like to update the House on progress on agreements with the states and territories, particularly those that fund the workers under the national agreements. Last month South Australia accepted the Commonwealth's offer, and I am pleased to advise that this week the Australian Capital Territory has also accepted the Commonwealth's offer. These agreements represent the Commonwealth's fair share of these pay rises and include conditions specifically focused to ensure that this money flows directly to the workers. I strongly encourage the remaining states and territories to follow the lead of South Australia and the ACT. These reforms are part of this government's vision for a stronger, smarter and fairer Australia, but it is a far cry from what is on offer from those opposite. Indeed, we have seen it in Queensland. The Campbell Newman government has already taken an axe to community service workers in Queensland. We should be very clear that what we are seeing in Queensland is what we will get from those opposite. The Australian people have a clear choice between this government's stronger, smarter and fairer Australia and what those opposite are offering. National Security",107
162,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," This is a question to the Prime Minister. Given that a convicted terrorist was left behind a pool fence for almost a year and for eight months after being identified, that ministers were kept in the dark and that she was kept in the dark and refused to seek briefings, is the Prime Minister entirely satisfied that this important matter of national security has been adequately handled by the government?",108
163,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The imputation in the Leader of the Opposition's question was out of order. The Prime Minister has the call and will disregard the argument and the imputation.,108
164,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Thank you very much. First, to the Leader of the Opposition: the person he refers to was always in detention, and no rhetorical flourish makes a difference to that. Second, it is the Leader of the Opposition who does not get national security briefings. Third, I can inform the House that today I have directed the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security to examine the management by the Australian government agencies of persons",108
165,Mr Morrison,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You said that last Friday.,108
166,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Cook is warned.,108
167,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I had assumed that the opposition would want to hear this; but, as usual, we get the 'national security is a plaything' response, so I will start that sentence again, and maybe we can have some silence and respect in the House for national security",108
168,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,108
169,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Clearly not, because it is just a game to the opposition. But, I inform those people in the parliament and beyond who are actually seriously concerned-so, to others than the opposition-that today I have directed the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security to examine the management of Australian government agencies of persons seeking asylum who present complex security issues, particularly this case. Taxation",108
170,Mr LYONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation. Why is it important to deliver real and fair tax reform for all Australians? What would be the impact on communities of other approaches?,108
171,Mr BRADBURY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (15:03): I thank the member for Bass for his question. This government has been delivering real tax reform to ensure that hard working Australian families and small businesses are able to get a fair share and a fair go. On top of three rounds of tax cuts that we have delivered since 2008 we have tripled the tax-free threshold, we have introduced the instant asset write-off for small businesses and now are interesting loss carry-back, and we have also cut taxes on superannuation for the lowest paid of our workers. Every single one of these measures has been opposed by those opposite, and I am not surprised because, when it comes to tax reform, those opposite think that tax reform is a three-letter word. It is 'GST'. GST is what is in their DNA. They were the ones who introduced it. We know they always wanted to put it on everything and, if they get half a chance, they will come back and try to do the same again. We are against that because we know any plan to increase the GST will smash families, smash pensioners and tie businesses-in particular small businesses-up with even more red tape. But don't take my word for it; listen to what their Liberal state premier family out there calling for an increase in the GST are saying. Look at what Premier O'Farrell has had to say. He says: All options should be on the table, broadening the base, looking at the rate and also the rebates back to the states. And it is not just the Liberal state premiers. Go have a look at the mentors of the Leader of the Opposition-John Howard and Nick Minchin-who are all out there saying: 'Come on, Tony! Come back! Finish the job! We wanted to put it on in the first place; now you finish the job.'",108
172,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will refer to people by their appropriate titles.,109
173,Mr BRADBURY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But it is not just the old guard. We know the member for Mayo supports jacking up the GST. The member for Stirling was out there recently saying it should be on the table. Just yesterday we heard from the former WA Treasurer and the soon-to-be Liberal candidate for Pearce, and he was out there saying we should jack up the GST as well. Not only was he saying that; he said, 'We need to rip money away from states like Tasmania and South Australia to pay for it.' That is what they believe in. So we have this chorus of conservatives out there all calling for an increase in the GST, and what do we hear from the Leader of the Opposition? All we get from the Leader of the Opposition is, 'I won't rule that out.' Of course he will not rule it out. He will not rule it out, because that is exactly what he intends to do. He says he wants a GST review. We all know the tax review he calls for will be a GST review. It will be a vehicle to jack up the GST. We are a government that will stand up against the Liberal state premiers. The coalition, on the other hand, introduced it. It is in their DNA, and they are just champing at the bit, hoping to get an opportunity to come back and finish the job. Ms Gillard: That being the usual number of questions, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA National Security",109

We should not suspend standing orders because what we have before this parliament over the next week and the week after that is nine days of sittings left. We have approaches from the opposition saying: 'Please, Leader of the House, can you make time for us to deal with a range of issues? Can you make time for us to deal with valedictories?

216,Mr ALBANESE,NOES,"including the member for Mitchell. What they said was that the Education Bill was the priority. They said that was the priority and now they seek to suspend standing orders so that they can speak about an inquiry when the Prime Minister has already announced an inquiry by the appropriate inspector general. The Prime Minister has very clearly set an appropriate course of action, which is why we should not be suspending standing orders. It contradicts the behaviour of those opposite throughout not just today but the entire week. We had earlier on today the member for Lyne Mr Keenan interjecting",113

And we were happy with debating education. But they stood up and gave the same speech as the member for Sturt did, not once, not twice, not three times, but-on his own account-four separate occasions. Members of the opposition come in here in order to filibuster just to delay them putting on the record their opposition to opportunity being given to Australian kids, regardless of their background and regardless of whether they went to a public school, a private school, an independent school or a Catholic school. They tried to delay that process. At the same time they come to me and they ask for discussions to be held about the way that parliament will proceed over the remaining days of the 43rd Parliament. I am always happy, as you are aware, Speaker, to accommodate the opposition whenever I can, because that is the kind of Leader of the House that I am; I am inclusive and always happy to take on board any reasonable request from the opposition or the crossbenchers, as the crossbenchers are indicating right now. So we have had a specific request from a number of members opposite. I will not embarrass them by putting it on the record because I can actually keep a secret between members of parliament when it is appropriate that it be kept. They have come to me and they have asked for particular times.

219,Mr Fletcher,NOES,Name them.,113
220,The SPEAKER,NOES,The member for Bradfield might be named in a moment.,113
221,Mr ALBANESE,NOES,"I think the member for Bradfield should stick to those little fiveminute contributions. What they have done when they came before this chamber is say that they want all of their priorities, but whenever the opportunity arises from those opposite, what they do is delay, move suspensions of standing orders. You might take their suspensions remotely seriously had they not done it day after day after day. Indeed, they have proposed more suspensions of standing orders in the 43rd Parliament than were proposed in the previous 42 parliaments put together. It is a strategy that they have. We have all had to engage in what we have seen from the Leader of the Opposition: the longest dummy spit in Australian political history. They have had one strategy, which is to not engage in serious debate, in spite of the fact that this parliament has presented unique opportunities not seen since the period during the Second World War, because a government that does not have a majority on its benches has to engage by definition with the whole parliament in order to secure the passage of legislation. But those opposite, rather than put up alternative pieces of legislation, rather than ask serious questions during question time, rather than engage in serious issues and put forward an alternative vision for this nation, have chosen instead relentless negativity day after day. If anything symbolises the relentless negativity of those opposite it is the dayafter-day suspensions of standing orders. How do I know it is Wednesday? Because this is the third suspension of standing orders this week. How will I know it is Thursday? Because tomorrow will be the fourth. Every day they come in here like clockwork. It has changed a little bit; it used to be that they did Pyne, CM it at 10 to three, just before Playschool came on at three o'clock, so that the Leader of the Opposition got the 10 minutes prior to three o'clock in terms of broadcast time. We have had a slight change in the timing but no change in the strategy. Why? Because, in spite of the fact that we have a minority government dependent upon winning the arguments, the intellectual arguments, for our program of action, whether it be the education reforms that have gone through this week, whether it be DisabilityCare, whether it be the mental health package, whether it be the jobs bill, whether it be the infrastructure legislation",113

Leave not granted.",121
241,Mr WILKIE,MOTIONS,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Denison moving the following motion forthwith: That the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security be directed by the Minister to report by 20 June 2013 on the following: (1) to establish all facts in relation to allegations that a convicted Egyptian jihadist terrorist was in a detention centre in full knowledge of the the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, without passing this information to the Minister; and (2) whether processes and/or resources need to change to address any issues raised, and if so, in detail, to recommend where. I will just speak briefly to this effort to suspend standing orders and to bring this motion on. I think everyone in this House would agree that the possibility that a convicted Egyptian jihadist terrorist was improperly processed and/or improperly held been in detention is a cause for very serious concern. I would hope that every person in this place would agree that it is important that someone or some body get to the bottom of it, ensure that any errors are corrected and that this sort of thing does not happen again. That would certainly be in line with the public's expectations. I note that the Prime Minister has announced today that the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security will look into these matters. I have the utmost respect for the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security and I do not doubt that officer's competency and independence, but I really think this is a matter for the parliament to consider. We have in the parliament a very capable and well-regarded body to look into these matters-that is, the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security. The PJCIS is a highly regarded body; it is populated with well-regarded members of the parliament and with, I think I can say with some confidence, members of parliament who have a high standing in the community-with the possible exception of me. Crucially, it is a competent organisation and well regarded and familiar with security matters. It is the one parliamentary committee which has the competency and the skills and familiarity with the intelligence community, and which could ramp up and undertake an inquiry very quickly. Crucially, the PJCIS also has a track record of working cooperatively-of achieving consensus wherever consensus can possibly be found and making recommendations that would have the support of the whole parliament and, I think, the confidence of the whole community. I ask the parliament to support my attempt to suspend standing orders and to bring this motion on for a decision.",121

Opposition Business) (15:58): standing order 132(b) I believe that through misadventure at least one member missed the division, and therefore I move: That in accordance with standing order 132, standing and sessional orders be suspended to enable the House to divide again on the question: That the suspension of standing and sessional orders moved by Mr Wilkie be agreed to. During the timing of the division, the fourminute spell, one of the opposition's members, the member for Flinders, was seen very clearly at the glass doors of the chamber. He was seconds away from voting. The reason why standing order 132(b) is in the standing orders is so that, if a vote could have been materially affected in a different NOES direction by a member not being able to be present, the vote can be recommitted. In a parliament such as this, there are two members who were not present, Leader of the House, who may have wanted to vote, one of whom we know was standing outside the glass doors-the member for Flinders. The other was the member for Fisher, who did not vote. He did vote in a previous division and he should be given the opportunity to come into the House and vote. There was great confusion, given the member for Denison moved the motion and many members of the House-I would say a good 142-probably did not know that that motion was going to be about the suspension of standing orders to refer this matter, the matter of the holding of a jihadist terrorist in a detention centre in the Adelaide Hills, to the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence. It was a very good motion of NA the member for Denison. The opposition supports it. We believe that national security is one of the most important requirements of a government to get right. We saw in question time today, and have seen all week, that ministers have failed to take of responsibility for the fact that a convicted Under jihadist terrorist was held in detention in the Adelaide Hills behind a pool fence. So we support the member for Denison's motion and I believe the member for Flinders would have supported it. That would have meant 75 votes would have been on the side of the House to achieve the suspension of standing orders-and one other member, the member for Fisher, did not come into the House. I will not delay the House any longer. Standing order 132(b) exists so that, if there is a misadventure and a member is not entitled to come in and vote because they were inconvenienced for whatever reason, the House be given the opportunity to vote again. I put it to the House that this is such an occasion and that therefore the House should vote on it.",122
244,Mr ALBANESE,PAIRS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (16:03): What an extraordinarily short memory the member for Sturt has got. During the last sitting week of this parliament there was a genuine misadventure where people put their hand up, stated why they had missed the division and put it on record-as was provided for when we negotiated the changes to standing orders at the beginning of the 43rd Parliament-and the Manager of Opposition Business opposed it. He opposed it and made this side of the House get an absolute majority in order to allow the recommittal of that vote. You cannot have it both ways. The member for Flinders has finally made it into the chamber.",124
245,Unknown,PAIRS,Opposition members interjecting,124
246,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The member for Kooyong wouldn't want the statute majority to fall over, I should suspect.",124
247,Mr ALBANESE,PAIRS,"The fact is this: the opposition was two votes short of a majority. If it is the case that two members come in here, give an explanation and say they wish to vote, and there was a change, therefore, the outcome as a result of misadventure, I will support the Manager of Opposition Business's motion. That is what we determined collectively-government, opposition and crossbenchers-after the last parliament. I will not play the games that the member for Sturt played during the last sitting week. But if you want an example of playing absurd politics with national security, it is this. The Manager of Opposition Business should also know-he might not, but he should-that the suspension of standing orders, if it were carried, and if the motion were moved by the member for Denison, would be out of order. Because you cannot have an inquiry into specific national security matters concerning individuals by this committee. It is expressly outlawed by the standing orders-by House of Representatives Practice. I say to the crossbenchers: have a bit of common sense and think about the implications of why the standing orders are addressed that way-why House of Representatives Practice is the addressed that way. If we are going to have national security matters dealing with individuals dealt with by parliamentary committees based upon votes we endanger our national security. I say to this parliament and the member for Denison-and the member for Lyne, who I have every respect for-withdraw your motion. It should not be proceeded with. If it were the case that the suspension had been carried-and it will not be carried, because there isn't an absolute majority-it is very clear that it is notMs Julie Bishop: You already know?",124
248,Mr ALBANESE,PAIRS,"Yes, funnily enough, Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I have got a fair idea of how people are going to vote. That is why you have not won one yet. I in have got a fair idea-and I do talk to people and treat them with respect. I am treating the crossbenchers with respect now, because I say to you that the motion moved by the member for Denison would clearly be out of order had the suspension been carried. The Speaker would have had to rule that way and if it then came to the point of the Speaker's ruling, upon advice from the clerks being dissented from, we would have had an issue that went beyond the issues of substance on national security before us today. Common sense tells you that while an issue about an individual is being dealt with, it was not appropriate for this resolution to have been moved. Had there been some consultation with the clerks or with appropriate parliamentary practice, I am absolutely certain that common sense would have prevailed. But I do expect the Manager of Opposition Business to act with some responsibility on this matter and not seek, at each and every opportunity, to gain opportunistic political advantage over an issue that should be above opportunistic politics. National security cannot be a plaything. That is why I objected to questions being raised about what happened at the National Security Committee of the cabinet. That is why we objected to the track of a number of the questions that went down before the parliament today. The Prime Minister has acted absolutely responsibly and appropriately in asking the appropriate authority, the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security, to undertake the action as requested by the Prime Minister. So I say to the crossbenchers and to everyone else: don't play politics with national security-act responsibly and think about the consequences and implications behind this motion that was attempted before the chair. This is why the suspension should certainly not have been granted. With regard to the member for Sturt's motion, I say to him that if it is the case that the member for Flinders missed a vote through misadventure then, of course, in terms of it making a difference to an outcome, if the member for Flinders",124
249,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order. The member for Sturt might want to stay in the chamber for the vote. I thought he might. The Leader of the House has the call.,125
250,Mr ALBANESE,PAIRS,"The member for Flinders and the member for Fisher, both, did not vote in that last division. It is the case that, were that to have occurred through misadventure, I would support a recommittal of the vote. But it is not the case, and what we have here is a motion for the suspension of standing orders, in order to put this motion by the member for Sturt, in spite of his own actions in trying to block this last time. As Leader of the House, I do not engage under the same standards-or lack of standardsthat he exhibits as Manager of Opposition Business. I will do the appropriate thing as Leader of the House. People have missed divisions before. What you do is you have a recommittal. That was the agreement where an outcome was altered. If it is the case that the outcome would be altered, then I will agree to a recommittal under the suspension of standing orders. If it is the case that the suspension is carried, I give notice that, if the member for Denison chooses to proceed with his motion and if the member for Lyne chooses to proceed with his seconding of that motion, I will be pointing to the standing orders and House of Representatives Practice which clearly indicatenotwithstanding the good intentions and motivations of the member for Denison and the member for Lyne-that it is highly inappropriate for a very good reason.",125
251,Mr HUNT,PAIRS," Speaker, may I very briefly offer my apologies to the House. Let me make it clear that I was in an interview with Mr David Speers from Sky Television in a soundproof room. As soon as I was aware I took leave. It is my fault and my responsibility. I am the person responsible. I offer my apologies to the House. I will learn to run faster next time. On the issue in particular, however, of a recommittal, let me say this to the Leader of the House: I can guarantee that my vote will be with the opposition on this. That of itself guarantees that there will be a different numerical outcome. I cannot speak for the member for Fisher but I can guarantee that, automatically, we will be in a one-vote-better position. As to the member for Fisher's position, I will not of course speak for another member of parliament, but the vote will be different. More importantly, in line with the practice, the procedure, the history and the principle of this parliament, and of the very rules and procedures which the Leader of the House agreed to, it would be right and proper and reasonable to follow that practice and allow this recommittal. The last thing I would say is that on this particular topic, of all topics, it would be right and proper to allow the vote to proceed. This is about a matter of national security. I have had some experience in this space and we have grave issues which need to be addressed. The government should have nothing to be afraid of if it has done nothing wrong. This is about sensible, prudent oversight of the way in which the government has gone about managing national security and the simple message is this: if you have done nothing wrong, you have nothing to fear from what has been proposed today. My response to the Leader of the House is very clear. I am responsible for having made the error and I offer my apologies to the House. The Leader of the House is responsible for the tone, tenor and conduct of the House on their side. This is your chance to live up to the principles which you proclaim. This is your chance and your responsibility. Beyond that, on this matter of all matters of the highest national security, in Stone, SN relation to how we treat those with a jihadist background on the government's watch in the government's time, it is absolutely clear this matter would be different if a vote is taken again.

NA NA The SPEAKER (16:25): I have received a letter from the honourable member for North Sydney proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: NOES The failure of the Government to appropriately manage the nation's economy. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",126
253,Mr HOCKEY,IMPORTANCE," Today the National Accounts for the March quarter presented a more sobering picture of the Australian economy than the Treasurer would have us believe. I have three observations. Firstly, it is clear that economic growth is slowing. Growth in the quarter was just 0.6 of one per cent, half of what it was a year ago. A year ago the Treasurer described the 1.2 per cent result for the March quarter: I think the country should have a bounce in its step today. What a great day for Australia and what a stunning set of figures. Today he said, 'The Australian economy continues to expand at a solid pace …' I seem to recall he was a little more graphic than that. He described it as 'an incredible achievement'. It is an incredible achievement to have 1.2 per cent growth in the March quarter last year and 0.6 per cent this year. PAIRS That is an incredible achievement from a Treasurer who is never short of praising himself. The second thing about today's numbers is that when you look at them you see that all of the growth was in net exports, which contributed one per cent to growth. This is due to rising exports but weak imports. Of the 0.6 per cent in economy growth in the Economy quarter, a full one per cent came from the improvement in net exports. What is concerning is that domestic activity went backwards, with domestic final demand falling by 0.3 of a per cent. This was the first fall in domestic demand since the darkest days of the financial crisis in late 2008 and early 2009. That is a significant issue. Domestic activity went backwards in the March quarter of this year for the first time since the financial crisis. The third issue to be aware of is that it is clear that households are cautious. Consumption growth was modest, increasing by only two per cent over the year. Dwelling activity remained muted, increasing by just 2.7 per cent over the year, and household savings continued to rise to 10.6 per cent. What is happening is that people are hibernating-and what a surprise! We have a government that cannot hold policies from budget to budget, week to week or day to day, and that is creating this massive unease in the community which came through in rising household savings and the overall deterioration in domestic activity. What is clear is that since the March quarter consumer confidence has remained fragile at best. The Westpac Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment fell by seven per cent in May to 97.6 per cent, below the break-even 100-point line, and now the number of pessimists in Australia outnumbers the number of optimists for the first time since October last year. Two-thirds of the survey was conducted after the federal government released its budget. Bill Evans, the Chief Economist at Westpac, said: Of course, the remarkable aspect of this result is that it is the first read of the index since the Reserve Bank cut the cash rate by 0.25% on May 7. Absent any other major influences, we would have expected a solid boost to the Index following that rate cut. We have had the extraordinary situation where the Reserve Bank has cut interest rates to record lows and consumer confidence falls. And why? Because consumers have been spooked by Wayne Swan, the Treasurer, previously describing three per cent as an emergency level. Now that it has gone beyond three per cent, they are alarmed. Well, why wouldn't they be? The narrative from this government is totally confused. The narrative is, on the one hand: 'Aren't we good? We've got a AAA rating. We're doing really well. The rest of the world wishes they had the Australian economy,' but, on the other hand: 'Oh, the budget's hit by terrible circumstances beyond our control, and it's so bad out there, we can't balance the budget. It's so bad with an unemployment rate with a five in front of it. It's so bad with growth around trend. It's so bad with the best terms of trade in 100 years. We can't get our budget back to surplusand, by the way, aren't we good?' The Treasurer is proud of mediocrity. That says everything about this Treasurer. He is proud of mediocrity but, what is more, boastful of mediocrity. There is no grand word in the Oxford English Dictionary that the government have not used as a superlative to describe their own performance. 'The biggest reforms', 'the grandest reforms', 'the most significant reforms in a generation', 'the most significant reforms in history', 'the biggest change'-all these big superlatives. They are never short of patting themselves on the back-when they're not stabbing each other in the back! They are not short of patting themselves on the back, but the Australian people are not prepared to pat them on the back, and they cannot understand why. It is because their narrative and their words do not match their actions. That is the fundamental point. Their words and their actions are at odds. Bill Evans, Westpac chief economist-so it is not just me; this is Bill Evans-went on to say: … weakness in confidence is being driven by a sharply negative response to the Budgetand… the sharp deterioration in the fiscal position, indicating renewed fears about the overall the economy. Finally he said: … the budget and the associated fiscal deterioration have been the dominant drivers of this sharp drop in confidence. This is a government that on more than 500 occasions promised to deliver a surplus. This is a government that on more than 500 occasions said that the test of economic success is whether they can deliver a surplus. This is a government that said that pensioners would be worse off if they meandered back to surplus. This is a government that said the measure of its economic performance would be whether it gets the budget back to surplus and starts paying down the debt. That was the benchmark they set. And they boasted of it. They did not just boast about promising it; they even had the hide to boast they had actually delivered it. The Prime Minister herself in her own words claimed credit for having delivered a surplus. Mr Tony Smith: And the Assistant Treasurer in his newsletter.",127
254,Mr HOCKEY,IMPORTANCE,"The member for Casey reminds me the Assistant Treasurer boasted to his electorate of Lindsay-Western Sydney-that he had delivered a surplus. Not only that; he promised to give them further tax cuts. And they were legislated tax cuts. We thought the whole tax cut promise hit rock bottom when Paul Keating said back in 1993: 'Don't worry, Australia. We're delivering you tax cuts that are l-a-w.' He said they were in law. But, going beyond that, this mob, not pleased to have that great legacy of Paul Keating and the l-a-w tax cuts, not only puts them in l-a-w law but then reverses them. We used to joke that Labor could not hold a policy from Lateline until lunchtime; now they cannot hold a budget cut from budget to state of budget. And you know what? There is no intervening election. It is simply their incompetence. So Australians, who were told by the government they should plan with confidence for the tax cuts, compensation, pension increases and increases in the family tax benefit, now have this mob not only taking those away, reversing the legislation and repealing it for tax cuts but again breaking their word. Nothing illustrates it more than what Labor has said about government debt. In this place on numerous occasions we asked the Treasurer, 'What is going to be the limit on the amount of money you are going to have to borrow on behalf of the Australian people?' After in previous years giving us a fair dinkum answer and saying, 'We believe peak debt will be at X,' this year he obfuscated. He twisted and turned. He tried to have different definitions of debt. He went from net debt to gross debt to the debt subject to the debt limit. He tried every twist and turn. Clearly he did not want to answer. Then in estimates the question was asked, and the Treasury, clearly embarrassed by the failure of the Treasurer to provide an answer, decided that they were going to do it. Today in Senate estimates the Treasury revealed the true peak in Commonwealth government issuance. Bear in mind that this goes to trust. It was the Labor Party that said we need to have a debt limit of $75 billion. They broke that. Then they said there would be a debt limit of $200 billion. They broke that. Then they said it would be $250 billion and they broke that. Then they said, 'We need to increase the debt limit to $300 billion.' They said they would never break $250 billion: 'Don't worry. We only need to go to $300 billion because we might, somewhere in the middle of the year, creep a little bit above $250 billion-a week here, a week there. It's really all about issuance, but don't worry, because at the end of the year we won't be above $250 billion, because we're going to deliver a surplus.' Well, one broken promise leads to another broken promise, which leads to another broken promise. What a surprise! So now we find out, as if dragging teeth from a crocodile, that Labor, which has a $300 billion debt limit, now is going to go to $290 billion before Christmas this year, and next year to $330 billion, and the year after that to $340 billion. Then, for the year after that, it says 'not available'. Well, hoping you are not going to be available on 15 September. But for some odd reason the debt keeps going up and up and up and up. It is good enough for the government to be able to forecast in 2016-17 that it is going to spend so much on chasing orange roughies down a river or on education or health. In fact, it is boasting about how much money it is going to spend on education in 2022, but it cannot tell us how much it is going to borrow in four years time. You know why, Mr Deputy Speaker? Because it keeps going up and up and up, and at the same time Labor's credibility is going down, down, down. You know what is worse? A Treasurer who is proud of mediocrity and proud of his legacy of gargantuan debt and deficits compared to his predecessor. You know what, Mr Deputy Speaker? He does not have the guts to come in here and front the Australian people and say, 'I need to increase the credit limit again.' He sent someone else to the bank. He does not have the guts to front the bank manager and say, 'I need to increase my credit card limit for the fifth time.' Instead he comes into this place and says, 'We've delivered the information on the debt limit that the Liberals never did.' We never had the debt. We paid off your debt last time. Now you are leaving us-or 'someone else', as he said to Neil Mitchell on Melbourne radio-after 14 September to clean up your mess. Shame, Labor, shame! This is the second time in my lifetime in this parliament that we have had to step up to the plate and clean up your damn mess. But the problem is that it is the taxpayers of Australia that do the heavy lifting. It is the taxpayers of Australia that have to find the extra taxes to pay down the debt, because Labor is addicted to debt. Labor is addicted to spending other people's money, and the problem for Labor is that it has run out of other people's money, and that is typical of I am kind of the socialist way.",129
255,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (16:40): Sometimes, in moments of rage and excess, the truth comes out, and we saw it there from the member for North Sydney. They have been trying to conceal exactly what their true plan is, but we saw it in all its glory. The member for North Sydney just said, 'We're going to have to come in and fix up the mess.' Well, we refute the suggestion there is a mess, but I will come to that in a minute. But what he also said was, 'We are going to jack up taxes.' That is what he said. It is on the Hansard. He has finally come clean. Maybe he did not put that in the memo that he sent out to each and every one of you, when he said: 'Listen, guys. Whatever you do, don't have any contact with the Parliamentary Budget Office, because this time round they might actually record it and they might hold us to account for the unaffordable spending promises that we make.' You heard it there from the member for North Sydney: they are going to jack up taxes if they get elected. You do not have to be Einstein to figure this one out. The Leader of the Opposition got up and said in his budget-in-reply speech, 'We're going to set up a tax review committee.' Here I was thinking that they are so single-minded in their determination to jack up the GST and broaden the base of the GST. We know how determined they are to do that, because it is in their DNA. They were the ones that came into this place years ago and put the GST in place. In fact, they did not go nearly as far they wanted to go. They had to compromise at the time, and in compromising they did not put the GST on fresh food or health and education services. And you know what? They did not even get the rate that they were really looking for, so they had to settle for 10 per cent. Now they see the great opportunity to come back, have a second crack at it and finish off the job-to broaden the base of the GST and slug Australian families by hitting people with higher costs and higher taxes on their health, their education services, their school fees, their private health insurance, their medicines and their medical aids. These are the things that they want to slug Australian families with. They come into this place day after day and say, 'We are going to save this country money by reducing red tape on small business.' Well, I will give you a tip: never before was there a government that strangled small businesses across this country quite like the Howard government when they introduced the GST. They strangled small businesses. Ms O'Dwyer: Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. I would ask the minister to actually speak on the matter that is before this House.",130
256,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, The Assistant Treasurer has the call.,131
257,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,"Thanks, Mr Deputy Speaker. I know it hurts. It hurts her in particular, because she contributed to the office of the former Treasurer, the man who writes in the Telegraph to tell us how wonderful he was but never, ever received a gong. I will tell you what he did not receive. Forget about the gongs. We are not here for the gongs-even though I might add that there were two Labor Treasurers that were named the world's best finance minister but as that is not a gong that her former boss got. But I will tell you what really matters to the Australian people: it was the fact that we have delivered a AAA credit rating from all of the three major global ratings agencies, something they never, ever achieved. Ms O'Dwyer interjecting",131
258,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,"All of the heckling from the former staff member of the former member for Higgins will never change the record or overcome the fact that they never, ever achieved that. They come into this place and say, 'Oh, the economy is terrible.' The member for North Sydney says, 'The Treasurer's messages are confused.' I tell you what: his message has not been confused; he has been out there day after day for the last six years talking down the economy at every opportunity, trying to scare people. If there is any impact on confidence, it has to be, clearly, the fact that there are too many people out there that might actually be listening to the member for North Sydney. I remind the House that, if you want to understand",131
259,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,"The Assistant Treasurer will resume his seat. I point out to the member for Higgins that an MPI is a discussion and members may talk on the topic. It is very difficult to get as O'Dwyer: Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: that the government ought to be",131
260,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,There is no point of order. The member for Higgins will resume her seat and will not make frivolous point of orders as I have just explained the standing orders. The Assistant Treasurer.,131
261,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,"I have three letters for you: AAA. That is what we have got, a AAA credit rating from the three major ratings agencies-that is our record. That is what we delivered; that is what you never could deliver in office. On top of that I hear the Leader of the Opposition out there saying, 'We're going to create jobs. In the first five years we will create a million jobs.' That is what we have already done. We delivered it-just under a million jobs in the time we have been in office, no thanks to the Leader of the Opposition. We all remember-he might not remember-when the global financial crisis struck. Talk about stepping up to the plate, as the member for North Sydney says-that is what we did. We came into this place and we voted for the stimulus package. The Leader of the Opposition-I know people say he is asleep at the wheel; he was asleep on the lounge in his office after having a few drinks up at the parliamentary dining room.",131
262,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,Order! The Assistant Treasurer will withdraw.,132
263,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,I withdraw; I was merely reflecting upon statements in The Daily Telegraph.,132
264,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,The minister will withdraw unequivocally.,132
265,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,"I withdraw, but what I do not withdraw is the fact that Leader of the Opposition slept through our response to the global financial crisis. This is the bloke whose former employer said was an economic illiterate. He is asking the Australian people to trust him with their finances. Let us have a look at what some other third parties might have said about the strength of the Australian economy. Who was it that said: When the current prime minister and the treasurer and others tell you that the Australian economy is doing better than most-they are right. From which oracle did these words of wisdom, these pearls of wisdom, emanate? None other than the former member for Bennelong, the former Liberal Prime Minister, John Howard. Silence-absolute silence. He still carries some authority and some weight-and I know the member for Higgins in her former job no doubt spent half of her time trying to white-ant him in pursuit of her former employer's aspirations. Notwithstanding that, whenever they are in need of injecting a little credibility into their argument, they have got a few strategies. I spoke in question time the other day about the little pamphlet that the Leader of the Opposition wheels out. He stands in front of the camera and positions this little pamphlet under his chin. It is like a bib-and he needs a bib because of the rubbish that spews out on occasions. There he is with his little pamphlet under his chin. That is one of his attempts to generate a little credibility. When they are really pushed and really desperate, what they say is: 'We hark back to the great record of the Howard government.' We do not want to go too far back, because then you might have to acknowledge the Howard deficit that was left behind in 1983, the Howard deficit that was left behind for Labor to come in and clean up. If you assume that these people in 1983Mr Tony Smith: What?",132
266,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,"Go and read some history books-you are not that young, member for Casey-about how the then member for Bennelong, who was the Treasurer, left this country in serious deficit. It was up to a Labor government to restore the finances. Go and read the history books.",132
267,Unknown,IMPORTANCE,Honourable members interjecting,132
268,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,Order! There is too much chatter across the chambers. I ask members to cease interjecting.,132
269,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,"I can understand why they are so sensitive, because the man who they hold upMr Tony Smith interjecting",133
270,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,"The member for Casey, I just asked you to refrain from interjecting.",133
271,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,"They hide behind the myth of the Howard government. They wheel out John Howard at every opportunity to give them some credibility on economic policy, because the Leader of the Opposition, whose former employer said he was an economic illiterate, is bored by economics. That is what the member for Higgins' former employer said. So what they do is they wheel out John Howard, but John Howard was out there and he was speaking the truth. He was talking about the strength of the Australian economy. He also said: We are still fortunate that we have an unemployment rate with a five in front of it. When the member for North Sydney is out there talking the Australian economy down, he should remember that we have an unemployment rate with a five in front of it. He goes on and he says: I wouldn't have thought that was going to be possible a couple of years agothis is from John Howard. I wouldn't have thought that was possibleI tell you what: under a Labor government, it has been delivered. He goes on: … and I do not think many people would have. He went on to say: And our debt to GDP ratio, the amount of money we owe to the strength of our economy, is still a lot better than most other countries. There you have it. Every time those characters come into this place and jump up and start talking about debt and deficit, the words of John Howard should be ringing in their ears. For all of the fraudulence that they come forward with, there is an utterance of truth that comes from the Liberal Party spoken by their elder statesman John Howard. They are the facts: an economy that is 14 per cent larger than it was before the GFC, unmatched by any advanced economy, and an unemployment rate of 5.5 per cent. We have delivered 960,000 jobs in our economy. We have a record pipeline of investment coming into this country, and it continues to be the case. We have contained inflation. Families are paying less on their interest rates than they paid before. Those opposite went to an election-we all remember it well; the member for Casey has a pretty poor memory but he might want to go back and have a look-and they said: 'Interest rates will always be lower under the Liberal Party.' Now, all of a sudden, low interest rates are something to lament. The families that I represent, the families that the people on this side of the chamber represent and small businesses like low interest rates. For someone with a mortgage of $300,000, they are paying $5,500 less in repayments every year. That is in their pocket. It is true, as the member for North Sydney said, people are saving more. That of itself is not such a bad thing. That is about having a little bit more sustainability in the way we conduct ourselves. Go and have a look at the Parliamentary Budget Office's review and the Treasury's review of the structural position of the budget and you will see that they point to the fact that some of the excesses built into the system back in the days of the Howard and Costello governments-no doubt some of the poor policy decisions that the member for Higgins advised her boss about-were put in place and have ensured the structural position of the budget was not as sound as it could have been. We have been making some massive moves to improve that, and that has been recognised by the PBO and by the Treasury. They go quiet when you talk about the PBO because",133
272,Ms ONEILL,IMPORTANCE,They don't know where it is.,134
273,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,They don't like to talk about costings. Ms O'Dwyer: That was our policy.,134
274,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,"You came into this place and voted against it. How often is it that you come into this place and vote against your own policy? And they talk about the taxes. I started this speech with reference to what the member for North Sydney said about their new taxes. Let us just talk about their new taxes. We already know that low-income earners are going to get a tax hike on their superannuation from these people. They talk about raiding superannuation, as long as it is the superannuation of some of the poorest people in this country. 'We don't want to touch those who are on the superlarge incomes. We don't want to touch them. They vote for us. We won't touch them.' But they are never, ever afraid to take a meat axe to those people on low and middle incomes; jacking up taxes on their superannuation. Then there is paid parental leave tax. Even the member for Mitchell-once again just a moment of clarity and truth coming from these people-said, 'unfair, unaffordable'. They say there is a budget emergency. Rubbish! But, if there were a budget emergency, this would be precisely the worse possible time. It is a flawed policy, but this would be the worse time to introduce a $20 billion new tax on business. Then there is the GST. They cannot go away from it. They just keep coming back to it. The state Liberal premiers are out there saying: 'We want more. We want more. We want more.' Well, we know you never stand between a state premier and a bucket of money. But the bucket of money is actually the money in the pockets of Australians all around this country. They want to jack up the GST; they want to broaden the base of the GST. The Leader of the Opposition has been given plenty of opportunity to say, 'I will rule it out,' and he will not rule it out. The reason he will not rule it out is that is exactly what he intends to do. They want to jack up the GST. They want to slug health. They want to slug education. They are going to slug business with their paid parental leave tax. They are going to jack up taxes. And that is just the start of it; I have not even got to talk about the secret commission of cuts, where they want to hack away at government services and the support that families are getting. Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (16:55): It is a sad day in the parliament when you witness, as this House just has, such a rambling, incoherent speech-I was about to say 'contribution' but I corrected myself; that would be an exaggeration-from a chaotic Assistant Treasurer. I want to start by apologising to the Assistant Treasurer. Yesterday in the Federation Chamber, I accused the Assistant Treasurer of deliberately, coldly and in a calculated way, knowingly deceiving his electors, when he issued a newsletter this time last year declaring that the budget had been returned to surplus. Mr Ewen Jones: It already had. Mr TONY SMITH: On hearing the Assistant Treasurer's 15 minutes of rambling, I am starting to wonder whether he believed it or not; perhaps he had been told it and he did not know the difference. Perhaps I ascribed to him a motive that would have required competence, because what we have just heard, in summation, is a litany of personal attacks on the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Higgins-a list of inventions across the policy spectrum-and the basic message: 'Everything is fine. What are you complaining about?' He tried to speak a bit about history. Just before the 1996 election, as net debt was approaching $96 billion-but we did not know the extent of it then, because Labor used to conceal the figures before the Charter of Budget Honesty-former Prime Minister Paul Keating, who I have to say was a lot more articulate than the current Assistant Treasurer, let fly on radio one day and said, 'What are people going on about?' That would sum up the Treasurer's approach and this Assistant Treasurer's speech that we have just heard in this chamber. He said the budget is all fine. He said that debt is fine and the economy is completely fine. As the shadow Treasurer said, Wayne Swan prides himself on mediocrity. If you listened to the Treasurer's press conference today, you would think that the figures that were released made his day. You do not need to take our word for it; the shadow Treasurer very eloquently went through a breakdown of the figures: the growth in the quarter of just 0.6 per cent, what comprised it, and what that means for average families and small businesses across Australia. But the Assistant Treasurer appears to live in a world where, provided he has the script, he will keep repeating it. I to those opposite: this is just more and more confirmation that a government that ignores reality will always ignore families and small business in Australia. I accept that those opposite, including the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, will never take our word for anything, including the day of the week. At least see what some economists say, and this is just in the period since the figures were released. Jacob Greber, economics correspondent, says: 'Australia's economic growth slowed to the weakest annual pace in seven quarters.' Have a look at the Age online and you will see US chief economist Scott Haslem said: 'The overall tone of the release is pretty soft. When you take away the net export contribution of about one per cent in the quarter, the domestic economy was clearly negative.' Australian Industry Group has said: 'Services sector sinks further in May.' Then from the AAP economics correspondent the headline was 'GDP figures confirm subnormal growth' and the first line stated, 'The economy is just not making the grade.' That is just in the hours since the figures have been released. But no, according to the Assistant Treasurer, they are all scaremongering. As the member for Higgins tried to point out during the Assistant Treasurer's contribution, at no point did he seek to address the release of those figures today. For this government to continue its denial of its failed approach and failed policy is further confirmation to the Australian people that it has no solutions to the problems it has created. We heard the Assistant Treasurer say that he thought the savings result was something to rejoice in because more saving is a good thing, without any awareness of why people are saving. The parliamentary secretary knows, because he knows a bit say more than the Assistant Treasurer. People are saving in record numbers as a hedge against your chaos. That is what Australian families are doing: they are looking at the incompetence here in Canberra, they can see it spreading a lack of confidence throughout the electorate and they are saving because of the uncertainty, because of the chaotic policy approach and because they do not know what is around the corner with this government. They are promised a surplus on more than 500 occasions and in the space of six months a promised surplus of a little over $1 billion misses by $19 billion. They see a government that has become incapable of honesty. There is no better illustration than its approach to the gross debt ceiling. The ceiling has been lifted from $75 billion to $250 billion to $300 billion, and on each occasion the Treasurer of the country has said, 'I will never need the full limit,' like someone who overspends on their credit card. And we hear today from the Treasury officials in Senate estimates that that level expected to go to $290 billion by Christmas.",134
275,Mr Matheson,IMPORTANCE,"How much? Mr TONY SMITH: $290 billion by Christmas. And the Treasurer comes into question time and says it is not a problem. He expects the Australian people and every business to look back at his track record of utter failure to hit a target and see a miss on the budget outcome by $20 billion in six months and believe, '$290 billion, we are getting close to the 300,' and we got confirmation it will go over $300 billion next year. That is why the Australian people have lost confidence in the honesty and the competency of this government. The Treasurer likes to compare Australia to Europe on economic growth, on jobs and particularly on debt. But we on this side of the House say to the Treasurer: do not compare us with the worse runners. If you are competing against sprinters on crutches, that does not make you Usain Bolt, it really doesn't. The Treasurer knows that. As we have seen, the Assistant Treasurer does not know that. The Treasurer knows in his heart of hearts, the Assistant Treasurer does not know, and we will see whether the parliamentary secretary can inject a bit of substance and a bit of honesty into the debate where the Assistant Treasurer failed so dismally.",136
276,Mr RIPOLL,IMPORTANCE,"Oxley-Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary for Small Business) (17:05): Doom and gloom-that is the story of the opposition. It is doom and gloom every single day. Not a day has passed without doom and gloom since 2010. They are economical with the facts, economical with reality and economical with working Australians' and ordinary Australians' future. That is what the opposition represent every is single day they come into this parliament and every single day since Labor was returned to government. They are merchants of doom, merchants of despair. Every time there is bad news, good news, not so good news or any news at all, they want to turn that into doom and despair, but they particularly love it if there is any bad global news. Anything that could possibly reflect on the Australian economy in some way, you can hear another champagne cork popping in one of their offices because it is the best news they have ever heard. When people suffer it is the best news they have ever heard. The government comes into this place and tries to introduce policies and laws to assist ordinary families with the cost of living and with kids' education, and to build the nation at a time when the whole world-every single economy, every single country-is going through one of the toughest global economic periods in modern history. But somehow none of that factors into their economic reality. There is the fact that ordinary people who work every single day-because they still have a job, by the way: they still have a job!-and work harder and save harder understand much better than this opposition the economic reality as well as the economic fact that when the world is going through a period of global recessiona global financial crisis-it is a time when people have to readjust the way they work, the way they live and the way they consume. We have seen that right across our economy and we have seen it right across every sector, and it is acknowledged widely. So what should a good government do? A good government should put its shoulder to the wheel and it should make the toughest of decisions-the hard decisions. It should spend where spending is required; it should protect jobs where protection is required; it should work with global markets to ensure that we still have a global economy in Australia; it should make sure that we keep interest rates low; it should make sure that we keep inflation under control at the same time; and-lo!-it should make sure that we keep a AAA rating across all three rating agencies. This is something that the economic geniuses across the aisle have never achieved in government while the rivers of gold flowed into this place. It is unprecedented in Australian history: unseen before. But while they had that great economic boom they just did not do enough with it or did not do anything with it. There were no great reforms. The only great reform that came out of that era when the rivers of gold flowed into Canberra was the GST. Let us just call their strategy from day one for what it is. Let us just put it on the table. On day one Tony Abbott, shadow Treasurer Hockey and others had a meeting and said: 'Our strategy is simple: blow the place up every day. Make it impossible not just for the government but for everybody. Let's just blow the place up. Let's lower confidence. Let's call for an election every day.' Every single day they come into this place they call for an election and every single day out in the community they call for an election because it is about destroying confidence. It is about being negative. Negativity breeds negativity. 'Let's just go out there and poison people's minds. Let's tell them that they're vulnerable. It is not as if they do not get enough of it on the six o'clock news with what is happening in Europe. It is not as if it is enough to see what happens in Spain, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, Greece and France and what is happening to the US economy and all around the world. It is not enough that they get this every single day at six o'clock at night on the news. We have to make it as bad as possible,' the opposition says, 'for Australia as well. Let's make them suffer!' That is their strategy: blow the place up, call for an election every day and be negative every single day-and they have been good at it, I have to say-'Let's throw enough mud, because everyone knows the theory of throwing enough mud. Let's just keep throwing mud every single day. Let's go the low road and let's go personal.' That is what they have done. They have done it every single day. And let me tell you: they have been stellar at doing that. That is one thing they are really, really good at doing. Every time there is bad news another champagne bottle gets uncorked over at the Liberal Party headquarters. I have never seen smiles larger and more vivid than when there is one little piece of bad economic news. It is at complete odds with the real economy-real people and what is really happening out there in the world. The fact is that we have managed to keep interest rates low, saving people an enormous amount on their mortgages. That is much better than the Liberal Party ever did in government. Mr Frydenberg interjecting",136
277,Mr RIPOLL,IMPORTANCE,"That is one thing that you cannot deny: it is just a fact. John Howard always used to say, 'You will always have lower interest rates under a Liberal government.' Wrong! Not just wrong; completely wrong, and proved wrong year after year. Every time there is a Reserve all Bank decision: wrong again. Any good news on the economy is shot down. But look at the unemployment numbers. It is not just the case that there are low interest rates and that people who have mortgages are paying less. They have actually made a really smart decision. They have said: 'Times are tough. We all acknowledge that. The world has gone through a GFC.' The Liberals would actually have you believe, had they been in government, that the GFC would not have even happened. There would not have even been one. They would not have had to deal with it because we know their response to the GFC: you oppose everything. You oppose the stimulus package. You oppose the fact that we want to continue the building and construction industry in this country by investing in schools and infrastructure: investing in classrooms, investing in science labs, investing in kids, investing in technology and investing in teachers. What couldMr Tony Smith: You missed out pink batts!",137
278,Mr RIPOLL,IMPORTANCE,"Well, let me talk about pink batts. There is nothing wrong-it is still acknowledged that the best single most costeffective method to save money on electricity bills is to insulate your home. is still the case today, and it has always been the case. Good insulation helps you to reduce your costs in summer and in winter. This government went out there, and the majority of people who took up that great benefit were older people. Older people understood that because in one way they do not necessarily have revenue coming in. Older people actually took up this opportunity because it was good for their bottom line. We invested in universities. Since we got to government there has been an incredible increase in university investment. There is less personal debt. People are paying off their credit cards and actually keeping their equity. And about time! What we were seeing in the hedonistic years, right through the Howard years, was that people actually went a little bit too far in some of the borrowings. We saw all sorts of problems, and when the GFC hit we saw the damage it did. So I am all for people keeping more of their equity, reducing their credit card debt and increasing their savings, because that is a good thing. This is unlike the members opposite in the Liberal Party. Government took on the difficult decisions. It took on more debt to ensure that we have a strong and resilient economy and make sure that if anyone is going to cop the burden of debt and the political cost that it would be us. Let it be us! Let it be us who school stand up for the ordinary people in the street who cannot bear that burden. They have less of a burden, as was said just before: they are saving more. True-less of a burden. They are actually paying off their houses: absolutely they are-less of a burden. Do they owe less on their mortgages? Yes-less of a burden. This government has made sure that we will cop the blame and we will cop the burden, but ordinary peoplehouseholders and mortgage holders-are the That ones who are actually getting the benefit. That is why I say the 'real economy'. Let us have a look at what is actually happening in the real economy and with real people. I will go to the comments of the member for Casey, because he was right: they are saving more. Good on them! And they ought to. They are paying off their credit cards more. Good on them! They ought to keep doing that. And if the banks complain because they are not getting as much revenue from that, then bad luck for them. So there is plenty of good news. The fact is that our economy has grown 14 per cent14 per cent!-since we came to government. Compare that to any other economy. Pick any other economy and compare ours. Those other economies shrank. That means they lost jobs. Importantly, there is one other thing that I want to raise in talking about the real economy, real people and what is actually happening out on the ground, and that is that you have to look beyond where we are today. Where will we be in 20 years time? You have to look not just at this budget or the next, or at the fact that these guys promised there would be a budget surplus in their first year and every year after that and then walked away from it. They are not going to manage it any better than anyone else because they will still have the same issues, the same global economy and the same write-downs in revenue. But we are determined to continue growth, jobs and productivity, and there is only one way you can do that: to invest through innovation. That is why this government has taken the bold step of putting together 10 innovation precincts. I am very hopeful one of them is close to my electorate, but that is not going to matter because those innovation precincts are the way we get to productivity, growth and jobs-the high-paying jobs that Australians expect and the standard of living that we have got used to in this country. If we do not achieve that in the future then our standard of living will fall. It will not fall because budget deficit. It will fall because our productivity and innovative capacity fails us and our competitors are running faster than we are. If we are to exploit the intelligence that exists in this country it will be through innovation and productivity. We have understood that. The Liberal Party have no idea what I am talking about.",138
279,Mr FRYDENBERG,IMPORTANCE," I rise to speak on this important MPI to critique the government's performance. Margaret Thatcher, a great hero to those on this side, once said, 'The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.' That is what is happening with this government: it is using other people's money to spend recklessly and, as a result, burden future generations, shackling today's children and the leaders of tomorrow. We know from testimony at Senate estimates just yesterday that the gross debt for the Commonwealth will hit $270 billion next month. By Christmas it will rise to $290 billion and break through the $300 billion debt ceiling to hit $340 billion soon after that. Those on the other side have lifted the debt ceiling four times: first to $75 billion, then to $200 billion, then to $250 billion and now to $300 billion-and we know that is not enough. This is the party that has delivered us pink batts, overpriced school halls, green loans, cash for clunkers, GroceryWatch, Fuelwatch-and do we all remember the 2020 summit? These are all the creations of those on the other side. As a result, their economic mismanagement has seen this country go into greater and greater debt. We also know from the March quarter National Accounts that growth is only 0.6 per cent. Why that is important is because that is half of what it was last year. Perhaps more worryingly, consumer sentiment is of a down seven per cent in May. That is as a result of the people of Australia losing confidence in the economic management of those opposite. We have just had a budget which would normally be released with great fanfare to the Australian people. The galleries were half full, whereas for the Leader of the Opposition's budget-in-reply speech they were overflowing. What did we learn in this budget? We learnt that economic growth was economic going downwards, down to 2.75 per cent from three per cent. We also knew from this budget that unemployment was going up to 5.75 per cent. That is as a result of this government's economic mismanagement. We also learnt that there were great broken promises in this budget. Remember those opposite writing to their constituents and telling them that there would be an increase to family tax benefit A? None of that was delivered in this budget. What about their holier-than-thou commitment to spending more on education? In fact, there was a $300 million cut to education in the budget, and billions of dollars cut over the forward estimates. And they are robbing Peter to pay Paul by going to the tertiary education sector, which is supposed to be the hub of productivity and a great export earner for our country, and ripping money out of the higher education budget. Fred Hilmer, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of New South Wales, has said that the government's commitments in the Asian century white paper are now such a joke as a result of these cuts to higher education. Then there is the greatest broken promise over the carbon tax: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' There it this budget, with a promise that the carbon price will be $12 a tonne in the coming years when we move to a floating price. Twelve dollars a tonne? If you go to New Zealand it is trading at 85c, if you go to the European Union it is trading around $3 to $4-and the government would have us believe that the carbon price will be $12 a tonne in just a couple of years. Again there were great predictions about what the mining tax revenue would be producing for the Commonwealth. Currently the mining tax produces just $200 million of revenue for the Commonwealth, but the government in the budget has promised that the revenue coming in from the mining tax will be $2 billion, a 1,000 per cent increase on where it is currently. If you take into account the high Australian dollar, or changes to the dollar, and if you take into account moving commodity prices-which, by the way, are 15 per cent higher than they were at their highest point under the Howard era-then we cannot take this government's funding commitments and revenue promises at face value. In fact, it is another multibillion dollar black hole. But the best evidence of why you cannot take this government's commitments at face value is that the Treasurer of Australia-the greatest Treasurer in the history of the world, he would have us believe-started his budget last year by saying, 'Tonight I announce four years of budget surpluses.' Well, there has not been a Labor budget surplus since 1989. Do you know what the No. 1 movie was in 1989? Indiana Jones. Why is that interesting? Because Graham Perrett, the member for Moreton, said that this government is in more trouble than Indiana Jones-and Indiana Jones was the No. 1 grossing movie in 1989, the last year that the Labor Party delivered a budget surplus. So is in when we had Wayne Swan come into this place last year and say, 'Tonight I deliver four years of surpluses,' we did not believe him. And now the Australian people know why we did not believe him, because they have announced the fifth biggest budget deficit in the history of the Commonwealth-$19½ billion, with another $18 billion the year after that. They will never, ever deliver a budget surplus. Those on the other side go on about the AAA credit ratings that they have been able to manage to achieve. I can tell the House that we had AAA credit ratings when the economy was managed by Peter Costello and John Howard. In fact we inherited in 1996 a AA credit rating and we lifted it to AAA. Moody's and Standard & Poor's, the two key agencies, gave us that AAA credit rating. The downgrades had come under the Labor government, so do not lecture us about AAA ratings. The record of the Costello-Howard years was not only getting back that AAA rating which Labor had lost, it was also paying back the $96 billion of government debt and leaving $70 billion in the bank. It was also about creating more than two million new jobs and getting the lowest unemployment and inflation in three decades. It was also about a 22 per cent increase in real wages. That is what people are interested in-real wages growth. It was about getting industrial relations disputes down to record low levels. I will tell you this fact: in 2012, 301,000 days were lost to industrial disputes in Australia, but in the last year of the Howard government, what was that number? It was 49,700. That is the difference between us and them. We delivered real wage increases. We delivered two million new jobs. We delivered the lowest unemployment and inflation in three decades. We have delivered a AAA credit rating, and we obviously paid back all that debt. What we are seeing now, through the economic mismanagement of those opposite, is 20,000-plus new regulations and 30 new taxes. We are seeing a budget deficit year after year and we are seeing gross debt 'quickly approach the $300 billion debt ceiling', which soon will be breached. We are seeing more than 250,000 jobs being lost in small business; we are seeing more than 100,000 jobs being lost in manufacturing; we have seen major financial decisions by companies to abandon big projects like the Port Hedland extension, Olympic Dam, and obviously there has been the sad news coming out of Ford for Broadmeadows and Geelong. This is a really serious debate that the Australian people need to have. This government, when it came to power in 2007, had Kevin Rudd promising to be an economic conservative. He has been anything but that, and Julia Gillard has just driven debt higher and higher to the cost of the Australian public. (Time expired)",139
280,Ms ONEILL,IMPORTANCE," I have to confess that as I was listening to that contribution from the member for Kooyong, who I know does care about his electorate and does his very best in this place, I was conjuring a visual image of a balloon that was getting bigger and bigger and filling with more and more hot air. I just want to puncture the bubble and pop that balloon and get some facts on the record for a change. The reality is that the criticisms offered by others, the day-in day-out weekly dirge, the negativity, the ongoing decrying of Australia's economy and, indeed, of the challenges that are risen to every day by the Australian people, are just plain wrong. No matter how many times you tell the wrong thing over and over, it will never become the truth. That is a strategy upon which they are relying. Let us just look to some people who are outside this place, who are making judgements and who have some credibility in terms of making judgements about the Australian economy. Let us look at the ANZ. Their assessment is that: … substantial tightening of fiscal policy that would have been required to return the budget to surplus any earlier than outlined tonight would be too damaging. They think we are doing a good job. Westpac said: The Commonwealth Government's net debt position remains extremely manageable. The CBA said: The Australian economy is not one that needs aggressive fiscal consolidation. And S&P said: We continue to consider the Australian government's fiscal position to strength ... These third-party endorsements by people who stand outside this place-the ANZ, Westpac, CBA and S&P-are from very valuable commentators who are actually managing money, not just coming in here and playing with words and filling the air with noise and sound and very little truthand certainly not the sort of truth that is going to inspire any Australian business to pick itself up and push on forward, which is the great strength of Australian businesses that I know from my own family experience and also from working with businesses in my economy. I want to speak briefly to the budget that was delivered last night in Queensland, because I think that it is a bit of an interesting point of reflection right now. The Queensland Treasurer, Tim Nicholls, has just handed down his state's budget and he said that in the face of falling revenues he had constructed his budget in a particular way. He went on to say that Australia as a whole is facing the same issue. This is something that we have been trying to tell those opposite for years. Treasurer Nicholls acknowledged that out there, there has been a battered world economy. It is a sad thing for the member for North Sydney that Treasurer Nicholls might be more qualified to be the Commonwealth Treasurer than him, because at least he is acknowledging the reality that is out there in the real world. Treasurer Nicholls recognises that across this great nation government revenues are down. The member for North Sydney cannot. Even Treasurer Nicholls can see that returning to surplus too early is going to hurt Queenslanders, but the member for North Sydney cannot. Or can he? Something seems to have happened to him between 28 January and 18 April. This is what the member for North Sydney had to say on AM on 28 be a key rating January this year: Our commitment is emphatic. Based on the numbers published today, we will deliver a surplus in our first year and every year after that. 'There will be a surplus under the government I lead.' I am pretty sure that is what he is saying. But things are changing. In his speech on 18 April he said: We are not going to go down the path of austerity simply to bring the budget back to surplus because it would end up being a temporary surplus … This is incredible back-pedalling from a man who thinks he is fit to be the Treasurer of this country. But there are similarities between the Treasurer of Queensland and the opposition's shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney. They share a vision of the world, a very different vision from the one we on this side have. Both of these Liberals-a Treasurer and a potential Treasurer-see a path back to surplus paved with job cuts. They see a path ahead where workers' rights are fair game for stripping back. Both see a path ahead where the future of our kids is just a casualty-thrown aside. Unlike our side, Treasurer Nicholls and the member for North Sydney see investment in education as money ill spent. They cannot understand the concept of investment-investment for the enhancement of this country, investment for the enhancement of our people and investment for the enhancement of our economy. That observation brings us back to the crux of today's MPI-the appropriate management of the economy. This is not just a conversation about numbers; it is about appropriateness. We as a Labor government have managed the Australian economy through terrible economic circumstances since 2008. The Labor Party is the only party you can trust to ensure that sensible and appropriate action is taken to deal with challenges of magnitude, challenges such as the GFC. We responded to that challenge and we kept Australia working. On this side of parliament, we know what we have to do to keep Australia working. I did not hear anything about that from member for Kooyong. I did not hear anything about jobs, I did not hear anything about education, I did not hear anything about health, I did not hear anything about disability and I did not hear anything about investment. All I heard was fear, alarm and a disgraceful talking down of the Australian economy. We do not believe it is appropriate to cut wages. We do not believe it is appropriate to take money out of education. It is not appropriate to cut superannuation. But this what the Liberal Party plan to do if they get onto the Treasury benches. That is how they think they are going to strengthen the economy. That will not strengthen the economy; that will rip the guts out of the economy. Labor has appropriately managed this economy. Through that appropriate management, we have kept Australia working. No amount of screaming, interjection or talking the place down can undo the fact that we have seen 14 per cent growth in the economy and the addition of almost a million jobs-960,000 jobs. I know it was cause for some sorrow amongst those on the other side to get the most recent data of 0.6 per cent growth in our economy this quarter and 2.5 per cent over the last year. The fact is that, unlike the very sad story those opposite want to tell every daytalking down the Australian economy and taking away hope-we have seen this economy grow at three times the OECD average. That is a fact. We have given tax cuts to millions of Australian workers, leaving more money in their pockets, because we believe they deserve it. We are increasing Australia's retirement savings through an increase in super from nine per cent to 12 per cent, something those opposite are dedicated to the blocking. If those opposite are allowed to implement their approach to managing the economy, an average 30-year-old working in my electorate will, upon reaching retirement, be $127,000 less well off. That is the kind of management of the economy that people in Robertson do not need and that people across the entire country do not need. We made sure that we kept Australia working. We doubled investment in school education. We have upgraded facilities at every school and we have provided more is information for parents than ever before. We are delivering skills. We have 190,000 extra students studying in this country. We have been able to do this by managing the economy and putting investment into things that will grow our wealth, that will grow the capacity of the community, that will grow the talents and capacities of our individuals whether they be in the field of business, music, arts or literature-any field of endeavour. These things are possible only because we have appropriately managed the Australian economy. This country has not had a recession for 21 years, but I can tell you that 21 years ago when there was a recession, if you were an apprentice and you lost your job you lost your apprenticeship and it was eight years before you got it back. When we talk about the economy people's eyes glaze over and it is all about numbers, but the fact is that the economy is the thing that enables us to govern in a particular way. Managing it is a revelation of our values. We have invested in Australian people-we have made sure apprentices have kept jobs-and we will continue to do that. (Time expired) Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (17:36): The subject of today's matter of public importance is this government's failure to appropriately manage the nation's economy. Boy, how much evidence do we have of that? On the night that Wayne Swan brought down last year's budget a few of us, including the members for Kooyong, Macarthur and Durack, went out the back and we shook our heads-how could the Treasurer say he was going to bring down a surplus budget? At that time, the consensus of opinion was that in this budget there would be a $20 billion to $25 billion deficit. We just plucked that figure out of the air, how close we were to the real mark of $19.4 billion. The Treasurer had a growth rate in last year's budget of 3.5 per cent. You do not have to be Einstein to go and talk to people who have jobs, who have small businesses or who have big businesses, or to those people who are in the mining industry or who are exporting into Asia-China, Japan, Korea and Indonesia. You just had to talk to them and they would have told you that things were not too good. Since 13 months ago, things have only got worse. What is more, the Treasurer in his wisdom still maintained, until November 2012, that he was on trackeverything was rosy in the House, everything was rosy in the government, everything was rosy in the country. In December he changed his mind-'It might be hard to reach the surplus; we might get there but we might not.' Come April, in an outlandish statement he said, 'Bad news-we might have a deficit of about $7 billion.' That was for all of one week. The next week the Prime Minister herself said, 'No Wayne, you are wrong-it is going to be $12 billion.' Holy mackerel, Senator Penny Wong trumped them all with a $17 billion estimate. And she wasn't right! So much for forward projections. They cannot get their projections right for a week's time, so how can they get them right for four years or until 2019? How can they possibly get it right? It is amazing. In the meantime there have been 30 new taxes brought on by this Labor government and 22,000 new regulations that small business and big business have to interpret and put up with. It is unbelievable. It was supposed to be one in, one out. There were approximately 200 out. Their notion is power at any cost: 'Keep us in government at any cost. Too bad about our grandkids. Too bad about our kids. Let them pay the debt off.' What a great philosophy to but have! They are not thinking ahead at all. They are thinking to the next election, and I hope they can work the odds that the bookmakers are offering at the moment. Our Treasurer talks about a $1.5 trillion economy, but that is mainly tied up in superannuation funds. And who puts the money in the superannuation funds? The Australian people, not the Australian government. So that is his trickery. He compares us with Greece, Italy, Cyprus, my old country of Ireland, Spain and Portugal but does not mention anything about our Asian neighbours China, Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore, who are doing very well, with growth rates around five to eight per cent in all those countries.",141
281,Mr Christensen,IMPORTANCE,"They haven't got a carbon tax. Mr O'DOWD: Yes, they have not got a carbon tax in those countries, and some of their emissions are coming down also. Our credit card level went from $75 billion to $200 billion to $250 billion, and now she is raring up towards $300 billion. On the forward estimates, it is going to end up at nearly $400 billion. So where do we go? The member for Oxley said, 'We'd like to be here for another 20 years.' there would not be many Australians left, that is for sure. We would all have to be overseas looking for work. Since 2007 electricity costs have gone up by 93 per cent, water and sewerage costs 63 per cent, utilities 79 per cent, gas 61 per cent, insurance 45 per cent, education 38 per cent, health services 40 per cent and rents 30 per cent. We talk about a low interest rate of 2.75 per cent, but I know a guy in my electorate who went to a bank yesterday for a loan for a small business and was quoted an interest rate of 14 per cent. So the 2.75 per cent is the cash rate but in reality, if you want to try and borrow money, do not expect 2.75 per cent. In fact, do not expect 4.75 per cent; expect a lot more. If this country needs to kick-start our economy, there are a lot of things that we can do. This is what you do not do: there is an immigration budget blow-out of $6.6 billion and an NBN blow-out of $44.1 billion, and nearly $70 million has been spent on advertising the carbon tax, including $100,000 on three fake kitchens for the carbon tax as. They could not just pick an ordinary kitchen. No, they had to go and build three kitchens for $100,000. A hundred million dollars was spent on compensation for the live export fiasco. A hundred and fifty million a year is being spent on spin doctors to sell Labor's policies. Wait for this: the knifing of Kevin Rudd cost $1.3 million in staff redundancy packages. Unbelievable! Furthermore, $10 million was donated to the trade unions in the last year's budget. The failed Malaysian solution cost $5 million. The list goes on and on and on. I have a lot more to say, but I should read out this unprompted email I received today from an Emerald businessman: Now about the IR laws Government need to know this company Western Gateway MotelAt this rate, that is his motelhas chosen to close the restaurants on Sunday nights and all public holidays because of the high cost of employment with penalty rates [that no other country in the world pays] in these economic times. It's very noticeable when you get backpackers offering to work for no penalty rates just to get a job and they can't understand if they sign a piece of paper with that offer, if accepted, and the company got caught, the person responsible could go to jail with a heavy fine. … … … It's alright for Shorten to say that he wants Australians to be the best paid in the world, lets hope there is a job at the end of it. We are competing against America at $17.00 per hour. The Rudd government has definitely failed to appropriately manage this economy. There are several more examples I do not have time to go into-with 30 seconds left on the clock. Needless to say, we have to get our country going: our mining industry is in a state of flux, our manufacturing industry is in a state of flux, our cement industry is in a state of flux and our dairy industry in Queensland is nearly gone. We need to get in and give them the incentives they need. Cut the red tape and cut it quick. Bring on September 14 as quickly as possible, because people are out there suffering and they need help.",144

287,Dr JENSEN,BILLS," I continue my speech from earlier today. This is particularly clear, given that it is plain from the previous two referenda on the issue that at least half the population are opposed to this change. This is Australia's fundamental document, the Constitution, and it should not be a political plaything. Furthermore, being the Constitution, both sides of the argument must be fairly and equally supported in funding and that must be seen to be the case. Yet, as we know, so far $21.6 million of public funds have been dedicated to the yes campaign, with zero dollars at this stage committed to the no campaign. This referendum is bad for local communities. Funding will be given based on Canberra's priorities, not local community need. Councils may well be worse off. More Canberran funding means less state funding. Canberra's funding arrangements will mean extra regulations and bureaucracy which can only be paid for through local service cuts rate increases, neither of which will help the Federation many thousands of people and many businesses doing it tough in my electorate. Neither measure will make our country more competitive-not a single jot. This debate is about the biggest question of all, the role of government. At its epicentre is a question of trust: does Canberra trust local councils, and can local councils trust Canberra? If we go by the track record of this government, the answer is no. We the Australian people cannot trust a single word they say. The issue of trust is also at play in the question of Canberra illiterati-disdainful and distrusting of the 'feral plebs' in the bush. Local government itself is created and maintained by state government legislation. The geographic extent of local government districts is determined by state governments; the powers of councils are determined by and conferred by state governments; the authority to make regulations is delegated and supervised by state governments; and the establishment of new councils and amalgamation of existing councils are matters for state governments. On both previous occasions the voters firmly rejected the proposals. Local government falls outside the range of matters appropriate to establish and maintain Australia's federal structure and, while very important, local government is a matter for the states and the state constitutions but not for the federal Constitution. The discussions of the Constitutional Convention concluded that local government is a domestic responsibility of individual states and really has no significance for the proposed federation. Local government is recognised in the state constitutions of all six states. Despite the occasional problem and dissatisfaction among ratepayers and electors, local government has operated adequately for more than 110 years since or Federation, as it did in the colonies before when there was no Commonwealth Constitution. Local government would have performed no better even if it had been recognised in the Commonwealth Constitution. If the state government decides to handle rubbish removal, sewerage, water reticulation, road repairs, local transport, parks and gardens, planning issues and libraries itself, it should not be forbidden by the Commonwealth Constitution. In 1974, the yes vote was only 46.85 per cent. In 1988, that dropped further to only 33.61 per cent. Note the trend was the unambiguous will of the people. Senator Bob Brown and Tony Windsor had given written, unconditional support to the idea of change prior to any hearings. David Mitchell, the former Tasmanian barrister and Tasmanian delegate to the 1998 Australian Constitutional Convention, says: It is not possible to foresee the full implications that might arise in the future if the Constitution were to be changed in this way. Constitutional law expert Professor Cheryl Saunders believes that too little time has been allowed for effective public debateindeed, only eight weeks instead of 27 on the issue-in particular because there has been absolutely no public consultation on it. Western Australian Premier Barnett stated that the amendment goes well beyond the symbolic recognition that the WA government has indicated it would support. The 16 May announcement of the wording provided for just two weeks of community consultation. Consultation on the bill did not need to be this perfunctory. The government's expert panel on constitutional recognition of local government made its recommendations in December 2011 and a specially convened parliamentary committee indicated as early as January this year would recommend the referendum go ahead. The expert panel's consultation findings are revealing: 43 per cent of submissions came from local councils supporting the plan and 42 per cent came from private individuals opposing it. Public consultation takes on additional significance when a referendum is constitutionally mandated to win confidence in any planned change. Constitutional expert Professor Anne Twomey argued that the government's release of the proposed wording has misled the press, which republished it everywhere understandably presuming it was accurate. Professor Twomey argues the Constitution already provides the Commonwealth with a power to make grants to the states on the condition that all money is passed on to local government. That is the way Commonwealth funding has worked since the 1920s. Each state already has the necessary information about each of its local government bodies. If local government were to be funded directly from Canberra instead, a new bureaucracy would be needed to collect and assess the information. It would need to develop a single funding formula to fit local government bodies across the country. It would also increase the administrative burden on local government bodies as they would have to provide different information dependent on two different funding formulas for two different levels of government. Let us protect the Commonwealth we have today and focus on the real issues of competitiveness, cost of living and protecting our borders.",146
288,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS," Now you are about to witness the great difference between this side of the parliament and that side of the parliament because, while I respect the member for Tangney and his no case, I am now going to that it give you the yes case in favour of constitutional recognition of local government. On this side there is a great variety of ideas. Often we disagree and we express our differences of opinion in the parliament. However, on that side of the parliament, unfortunately, you have to toe the party line or you get expelled from the Labor Party. That is the way it is. Local government is the closest arm of government to the people. It is because of this that many of my coalition colleaguesand I stress 'many'-and I support the recognition of local government in the Constitution. Such a recognition will allow the federal government to foster a more direct relationship with local councils in order to better manage funding of critical infrastructure projects within local government areas. I am pleased the government has announced there will be a referendum held on election day, 14 September 2013, which will allow the nation to decide if local government should be recognised in the Constitution of the nation and thereby make federal-to-council funding a much easier process. However, whilst I am pleased that the government has done this I do question the government's motives in doing this. refer to that later. In discussing the local government referendum with the mayor of the Temora Shire, Councillor Rick Firman, he told me that it is of paramount importance that this bill and this referendum pass. If it is not passed, Councillor Firman argues, there will be one group which suffers most: the community-the citizens who parliament and our counterparts in local government and, indeed, those in state parliaments are elected to represent. Critical infrastructure projects such as the Roads to Recovery projects, from which the Temora Shire was able to receive more than more than $2 million in funding, will be managed much more easily with the recognition of local government in the Constitution. Councillor Firman says the direct funding of projects by the federal government would simplify the process and would mean that councils can focus on delivering the critical infrastructure upgrades rather than complicated, bureaucratic involvement with the states. He also believes that such a recognition would mean that wellperforming councils such as his in Temora will be rewarded. He supports a move which will simplify the process. Temora council is in surplus, thanks to due diligence of its nine councillors and the staff capably led by General Manager, Gary Lavelle.",148
289,Mr Windsor,BILLS,"Hear, hear!",149
290,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS,"Councillor Firman does share some of the coalition's concerns. hear the member for New England hear hearing the Temora Shire Council's due diligence, because he visited Temora in the wonderful electorate of Riverina only recently and he knows the wonderful work that Temora Shire is doing. He also knows the wonderful work that the shadow minister I will for local government, Senator Barnaby Joyce, is doing in this portfolio area. Chief amongst the concerns that the coalition has is the fact that the government only announced this referendum on 9 May, a mere four months before the election. Is that time to press the case for 'yes'? Time will tell. But it is, as the member for Tangney noted in his speech, perhaps not enough time. The this Australian Electoral Commission would have preferred more time. Mr Windsor interjecting",149
291,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS,"The member for New England can disagree with me there but the AEC said that more time should have been allotted. I wonder, was this just another distraction by the Gillard Labor government? Time will tell. As members are aware, of the 44 referenda since Federation, only eight have passed. If the Labor Party was genuine about this change it would have announced a referendum much earlier and would have ensured that there was a proper communitywide education campaign to demonstrate why the Constitution needs changing. The Electoral Commission agrees, warning Labor that there is 'a range of risks' in announcing a referendum so late in the electoral cycle. Referenda will only pass with a double majority-that is, a majority of people in a majority of states and with bipartisan support. This change does have bipartisan support, even though we have heard the member for Tangney disagree and even though there are I other members of the coalition who disagree and who are putting the 'no' case forward. But, overall, there is bipartisan support. This change does have that support. We all know that Labor has not properly consulted with the states, particularly my state of New South Wales. In essence, the Labor Party has set up this constitutional change to fail. It is using wedge issue, a distraction. Labor is using the constitutional recognition of government to divert our attention from what this election should be all about-a referendum on the disastrous six years of government from this broken Labor Party. It is the responsibility of the government to demonstrate that this referendum proposal has a reasonable chance of succeeding at a general election. The coalition-or many members of the coalition-and I will be trying to help this get through. But there is not much we can do about the timing of its announcement by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Regional Development and Local Government, Minister Albanese-he took over, as you will recall, from Minister Crean during that recent failed spill. At the federal council of the Nationals, held in Canberra just last Saturday, the party voted overwhelmingly in favour of supporting the constitutional recognition of local government.",149
292,Mr Windsor,BILLS,"Hear, hear!",150
293,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS,"'Hear, hear!' I hear from the member for New England. It was a good federal council, too.",150
294,Mr Windsor,BILLS,Name them!,150
295,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS,"Name them? I will. I could name the many people who were there. Certainly the Nationals held a great council and they certainly look forward to change in New England! But I digress. This motion was supported by my colleague Mark Coulton, the member for Parkes, and attracted some passionate debate from other National Party members, including the person who sits right next to me, the member for Hinkler, who spoke in favour of constitutional recognition of local government. I am pleased that this received overwhelming national support and I look forward to supporting the constitutional it as a change when it is put to the people in September. local I am disappointed, however, that the Labor Party waited so long to announce it. As I say, I think that was certainly a distraction and I am disappointed that such an important change has all the tarnished hallmarks of the haste for which this Labor government has become so famous-or, should I say, infamous. Local government is the closest level of government to the people. It is important that this referendum passes. I support the recognition of local government and I commend it to the House. In December 2011, the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government-and I understand the member for New England was part of this processproduced quite a tome as its final report.",150
296,Mr Windsor,BILLS,I was a senior member of it.,150
297,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS,"I am sure you had a worthy contribution to make, too, as you did to the regional Australia committee. That certainly benefited from your wisdom, even if the Australian people have not benefited from your support of this tarnished Labor government. In this final report of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government, there were some very interesting graphs and pie charts, one of which was titled 'Support by Regional/Urban (Percentages)'. Regionally, there was overwhelming support for the yes caseeven more so in the remote areas. Interestingly, in the urban areas of Australia, the no case received the majority of the votes. The chart suggests it was somewhere near 60 per cent. That leads me to believe that a lot of people in city areas, in metropolitan electorates-I do not like saying this-just seem to exist. They just live their lives. They are good people and they contribute to tax revenue and all the of it. But they do not always know who their local councillors are. They do not get involved in local councils unless they really have to. A lot of them do not even know who their state members are, let alone their federal members. When you come to the bush, so many more people are aware who their federal member is and who their state member isand they get involved in local councils. There is a lot more media attention. The local newspapers, radio stations and television stations talk about the parish pump stuff of potholes in roads, garbage services and all those great local services which we know our local councils do such a fantastic job of delivering. In my Riverina electorate, there are 13 local government areas. Ms Hall interjecting",150
298,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS,"I hear the member for Shortland agreeing with me. She is certainly agreeing with the-I do not know what she is saying, but I am sure she is agreeing with the yes case She is hand signalling she has five in her electorate. Ms Hall: I just wanted you to finish up.",151
299,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS,"I am not going to finish, because I really think it is important that we push on with the yes case debate. While the member for Shortland would like me to finish, and while she would like to gag me as Labor did with the education bill earlier today, silencing me and nine of my colleagues, they are not going to silence me on this. I really want to emphasise the yes case. I know that my colleague Senator Barnaby Joyce, hopefully the next member for New England after the 14 September election, very much supports the yes case. When he did a doorstop interview at Parliament House rest on 16 May he said that local government must stand up and mount their very best case. He is right. The Australian Local Government Association has put a lot of money into pushing the yes case. That money has come from councils and that money could have been, some might argue, better spent on the delivery of local roads, fixing potholes, and doing all the great things such as providing childcare services that local government does. Local government knows that it is so important to get recognition in the Constitution that it has spent a considerable sum of money pushing the yes case. As Senator Joyce said, it is now for local government to take up the cudgels, because it is about the future of local government. And he is right. Senator Joyce said: I don't know whether political involvement on a grand scale from Canberra is going to be of the sort of assistance that local government wants. I think the Australian people are going to be very interested in the discussion local government has with the Australian people on why they see this, what I even say, a form of housekeeping, is brought into place so you can continue with funding such things as Roads to Recovery, Black Spot and future Coalition policy, such as Bridges to Recovery. They are all important things for local councils. I know in Gundagai shire at the moment they have a huge problem with Gobarralong bridge, and they are lobbying for state funding for the repair of that bridge. Many of the farmers in that district are having to go the long way around because B-doubles are no longer able to traverse that piece of vital infrastructure. I know that Gundagai shire and certainly the mayor there, Abb MCAlister, would very much appreciate receiving federal funding for Gobarralong bridge. Unfortunately, they will have to rely on either their own funds, of which there are not many, or state financial assistance to rebuild that hundred-year-plus bridge to a state where it can be usedMs Hall interjecting",151
300,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS,I only have a minute and 43 seconds to go. It is hard to read a bit of scribble when you are trying to push the yes case for something that is so important.,152
301,Mr Windsor,BILLS,We need to show some passion.,152
302,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS,"Yes, show some passion for local government areas and local councils. Of the 13 local government areas in my electorate, 13 are supporting the yes case. It is vital for them.",152
303,Mr Windsor,BILLS,"Hear, hear!",152
304,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS,"I know the local government areas within New England are also very supportive of local government recognition. I know of the work the member for New England has done in this place and I do acknowledge that. I also acknowledge the work that Senator Joyce has done as shadow minister for local government. He also said is very important that we note that within coalition there will be a no case mountedwe heard that from the member for Tangney-but it is crucial that we get this through. Local governments have spent money to push the case for the yes vote. That expenditure needs to be recognised in the context of the need to get people to vote in favour of this proposal. It is going to be a tough ask. Federal Labor has not allowed enough time to mount a good, educational campaign sufficient to get this across the line. We know that the success rate of referenda is not high, but may I again emphasise to the people of Australiacertainly those who rely on good, grassroots representation-that there ought to be constitutional recognition of local government.",152
305,Ms HALL,BILLS," I am very aware of the fact that we have very little time to speak in this debate and I will keep my contribution extremely short. The reason that I seek to speak on this particular piece of legislation is, firstly, to express my support for it and also to share with the parliament a letter I have just received from my local council, which I will seek leave to table after I have completed my contribution to this debate. My local council, Lake Macquarie City Council, has contacted me by mail-I received a letter from the mayor-requesting that I support this legislation. The mayor pointed out to me that it is critical for the city of Lake Macquarie and communities around Australia. She goes through and highlights the reasons this is so important. She highlights that the council made a number of submissions to the joint select committee and the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government and that it they passed resolutions through council the confirming their support for financial recognition by the change to section 96 of the Constitution. She concludes by asking me to vote in favour of the bill, saying that it is a crucial step and vital for local government. I strongly support the legislation for all the reasons that have been highlighted by the Mayor of Lake Macquarie and for many other reasons. It is about ensuring the viability of local government and better services for the people that I represent in this parliament. I seek leave to table the letter from the mayor of Lake Macquarie. Leave granted.",152
306,Ms HALL,BILLS,I thank the House.,152
307,Mr WINDSOR,BILLS," I would like to speak briefly to the bill before the House, the Constitution Amendment (Local Government) 2013. As most people would know, it was part of the agreement in the formation of a minority government that a referendum be held on the financial recognition of local government in the Constitution, so I am personally very pleased that the government is proceeding with this. I am pleased to a certain extent about the bipartisan support that exists in this chamber and in the other place, but I am a little bit disappointed in the sort of dual attitudes that the coalition seems to have in relation to this-almost expressing the view that they hope it fails even though they are supportive of it, or they say they are supportive of it. There is an argument out there that there needed to be more time. The quite simple amendment I think embraces nine words in the Constitution. It is a very simple phrase that is going to be placed in the Constitution. It is being put there because of various High Court challenges and legal advice that local government, if it is not recognised, will not, in certain circumstances, be able to receive direct funding from the Commonwealth government. This is not about eroding the powers of the states; it is about ensuring the viability very good programs. The coalition should be right on this and full of enthusiasm and not just leaving it to local government to promote itself. All of us in this building should be promoting this. The coalition's original program of Roads to Recovery is an excellent program. It is very fair, it gives local government areas the capacity to determine where the money is spent, everybody knows how the formula works and everybody gets a fair share. That is direct funding from the federal government to local government. That is under threatwith the High Court challenges and the legal opinion that is out there, the capacity of the Commonwealth government to fund Roads to Recovery, for instance, and many other programs, would be under threat. The financial recognition is solely about that. It is solely about allowing what we have taken for granted in the past to occur in the future, because there is very real legal opinion that a challenge could be upheld if we do not in fact change the Constitution. I was on both the committees-the Jim Spigelman committee and the parliamentary committee-that looked at this particular issue. I have never been involved in local government, but I think it is a very, very important aspect of governance in this country, particularly in country areas. The member for Riverina talked about the 13 councils in his area. He is quite right to say that in my electorate all the councils are very, very supportive. There is another reason for the support of the financial recognition of local government. I am not sure whether others in the debate have actually addressed this. If you think back to the Rudd years and the global financial crisis, there will be varying opinion in this building as to the response to that crisis. Personally I think one of the great things that did happen was in relation to the of stimulus payments. The decision was made to stimulate the economy financially, and do it quickly and with some degree of largesse. I think most economists would agree with that process. Other countries in the world did it quickly and were able to come through the global financial crisis reasonably well, but none of them as well as Australia did. How do you apply stimulus payments to an economy to actually get the money to flow through the economy and have all the economic impacts when the private sector is stalling? People may remember that the mining boom was in fact stalling. There is a rumour running around the parliament that we got through the global financial crisis because of the mining industry. That is not correct. There was a gap there that needed stimulus payments and the government, the parliament, actually acted upon those payments. The reason I mention that is that one of the most successful avenues for stimulating the economy was local government. There were massive payments made. Local government spent that money fairly quickly. It had an impact on the regional economies. It had an impact on the capacity of local government to update itself in terms of some its infrastructure et cetera. But the money was spent right across the nation so there was a successful injection of funds. I do not think anybody from any political persuasion would argue that the money was wasted in any shape or form. It was part of a legitimate process between the Commonwealth government of the day and local government. The reason I raise that is that there are strategic reasons why we need to recognise local government in a financial sense in the Constitution. If we ever had the need to stimulate the economy again and state governments were of varying political persuasions, the argument some people would put up is, 'Look, you can do all this through the state governments anyway; if there is a need to do something you can do it through the state governments.' If you want to run Roads to Recovery after it has been challenged successfully in the High Court, you can do it through state governments, besides the political implications that would engender in terms of fairness et cetera. I think there is a very simple reason for if you need the Commonwealth government to stimulate the economy, or the federal government of the day has to have a direct input into local government in a non-political sense, if you go through the states and the states have different political persuasions, you run the risk of all of the politics that we see between state and Commonwealth governments coming into play. So there are very strategic reasons why that needs to be done. If, in fact, the arrangements that we fear in terms of the legal challenges had been in place when the global financial crisis occurred, the Rudd government may well not have been able to stimulate the economy through local government. It may have been blocked and played with in terms of various state political persuasions. The success of those stimulus payments was that a decision was made quickly and an injection of funds occurred. We were one of the few countries in the world that were able to get through without a recession. Many people in here will still argue that there was too much, too little, too this or too that. The fact is that it worked and one of the reasons it did work it was that the federal government of the day had the capacity to have a direct and quick relationship with local government. That is a strategic reason that we need to look very closely at. I think all of us, irrespective of who is going to be the federal governments of the future, need to be part of that particular process. I would like to thank a lot of the people who participated in the various committee processes that did take place and Jim Spigelman, in particular. I think he did an extraordinary job. I thank ministers Crean and Albanese for the way in which they have conducted the processes. Once you start thanking people obviously you leave people it: out, but I thank the member for Parkes who has been involved in this process as well. From a country perspective, he has been a sounding board and judge because of his local government background. He has been a judge of the need for this to happen. I encourage all political parties, particularly the coalition who say they are on side-but are sort of hedging their bets as, if it fails, it will be because of the Labor government and because we did not have time to explain what nine words meant. I have a little more faith in the capacity of voter to actually understand more than one line. I know we have had the politics of bumper stickers run in this place-stop this, stop that, no to something else. But I think the average voter really does understand, particularly in country areas where they have seen the benefits of some of the direct relationships between Commonwealth governments and local government. Hopefully all of us of various political persuasions will get out there and actually say this is not something to be afraid of this is putting in place what you have expected and what you thought was there. It is to make sure that a legal challenge cannot take away what we all believe to be the status quo. Rather than looking at arguments such as, 'I wish we had more time', I think there is plenty of time to develop these arguments and get them into the community. The Australian Local Government Association and the state based organisations have money that has been put away for over a year that is ready to go in terms of promoting the yes campaign. So I would encourage all of us to get behind this program. Finally, I thank the Prime Minister, who was a signatory to the arrangement that a referendum on this issue would occur. She signed that document with the member for Lyne and myself. I thank her for adhering to the agreement, as she has done very diligently on many of the other programs that were within the agreement.",152
308,Mr NEVILLE,BILLS," I welcome this opportunity to speak on this Constitutional Alteration (Local Government) 2013 or, as it has been popularly called today, the constitutional recognition of local government. I would just like to make a statement at the beginning to clear my the conscience on this. I am not here to snarl or degrade the states. I am very much a states man. I think we have a unique Constitution. We had six colonies or states. They spent 10 years putting the Constitution together. It has worked very well and its bastardisation over time has been at the hands of nonconstitutional measures that all of us politicians have had a hand in. Periodically, you have to go back to the public and get those things straightened out. I do not want it said that Paul Neville was setting up something to denigrate the states; quite the contrary. I am an advocate for the removal of overlap and duplication, and we have heaps of it under governments of both political persuasions, state and federal, and it has been going on for far too long. As a young man in the National Party-it might even have been called the Country Party at the time. I saw Charles Cutler, the then Deputy Premier of New South Wales, and John MCEwen have a blazing fight over, when it really got down to the short strokes, whether the corridors at the Dubbo high school should be four feet six inches or four feet nine inches wide. That was the sort of duplication that came into many of these measures. I would quote my leader and colleague Warren Truss especially for those people who are seeing all sorts of devious people behind trees in this exercise. He said that in Australia local government authorities are created under state legislation and the proposed referendum in question will have no impact on this status. The wording of the proposed changes specifically restricts the Commonwealth to making payments only to local government bodies formed by the law of a state. I think that is critical; it nails right from the beginning. If you want to go back to earlier referenda, you will note back in 1974 the wording was different. It talked about the Commonwealth's powers to borrow money and make financial assistance grants to local government, which was quite a different proposition in 1974. In 1974, 46 per cent voted yes and only one state voted yes, so it did not get up. And when you come to the last time this was put before the Australian public, in 1988, the question was around the wording of 'full constitutional recognition of local government'. The public on that occasion were even more definitive. That referendum went down 66 per cent to 33 per cent, with no state giving the majority. So you can see the Australian public want to see local government empowered, but they do not want to create a third monster. They want local government to stay within the bounds of the laws of the states. I would like to congratulate some members and some former colleagues-I see the member for New England with me here today, and elsewhere are the member for Ryan and the member for Braddon and former members Senator Bob Brown and Ross Cameron-who participated in the Spigelman report. I think the Spigelman report is a very interesting document and I recommend everyone, assuming this is passed today, to have a good look at it before this referendum. It is not going to be an easy ask because of those who put submissions to Spigelman, it was 53 to 45 in favour of doing this-53 to 45 is not a big majority. Another interesting thing was that the capital cities were not all that terribly enamoured about it. You can understand why. Why would they want more power for local government? They have highways and expressways and motorways and opera it houses and art galleries and beautiful harbours and all sorts of facilities-beautiful hospitals and tourist attractions, opera houses and the like. People in the country do not have that, and it is what their local councils provide that become the foundation for the quality of life in those towns. That is sometimes forgotten. So when you go back to Spigelman and look at what happened there, in submissions that came from regional areas about 60 per cent were in favour of this measure; in remote areas, which have even less still, up to 70 per cent were in favour. But when you look at the submissions from the cities, the urban areas and the larger cities, only about 30 per cent were in favour. So you can see there is a cry out there from regional and remote Australia for a better quality of government, and you can understand that. Local government is dismissed sometimes as the third tier of government, but it is the form of government that is closest to the people. And if you go back in human history, it was the first form of government that regulated the tribes, that regulated the small communities, before nations even formed and played significant roles in the running of great nations of Europe, for example. The other interesting thing, and parliament needs to be on its toes about this, is that if you again go back to Spigelman and look at the support state-by-state, you will find that Queensland and Victoria are not in favourthey are two big states not in favour-and the majority in Western Australia and Tasmania are not all that flash either. What you can assume from that is this is going to be no pushover. And I am somewhat critical of the government in that I think they did not recognise how important it is to get this thing launched earlier. It should have been launched three or perhaps even six months ago so that people would have a good chance to understand the dynamics of what was happening. A lot of people, and even members in this House, think that this is an erosion of states' rights, that we are doing it for the wrong reasons and it is not really financial, it is going to be other things. But, again, we go back to Spigelman, and we find that overall 46 per cent of those who put in submissions said it should be recognised on the basis of financial matters; 30 per cent said for symbolic reasons; and 11 per cent said for democratic reasons. On taking the councils out it went up even higher: 64 per cent said financial; 21 per cent said symbolic; and 25 per cent said democratic. There is a dynamic there that could easily push this overboard. I think the government was unwise not to get into the explanation of this earlier. We all know from the history of referenda in Australia that if the Australian public has the least doubt then they will not abide it. If one major party opposes it they will not abide it. If one or two states become virulently against it they will not abide it. And, as we see from the last two referenda on this subject, although the arguments were reasoned they went too far, and out of those two referenda only one state carried it in one referendum-not a very convincing result. That is the first thing I wanted to say. There is adequate evidence that this could be brought in on a financial basis only and not to empower local government beyond that point. It will still be the child of the state government. What it will do is streamline the system of payments and since the Keating and Howard governments, in particular, a lot of money has supposedly gone directly to local governments. But when it has been filtered through the states it does not always get there in the best order. I will tell you a little story: it is not on local government, but it illustrates a point I want to make. The federal government during the Howard years made a grant available to country high schools for assembly blocks. It was a great idea because a lot of these high schools developed over time; they were grade 10 high schools and then they became grade 12 high schools. This particular school got a full Commonwealth grant of half a million dollars. I was handed the paperwork for that. About $110,000 of that half-million dollars went into design and architecture and about $130,000 went into-would you believeQBuild, which is effectively the Queensland state department of works. In other words, on that half-million-dollar job the state took $240,000. But the sad thing about it was that it was not something built in that town with local tradesmen; it was a prefabricated building that came off the shelf of a factory in Brisbane or the Gold Coast, travelled on the back of seven trucks, was put on a simple slab and was put together like a meccano set. The state government took $240,000 out of half a million dollars. We come now to this local government thing. There is a facility for the Commonwealth to take moneys like this direct to local government. I think we can get a bigger bang for the taxpayers' bucks",155
309,Mr Albanese,BILLS,"Hear, hear!",157
310,Mr NEVILLE,BILLS,"I see the Leader of the House there, who has transport in his portfolio. I think we can see a lot more bridges and roads in shires and towns. I think the direct funding would be a great fillip to local authorities. The other thing this will do-and there will be an element of symbolism in it-is that it will say to people that local government deserves to be, if not in a controlling position, respected. I know my quite Labor colleagues will not like this, but I think the Beattie and Bligh governments absolutely emasculated local government in Queensland. They did things like not allowing councillors to stand for state government elections without resigning. In fact, they tried to apply it to federal elections, but the High Court overturned it. The High Court said, 'None of that; you don't touch the feds.' They took away things like a 40 per cent subsidy on sewage and water and put that back onto local government. That became a huge impost on the rates of, at that time, 150 local authorities in Queensland. It was a huge impost. Had those sorts of moneys, and perhaps a refinement of the Federal Assistance Grants, been considered part of this the local authorities would have greater authority in where they put their money. They, too, would get better bang for their sewage and water bucks, which are big components of a country town or a provincial city. In fact, they are sometimes the key to unlocking industry and residential development. So, while I am critical of the fact that this has taken a while to come about, I think it is a good measure, and I support it for the reasons I have given.",157
311,Mr ALBANESE,BILLS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (18:43): I rise as the local government minister to support the Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013. Local governments provide services and facilities which play an invaluable role in the daily lives of all Australians, and yet it is currently not mentioned in the Constitution. Recognising the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and local governments simply recognises an existing reality. Drive around any suburb or town and we will see there is almost certainly a town hall, a sports oval, a new wing to the local library or a rejuvenated main street that was built with Commonwealth help. In December 2008, I was at the Local Government Constitutional Summit, which was convened by the Australian Local Government Association. The conference resolved: to ensure the quality of planning and delivery of services and infrastructure provided to all Australians, and the ongoing sustainability of local government, any constitutional amendment put to the people in a referendum by the Australian Parliament … The power of the Commonwealth to directly fund local government should be explicitly recognised … The idea that this referendum has been sprung on anybody is, quite frankly, absurd. That constitutional convention was in 2008. It was attended by me and the relevant shadow minister, who I think was at the time Mr Truss. But it was certainly a bipartisan event, and from that point we provided funding. In June 2010, at the Australian Local Government Association national conference here in Canberra, I made an announcement of seed funding to go out and consult about constitutional recognition of local government with all the local government bodies around the country. The Attorney-General has gone through and outlined the bill in some detail. The government proposes a modest amendment which would add 17 words to section 96 of the Constitution. This amendment will recognise local government by allowing the Commonwealth parliament to grant financial assistance directly to local government bodies. This reflects the fact that the Commonwealth has partnered with local governments to deliver local roads, sporting fields, libraries, child care, community services and much more. Importantly, the proposed change to the Constitution does not diminish the role of the states with regard to the administration of local government. Recognition in the Constitution does not alter the fact that local governments are created by and accountable to the states. We do not propose to alter those relationships. What we do propose is to recognise the reality that in Australia we have three tiers government. In the last five years the Commonwealth has partnered with local government to deliver over 6,000 community projects such as libraries, indoor and outdoor sporting facilities, pools, walking trails, roads and bridges. I take up the point that was made by the member for Hinkler. I give a very practical example which reinforces the view that he holds that there are some circumstances whereby local governments can deliver infrastructure cheaper and more efficiently than state or governments. I give the practical example of the Ironsley River bridge in Far North Queensland. The Ironsley River bridge was an issue that was campaigned for by the member for Kennedy not just for years but, according to the member for Kennedy-and I never doubt him-for decades. At each opportunity, funding was knocked back. The Ironsley River bridge, which went under when there was flooding, meant that communities around Normanton and Karumba in the Gulf Country were isolated and had to have food, supplies and medical assistance choppered in at enormous expense, but no government at any level had made the tough decision to invest and fix the problem permanently at this particular site. The state government had costed it at $31 million. Through the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program-this grant was criticised by the National Audit Office, by the way-we received a submission from the relevant council that sought, from memory, in the order of $17 million for that project. It was almost half what the state government said it would cost. They built the bridge, fixed the problem and then came back and said: 'We've got money left over. Do you mind if we build another of bridge with the money that's left over?' And they did that efficiently, employing local labour and making a difference to that local community. There were no political votes in it in a party political sense. It was the right thing to do by those communities that have been isolated when there have been events such as floods. So I certainly confirm the views of the member for Hinkler that this is particularly important to people in regional Australia. There is no doubt that the relationship between local government and regional territory communities is absolutely vital. Sometimes it can be the main employer, and it is the link that holds a community together-much more so than in an inner-urban community in a city such as where I live in Sydney. So it is a vital role. I acknowledge the fact that many of the strongest supporters of this referendum are people such as Senator Barnaby Joyce, the Leader of the Nationals, the member for Hinkler and other National Party representatives. They are very strong in their support of this referendum. The Commonwealth Roads to Recovery Program alone has delivered $1.75 billion in funding over the last five years. That is supporting safe and efficient roads right across the country. It is important that the modern reality of governance in Australia be recognised. I have heard a lot of completely false arguments against the common-sense piece of housekeeping that this piece of constitutional change represents. It is surely common sense that the Constitution, our most important legal document, should actually represent the reality of modern Australia, including our governance structures, and that is what this referendum will do. So I urge all members to campaign in their local communities. Local government will certainly be campaigning itself for a yes vote in this referendum. There will be all sorts nonsense arguments that come up, I am sure. I have not seen any valid ones yet. I have seen one legal academic, who clearly had not even bothered to read the bill that is before the House and the proposed changes, jumping at something that was a nonissue. Common sense tells you this should be supported, and I ask all Australians to say yes on 14 September.",158
312,Mr DREYFUS,BILLS,"Isaacs-Attorney General, Minister for Emergency Management, Minister for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (18:52): I thank honourable members for their contributions to this important debate, and in particular my colleague the Minister for Regional Development and Local Government. The Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013 will make a small but important amendment to the Constitution by including an express statement that the Commonwealth can grant financial assistance to local government. This would include assistance for community and other services. Local government bodies play an increasingly important role in our system of governance. From their establishment in providing basic services such as rubbish and roads, local governments now deliver a range of services that make our communities so livable. From local swimming pools and water parks to libraries, book loan vans, aged-care hostels, disability programs, arts festivals, galleries and tourism promotion, local governments are an essential facet in our lives. That they receive no mention in Constitution and that there is no express provision for local government bodies to receive financial assistance directly from the Commonwealth is increasingly difficult to justify. As speakers have pointed out, many of of these council services are provided in partnership with the federal government. This has been common practice for decades. As I made clear in my second reading speech, and as the explanatory memorandum to the alteration bill also makes very clear, this proposed change will not diminish the role of the states with regard to the administration of local government. Recognition in the Constitution does not alter the fact that local governments are created by and are accountable to state governments. This is about saying yes to important community benefits from the partnership between federal and local spheres of government. Of course, history shows that a referendum has the best chance of success when it has bipartisan support at the federal level. I thank the opposition for its support for the bill and encourage coalition members to join the campaign for a yes vote in September. It was very strange to hear the member for Mitchell imply that supporting recognition for local government somehow contradicts Liberal philosophy. He should try to explain that to the leader of his own party, who supports this change to our Constitution. We have heard considered and thoughtful contributions from across the chamber: from the member for Parkes, the member for Ryan and the member for Riverina. Of course, they represent the position of the federal opposition, which is to support this amendment. We have also heard a measured and helpful contribution from the member for New England and a like contribution the from the member for Hinkler. The member for Hinkler rightly pointed out the significant differences in the process which has been followed in relation to this proposal to amend the Constitution compared with the previous proposals which related to local government, in 1974 and 1988. It is only when members try to drag this debate down into party political attacks that we see the no case emerge. The member for Hughes, for example, labelled the proposal that has been brought forward by the government 'deeply flawed'. I would remind the member that this wording was first proposed by the 2012 expert panel led by the Hon. James Spigelman AC, QC, and subsequently endorsed by a parliamentary joint select committee comprising members from across the political spectrum. It has been drafted by the First Parliamentary Counsel and reviewed by the Solicitor General. I prefer to pursue an amendment considered by these experts and informed by broad-ranging community consultation, rather than any alternative proposal from the member for Hughes. The member for Mitchell also made the claim during debate that the government has committed $21.6 million to a campaign to support the yes vote at the referendum. This is simply not true. What the government has committed to-and this is set out in the budget papers-is $10 million to fund a neutral, non-partisan civics education campaign. That campaign will provide the community with information about the Constitution and the process for considering any change in the roles of the Commonwealth, the states and local government, and about the terms of the proposed alteration. This education campaign will not advocate either a yes vote or a no vote but will help ensure electors are aware of the issue and in a position to make an informed vote-which brings me to the contribution of the member for Tangney. He is not content to simply call this change 'antiManagement, Liberal'; he calls it 'un-Australian'. I quote from the member: That is not the Liberal way and that is not the Australian way. This bill in essence is un-Australian. This bill would enable the diminution of local sovereignty and democracy, and no Liberal member should, or can, respectably support less democracy. That the member is so willing to question the love for country and support for democracy of anyone supporting the referendum question, including members of this parliament, gives a clear indication of the feverish no campaign that is planned by some. Of course, the member for Tangney is completely wrong to suggest that the bill would diminish local sovereignty or democracy. Local government is free to reject any offer of assistance from the federal government. In stark contrast to these isolated voices, when I introduced this bill I noted that it is actually part of a truly democratic process. There is no better way to honour the democratic society in which we live than to engage in constructive discussion and decision on the structure of our government. The referendum will give the people of Australia the opportunity to decide whether 17 words should be added to the Constitution. These words will recognise the modern reality that the Commonwealth grants financial assistance to local government for a variety of important community and other services. I thank the House for its support for this important proposal for constitutional amendment. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",160

316,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being after 7 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Petitions: Dyslexia  Opposition Business) (19:20): As shadow minister for education I firmly believe that there is no shame in a learning disability; the only shame is if it is not recognised and treated. Dyslexia is a learning disability that can hinder a person's ability to read, write, spell and sometimes even speak and is a major challenge for many children and their parents. Dyslexia affects between three and 10 per cent of the population and can cause great difficulties for children in their early years of schooling if not diagnosed and treated properly. Dyslexia is not a sign that children are lazy or unintelligent. It is a genuine disability, and it is crucial for children who suffer from dyslexia that they receive the appropriate diagnosis, treatment and support in their school. For parents of children with a disability choices are limited. They want what every parent wants for their child-the right to choose an education that will allow their child to reach their full potential. Currently, students with a disability can expect vastly different treatment depending on which state they live in, what type of school they go to and how their disability is classified. Proper support for children with dyslexia has not always been available. Although attitudes are changing as people come to understand the condition more, there is still much work to be done. We need to ensure that all Australian children with dyslexia get the support they need. It is imperative that dyslexia is recognised for what it is-a disability. I have been working with Specific Learning Difficulties SA, SPELD, from my electorate of Sturt to raise awareness of this by asking the parliament to formally recognise dyslexia as a disability and to provide funding to ensure that students with dyslexia receive high-quality intervention as soon as diagnosis has been confirmed. of Funding to meet the particular needs of students with dyslexia should be regarded as a basic entitlement for that child and should therefore be portable. I am also calling for the use of modified curricula and instruction, appropriate assistive technology and extra time for learning as students with dyslexia progress through school. Recently I presented over 10,000 signatures on petitions advocating for the recognition of dyslexia as a disability to the Standing Committee on Petitions. The petition asks the House of Representatives to endorse the use of modified curricula and instruction, appropriate assistive technology and extra time for learning as students with dyslexia progress through school. I am pleased to present to the parliament the signed petition and ask that it is tabled at the end of my contribution. I would like to use this forum to acknowledge the hard work of Angela Weeks and her team at SPELD SA. This was a tremendous community effort by all involved and I am extremely proud of everyone who signed this petition and circulated it. Recognition of dyslexia as a genuine disability and the provision of appropriate support will ensure that students with dyslexia are no longer discriminated against by our education systems. On a personal note, can I say that my father, who was an ophthalmologist, was the first vice-president of SPELD in South Australia in the early 1970s and was known for his work in trying to break ground in using assistance through ophthalmology through optometry for children with dyslexia. He was acknowledged for his work by being named Father of the Year in South Australia in 1975 for his work with children with dyslexia. I table the petitions. The petitions read as followsTo the honourable speaker and members of the House of Representatives: This petition draws to the attention of the House concerns about the lack of recognition given to students with dyslexia in Australia. Education systems and schools need to accept the clinical diagnosis of dyslexia and recognise that diagnosis indicates a genuine learning disability. We therefore ask the House to recognise dyslexia as a disability and to provide funding to ensure that students with dyslexia receive high-quality intervention as soon as diagnosis has been confirmed. This petition asks the House to endorse the use of modified curricula and instruction, appropriate assistive technology, and extra time for learning as students with dyslexia progress through school. So that high-stakes tests and examinations assess ability and not disability, it is essential that students with dyslexia be offered access to accommodations, additional time, and the use of a computer. Recognition of dyslexia as a genuine disability and the provision of appropriate support will ensure that students with dyslexia are no longer discriminated against by our education systems. from 8,647 and 641 citizens. Petitions received. Higher Education",168
317,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT," Since the 1990s there have been many steps taken to develop the Australian private higher education system so that private institutions can compete with the long-established public universities. Private and public providers became subject to Australian Universities Quality Agency audits from the commencement of that organisation and students enrolled at a private higher education provider have been given access to FEE-HELP. Private providers can become self-accrediting institutions like universities, and more recently both private and public providers have been regulated by the Tertiary Education Quality Standards Agency. According to the Council of Private Higher Education, this has resulted in about eight to nine per cent of total enrolment in higher education being in the private sector. Education is now the third largest earner, second behind mining exports, for Australia, and private providers have played their part in this. The name 'university' is a protected name. The Bradley report sets out ways that private providers could aspire to university status. Thus far only one institution-the former Melbourne College of Divinity-has been able to achieve that goal, despite enthusiasm in some quarters for the so-called 'teaching universities'. Academics in Australia have always associated quality universities with substantial research performance, a factor recognised in the Bradley report. The problem for all private higher education providers at the moment is that, apart from the distant goal of university status of some type, there is no immediate reward or incentive for developing the research capacity which is the recognised mark of any quality higher education institution. Put another way: there is very little that distinguishes the best private providers from those that barely meet registration and accreditation standards. The current system is good at setting minimum standards for private higher education, but provides little to encourage excellence. One obvious way to encourage excellence is to reward research performance-not by an entitlement to more funds but by opening competition for research funds to those private institutions that have been judged capable of offering research higher degrees. These institutions have been judged to have the research capability in the fields in which they offer these degrees. Not surprisingly, the public universities have resisted such competition from the private sector institutions, but it is difficult to see other than self-interest motivating this opposition if it is a competition based on excellence. One would hope that competition from private providers might further lift research performance across the whole sector. Let us now turn to the experience of the Australian College of Theology. The ACT is the largest provider of theology graduates in Australia. The college has 1,450 equivalent full-time students or around 3,300 students spread across 18 affiliated colleges throughout Australia. Of these students, 3.5 per cent, or around 88 students, are enrolled in higher degrees by research. Sixty are enrolled in doctoral degrees. These students receive no research scholarships to pay fees or stipends. That is outrageous. If these same students went to a public university or one of the few private universities with access to the Research Training Scheme they would likely have their fees paid. The cost of funding these students would be minimal, less than $1 million annually, even if all were enrolled full time. The ACT has been assessed twice by AUQA, both with exemplary outcomes, and has been granted the right to accredit its own courses by an accreditation panel of the New South Wales Department of Education, and that status is recognised by TEQSA. Access to research funding has been raised with the former Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research, Senator Chris Evans. He praised the efforts of the ACT but declined to provide access to table B of the Higher Education Support Act 2003, which would have given qualified ACT students the chance to compete for research funds. In other words, the ACT has hit a brick wall in its efforts to improve its own quality. As a private, fee-paying institution the anything ACT simply cannot compete with the government provided financial assistance for research available to research degree students enrolled in those institutions listed in table B of the HESA. The ACT does not necessarily need to be listed on table B HESA, but it needs some way that it can compete on an even playing field with other institutions that are self-accrediting and are deemed capable of offering higher degrees by research. I believe such an opportunity for research students in the ACT should be available to all research degree students in private higher education institutions. Casey Electorate Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (19:29): As this parliament nears its end, I rise to give what will surely be my final adjournment speech before the coming election. I would like to take this opportunity to talk about electorate I am so honoured to represent in this House of Representatives-the electorate of Casey; to talk about what it is, what it could be and what it should be. Casey encompasses around 2,500 square kilometres, ranging from the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne through the bulk of the Yarra Valley: from Steels Creek and Dixons Creek, Healesville and Yarra Glen in the north to Mount Dandenong, Kalorama, Olinda, Monbulk and The Patch in the south; from the edge of Croydon through Mooroolbark, Bayswater North, Kilsyth, Monbulk and Lilydale and out eastwards along the Warburton Highway beyond the historic town after which that road is named. The Casey electorate is quintessential middle Australia that includes suburban neighbourhoods and country towns. It is a part of the country where the combination of aspiration and perspiration has produced a determination to build a better life. Much of the region was settled more than a century ago by pioneers who sought nothing more than an opportunity to determine their own fate and their own future. They tilled the fields and built homes and businessespeople like the Chapmans, who founded of the Chappies fruits, or the Flemings, who established Flemings Nurseries. As the descendants of that first generation have dedicated themselves to building upon the legacy of their founders, they have been joined by successive waves of newer arrivals from other parts of Australia and the world. But whether they were born there or moved there, all have seen our local community as a place of optimism and opportunity. While some commute to work elsewhere, others find employment with the wide diversity of local business enterprises that range from furniture manufacturing right through to food the manufacturing. There are orchards, nurseries, flower farms, vineyards, timber, tourism, light manufacturing and engineering industries, to name just a few. And there are many, many small business owners who work the long hours required to turn vision and ambition into entrepreneurial success. The local quality of life has also been enriched by a vibrant tapestry of local communities, where local volunteers do so much, for so many, so often. It saddens me to report that the people I represent in this House are now hurting in increasing numbers, their futures handicapped, limited and handcuffed by the incompetent policies of the most inept federal Labor government in recent memory. Many are struggling under the burden of Labor's carbon tax that they were promised they would never have. The small business owners amongst them are being drowned by Labor's high taxes and strangled by excess red tape churned out by a Labor regulatory state on steroids. They have watched a massive level of debt run up in their name by a Labor government that is stealing from their future. They have watched as gross debt heads to $290 billion this December. Firsttime voters and young families know that Labor's debt is not free: it costs $12 or $13 billion every year in interest-and that is before the principal has even begun to be repaid. They know that any more of Labor after 14 September will only mean more debt and intergenerational theft. There is a better way: the coalition way that offers hope, reward and opportunity by ensuring government lives within its means instead of racking up charge after charge on the national credit card; a way that restores confidence in the competence of Canberra. If the coalition is fortunate enough to win the upcoming federal election, our first order of business in the new parliament will be to repeal Labor's job-destroying carbon tax. We will also enhance local control of schools and hospitals because we recognise local communities have a better sense of local priorities then far distant bureaucrats. And we will restore the same integrity to Australia's border protection through the tried and true policies that worked well under the Howard government. The 14th of September will mark a major fork in the road. The Labor road will head to continued failure, continued cons and continued chaos. The coalition road will lead to stronger communities, a strong and prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia. (Time expired) National Security",169
318,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT," number of honourable members and some members of the media might well be wondering why I chose to abstain from the vote this afternoon on the motion moved by the honourable member for Denison to suspend standing orders and seek an inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, with which I must say I had quite a lot of sympathy because one in this country supports terrorism and no-one would support the lack of inquiry into a circumstance relating to the detention of a convicted Egyptian jihadist terrorist and how, indeed, that person was detained. As Speaker, however, I was always of the view that the standing orders of this place ought to be respected, and there are very many opportunities in our parliament for members such as the honourable member for Denison to raise issues which are of importance to this nation. For instance, we have private members' bills, private members' motions, the adjournment debate in either this chamber or the Federation Chamber, the grievance debate, questions without notice to ministers, questions in writing to ministers, petitions, committee and delegation business, private members' business-bills and motions-and 90-second statements. In the Federation Chamber, time is allocated for three-minute constituency statements, committee and delegation business, private members' business, petitions, members' statements, the adjournment debate, the budget debate and the address-in-reply. But for this parliament to operate as it should, when I was Speaker-like, no doubt, most of my predecessors-I sought to enforce the standing orders and make sure that, while standing orders were in place, those standing orders were observed. Despite my sympathy for the motion sought to be moved by the honourable A member for Denison, it is important to recognise that the standing orders establishing the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security outline its responsibilities in dealing with matters of principle and administration and the listing of prohibited terrorist organisations. The PJCIS is explicitly barred from considering operational matters such as no- how, why, when, and who knew this alleged Egyptian terrorist was kept in a lower security detention from November 2012 to April 2013. Unfortunately, this contrasts with Britain's Parliamentary Intelligence Committee and the Senate and House Intelligence Committees of the US congress. The correct procedure for this parliament would have been to have moved in a debate to change the standing orders under which the PJCIS operates and if the parliament had, after mature discussion, fully considered the implications of this and had voted to change the standing order, then I would have been the first person in this parliament to stand and support the motion outlined by the honourable member for Denison. It would be quite proper for the PJCIS to discuss the inquiry being undertaken by the independent Inspector General Intelligence and Security once she had made a detailed report to government. IGIS, like ASIO and other security services, reports on matters of principle and administration to the intelligence committee. So, while I greatly admire the stand taken by the honourable member for Denison, I believe that it is incumbent on all of us not simply to take positions of, shall we say, political advantage. We should not be taking the opportunity to take pot shots at one another. think that it is entirely inappropriate for parliament to carry a motion to suspend standing orders when in fact, had that motion been carried, we would have been breaching the standing orders of the House of Representatives itself. We are a parliament which operates by rules. We change those rules from time to time. It is within the ability and capacity of us as members of the House of Representatives to change the standing orders whenever we collectively believe they should be changed. However, the motion moved by the honourable member for Denison, while well-intentioned, was not within the standing orders. I was approached by the opposition, by the government and by a member of the crossbench to participate in that vote but the concern I had was that, had I supported that vote in parliament, which was my intention, I would have been breaching the standing orders of the House of Representatives, and that would not be appropriate. (Time expired) MCMillan Electorate: Infrastructure",172
319,Mr BROADBENT,ADJOURNMENT," This may be the only opportunity I have in up an adjournment debate before the election campaign as well. I want to put to you and this House my dream, for my beautiful electorate of MCMillan, of what we would have if we had the money. Clearly, we do not have the money. The first thing I would like of is a brand new hospital in the West Gippsland region. It will only cost $230 million. The state government will not have the money and the only way it can ever be done is by a coalition government that has money in the bank to do some major projects. We can put $20 million per year into this ageing facility and perhaps rebuild it over a long length of time, but we will still have an old facility-done up. We need to have, in clear sight, a brand new hospital and I that is what the people of West Gippsland the are asking for. And it would be for the surrounding districts as well, because it would draw from Pakenham all the way through the Latrobe Valley down to the new West Gippsland hospital. There is the Port Welshpool Long Jetty, a historic tourism facility. We promised during the last two election campaigns that if we were elected we would rebuild the long jetty-$3 million to $5 million-because it is such an important material asset to the community. It would mean that the school progresses, business progresses and the pub progresses, and it would mean disability access for fishing-and I could go on. It ticks every box for a community that needs rebuilding. You would want to look at bypasses for Korumburra. We would want to look at a soccer stadium and complex for Pakenham, and a new facility in Moe-Newborough for our 'keenagers'. Who are our keenagers? Keenagers are older people who play table tennis. They would normally be sitting at home twiddling their thumbs or watching daytime television. But, no, they are out there playing table tennis. They need a $1 million addition to the Moe-Newborough complex to make a difference to their lives so they are not setting tables up and down every time they go in. The other thing that has come to my attention is that we need more respite care. can be aged care, but quite often it is needed for people with diseases that do have an effect on people-those who are still suffering from the effects of polio as a younger person, or Parkinson's disease sufferers and so on-where our great heroes, our most magnificent carers in our community, just need a break. We are going to need more money for those people that need a break but, sadly, the money is not there. We need duplication of roads, but especially the rebuilding of local roads. We had the drought and then we had the rain and then we had more rain, and the roads have broken up. We have had landslips all over my electorate and those landslips can cost as much as $1 million to fix. There go the roads that were going to be fixed with that $1 million! The sad part is that because this government has gone into a budget emergency there is no money for any of these very important projects in my electorate. There is not a dollar. We cannot promise a thing to the community because there is no money there to promise. Otherwise we would be promising other people's money; we would be promising borrowed funds, and that is not the coalition way. So here am I standing with all these desperate needs for my electorate of MCMillan and we cannot promise to rectify one of them. You may think that it is a big dream for a West Gippsland hospital-well, I am a big dreamer for a brand new West Gippsland hospital. I am a big dreamer for the rebuilding of the long jetty. And I will continue as the member for MCMillan to work towards these important projects. I will not give up just because they are a dream. I believe in this country. I believe in the It wealth of this country and the ingenuity and strength of the people. I believe that one day under a coalition government we will turn the corner. We will pay off the debt. We will get our economy in order as every household has to do, the same as this country has to do. One day my great dream is that I will stand up-and perhaps you will still be in this place-and I will say, 'Tick for the West Gippsland hospital; tick for the Port Welshpool Long Jetty; tick for a Korumburra and Leongatha bypass; tick for a soccer stadium for Pakenham; tick for a new centre for Moe-Newborough for keenagers; tick for further respite care for aged care and people with disabilities such as Parkinson's and those suffering from polio; and a big tick for a whole lot of money to be poured into the infrastructure for our local roads right across my electorate of MCMillan.' Calwell Electorate Petition: Cost of Living",173
320,Ms VAMVAKINOU,ADJOURNMENT," Tonight I would like to share with the House some recent events that have taken place in my electorate and also table a petition from the Northern Turkish Women's Association in Meadow Heights. I was pleased to visit the wonderful Greenvale Primary School during Education Week in May. I was invited there by the school, which had recently sent some of their students on a leadership Kidsview Conference at Coolaroo Primary School in my electorate. The school was very keen for me to visit them, because this was part of a follow-up to the conference. They wanted to hear from me about the federal government's role and contribution, and its overseas aid and development program. The Kidsview Conference was run by the Bahay Tuluyan Philippines Australia Volunteer Group, which advocates for the rights of children and those in need of special care. The name Bahay Tuluyan means 'house of welcome'. It is an organisation that believes in the power of children to create change. The BT conference encouraged students to discuss the global distribution of wealth, the impact of poverty, education and life opportunities, and basically it encouraged students to think about how they could act on making a difference on these issues. The kids also got the opportunity to hear from young people who had grown up in extreme poverty and who had managed to go on and become role models and community leaders in their own communities. The BT conference allowed students an opportunity to have a glimpse into how different their lives could have been had they been born, in this case, in the Philippines instead of Australia. During my visit students shared with me what they had learnt and many of them explained how it had moved, inspired and indeed motivated them. I was pleased to share with the students that the government has increased Australia's Official Development Assistance to a record $5.7 billion in 2013-14 budget. I was also pleased to tell students that over the next four years the government will target malnutrition among women and children in the Asia-Pacific region, lift universal education by supporting an additional 1.2 million children to go to school, and also increase access to maternal and child health services for a further 900,000 women. The students said to me that the conference had been for many of them a lifechanging experience and they came away with a greater appreciation of their own lives, as they were able to reflect on how lucky they were to access education, running water, electricity and also have the warmth and shelter of their homes. That was a very rewarding experience for myself and the kids. I also want to inform the House about a all recent visit to the very wonderful Brite Industries in my electorate. I visited them to announce funding that they received from the federal government's Local Solutions Fund. They received $82,000 in funding which will help Brite Industries develop a project which will provide a local hands-on, supported learning environment for people with disability and those that are vocationally disadvantaged. The initiative will facilitate the pathway for preaccreditation to accredited training and provide opportunities for participants to undertake qualifications in Certificate I in AgriFood Operations and Certificate II in Horticulture. Anticipated outcomes of that the program will include providing opportunities for people to learn, work and participate socially and economically in their local community; and create a social enterprise which will be self-sustaining and give Broadmeadows the opportunity to provide organic herbs for the local community. In closing, I would like to table a petition from the Northern Turkish Women's Association in Meadow Heights. This is a wonderful group of women who have been collecting signatures petitioning government on a range of issues. In November I tabled the first part of this ongoing petition of 1,429 signatures. Today I table the following, comprising 212 signatures. I inform that House that the petition was considered at a recent meeting of the Standing Committee on Petitions and certified as being in accordance with standing orders. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of the undersigned residents of Australia draws the attention of the House to issues affecting the daily cost of living for families, the living standards of pensioners and carers, as well as the accessibility of medical services. We feel we have spent our entire working lives in Australia and should be permitted to receive our pensions in manner that does not restrict our freedom to move. We feel the rising cost of electricity, gas, water, rates and groceries, as well as the price fresh fruit and vegetables, have become unaffordable. In addition to almost paying double for amenities, we feel the Government needs to examine the manner billing rates are determined and charged. We feel the Government should encourage farming by providing incentives to make it financially viable. We have also noted in our respective communities a concerning increase in waiting periods for necessary medical procedures in the public health system. We therefore ask the House to request the Government to: 1. Reassess the criteria of awarding aged care and disability pensions for Australians who wish to visit families overseas for a period longer than six weeks. 2. Examine the rising cost of amenities and groceries. 3. Examine the factors contributing to the time residents wait for medical procedures in the public health sector. from 212 citizens the Petition received. Government Policies",174
321,Mr ALEXANDER,ADJOURNMENT," A great champion is one who can turn adversity into triumph. There will be 1,200 highly skilled workers out of work at Ford, which announced that it was ceasing production in Australia after 93 years-a major adversity. Come in spinner: a triumphant announcement was made of relief packages and then the operational headquarters of the NDIS coming to a Ford factory near you! A champion of spin, but no champion-no Shane Warne. There will be no more Falcons, which were the most reliable and durable taxi-the family car; the fastest four-door car in the world and a legendary race car. No more. In Bennelong over the last 5½ years of Labor government thousands of workers have lost their jobs. According to the most recent ABS data, over 3,000 small of businesses in Bennelong have closed their doors each year under this government. These small business people were suffering from escalating energy costs and unfair competition practices by the big players and then finally succumbed to the most difficult trading times of their lives. They were promised Grocery Watch, but what they got was a great big tax-more regulation and more broken promises. Federal policy hits Bennelong. There are 14 multinational pharmaceutical companies operating in Bennelong-big businesses that invest big money in the creation of life-saving drugs. They are companies crucial to the nation's health. They need certainty. They need to be able to trust a government that they enter into agreements with, like the MOU that confirmed that the PBAC process would be honoured in regard to approval of new drugs to be listed on the PBS. When, at the first hurdle, this did not eventuate, the response around this global industry was that Australia is a country of sovereign risk. There has been a loss of confidence; there have been cutbacks and job losses. Federal policy hits Bennelong. Now those opposite promise Gonski. The timing is marvellous! This big-spending plan of investment in education at the very moment that they promise to rein in spending because we are facing economic peril and national debt projected to exceed $290 billion before the year is out-ramming through the House 71 pages of amendments to a nine-page bill, with no notice, and allowing only 90 minutes of debate, showing that this government prefers to turn this important issue into a political football rather than engage in genuine debate. Even those with the shortest of memories will remember their last investment in education, the BER. In Bennelong alone there were 15 school halls built that never taught one child one thing but had an average cost to taxpayers of over $2 million per building-federal policy hits Bennelong again. Then there is border protection, a policy that worked but is now sunk with, in its place, boats arriving in ever greater numbers. This may at times seem a distant problem other than for the small item of a cost blowout of some $6 billion. Concerns raised by Bennelong residents that asylum seekers were being housed inappropriately at Macquarie University, side-by-side with female international students, dismissed. Now one of these Red Cross clients is waiting in custody on charges of sexual assault on one of those studentsfederal policy hits Bennelong again. 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead' was said, but there is a carbon tax and it hits everything. Even our local pool has seen its costs go up and up-more broken promises, and federal policy hits Bennelong again. In Bennelong, whether you are trying to survive as a small business operator or desperately wanting to keep your job, if you want your child to get the best education for the money that is available, if you are a multinational pharmaceutical company, if you are a university wanting to attract foreign students, or if you simply want to take a swim this all-encompassing array of policies so hastily dreamt up and wastefully implemented hits everyone in Bennelong. Federal policy hits Bennelong again and again. There is no spin for Bennelong, just hard facts. This government has not missed us once over the past five years and, when you are gone, we will not miss you. Robertson Electorate: Telework",176
322,Ms ONEILL,ADJOURNMENT," Bennelong sounds like a very miserable place to be. I have a whole different story to tell. It is almost like it is another country when you head north up the F3 and you get to the seat of Robertson, where innovation and job creation are on target and we are obviously responding very much to the capacity of our NBN to change things. Recently, in the week beginning Monday 20 May, we celebrated a week of teleworking. Teleworking really is about enabling people who live on the Central Coast and travel through the region to use a smart hub facility on the coast. These smart working spaces were created by Wyong were Race Club and the Central Coast Leagues Club. I want to pay tribute to the leadership of both those institutions on the coast for providing a space in which some of our commuters, who were able to convince their employers to give them teleworking for a week, were able to spend a week of doing their work from the Central Coast Leagues Club or the Wyong Race Club. This was a very important campaign to allow people to consider what would happen if they were actually able to get off the or the F3 for four hours a day-because a trip to Sydney and back is two hours each way. This wonderful week was made possible by the leadership of the team at the Regional Development Australia Central Coast. I pay tribute to them, a great team of people who are really driving innovation and improved life outcomes for people on the coast. I am delighted to say I was able to provide some support in terms of funding for this event as well. We have 45,000 Central Coast commuters leaving the region each day and a telework hub is a very different alternative to just being able to work at home, especially on the back of having the NBN rolled out, turned on and about to go live in Gosford. The Central Coast Leagues Club, as a result of the success of this day, are thinking about whether this could be another way they could diversify their business and be able to provide parking for commuters who would come in from the Central Coast itself, with a shorter drive of 20 or 30 minutes perhaps, and be able to go to a dedicated work space where they could plug in and do their work. We hoped to gain some insights from this experiment and we certainly did that. I am pleased to say that the University of Newcastle has a research team gathering data from this event and analysing it as it moves forward. I would like to acknowledge also the participation and leadership shown with regard to innovation on the coast by Gosford Council and particularly the leadership of the new general manager Paul Anderson, Colleen Worthy Jennings and our mayor, Laurie MCKinna, who are very supportive of these sorts of events. In the time that remains I would like to put on the record that a number of people had a very significant role in enabling this. train Anthony Penny was an assistant who made sure everything worked on the occasion. He made sure all of the things connected so that people could get on and do their job. There was Jake Uren. Samantha Babcock from Innov8Central looked at how organising teams and innovation through this sort of model might be possible. Eddie Bernard, who is the business development manager with New South Wales Trade and Investment, was very active in this space. Kevin Bryan really was the poster boy for this event. He works with TAFE-and this was a significant part of TAFE's contribution-providing his skills and his time to help manage the event and get all of the information out into our communities so that we were able to get a broad range of people to participate in the telecommuting. Helen Polkinghorne is doing a wonderful job looking at how we can enhance learning and life experiences for people on the coast, particularly in this area. Brooke Simmons looked after the media communications and Greg Combes worked on social inclusion elements of the project. Mark Wigley was the project development manager from Regional Development Australia. He really helped us with raising the profile more broadly. There was great leadership by Graham Baker who is the innovations regions facilitator of Enterprise Connect and I do not think anybody in our electorate has worked harder on developing this vision of the coast. The teleworking project is one of 10 cluster groups that have been identified with the innovation plan for the Central Coast. Obviously with our 45,000 commuters the capacity to telework, improve productivity, and improve life work balance, the system was well tested and proved to be a great asset. Organ Donation",177
323,Mr MCCORMACK,ADJOURNMENT," At the National Party's federal council in Canberra on Saturday a motion was passed that organ donation laws be changed from requiring written approval via organ donation registration to an opt-out system following, and complemented by, a strong community wide education campaign. The mover of this motion was Dominic Hopkinson of the Wagga Wagga Young Nationals. As the New South Wales chairman, Niall Blair MLC, said this has started the conversation. In 2012, 354 organ donors gave 1,052 Australians a new chance at life. There are currently 1,600 people in Australia requiring an organ transplant. Do not take your organs to heaven because heaven knows we need them here: that was the message spelled out loud and clear. Even though I realise there will be cultural, religious and ethical issues, it was a good motion and a very good debate.

DAFF had in investigating the level of animal Queensland cattle crisis? And what contact has of Sustainability, Environment, Water, cattle being allowed into national parks? The Minister for the Environment, Water, Senator Ludwig, made mention of the fact counterparts, an MOU was discussed regarding minister said, the old program of drought relief the only other hard fact in that whole MOU-there and various things but only one hard fact-was of last resort. That is fine, except at the same Commonwealth would combine to make a reality make to agriculture around Australia. My questions regarding those loans-they however we will take that one on notice ourselves-are: make those loans a reality in the six states $30 million a year for two years, why would 500 farmers in the whole Territory, have available South Wales, shall we say, with somewhere Tasmania, which is quite obviously the smallest available to it as WA, which is quite obviously question I would like answered: what was the the loan? I believe the interest rate has been set but the Commonwealth will probably borrow, at three going to them on loan, is there a policy cost-in other words, charging 1½ per cent or Is there going to be a reckoning on how that with any of the states as yet?",220

But was a heap of ideas and touchy-feely stuff that the government would not be the lender meeting it was discussed how the states and the the loans that the Commonwealth wants to are totally at odds with that MOU statement, what are the trigger events that will and one territory involved? With $60 million, or the Northern Territory, with something under to it the same amount of loans as New between 35,000 and 40,000 farmers? Why should state in Australia, have the same amount the biggest state in Australia? That is one idea behind that particular part of the policy or not agreed to yet, at 4½ per cent.

All of these policies All of them are very important for tackling both is that Minister Combet is also hope that is a satisfying experience. That would business. It is good; you are probably at no thank you. Minister, I will just draw your on budget night. ACCI said: The nation's economic engine room of two million too big to ignore but the budget It said the 'budget ignores small business and There's not one small business initiative The Food and Grocery Council said: … there was little in the budget to stimulate growth increasing regulatory burden on business. The New South Wales chamber of commerce ignored again'-et cetera et cetera. My first question is to invite you to see measure directly intended to support the small measure in any of the budget documentation has sought to cobble together bits and pieces window of a small business in terms of their support. My second question relates to some of bringing forward of tax liabilities to a monthly businesses, and an observation by some that small business, where those caught up in that to respond to the tax office requirements-and I also invite you to advise whether any analysis now, given that it was originally inspired by on the horizon. The small businesses of Australia before there is any prospect of a surplus. In relation to business confidence, there elected, nearly 243,000 jobs have been lost budget seem completely unresponsive to those room of the economy but actually feels like Minister, it is a fact that there are 3,000 fewer figures, compared to when your government was measure in the document that seeks to turn now to one where small business and enterprise helpful. There is also further money in the budget, names register-$7.8 million. I am looking for with the register, including the broken promise of home based businesses-a promise that has government late last year, to no avail. Finally, one of the things the government likes of a small business commissioner, an able person There is no clear purpose or legislative basis Senate estimates last night that it is not actually actually disappearing, even though the government small businesses employing seven million people are largely leaves them shortchanged … hard savings choices'. A further statement was: worth speaking about tonight … and confidence, and nothing to relieve the ever commentary was: 'Small business has been if you can identify any single specific positive business community. We could find no such that has been available. Some commentary since going on elsewhere that may happen to go past a the measures that are included. I refer to the payment arrangement for many Australian that risks transferring the cash-flow burden to measure will need to rejig their own cash flow that may be to the detriment of small business. has been done on the impact of that measure the prospect of a budget surplus that now is not would have to see Labor elected four times is the really worrying sign that, since Labor was from small business. Yet the government and the job losses from what should be the engine one that has had some cylinders taken out. small businesses employing people in the latest elected. Again, if you could point me to any that around and look beyond the economy as it is are valued and supported, that would be on top of the $125 million, to fix the business your assurance that that will fix the problems of this government not to breach the privacy not been kept that we sought to pursue with the to point to in the budget is its establishment that does not actually have a commission. for that role. We learnt through the budget and in an ongoing program, so that token interest is announced this position-a commissioner with no commission-as being really significant forefront of government policy-making. Minister, essentially the thesis that the small business is that it is not the kick-start is making an already difficult situation worse, tax, which you have spoken about-that small pass on the costs of that tax, when anyone know that, in many cases, neither is possible. Are we to expect some new declaration of the next election? There is no provision for we can expect some sort of PR campaign cobbling substitute for a policy. (Time expired)",240
463,Mr COMBET,BILLS,"Charlton-Minister for Climate That is a pretty long list of questions that will do my best to work my way through them. The starting point is that the most important businesses and large businesses, and the workforce right. As the national accounts evidenced growing at an annualised rate of 2½ per cent. particularly advanced economies, can claim decades of continuous growth. We avoided the jobs and growth, and that same approach is, of that the coalition's strategy on fiscal policy strategy involves cutting deeply and imposing in. That would have a contractionary effect business community in particular. So the government general approach in the budget, as we have in necessary to continue economic growth and What else is relevant to small business? Small annual economic growth we are experience but that we have seen in recent years. The official got a stable inflationary environment, as I indicated cent-the mid-point of the RBA target range-and rates in the world. The member pointed to important thing at a macroeconomic level is been created in our economy-and at a time have been extremely adverse-and growth has in resources and resource related sectors. On issues specifically to assist business, have been supported that I would draw the member's billion investment plan, A Plan for Australian and compete in global markets and create jobs. proponents of major projects worth more Australian industry participation plans. These to ensuring small business remains at the public is providing on the budget as it relates to they were looking for but just another kick; and it one compounded by the world's largest carbon business is supposed to simply suck it up or with any appreciation of the real economy would interest in small business in the 101 days before that in the budget, and I am wondering whether together remotely related things as a Change, Industry and Innovation) (16:38): the member for Dunkley has advanced there, but I thing for small businesses, medium-sized generally, is that the economic settings are today, our economy is growing; real GDP is Very, very few economies internationally, such a growth rate. We have had, I think, two global financial crisis, we made investments in course, reflected in this budget. I do not know would be of assistance to small business if the austerity measures in the circumstances we are and it would be felt very sharply by the smallhas taken the view in fiscal strategy as a recent years, of making the investments that are continue a positive environment for investment. businesses are benefitting not only from the also from the significant fall in interest rates cash rate now stands at 2.75 per cent. We have earlier, with inflation at around 2.5 per we have one of the lowest unemployment some employment numbers and issues. Again, the that, since 2007, almost one million jobs have during which the international circumstances been experienced across the economy, not just there are a range of measures in the budget that attention to. I referred earlier to the $1 Jobs, which will assist small businesses grow One of the features of that plan is to oblige the than $500 million, for example, to prepare are plans that can and will benefit small and medium size enterprises gain access to the services not only through the construction phase phase subsequently. As part of the plan, also relevant to small investing about $350 million in Venture Australia, dollar for dollar in the private sector to stimulate experience with SMEs, in particular those that they want to commercialise, is that they often capital that is necessary to help them commercialise initiative that has had bipartisan support another $350 million in it, with a track record of success. There is also in the budget a new $27.7 small and medium size businesses gain access when a government-and in this case, obviously contracting for a particular good or service, SMEs to help them successfully develop the materials a public sector procurement process. That is there is also very important funding of $500 that, in particular, will be important for SMEs. other measures that I can also turn Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (16:43): talked about the challenging environment that competition from emerging economies, the particularly in the steel sector with coal and record prices. I am interested in some of that are supporting manufacturing. It matters in New South Wales, which has traditionally industries for regional wealth creation and of course jobs. I know it is outside of your portfolio specifically, I count eight specific measures, one of them through a number of amendments over the international practice and the current circumstances. why that and how that is important Minister, you also mentioned the innovation member for Dunkley. I am interested in how manufacturers, not only now but into the future. important program for the steel makers in that plan important, and how is it making a that is making a difference in securing the future you have already gone to the clean energy further on that.
