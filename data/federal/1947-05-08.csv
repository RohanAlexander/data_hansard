1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. J. S. Eosevear) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. TIMBEE.",12
2,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"Will the Minister representing the. Minister for Trade and Customs state whether the Deputy.Prices Commissioner, Mr Herlihy, announced in a press statement last February that it was proposed to institute an all-out drive against black marketing in timber? If so, can the Minister state what progress has been made in the campaign against black marketeers, whether any prosecutions have been launched against offenders, and whether there has been any diminution of black-marketing operations in this commodity, which, is so vital to home-builders?  question to the Minister for - Trade and Customs. I have no doubt that he will fi::-n;sh nn adequate: answer in due course. STOCK FEED.",12
3,Mr MCLEOD,Unknown,"I have received many - complaints from farmers and produce merchants, because of their inability to - obtain adequate supplies of pollard and wheat for stock feed, mostly in the - dairying and pig-raising industries. Is the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture able to take action through his department with a view to alleviating the position?  the honourable member has in. mind the position in Victoria. The output of bran and pollard in that State is at a very high level, but so is the demand, due. to the capacity of wheat farmers and poultry raisers to use this class of feed, because of the remunerative prices they are receiving for their products. I do nol know that anything can be done to overtake the shortage. During the war, under delegated national security powers, the Government of Victoria supervised the distribution of bran and pollard in order to ensure oriority of supplies to those who needed them most. Durinsr the debate on the financial statement, members of the Opposition clamoured for the removal of control from different kinds 'jf primary production. In the circumstances, I am afraid that it would be impracticable for the State of Victoria to exercise control of the distribution of these products, as it did formerly. However, I shall be very glad to make an inquiry with a view to determining whether distribution can be accelerated. There may have been a temporary interruption of distribution during the recent unfortunate industrial disturbance in Victoria. PUBLIC SERVICE. NUMERICAL STRENGTH.",13
4,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to the statement of the Commonwealth Statistician that, at the end of February last, 550,100 of' a total of 2,193,400 persons engaged in civilian' employment in Australia are on the Government payroll? If so, with respect to persons employed by the.Commonwealth .Government, is the right honoraible gentleman able to indicate the Commonwealth departments in which employment has increased since the end of the war, what, justification there has been for such increases, and what steps, .if any, are being taken to ensure that rigid economy shall be practised in the staffing of Commonwealth departments ?",13
5,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I have not read the' figures cited, but I heard references to the matter by the right honourable gentleman or some other honourable gentleman during the recent debate on the financial statement. I have had a report prepared on the subject showing the number of persons employed by the Commonwealth Government at the present time, as compared-with the peak period of the war, and showing also what has been done in regard to staffing in the various departments. It is a very long report. I would not like to embody it in Hansard, because it would involve too much work at the Government Printing Office, but I will make it available to the honourable member and to the press. IMMIGRATION .",13
6,Mr LANG,Unknown,"Has the Minister for Immigration seen a statement by Mr A. Masel, published in the Australian Jewish Herald of the 3rd April last, that the Minister for Immigration had laid it down that immigrants under a Jewish scheme must be of Jewish faith? Have any steps been taken by his department to prevent the entry of Christians under any scheme controlled by his department? Has any action been taken by him to ascertain the religious faith of any intending migrants to this country?",13
7,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I have read the statement referred to, and it is in accordance with the facts. I told the Jewish Welfare Organization ""that any persons about whom they desired to make representations must be of the Jewish faith; that is, they must be Jewish people who attend the Synagogue. I did not want the Jewish organizations to be making representations to. me on behalf of that class of persons who has become known as Nuremburg Jews-that is, persons who were condemned under the Hitler regime - because one or more of their grandparents had been Jews. Both in Europe and outside of it there are such persons who profess the Christian faith. I want the Jewish organization to confine its activities to Jewish people. In regard, to Nuremburg Jews, I have established, in co-operation with the proper authorities, two committees to represent persons of partly Jewish blood. One of these committee's will concern itself with those profess the Protestant faith, while the other committee will represent Catholics. The committee' to represent the Protestants is in Melbourne and is presided over by Professor Woodrow, the secretary being Miss Margaret Holmes. The Catholic committee is located in Sydney, and the secretary is Mrs J. Harcombe. I think the honourable member is misinterpreting the news item if he thinks that the Jewish people have been given advan-. tages over other persons of Christian faith who are partly of Jewish origin. Tliat, of course, would be a very un-Christiaii-like attitude to adopt.",13
8,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for Immigration. (1) How many British people have come to Australia since the cessation of war in the Pacific? (2) How many of these were new British migrants and how many migrants other than British came? (3) How many ex-service men and women who were British received their discharge in Australia? (4) How many allied servicemen received their discharges in Australia, and what were their nationalities? (5) How many applications from British people have been lodged in Australia House, London, by persons 'who wish to come to Australia? (6) What are the terms upon which British migrants can come to Australia in the future?",14
9,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"The honourable member was good. enough to tell me that he intended to ask a series of questions on this subject. The number of British people' who came to Australia, between V-P Day and the 31st January, 1947, was 38,41.3. Thatfigureincludes temporary visitors and returning Australians. The number of new British migrants to come to Australia between V-P Day and the 31st January, 1947, was 22,274 and 2,605 foreign migrants, of whom about 700 were refugees, were admitted up to the 31st December, 1946. The number of British ex-service men and women who received their discharge in Australia was 2,873. The number of allied ex-servicemen who received their discharge in Australia was 917, of whom 812 were American and 105 Dutch. Approximately 196,193 applications have been lodged toy who Britishers at Australia House for free and assisted passages to Australia and for the right, as it were, to enter Australia of those willing to pay the fares of themselves and their dependants. There are two agreements with the United Kingdom under our migration schemes. One provides for free passages to Australia for suitable ex-service men and women of the United Kingdom armed forces and merchant navy, together with their dependants. Under that scheme, the whole of the passage money is paid by the United Kingdom Government as part of its rehabilitation scheme. There is also an assisted passage agreement whereby the approved migrant is obliged to pay: (a) £10 sterling if nineteen years of age or over, (6) £5 sterling if fourteen years and under nineteen years, and (c) nothing if under fourteen years of age. The difference between these rates and the amount charged by the shipping companies is met by the United Kingdom and Australian Governments. The actual amount paid by the governments varies on different ships inasmuch as the rates charged by the companies vary. 1 answered this question in this form because I did not desire to take up the time of the House by asking for leave to make a statement.",14
10,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"I rise to order. I have always understood that the time allotted for asking questions in the afternoon is an occasion when honourable members have the right to ask questions without notice, and that if questions are asked upon notice, they must be placed upon the notice-paper. Therefore, I ask you, Mr Speaker, at your convenience, to investigate whether a practice is to be introduced under which an honourable, member may give privately an intimation to a Minister of his intention to ask him a question, and the Minister subsequently produce a typewritten statement from which he reads the answer, I submit to you, Mr Speaker, that if this practice is adopted by honourable members on both sides of the House, we might very well devote the whole of a sitting day to having lengthy answers read to very abstruse questions.",14
11,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. J. S. Rosevear). - On previous occasions I have dealt with the matter of replies by Ministers to questions without notice. There was a growing practice-and I have to admit that it was a growing practice before this Government took office-of Ministers making lengthy replies to questions asked the previous day. In view of that growing practice, 1 ruled that a Minister, in order to reply to a question asked the previous day or some period before, would have to obtain the permission of the House. In my long experience of this House, the practice has been for some honourable members to indicate to Ministers what they intended to'ask, and the Ministers would then give either a short or long reply. I do not think that there is anything to prevent an honourable member from doing that. In the Senate, it is the general custom to do so. It does not offend against any standing order. FLOUR. -' Mr ABBOTT - Has the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture seen a statement in the Sydney press this morning war Navy'. by the secretary of the New South Wales Elour Mill Owners Association that after the 19th May mills in New South Wales will drop from two shifts a day to one shift, that this will mean a reduction about 125,000 tons a year and that Great Britain will be the worse sufferer? As the statement indicates that this is due the failure of the Victorian transporreceive tation system, was anything done in respect of the question I asked in the House last year concerning the possibility of using hulks for the transport of wheat from southern ports to New South Wales, such hulks to be towed by oceanexpects going tugs?  statement in question; but it is true that, second due to transport difficulties, and the fact that there has been a severe drought New South Wales, it has become necesfuture sary to reduce the hours that worked in many New South Wales flour mills. The Commonwealth Government is paying a subsidy of Is. 6d. a bushel in respect of all wheat shifted interstate to New South Wales in order to assist in keeping mills in that State running, even at reduced hours. I emphasize that Great Britain will not suffer as the result of the reduction of output referred to by the honourable member, because any wheat not shifted from Victoria for milling in New South Wales will be milled in Victoria, in which State there is sufficient capacity to process it. With regard to the latter part of the honourable member's question, some inquiries were made regarding the practicability of bringing wheat to New South Wales in hulks. The information conveyed to me on that subject was that it would not be a practical proposition. ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY. RELEASES.",15
12,Mr DUTHIE,Unknown,"Can the Minister for the Navy supply the House with up-todate information as to the possibility of releasing .men who have served six years or more in the Royal Australian Navy who have applied for such release? Has the Government yet formulated its peacetime overall naval programme, especially in relation to the complement of the post",15
13,Mr RIORDAN,Unknown,"In reply to the first, part of the honourable member's question, which relates to permanent personnel of of the Navy, a large number of applications have been received from men desirous of being released. Such of the applications to as are based on compassionate grounds most sympathetic consideration. It will be appreciated, however, that the number of applications is so great that if all were granted the strength of the Navy would he very substantially depleted. By the end of this year the department to be in a position to indicate the possibilities of releasing those who are now seeking their discharge. As to the part of the honourable member's question,, as has already been indicated by the Minister for Defence, a statement in will be made to the House in the near indicating the post-war strength will be of the three service.?. FOOD FOR BRITAIN .",15
14,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"In view of reports that shipments of meat to Britain are a month behind schedule as a result of the Sydney waterfront dispute and that shipments of flour to Britain will cease shortly as an aftermath of the engineers' dispute in Melbourne, will the Prime Minister have prepared for presentation to the House a. statement setting out: 1. How many ships destined to carry food for Britain were delayed as a result of the Sydney waterfront dispute, what was their cargo capacity, and for what periods were their sailings delayed. 2. What effects will the engineers' dispute in Victoria have upon the shipment of flour and other food to Britaiu. 3. What delays to ships sailing to Britain have been caused in the last six months by labour shortages on Sydney wharfs?",16
15,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"Answer s to questions of that character involve a great amount of work and investigation. I am always reluctant to make promises that involve officials in weeks and weeks of work, particularly as honourable members complain about the number of people in the Public Service. However, I will with the Minister for Supply and Shipping examine the honourable gentleman's question to ascertain, whether it is possible to supply him with a reasonably short answer that does not require too much - investigation.",16
16,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"I refer to the serious plight of Great Britain in respect of meat supplies, and to a statement in today's press by the British Minister of Food, Mr Strachey, that the shortage in the second half of 1947 will be worse than it is now. In the light of this situation,' will the Minister for Commerce and. Agriculture give to the House the information which, so far, he has persistently refused to give, as to the nature of the scheme submitted to him by the chairman of the Australian Meat Board, which,, in a prepared statement to the House on the 1st May, he said that he had endorsed, and to publicize which he had authorized the expenditure of government funds? This scheme, it was stated, called for the co-operation of graziers and stock-owners. Will the Minister tell the House in what manner the co-operation of graziers and stock-owners is sought, and what is expected of them? He has refused to answer the question on each occasion on which it has been asked.",16
17,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! .,16
18,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"Will the Minister state whether the reason for his refusal is that there is no, practical scheme to announce; that the proposals under the scheme are of such an unfair and sectional character that he hesitates publicly to state them; or that he is so indifferent to the British people's food problems that he can treat with evasion and levity any request for information?",16
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! I have previously drawn the attention of the honourable gentleman to his use of language that is not permissible.,16
20,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"I shall conclude by asking whether the Minister is so indifferent to the British people's food problem that he can consistently refuse to give information?  different to the honourable member's stupidity. On a previous occasion, the nature of the answer that I .furnished to him was governed by my belief that he was fully aware of the scheme that had been propounded by the Australian Meat Board to assist Great Britain. The honourable gentleman knows full well that the graziers, backed by organizations of ex-servicemen in New South Wales, have, agreed to co-operate with the Australian Meat Board in a scheme whereby graziers may consign their stock to works indicated by the board, aud that stock is to be . earmarked specifically for consignment to Great Britain at the ruling export prices. I believe that the honourable member was fully aware of that fact when he facetiously asked the questions that he submitted to me quite recently.",16
21,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"The question that I am about to ask is prompted by today's report that there is a. serious lag in the shipment of meat and other foods to Great Britain. I understand that when the Stevedoring Industry Bill was before this House, the Government intimated to the Waterside Workers Federation that it would require certain assurances in regard to continuity of ""?ork and satisfactory performance of duty on the waterfront before the act would be proclaimed. I now ask the Attorney-General whether such assurances have been sought and obtained, and whether the act has been proclaimed to come into operation.",16
22,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"The act has been assented to, but has not. yet been proclaimed to come into operation. That is dependent, not upon any specific assurances being given, but upon arrangements being made in respect of the organization of the commission, and these will not be completed until arrangements for the new organization under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act can be carried into effect. NA BOARD.",17
23,Mr RANKIN,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL FILM,"Has the Minister for Information seen the statement of Mr. Mungo MACCallum in last night's Sydney Sm, that when the honourable gentleman stated in Parliament on the 5th March last that no report had been submitted to him by Mr Ralph Foster, formerly National Film Commissioner, he had been misinformed, as the report was made tp the board when he wa? its chairman? Has he seen Mr. Mungo MACCallum's further statement that if the Minister reads the report he will see that all is .far' from well with Australian propaganda film policy, that, Mr Foster never had the confidence of the officials in the Department of Information, and the fact that the Minister's advisers were keeping the report to themselves makes it certain that it was critical? In view of these comments, will the Minister obtain the report and make a statement to the House, provided he gets leave to do so?",17
24,Mr CALWELL,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL FILM,"If the honourable member can guarantee that I shall get leave, I shall consider his question, and make a statement to the House. statement - which I made, and I am not sure whether I made it to the House or outside it, is correct. Mr Foster did not make the report to me as Minister for Information, but he made a report to the National Film Board, of which I was at one time the chairman, but of which I have not been chairman for a considerable period. If the honourable member assures me that a report in my department is a very critical one, I shall certainly take early opportunity to examine it. There is nothing to - hide about the activities of the board. I have a very great regard for the work which Mr Foster did, and when he left the service of the board after being on loan from the Canadian Government for twelve months, I gave to him a very eulogistic letter on his work in Australia. SUGAR.  orable member for Moreton asked me a question of very great importance to sugar-growers. I have since had supplied to me some information of an exceedingly helpful character to those producers. I ask for leave to make a statement in reply to the question of the honourable member. OPPOSITION MEMBERS - No . Leave not granted. BANKING. NA GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENTALITIES. . Mr FRASER - In financial legislation passed by this Parliament some time ago power was given to require State governments, semi-governmental and local governmental bodies to transfer their accounts from private banking institutions. Will the Treasurer inform me whether the time has arrived when that power may be exercised, and if so whether any direction has heen given to the authorities mentioned to transfer their business from private banking institutions, and to place their money in the bank which is the people's bank?",17
25,Mr CHIFLEY,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"Unde r section 48 of the Banking Act power was given to the Treasurer to direct that private hanks should not accept business .from State governments, semi-governmental - instruThe mentalities and local-governing bodies. I have consulted, the State Premiers whose governments now bank with private banks, with the object of obtaining compliance with that section. Arrangements have been made for the Government of Victoria to transfer its business to the Commonwealth Bank. It has not been possible to arrange for the Government of New South Wales to do so, because sufficient staff and accommodation are not available. I have also intimated to about 200 local-governing bodies that, having regard to the powers in the section to which I have referred, they are not to conduct their banking with the private trading banks after the 1st August next.",17
26,Mr FADDEN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,Does that apply to the Abercrombie Shire?,18
27,Mr CHIFLEY,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"It does, and its account has already been transferred. The direction given does not indicate that the authorities mentioned must transfer their business to the Commonwealth Bank. Where there are'State banks with facilities available the business may be transferred to them. I have taken care, in consultation with the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, to ensure that wherever this direction has heen issued the Commonwealth Bank will be in a position to supply the needed banking facilities to enable the business to be transferred without inconvenience. ARMED FORCES. AUSTRALIANS INJAPAN : STATE ELECTORAL RIGHTS.",18
28,Mr BEALE,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"Yesterday I asked the Minister for the A r m y a question relating to press reports to the effect that soldiers from New South Wales who are in Japan were unable to vote at the recent, State elections. . The Minister, in what purported to be a reply to my question, said that it was a State matter and not a Commonwealth matter. I ' now ask the honourable gentleman whether the distribution of ballot-papers to New South Wales electors in Japan was not a matter for the officer in command in Japan, or some officer under his charge. If so, will the Minister now tell the House why ballot-papers were not distributed to the troops who were entitled to receive them?",18
29,Mr CHAMBERS,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"Yesterday I in formed the honourable member that it was the responsibility of the Government of New South Wales to arrange for troops from New South Wales who were in Japan to record their votes; it was not a Commonwealth responsibility. assure the honourable member that if the Government of New South Wales had arranged for the ballot-papers to be forwarded to British Commonwealth Occupation Forces the officer in command would have, seen that they were distributed.",18
30,Mr BEALE,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,Were they sent to him?,18
31,Mr CHAMBERS,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"I am not in a position to say whether they were or were not. I suggest that the honourable member should approach the member of the State Parliament who represents his district and ask him to ascertain whether the Government of New South Wales forwarded the ballot papers or not. It was not the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government to do so; it had nothing to do ..with the forwarding of the papers. If the honourable member can assure me that the papers were forwarded to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, I shall inquire as to why they were not distributed. HOUSING. Mrs . BLACKBURN - Numerous representations having been made to me on the subject, I ask the Minister for Works and Housing whether investigations have been made as to the suitability of Dampney concrete for home-building? Can the claims in respect of durability and low cost of production be substantiated ? Has a demonstration cottage been erected for public inspection, as has been the case with other examples of modern home-building recently?",18
32,Mr LEMMON,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"The Dampney form of construction. has been examined by officers of my department in the experimental building station at Ryde, New South Wales. Some time ago, I requested the experimental engineers to make this examination. They examined certain homes that had been built by Mr . Dampney, or under his direction and with his system, which is a system of concrete slabs. There are many other systems of concrete slab production. In the first - houses examined, it was considered that there were some faults in the form of construction which could have been avoided had a different code of practice been followed. Therefore, I requested the exI perimental station to d r a ft a code of construction which might assist Mr . Dampney and his form of construction. That code was drafted. About ten days ago. I sent a copy of it to the Warringah Shire Council, in which Mr Dampney now desires to build a home under it. I have asked the council to issue to him u building permit, if it can see fit to do in order that construction may be undertaken. The costs were submitted to me on a square basis, and the construction appeared to be extremely cheap. However, I do not believe that the house could be built so cheaply if the internal fittings were the same as are used in other forms of construction, and the house were built to the. same specifications. I have arranged that, if Mr Dampney proceeds with the construction of this house, a close check shall be kept on costs, in order to determine whether his construction is better than other forms. If it is, we shall he interested in it. TRADE WITH JAPAN.",18
33,Mr DUTHIE,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"In view of the report that the United States of America is senddiscuss ing a trade delegation to Japan, and is thus ""getting in on the ground floor"" in regard to future trade with that country, I ask .the Prime Minister whether his Government intends to likewise in the near future?",19
34,Mr CHIFLEY,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"Alread y a delegation from Australia is in Japan, and its quiries will concern largely textiles and games ? piecegoods. We have 'kept very closely in touch with trade developments considered. in Japan, and have had representatives there dealing with wool sales through the military organization. It is intended to keep closely in touch with all developments in regard to the supply of materials or commodities from this country which may be urgently needed there, as well as in regard to obtaining from that country goods that may be urgently needed here. I assure the honourable member that all steps have been taken to keep the Governof ment fully apprised of the possibilities. WAR GRATUITY.",19
35,Mr SHEEHAN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,Will the Minister for the Army say whether it is true that many ex-servicemen have applied for advance payment of their war gratuity? T it true that there are no regulations c governing the payment of war gratuity that would enable payments to be made ported ? even for the purpose of preventing the loss of an ex-serviceman's business? the Minister consider the inclusion of such a provision in the regulations?,19
36,Mr CHAMBERS,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"The War Gratuity so, Act provides for the making of hardship payments in certain cases.",19
37,Mr SHEEHAN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,Onl y in the case of sickness.,19
38,Mr CHAMBERS,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"I think the honourable member will realise that the conditions governing payments were agreed upon and incorporated in the act in the light of the experience gained in the payment of gratuity after World War I . I receive mauy requests for the early payment of gratuity, so that the money may be used for business purposes. We know that many returned soldiers from World War I . lost the whole of their gratuities by making bad business investments, and that, is why the conditions have been made fairly strict now. However, I shall look into the matter, and it with my colleagues in Cabinet. OLYMPIC GAMES.",19
39,Mr TURNBULL,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,Will the Prime do Minister consider a proposal that the Commonwealth Government should make a gift of money to assist the representaintion of Australia at the next Olympic,19
40,Mr CHIFLEY,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,The matter will be COMMONWEALTH LITERARY -. FUND. FORMAL MOTION FOR ADJOURNMENT.,19
41,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"Hon. J. S. Rosevear). - I have received from the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) an intimation that he desires to move the. adjournment of the House for the purpose discussing a definite matter of urgent, public importance, namelyThe extent to which the Commonwealth Literary Fund is being used to subsidize Communists and former Communists in the production of Australian literature.",19
42,Sir EARLE PAGE,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,Cowper) [3.13] I move That the House do now adjourn.,19
43,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"Is the motion supFine honourable members having risen Will in. support of the motion,",19
44,Sir EARLE PAGE,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"I have moved the adjournment of the House for purpose of discussing a definite matter urgent public importance, namely, "" extent to which the Commonwealth Literary Eund is being used to subsidize Communists and former Communists the production of Australian literature"". When I learned that the honourable ber for Parkes (Mr Haylen) must have known the facts regarding the career Mr Bawling at the time when he made an unwarranted attack on me, I asked myself why he was seeking to make such a divershould sion-wh y he was trying to draw a herring across the trail. I asked myself whether this member of: the advisory co""mmittee of the Commonwealth Literary Fund was trying to cover up something in connection with its activioverhaul ties. Then, when the Minister for Transmember port (Mr Ward) refused me the timethe honoured right to make a personal explanation in reply to gross personal misrepresentation, I became convinced that there was something which the vernment was trying to hide. I have always believed, and I still believe, the Commonwealth Literary Fund is good thing, but I was of the opinion its function was to assist Australian authors of talent. I assumed that the controllers of the fund would inform themselves regarding the record and character of an author whom it was proposed to assist from a fund profull vided by the public, and particularly committee. that they . would assure themselves that his - work was free from bias I believed that assistance would be given to men and women whose work was of an extreme character. Since the attack upon me by the honor Mr. able member for Parkes, I have examined the nature of the control of the Commonauthorities wealth Literary Fund, and I have learned that no safeguards exist to ensure a bsence of bias in the work of those the fund is used to assist. The fund not established by statute. It depends on an annual appropriation hy the Parliagraphy, ment. It seems to be somewhat like Melchizedec-it had neither father nor mother, and it has neither beginning nor end. There is an advisory committee which is supposed to. inquire into the qualifications of a candidate for assisMitehe'lil tance, and to make recommendations to the those .authorized to approve or disof approve the application. For the memThe bers of this board I have the greatest respect. They are the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), the in Prime Ministei' (Mr Chifley) and the Leader of the-Opposition (Mr Menzies). memItis as good a body, as could be appointed, but as its decisions depend of largely upon the recommendations made to it by the advisory committee, it is imperative that those recommendations be unbiased, and should state the red facts of the case. What can happen under the present system has been.exemplified in the case of Mr Rawling, and it is evident that there is urgent need to the system. The honourable for Parkes, who is a member of advisory committee, is on the horns of a dilemma as the result of his attack on me the other day. Either he knew the history of Mr Rawling at the time he Goadvised the board regarding the making of a grant-in which case he was guilty that of making a had recommendation, and a also of making a dishonest attack upon that me-o r he had not made full inquiries regarding Mr Rawling, and had therefore been remiss in his duty. In either case he has shown himself to be unfit to be a member of the advisory committee. This incident emphasized the. need for a inquiry into the work of the advisory - I come now to the particular case not under review. As an admirer of the poetry of Charles Harpur, I was interested in his biography. I knew that Cecil Salier and Dr Robinson, of the Queensland University, were recognized . on the life of Harpur, and had done years of study ""and much writing an on his works. Therefore, when Mr. whom Rawling was appointed by the adis visory committee of the Commonwealth Literary Fund to write Harpur's bioI made inquiries at the Mitchell Library for information regarding Rawling, so that I might learn why he had been chosen in preference to Mr Salier or Dr Robinson. The Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) is, I believe, president of the Library, so he is well aware that under the State law, this library receives copies of all books published in Kew South Wales, and rarely misses buying those published in other States. It keeps an index of all articles, as well as hooks brought to it, on Australian subjects. In the Mitchell Library there is no - evidence that Mr Rawling ever wrote a single article on Charles Harpur. There is an extensive index in the library and it is the only place in Australia where .n proper examination of Harpur's works can be made. I found that there was no record of Mr Rawling ever having consulted the library officials in relation Harpur's works. My inquiries there revealed that the only works written by . Rawling were these: Hitler's Threat to Peace- a sixteen-page pamphlet printed ten years ago' for the Friends of the Soviet Union, and the Front Against War and Fascism, a body with headquarters in Moscow. It was concerned more with opposing defence in Australia that with Hitler. Speakers' Notes for Lhe Communist Party (193S) on Conscription. This was printed by Forward Press, a printing business then owned by the Central Committee of the Communist party, through a nominee, and taken over in 1940 by the Government when the papers which it printed, were suppressed. In this document it was suggested that there was no danger from Japan and that the real objective of those who demanded - compulsory military training was to secure trained forces to aid the Imperialist aggressors of Britain to attack Russia. Another publication was Who Owns AvjitvaliaV This was a 64-page pamphlet of Communist propaganda directed against big Australian concerns, particularly those such as the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, which assisted the defence of Australia to a material degree. It was part of the propaganda by which the Communists sought before the war to assure that if a crisis came this country would be defenceless. It was published - by Modern Publishers, the official munist publishing house, and printed by the Forward Press, the Communist honourable party's official printer. There was also History of the Australian People, written from the Communist angle, and published for in parts by Modern Publishers, an official ' Communist publishing house, and printed by Forward Press, the official Communist press. It consisted of a series of pamphlets, and carried on its covers advertiseof all ments for other Communist publications. It gave a Communist twist to the whole of our early history. In addition, Mr. Rawling wrote various articles in the Communist Review, to which he was a regular contributor every month until just before it was suppressed in 1940. He seems to have been the originator of the idea which led' to the Young Communist party changing its name to Eureka to League of Youth. These works represent the whole literary output of Mr. Rawling, as recorded in the Mitchell Library. His qualifications as an interpreter of the life of an Australian poet are entirely negative, since, for twenty years, he has been steeped in the viewpoint of Russian Communism. ' On the 26th March, 1947, 1 accordingly asked the Prime Minister a series of questions. I ask honourable members to note carefully their wording, because they constitute a. contradiction of everything that has been said about me in regard to this matter. The questions wereW ill the Prime Minister inform me whether Mr J. M . Bawling has been granted a fellowship valued at £400 by the Commonwealth Literary Fund, to write the life of the poet Charles Harpur? Is this Mr Bawling the same gentleman who was chief publicity officer of the Communist party for some years, and who wrote"" the Communist party's official history of Australia, which was published by the official Communist publishing house? What qualifications does Mr Bawling possess to write the life of Charles Harpur? Are his qualifications superior to those of recognized authorities on the poet who have no association with the Communist party? . Will the right honourable gentleman lay upon the table of the House all recommendations, reports and papers relating to the granting to Mr Bawling of this fellowship? It is clear that my question referred to Mr Rawling's publicity work in the past tense, as I specifically used the words ""was chief publicity officer . . . for some years, and who wrote . . ."" In Comreply, the Prime Minister saidOffhand, I am not able to give the r is h t gentleman all the information that A he seeks. I remember that the name of Mr . Bawling was associated with an application a fellowship, .but I am not able to recall whether the fellowship was granted to him. I do not know whether I can promise, at this stage, to lay all the relevant papers upon the table of the House, but I shall.ensure that the right honourable gentleman is fully informed regarding the matter. On the ISth April, 1947,- I received an undated letter from the Prime Minister, enclosing a copy of a communication dated the 12th April, 1947, which he had received from Mr J. M . Rawling. It will be recalled that on Tuesday asked the right honourable gentleman's permission to read it. It reads as folme lows :I wisli to refer to the question asked me by Sir Ksirle Page on March 20, and state that there is not an atom of truth in the allegations made by him. I was never "" Chief publicity officer of the Communist p a r t y "" and I have hot written ""the official history of the p a r t y "". On the evidence of his books and literary activities this, of course, was a quibble. facts I had gleaned, Mr Raw-ling's letter continuedThere were many men of my generation served in the 1014-18 war and were disillusioned in the years that followed, became enthused about the Russian Revolution and saw some hope for the world therein. were disillusioned there, too, good company. But what I wrote for the Communist party was mainly what X could still stand by. It took two forms1. Agitation for collective security, 11)35-30, and 2. Australian historical articles. In regard to the Communist party, I think that, if it were asked, it would designate me as its number 1 enemy. I have spoken over the national network and have published numerous newspaper articles against that party. For I regard it as democracy's greatest enemy and a dire threat to the Labour movement. I should be grateful if , in answering Sir Earle Page's questions, you would not dwell nn niy association with the Communist party, but be content to deny his allegations. I ask this because I and mine have suffered enough because of that association and feel that any further publicity will militate against my being employed again as a teacher in a G.P.S. after expiry of my fellowship. As to my qualifications to write a life of Charles Harpur-the y are these: I specialized in history for my B.A. at Sydney University; I gained my M.A. in Australian history for a Life of I ) . IT. Deneihy and I have written and published n History of Australia to 1S32 in a volume of 480 pages. In an undated letter to me, w h i c h T received on the IS t h A p r i l last, the P Minister wroteIn the circumstances explained Bawling I think you will agree that it will lie unnecessary to reply at length to the stateSir Earle Page. ments made in your question. I have therefore prepared a reply in the following terms:'' I have made inquiries in connection with this matter and am advised by Mr. Rawling that he is not a member of the Communist party and that, on the contrary, he is an active opponent of that party "". In view of the appeal in Mr Eawling's I letter to the Prime Minister, I replied thanking him for his courtesy in sending the letter and was prepared to let the matter of Mr Rawling's past communisabout tic activities drop, as the statement to referred simply to the present position of Mr Rawling indicating that he was not now a member of the Communist party. In view of the attitude of the Prime Minister, and of the contents of Mr. Rawling's letter, a copy of which the Prime Minister had sent me, and the I was appalled at the attack made on me, in my absence who from the House, by the honourable memwho ber for Parkes, who is a member of the advisory committee of the Commonwealth We Literary Fund. The honourable member but I am in for Parkes saidThe right honourable member for Cowper a? keel a question concerning Mr J. M . Bawling. He alleged that Mr Rawling, who had been awarded a literary fellowship by the Commonwealth Government, was a member of the Communist party. He had to use the past tense, because I did. He asked: Tn view of the scandalous case of character assassination by the right honourable member for Cowper, if any steps can be taken to protect citizens from the savagery of vicious misstatements made on hearsay by the right honourable member for Cowjjer. My questions were not based on hearsay, but on the official records of the Mitchell Library, which I have since checked at the National Library, and Mr Rawling himself admits his past connection with the Communist party in his letter to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister replied to him on the 1st May, 1947, stating that he was aware that Rawling had been awarded a scholarship and that, in a question directed to himThe right honourable member for Cowper at Joust insinuated, if he did not directly say. that Mr Rawlins was a Communist or assor i m e ciated with the Communist party. The Prime Minister's Department made inquiries. It reported that, on the evidence available, there by Mr was no justification for the right honourable member's statements. That statement has also been denied by Mr Bawling. 1 made no insinuations. I asked several questions. Let us look at my questions and Mr Rawling's letter and askedis this Mr Rawling the same gentleman who was chief publicity officer of the Communist party for some years, and who wrote the Communist party's official history of Australia, which was published by the official Communist publishing house? Mr Rawling's letter, and records of Mitchell Library show that it is the same Air. Rawling. My question makes no sugparty gestion that Mir. Rawling is still a Comhis ways. munist. I asked was he the chief pubnothing licity officer of the Communist party some years, whowrote the Communist party's official history of Australia, which was published by the official Communist publishing house. If he was not the he was the most prominent publicity officer of that party. His history tralia has a definite Communist twist, and was published by the official Comtant munist, publishing house. How then, i T ask a question which is substantially true, am I assassinating any man's character? And, how can I be making ""vicious misstatements made on heartralian say "" when I am quoting the official cords of the Mitchell Library, which substantiated by Mr Rawling's letter? Those records and Mr Rawling's letter prove the substance of my statement. The honourable member for Parkes pirants accused me of "" assassination of characFellowships ter "" and "" vicious misstatements made hearsay"". As they are statements of fact, how then can he justify the appointto ment of Mr Rawling to this fellowship if he holds these views on communism? [Extension of time granted.'] Why, also, in view of Mr Rawling's expressed wish that the matter should be left in abeyance, and my willingness 30 after the pathetic appeal by Mr. Rawling in his letter to the Prime MinCowper ister, does the honourable member drag this matter up, in my absence from the HOUSP, two days before the elections in New South Wales and' Queensland? Whatever I say inside this chamber am prepared to say outside. I am willing to say outside this chamber what I said about Mr Rawling. But I dare the honwhich orable member for Parkes to repeat side what he said about me. . I would issue a writ for defamation within five record. I minutes of his doing so. This narrative proves that, first of all, the Prime Minister has not answered my questions. He has answered questions of his own as to whether Mr Rawling is, or is not, a member of the Communist, party. He does not admit publicly what the Mr Rawling has told him-that he was the publicity officer of the Communist and subsequently saw the error of The Prime - Minister says about the qualifications of Mr. for Rawling as compared with those of men like Mr C. W. Salier, or Dr Robinson. But the establishment of my bona fides is a small matter beside the policy of the chief, advisory committee of the Commonwealth Literary Fund as to the conditions of Auson which, and to whom, fellowships should be bestowed. This may be imporfor the future of Australia. Comf munism is now seen by every thoughtful person of all parties as the cancerous growth that is destroying our industrial life, impeding our production in Ausaud doing its utmost to derestroy the British Empire. No public are funds should be spent that could even be suspected of fostering subtle sources of Communist propaganda. If , however, the past records of all as for Commonwealth Literary Fund are treated in this light on fashion-as in this case where the facts are beyond dispute and have been brought light merely by chance-it is evident that a full inquiry and overhaul of the whole system of awarding such fellowships should be made to prevent a repetition. ' Br. EVATT (Barton-Attorney-Genera l to do and Minister for External Affairs) [3.36] - The right honourable member for (Sir Earle Page) suggested that the origin of the Commonwealth Literary Fund is uncertain, but it was established in 190S by Mr Deakin and has been continued ever since. In 1939, when the . grant was only £400 a year, - the right I honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) suggested a further development of Australian literature and a means by Australian authors should be enoutcouraged. The Prime Minister at that time was the late 'MY. Lyons, who readily acceded to the proposal, and a committee was established, consisting of himself, the then Leader of the Opposition, the late Mr Curtin, and the right honourable member for Yarra, who made the suggestion in the House. The scheme has continued in its present form since then. I shall refer in a. moment to the character of the work done by the Commonwealth Literary Eund. In my opinion, its ' achievements represent a great contribution to the encouragement of Australian letters. The record of the fellowships granted is excellent. I will deal separately with the one referred to hy the right honourable member for Cowper. The right honourable member ought to know the facts, because, after - the right honourable member for Kooyong (Mr . ' Menzies) succeeded Mr Lyons as Prime Minister in 1939, he wrote to the right honourable member for, Cowper, who was then Leader o.f the Australian Country party, pointing out that up till, that time the AustralianCountry party had not functioned independently of the United Australia party, and invitin g him to nominate a representative of the Australian Country party to serve on the committee. . 1I have read letter. Apparently nothing was done to comply with ' that request. fellowship granted number no fewer than 33, and only one has been criticized by the right honourable member for Cowper.",20

None of them deals with politics or political propaganda of any kind, except, perhaps, the biography of statesmen in the early days of federation. They are literary in character, and cover all phases of literary activity. I had supposed, and until today it had been thought, that all parties were in favour of this plan, and were carrying it out for the encouragement of Australian authors. I desire now to deal with the references .to Mr Rawling. The right honourable member for Cowper stated accurately the question which he had asked in the .House, namely, was Mr Rawling a publicit y officer of, or was he otherwise associated with the Oommunist party? The fact is that he had been associated with it - There is no question of that. But the manner of his leaving the Communist party was a matter of such public, notoriety during the early stages of the n 1940, to be exact-that the slightest inquiry would have revealed to the right honourable gentleman the fact that, Gay at or about that time Soviet Russia attacked Finland, Mr Rawling broke in Hew with the Communist party. From that n time to the present day he has been one of its most bitter critics. I believe that it is fair to say that the Communistl party would regard Mr Rawling as its No. 1 enemy.",24
47,Mr MCBRTDE,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,It is what he says that,25
48,Dr EVATT,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"It is what he says now. In 1940 Mr Rawling made a broadcast over the national stations giving the reasons why he considered that he should dissociate himself from the Communist party and its war policy. Ever since Mr Rawling has been an active opponent of the Communist party. The omission of that fact from the right honourable gentleman's question was calculated to cause very .irave in j u r y to Mr Rawling, who served in World War I . In his letter to the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley), he stated that he had been sympathetic with the experiment of Soviet Russia, had joined the Oommunist party and had been active in it. All that is correct. Mr Rawling also wrote certain material to which the right honourable gentleman has referred. Then, in May, 1940, he made a complete break with the Communist party, not privately or by resigning from it, but as the result of an open public controversy in which his articles appeared in leading metropolitan newspapers, probably throughout Australia and certainly in New South Wales. That raises the very important question which, after all, is the only point that does from the subject associated with the motion submitted by the right honourable member for Cowper. Should the fact that a person has strong political views, and has been a member of the Communist party, act as a perpetual bar against his being qualified to write on some aspect of Australian literature and history?",25
49,Mr FADDEN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"Yes , if other competent authors are available.",26
50,Dr EVATT,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"It is a question, then, of proving whether other qualified authors are available. That was not the contention of the right honourable member for Cowper.",26
51,Mr FADDEN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,It was. Mr Rawling was preferred to other authors.,26
52,Dr EVATT,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"The contention which the right honourable member for Cowper submitted is that Mr Rawling should be disqualified. If no other authors are available, and he is chosen, the same result is reached. The object of Commonwealth assistance to Australian authors is not to encourage political propaganda, but to foster good literature, and reward literary .merit. If the House agrees that that is the object of the fund, I contend that.the political views of the author do not and should not enter into the matter. Imagine what kind of a standard would have to apply if, in determining whether the fund should assist authors in Australia, we were obliged to make a preliminary investigation of the political views, past and present, of every candidate! Apply that to what is the chief glory of England-that is its literature! Let us look back at the history of English literature, and at the great procession of poets and authors who have made the name of English literature famou; throughout the world, and apply a political test to them! The right honourable gentleman is carrying this matter further than I have ever heard it carried before. The book which Mr Rawling is to write is not a Communist publication, and will not have a seditious or subversive tendency. The man who is writing it has chosen a literary subject, namely, the life of the Australian-born poet, Charles Harpur. Is this author to be excluded from competing for a felarise lowship on such .a subject? The right honourable gentleman's contention cannot be accepted as a principle. It is completely wrong. One has only to refer to great names in English literatureShelley, Byron, Wordsworth, Southey, Coleridge, Robert Burns, the great Scottish poet, and William Blake, and ask oneself, "" If a literary fund had been in existence in their day how would they have scaled the first barrier?"" Tbese great men of genius, whom every body acknowledges today, wrote in the early portion of their careers under the influence of the Trench Revolution, and were somewhat sympathetic towards it. Wordsworth and Southey later became Poet Laureates of Britain. We cannot apply this rule of exclusion to people simply as persons. Yet that is what the right honourable member for Cowper is attempting to do. He admitted that Mr Rawling is not writing on the subject of communism, or present' political trends. There is nothing political in the biography of Charles Harpur. Why, then, should Mr Rawling be disqualified? If literary merit is to be encouraged, it should be encouraged as literature and not as propaganda. Political opinions have nothing to do with the matter. It would be different if we ""were considering a political work. That might be a relevant factor. When he makes, as a test of literary merit, conformity to political or social stand-points the right honourable gentleman is adopting the policy of the Hitler regime. That was the approach of the Nazi propagandists to this problem. On the 10th May, 1933, the Nazis decided to show that a new regime had been introduced into Germany under Hitle r and Goebbels. The occasion was celebrated by the burning of the books of 160 authors. The subject matter of the books did not mat'.er; the Nazis who burnt them had probably never read any of them. But the books had been written by people who, as persons, were regarded as antipathetic to the Nazi regime. They in cluded some of the greatest German poets, such as Heine, and their works were burnt in a bonfire. One commentator wrote at the time- And as the ingenious ceremonies wore on hour after hour, before a crowd of fortythousand celebrants, the world outside may well have sensed that a new spirit, and a new age, had begun for Germany, an age of Brown Darkness . . . The .request for information by the right honourable, member has nothing whatever to do with this point. The fund is of a non-party character. If the political views of candidates are to be considered in relation to authorship, we shall have a new form of censorship which would be as intolerable as any the world has ever known. The works in the list to which I have referred include biographies of the Australian writers by Tom Collins, works by Ernestine Hill , Marjorie Clark, Marjorie Barnard and others. The new rule suggested by the right honourable member for Cowper, to the effect that the personal political opinions of applicants should be taken into account when considering the granting of fellowships, and not their purely literary work, would be so intolerable that I cannot believe that the right honourable gentleman himself would wish to see it applied. Sir Earle Page interjecting,",26
53,Dr EVATT,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"I assure the right honourable gentleman that the honourable member for Parkes is well able to look after himself. What the right honourable member had to say in derogation of Mr . Rawling was, in effect, that he had been a Communist, but it has also been fair l y and openly stated that he had broken with the Communist party publicly in circumstances in which the hatred of the Communists was being visited upon him. Mr Rawling, I understand, is carrying .on his work as a school teacher. He is a distinguished graduate of an Australian university, and has written historical works. Apparently he has excellent qualifications for a fellowship. He has been chosen to write the life of Charles Harpur. Sir Earle Page interjecting,",27
54,Dr EVATT,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"It is obvious that the right honourable member has changed his ground. The point now being advanced is not the issue that was raised between the right honourable member and the honourable member for Parkes. It was alleged, first, that Mr Rawling was a Communist, had engaged in. Communist propaganda, and had written Communist articles, and that, therefore, he was debarred from writin g a work of any value to Australia. I suggest to the House that there is no substance in that contention. If honourable members will examine the records of the authors and poets, of this country they will discover that very few of them could successfully withstand the application of such a test: Henry Lawson was associated with Australian workers and Australian unions in his early lif e and he wrote for the Australian Worker. Practically all the early poets who contributed to the Bulletin had strong radical tendencies, and some of them were even republican in their outlook at certain stages.",27
55,Mr LANG,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,They were all Australians.,27
56,Dr EVATT,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"That is so, and Mr . Rawling is an Australian, as far as I know. My point, at the moment, is that the test that has been proposed by the right honourable member for Cowper would have, proved fatal even to Australian writers like Henry Lawson, and some of the best of our writers of days gone by.",27
57,Mr WHITE,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,That is nonsense.,27
58,Dr EVATT,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"The honourable member for Balaclava shows, by his interjection, his incapacity for analysis. The point is whether a man's political views shall, or shall not, be taken into consideration, and in certain circumstances be regarded as disqualification for writin g on literary subjects insofar as' the Commonwealth Literary Fund is concerned. The answer to that proposal must surely be clear' to everybody. No one could really justify such a rule. A perusal.by able members of the list of fellowships that have been granted, and of the books and authors in respect cf which help been given, will reveal that a very good job has been done. I hope that honorin able members will endorse that view.",27
59,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"Barker) | 3.55] - I was deeply interested in reply of the Attorney-Gene nil (Dr Evatt) to the concise and incontrovertible statements of the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page). The Attorney-General has travelled all round the question. He reminded me of a for years ago? late member of the South Australian Parliament, who said of a fellow Irishman. "" The honourable member round the truth for an hour and and did not touch it once "". That is position in which the Attorney-General ' finds himself. One objection that honorin able members pf the Opposition the present method of administering Commonwealth Literary Fund, is that seems to provide a nursing home for munists. Unless a man is ""red or pretty pink "", he has not much chance of able consideration. I am not altogether unaware of what has been going on connection with this fund for some time past. I asked a question about it as ago as the 26th March, 1946. In my we have reached a stage in the history the fund when there should be a public showdown, so that we may know exactly what is going on. There certainly has been a change lately in the advisory committee ' of the fund. I understand that the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen) is a comparatively recent barred. addition to the committee. If the views that that, honourable gentleman expresses in this House- I do not know anything about his literary qualifications-be taken as a criterion, I should say that there will be a confirmation of the policy that, only the ""reds and pinks will get go "". This fund is not being used today for the purpose for which the right honpeople orable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) worked in 1939 when that right honorgard able gentleman took a_ very important part in its development and adminisof tration. The fund is undoubtedly being used today for other than honorits original purpose. I know of persons receiving grants from the fund in relation to the publishing of books has which have consisted, in the main, of reprinted articles which were published, the press in Sydney years ago and paid for. I ask the Attorney-General whether it is not a fact that the purpose of the fund is to encourage people to write the uriginal matter, particularly on Australian subjects. Does the Attorney General consider that the giving of fellowships is justified when the books produced consist chiefly of reprinted articles which were published and paid . Dr. EVATT - Will the honourable gentletalked all man name the books? a half . Mr Archie CAMERON - I can do the so, but T will not do it publicly at this - stage. I asked a question, upon' notice, the House quite a long time ago, about have to a well-known person named Jean the Devaney. I do not think that it will be it denied that she was a member of the ComCommunist party. Yet, in the height of the war, when members of this Parliafavorment could not enter certain areas in Queensland, because they were defence in areas, this woman was given a fellowship and permitted to enter those areas, long where some of the most secret of our view ' defence measures were being applied, of allegedly for the purpose of writing a book on how people reacted under wartime conditions. The Attorney-General knows how they reacted in the electoral Division of Capricornia, for that was disclosed at the last general elections.",28
60,Mr RANKIN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,He r foul book was,28
61,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"I should expect it to be. There is another case that I could go into, but I will not do so now. The state of affairs which has been reached in connection with the Commona wealth Literary Fund is such that there should be a public inquiry at which would be obliged to give evidenceupon oath, and would be protected in reto their evidence. Nothing else will satisfy me. The machinations of somethose who have been helped by this fund should be brought' to light. I have been dealing with this matter behind the scenes at least since March, 1946. I am not interested in .the case of Rawling.' If this man has "" seen the l i g h t ' ' , as the Attorney-General has suggested, there has been a lapse of seven years in which he has not produced one pamphlet to put in the Mitchell Library in contradiction of the stuff that he wrote previously. When a man finds that he has been following a wrong principle for a number of years and has been politir-ally converted, one naturally expects that, having "" seen the l i g h t "" , he will be prepared to give his testimony in writing, and let it go . on record alongside the misleading statements which he formerly made. This man has not done that. His good f a it h can be tested by his failure to do so. The Attorney General has asked whether the political views of an author should be taken into consideration. The Australian taxpayer has a very strong objection to providing money for the subsidizing of communism. [ contend that the views of a man who. writes a story on the life of Charles Harpur or anybody else will be coloured by whether he is a Communist or a tory, or has any other background. The Attorney-General has written a work entitled Labour Leader. He gave me a copy of it , for which I thank him. Can it be said that the right honourable gentleman would have described the l if e of Holman in the terms that he has used in that work had he'not been a Labour man? Would the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) or the honourable member for Kew England (Mr Abbott) take the same view of Holman's life as has been taken by the Attorney-General? Would the honourable, member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull ) or the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Adermann), if they became authors and wrote The History of the B u m Rebellion, adopt the same attitude towards it as has been adopted by the Attorney-General ? It has been proved up to the hilt that immediately a man becomes an author his views of another man, whether that man be associated with literature, politics; science, industry or anything else, are coloured by that man's political outlook. My objection is, that the Commonwealth - Literary Fund is being used in too many instances by men who, if not - ed or pink, aire at any rate "" fellow travellers "".  judges of the Arbitration Court whom the honourable gentleman's party appointed <",28
62,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"I am not arguing that for the moment. If the honourable gentleman cares to engage in this debate, he can say his piece in thespitfire fashion that he usually adopts.. He ought to have been a fighter pilot. Something has been said during the debate about the burning of books. I believe that the Attorney-General referred! to that matter. There have been notorious instances of the burning of books.' Adolf Hitler did not start the practice. The Attorney-General is sufficiently an historian to know that a good part of the great library of Alexandria was burned by Julius Caesar, and the rest of it by the first Mohammedan conqueror, who took the view- a very political viewthat if anything in - the Alexandria Library was in conflict with the Koran it was dangerous, and if any of it was in agreement with the Koran it was superfluous. On that point, I am giving to the Attorney-General a first-class cue as to the line that should be taken when it comes to an argument concerning dominion governors: There is no view except that of the man in authority. I close on this note: An y man can take a part in the writin g of articles. He can be a litterateur. He can write a play on' Eureka, or a work on the life of Charles Harpur;. but if his political views are such as have been disclosed today by the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page)-and disclosed under pressure, I may state-the n that man has to remember what Longfellow wrote about ""footprints on the sands of time "" . Also, he has to remove those footprints, those stains, by proving his loyalty to the new cause which he has taken up. In this instance, such proof has not been furnished.",29
63,Mr HAYLEN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,Parkes) [ 4 . 5 ] - It is a very sad spectacle indeed to see Australian literature being dragged through the cow-yards of the Australian Country party.,29
64,Unknown,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"Opposition members interjecting, - Mr SPEAKER - Order ! There is not going to be any "" rough house "" here today. Each speaker has been accorded fair treatment, and has been heard in silence. Strong language has been used on both sides of the House. Any honourable member who attempts to cause disorder will be named.",29
65,Mr HAYLEN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"This sudden concern of members of the Australian Country party for Australian literature, is amazing. According to the statement of the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt), who is a literary figure in this country and a man of unimpeachable veracity, the Australian Country party was invited to assist us to build up an Australian literature. The then Prime Minister appointed Mr Thorby. I should not suggest that that gentleman had a very true appreciation of literature. He attended one meeting of the Commonwealth Literary Fund, but in the last eight years no member of the Australian Country party has attended the meetings. The statements of the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) were too bucolic for me quite fully grasp. By some devious means he is attempting to destroy that which we have built up tortuously-a n appreciation Australian literature, and encouragement list of Australian writers. I could have understood his enthusiasm had the subwealth ject under discussion been the payment of a subsidy on the production of butter fat, I doubt whether he has read' thing except the results of butter fat tests as in the Grafton Examiner, or his speeches in Hansard. Yet he puts self forward as a literary authority! want to "" test the credibility of ness "" in regard to Australian literature. After eight years of abstention by himself and his party from any attempt to assist Australian literature, he has made statement in this House about an author and has asked a question concerning that man's political beliefs. Although he claimed that what I had done was scandaus lous, I stand by it, because the whole the Atlantic Charter, including the four freedoms, has been built round the right of freedom 'of expression. This author has an expression to make, and he is entitled to make it. The discussion must not be dragged down to the cow-yard level. If the right honourable member for Cowper had been honest, he would not have waited for a radio audience before which to make his answer. Yesterday, I asked him to speak on the motion for the adjournment of the House. Although I told the Whip of his party that I intended to mention the matter in the course of my remarks in another debate, he deferred his reply until he had a radio audience. That is characteristic of the sanctimonious humbug and hypocrisy with which he decks nearly every statement that he makes in this House. The classical example is his contributions to the subject of food for Britain. This man, who is known as "" the tragic Treasurer "", could not, while Treasurer, cause two and two to make four; yet, when the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) had announced to his Cabinet the proposal to make a gift of £25,000,000 to Great Britain, he quickly added that up, and made a story of it to suit himself politic-ally, and brought the matter into the field of party politics. The Attorney-General has established that the man whose name has been mento tioned, although a former Communist, has not for some years written a Communist tract. The right honourable gentleof man has also established that the of persons who have been awarded fellowships by the CommonLiterary Fund contains the names of many famous Australians, and that there has not been one attempt at political anypropaganda, in the hooks published a result of the fellowships own granted hy that fund. The . righthimhonorable member for Cowper paid I a great tribute to the Prime Minister, the witthe Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) and the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), and deservedly so; but he then commenced to cast slurs a on and to smear the members of the advisory committee-a n old Communist trick. Leaving me out of account, because I am a political opponent of his, let have a look at the personnel associated of with the fund. Would the right honourable gentleman suggest that Professor Osborne, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Melbourne, is a Communist, that he is interested in the production of Communist tracts, and to that end is using funds of the Commonwealth Government? Would he suggest that the Librarian of the National Library, Mr Binns, is a Communist? Would be suggest that Dr Mackaness, of Sydney, who I am sure would not mind being called a tory, would be a Communist, and would spend the whole of his time and voluntary effort in encouraging the writing of Communist tracts? The idea is ridiculous. The germ of it, of course, is not to be found in any of the statements of the right honourable member, but must be sought outside this House. Surely members of the Opposition, including members of the Australian Country party, will not accept the proposition that there should be political censorship of any literary fund. That would be intolerable and impossible. The. AttorneyGenpntl has shown why the Commonwealth Literary Fund has had to be free and unencumbered. It would be a shocking thing if a gestapo were to be employed against the writers of this country, because some members, of the Australian Country party are timid of the prospects of holding their seats in the future and seek a little brief publicity at the moment. The criticism that has been launched on this occasion cannot be sustained, for the reason that the Commonwealth Literary Fund could not exist if a censorship were imposed on the politics of the men concerned. By reason of the intelligence of the advisory committee, and later the revision of the literary committee, some consideration can be given to the subjects discussed, and it has been .the law that politics cannot enter into any serious writing by persons who receive fellowships. But the real story, if it must be told, is that a disgruntled man outside this House has related in strong terms to the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) and the new recruit, the right honourable member for Cowper, the story of his disappointment in failing to secure a fellowship himself. On every occasion on which the literary committee has made an appointment, he has come forward with a fresh lie. We have had to stand up to a vendetta by this man Ellis and his employer, the Sydney Bulletin, who are haters of Labour and of the Communists. Mr Br.ArN - That is the man who wrote the life of Macquarie.",30
66,Mr HAYLEN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,It is not.,31
67,Mr BLAIN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,The honourable member is a liar..,31
68,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"Order ! Normally, the Chair waits for an honourable member to object to the use of unparliamentary language, but on this occasion intends to depart from that practice. The Chair will not tolerate language of the kind used by the honourable member"" for the Northern Territory (Mr Blain). The honourable member will withdraw his remark, and apologize to the House for having made it.",31
69,Mr BLAIN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"Evidently , it is ignorance on the part of the honourable member",31
70,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,Order !,31
71,Mr BLAIN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"I withdraw the statement, and ask the honourable member to make sure of his facts.",31
72,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,Order !- The Chair has ordered the honourable member to withdraw and apologize.,31
73,Mr BLAIN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,I have already withdrawn the statement.,31
74,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,The honourable member must also apologize.,31
75,Mr BLAIN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,I apologize.,31
76,Mr HAYLEN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"In deference to the honourable member who interjected, I may say that I did not properly hear what he said. Half a dozen stories have been written about the life of Macquarie. I understand that the man whose name I have mentioned wrote a story which was rejected by _ the Commonwealth Literary Fund. I apologize for having contradicted the honourable member. I merely' wanted to brush his remarks aside, because I have so few minutes in which to make my speech. The whole of this sordid brawl has been occasioned by the right honourable member for Cowper, upon ex parte information tendered outside this House by a disgruntled man. The Commonwealth Literary Fund, and the small part that I have played in it during the last few years, will stand the closest investigation. Before I conclude, I warn the House that if it wants to destroy Australian literature, if it wants to remove all liberties from this country, as well as a growing appreciation of what this land stands for and what makes it live, that object can be achieved hy imposing a censorship which will destroy all that we have tried to build up in 150 hard, brutal years, by putting policemen in charge of those who select our literature. A final word: The Attorney General has said that it was on the 10th May of a certain year that books were burned by Hitler. . To-day is the Sth May. The Australian Country party has .two days in which to complete the task that it has begun.",31
77,Mr ANTHONY,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"Richmond) [4.15] - . The honourable member for Parkes (Mr. Haylen) is so completely on the defensive that in the very first words he uttered in reply to the speech of the right able member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) he sought to insult and throw dirt at members of the Australian Country party because the right honourable riiember for Cowper is a member of that party. His reference to the cowyards of the community will not escape the attention of those people who are producing food for Britain, and who sometimes have to wallow in the mud",32
78,Mr HAYLEN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,I rise to order. I was not referring to members of the Australian Country party.,32
79,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,Order ! The honorab'e member for Parkes (Mr Haylen) must not abuse the Standing Orders by seeking to raise a point of order when no point of order is involved.,32
80,Mr ANTHONY,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"To use' the words which you, yourself, Mr Speaker, have often used when rebuking honourable members, the honourable member for Parkes can hand it out, but he can not take it. When he makes a personal attack on an honourable member on this side of the House, he must be prepared to take what comes to him in reply. This time,'he has been caught flat-footed. He took advantage of the absence of the right honourable member for Cowper to make a personal' attack on his character. Now, when the right honourable member has substantiated all his assertions by quoting chapter and verse from the records of the Mitchell Library, and the records .of this Parliament, the honourable member for Pa'rkes, .who does not hesitate to asperse the sincerity of good faith of members of the Australian Country party, needs to be told a few things about himself. The other day, he rose in his place in this House and asked a question about the trip abroad of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender).",32
81,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,Order ! The honourable member must return to the subject. What the honourable member for. Parkes said about the honourable member for Warringah has nothing to do with the matter under discussion.,32
82,Mr ANTHONY,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"The honourable, member for Parkes must accept, some responsibility for a Communist receiving a fellowship from the Commonwealth Literary Fund. I make no charge against honor- the literary committee of the fund, which consists of the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), whose integrity is beyond question, the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), but I point out that the literary committee merely adjudicates upon the claims submitted to it by the Advisory Committee, of which the honourable member for Parkesis a member. It is obvious that the Prime Minister, for instance, has. not the tune to read all the works published in Australia in the course of a year. For guidance in this direction he must rely upon the members of the advisory committee, and the member for Parkes, a member of that committee, digs up as an applicant for a fellowship some one with a Communist background. I had never heard of Mr Rawling until this incident occurred, and it is unfortunate that he should receive such publicity now if it is true that he has recanted his Communist views. However, the whole incident wascreated hy the attempt of the honourable member for Parkes to make political capital at the expense of the right honourable member for Cowper. The Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) quoted a long list of English authors, including "" Bobby "" Burns, Tennyson and Shakespeare, and - appeared to be trying todraw some sort of analogy between them and Mr Rawling. The only point for us to consider is what qualifications had a certain Mr Rawling, who was recommended by the advisory committee to the Commonwealth Literary Fund for a fellowship to be chosen to write the life of Australia's first notable poet. The night honourable member' for Cowper suggested that the committee should have looked fox his qualifications in his previous writings. After all, that is the only way in which the merits of any applicant for such a fellowship can be gauged. The only writings of Mr Rawling of which there is any record are not unbiased productions; they are Communist propaganda.",32
83,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,The Short History of the Australian People is not propaganda.,33
84,Mr ANTHONY,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"It is all Communist propaganda. If we are to judge a person's qualifications and sincerity, or to decide whether or not he is biased, we can only go back to what he has written or said. If he has not repudiated the opinions expressed in his writings or utterances, we must assume that he still holds those opinions. In a letter referred to by' the right honourable member for Cowper, Mr Rawling has stated, I understand"", that he no longer holds Communist views. If that is so, good luck to him, but the mere fact that he has recanted his Communist ideas does not of itself qualify him to write the life of Charles Harpur, or to receive a fellowship wort!) £400 from the Commonwealth Literary Fund. It is unfortunate that the matter should have been raised in this way, and that the history of Mr Rawling, if he is no longer a Communist, should be made the subject of debate in this chamber. However, as I have said, the responsibility for this lies on the honourable member for Parkes, who sought to take advantage, of the absence of the right honourable member for Cowper to score a political point. I hope that the information which the right honourable member for Cowper has placed before the House will be taken into account by the members of the literary committee. I believe, as I think does every honourable member on this side of the House, that the Commonwealth Literary Fund is an excellent institution. There is a long list of persons of merit who have been assisted from .the fund. There may be some who received assistance without meriting it, but it is notable that the only case upon which - doubts have been cast has occurred since lihe honourable member for Parkes became a member of the advisory committee. When the .honourable member for Parkes - talks about the cowyards and the Aus[73] tralian Country party he had better look to himself.",33
85,Mr CHIFLEY,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"Macquarie - Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.20J - I think it is necessary that I , as chairman of the literary committee of the Commonwealth Literary Fund, should say something about, this matter. The committee consists of the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) and myself, as chairman. I always believed that the Commonwealth Literary Fund had been created-no t by this Government, but by a previous onefor the purpose of assisting in the development of Australian literature, and to render financial assistance to those who might have the ability to produce worthwhile literature. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) said that the real question to he decided was the capacity of Mr Rawling. As a matter of fact, the original question asked by the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) had nothing to do with the literary capacity of Mr Rawling. It was the right honourable member who introduced politics by referring to communism.",33
86,Sir EARLE PAGE,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,I asked whether Mr. Rawling was better qualified than two other men to write the life of Charloi Harpur.,33
87,Mr CHIFLEY,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"There is no doubt that it was the right honourable membe.': himself who raised the issue of Mr. Rawling's political beliefs. I am sure that the right honourable member for Yarra and the Leader of the Opposition will agree with me when I say that the literary committee takes full responsibility for the awarding of fellowships, no matter what recommendations may have been made by the advisory committee. As a matter of fact, many applications and recommendations have been rejected. Our decisions are made, rightly or wrongly, according to what we believe to be the literary capacity of the applicant. If the literary committee is to turn itself into a gestapo to inquire into the political history of every applicant for a grant, the sooner the committee is abolished the better. Having regard to the diverse political views of the members of the committee, it would be absurd to suggest that it should concern itself with die political views of applicants rather than their literary ability. I go further than did the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) : If the committee is to continue - and I hope i.t will, because it has been of considerable value- I will never be a party to the proposition that when an application or recommendation comes before the committee, it should dredge the sewers to find out the political views of the person concerned.",33
88,Mr MCEWEN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,That is an extremestatement.,34
89,Mr CHIFLEY,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"I do not care how extreme it may be. The purpose of the committee is to assist the development of Australian literature, not to turn themselves into policemen in an effort to find nut the political views of writers. I lay down two rules which I suggest the commiitee should follow in considering applications for assistance from the Commonwealth Literary Fu.nd : First, that applicant* shall have a. literary capacity to warrant the granting of assistance; and secondly, that when assistance is given, tile recipient shall not use the money to engage in political propaganda on behalf of any party, whether it be the Labour party the Australian Country party, the Liberal, party or the Communist party. When the present Leader of the Opposition was Prime Minister he issued an invitation to the Australian Country party to nominate a representative for appointment to the committee; but so great was the interest of that party that its representative attended only one meeting. Since then the Australian Country party has not taken the slightest interest in the committee.",34
90,Mr FADDEN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,This is the first time. I have ever heard of such an invij-.ation being extended to the Australian Country party.,34
91,Mr CHIFLEY,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"The letter of invitation was written by the then Prime Minister to the right honourable member for Cowper,. then Leader of the Australian Country party. The Attorney-General has a copy of it and if the right honourable member so desires he may read it. I shall not go into the question as to what Mr Rawling is, or was. I have stated the two principles which guide the committee. If they were departed from there would be set up immediately a sort, of political gestapo which would concern itself more with the political philosophies of writers than with their literary capacity. , I do not propose to depart from these principles and if they'were departed from I would disband the committee at once.",34
92,Mr SCULLIN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"Yarra) [4.32] - I rise principally to endorse what the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) has said in. connection with this matter. As a member of the committee I take iny share of responsibility for its actions. Whilst 1 appreciate the personal references made to the members of the committee, I am not prepared to allow it to be said that we had no rights, that the committee merely did what it was told and accepted the recommendations of the advisory committee without question. Anybody who says that knows nothing whatever about the workings of the committee which has been in existence for eight, years. The advisory committee is composed of literary men who inquire into the merits of the work of those who seek assistance from the fund. The advisory committee sends its recommendation, together with all appropriate .information, to the literary committee for consideration. The committee examines the recommendation and the facts surrounding the application, and decides either to accept or reject the recommendation. It is true that we have accepted the majority of the recommendations of the advisory committee; but it is also true that we have rejected a good many of them. Sometimes the members of the advisory committee feel somewhat hurt by our rejections, - but we have our own reasons for our decisions. The - literary committee is composed not merely of three busy parliamentarians who meet and say, "" We shall endorse this or that recommendation "" ; on the contrary the commi'.tce goes into the matter very thoroughly. To the two busy men on the committee, the Prime Minister, and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), who have greater responsibilities to the Parliament than I have as a private member, I pay tribute for the time and attention and earnest consideration they have given to the matters placed before them. I regret that the Commonwealth Literary Fund and the committee that administers it should be dragged into a political fight, in this Parliament. joined the committee, as the Attornc.yGcncTitl (Dr Evatt) has said, eight years ago, after I had resigned as Leader of the Opposition because of ill healrh and was no longer able to take an active part in the hurly-burly of politics. 1 felt ihen that I owed a public duty to the people T. represented and to the Australian people g'enera.ll\y and 1 raised in this House a matter that had troubled my mind for many years, namely, that year after year we were accustomed to vote millions of pounds for the assistance of industry of all kinds, primary producers, manufacturers and others, by way of subsidies and payments of various kinds, but we entirely neglected one body of people in the community which was making a contribution to our national life and literature. I agree that some journals were giving assistance to men of letters, notably the Biill.et.in. which did more for Australian writers than any other publication, particularly in earlier years. That journal had provided opportunities for literary men, particularly in the early days of its publication, which was of the greatest national value; but the need for assistance to Australian writers was completely ignored by the Australian Parliament. If I had thought that, because of my association with the committee I would have been dragged into a party political fight or accused of sponsoring communism I would have ceased to be a member of the committee immediately and the other members would have done likewise. Can one imagine the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition or me sponsoring and subsidizing the propaganda of communism, and using the Commonwealth Literary Fund to foster the breeding grounds of Communist propaganda? Does not that stretch the imagination too far? Since the fund was established it has grunted 33 fellowships, and it has been responsible for the printing of a number of manuscripts which otherwise would never have seen the light of day. Some of them, I am glad to say, have not only been published but have also paid the costs of publication out of sales. Most of these were of a kind which ordinary commercial publishers would not touch. About S6 of these publications I have been sponsored by the fund and this is the first occasion on which criticism of the kind voiced by the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) has been levelled at. the fund. Suppose thai, every thing thai; has been said about this case is correct. The committee is not. infallible; it is capable of making mistakes. Why besmirch the fund and the great ideal.* that lie behind it by dragging theui into a party political fight? 1 endorse what the Prime Minister has said, and I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition will do likewise, and say that never once have we asked what were the politics of any person whose work was submitted to us. All we were concerned about, was the subject of the work and the way in which it was treated. I . have not seen in any of the publications that, we have sponsored one line of political propaganda. I do not claim to have read every line of every work submitted for our consideration, but I have read a great deal; J. have burned the midnight, of! in going through them. I would not. think of saying that an applicant for a fellowship should hold the same political opinions as I do. One has only to look at the list of fellowships granted to see that this fund has not been used as the nursery of Communist ideas. I implore honourable members to look at the list. Here are a few name? that, appear on it : Mrs Ernestine Hill , for the completion of her'work Matthew Flinders-Lover ; E. J. Brady, for the compilation of a. book entitled Tiro Frontiers; S. J. Baker, for his Dictionary of Australian Language; I . H . M . Abbott, for his volume on Newcastle Packets and the Hunter River District. Mr Abbott has, I understand, a friend in this House. Mr AnnoTT --He is my brother. Mr Scullin"" - The list also contains the names of Dame Mary Gilmour, for her biography; J. S. MACDonald, whowrote on Australian art. Mr. MACDonald was a great art critic, though many people do not agree with his criticisms. The list also contains the name of Mr Frank Reid, author of History of HIP. Great Earner Reef; Mr Daisy Bates. f o v tH& preparation of ' a booklet of Aboriginal Stories for Children; Ian Mudie, forThe Disappearing Murray and Darling Rivers Paddle jSteamcrs; and Mr II . M . Green, who wrote Critical History of Australian Literature. Who would say that these works are in the nature of Communist propaganda? The committee has granted 33 fellowships' and has resurrected buried manuscripts, and reprinted books that have gone out of circulation, such as Torn Collins's Such is Life. All of this has been done in the short life of the fund and this is (lie first complaint - we have had of the committee's operations. As to the specific case mentioned by rl 10 right honourable member for Cowper, I admit that I knew nothing about Mr. Ilawling's private politics. I would not question tliein. I have so vivid a recollection of the persecution of Labourites in days gone by, of men. who were not allowed to work m the mines because they had accepted office in the Labour party, of the injustices meted out by politically biased persons, that I would not think of asking about the political convictions of any person who sought assistance from the Commonwealth Literary Eund. | Extension of time granted.} I have since had inquiries made in order to ascertain how far these attacks upon Rawling are warranted. It is true he was a. Communist.; but he has re^ pented of his ways and hasbecome a strong critic of the Communist party. The fact that he has not written books, since he ceased to be a Communist sup.* porter does not prove that, his convictions have not changed. I believe that for some years he has been employed as a teacher. He went into the Army eighteen years, of age and served with distinction in World War I, He beCountry came a Oommunist after hisreturn Australia, but now he is listed, as the Communist's enemy No. 1. As far as his personal character is concerned, we have before us a document showing that liis application for a fellowship was sponsored by the well-known and reputGeneral raised it. able, headmaster of one of our greatpublic schools in Sydney. I believe it was Newing.ton. I would havesented nothing to do with sponsoring munism,, nor .would I he associated ttr. Srullin. with a political censorship of literary works. I would not be a member of the committee if I had to ask an applicant for assistance from the fund, "" How did you vote at the last, elections ? "" Does any honourable member imagine that any member of a committee, which consists of members of differing political views, would do such a thing? In the yeaa:s during which I have been a member of the committee I have never had a difference of opinion with the Leader of the Opposition on any question raised or any recommendation submitted for the consideration of the committee. , .",34

103,Mr EADDKK,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND, Order ! The right honourable member for Yarra is addressing the House.,37
104,Mr SCULLIN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"The procedure is simple. The committee has literary men to advise it . They are well known in literature. They read the manuscripts and give us all the particulars. Sometimes members of the committee re-read manuscripts. I have often presumed to re-read a manuscript. We all do it where there is a doubt. The manuscripts are passed around the members in order that they may read the in and decide whether to endorse the recommendations of our advisers. I do not claim that we set ourselves up as greater literary students than they are. 1 take my share of responsibility for our decisions, but would lake no responsibility for examining the political opinions of men whose literary work comes before us. It is a poor outlook if it is claimed that a man who has committed an offence, even though he has repented, shall not be forgiven. Mr . Rawling is the only man whose fellowship has been attacked. The honourable member . for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) made a few points about other things, but lie cannot set himself up as the last word on literature. It cannot be said that the experts who advise us have no literary knowledge. If any member of the Australian Country party feels that his presence on the committee would improve it and the work it does, I shall be glad to have him joi n us, but I decline to agree that the committee must examine a man's political conscience before deciding that lie. be granted a fellowship. When I proposed the present system I had in mind a number of Australian writers who had not heen given the opportunity to develop (heir talents. I pointed out that when they were worn out as writers and no longer capable of giving of their best they were pensioned, but that when they were young and vigorous and capable of fine work, given the opportunity, they were made to fend for themselves. One man among many I had in mind was working on jobs in the bush and in brickyards and was going blind. He was writing beautiful Australian poetry. Given financial relief and encouragement, our writers' will rise to greater heights and Australia will produce literature equal to any in the world.",37

Scullin) should have taken the fight into his own corner: because I am sure that no one in his wildest dreams would associate the right honourable gentleman, or his colleagues on the advisory committee, of any misdemeanour in connection with the matter raised by the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page). I think the right honourable member for Cowper, himself, made that plain in his concise statement. Constituted as it is, the literary committee obviously has to depend on the advice of experts on the advisory committee. As Leader of the Australian Country party, I make it.clear that never to my knowledge has :my party been invited *,o he represented on the advisory committee. The first I heard of its having been invited to nominate a representative was the statement by the Attorney-General (Dr E v at t ) , which was confirmed by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen) and the right honourable member for Yarra.",37

108,Mr FADDEN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"In view of the political set-up, I am surprised that we have not, been invited, and I protest against the discourtesy to us by our not liaving heen asked to help. This is not a statutory committee. I emphasize that. It is appointed annually. But not once since 1939 until now has the Australian Country party been invited to be represented on it . I direct attention to the manner in which we have been ignored in many other ways. Honourable members may rest assured that we shall exert pressure to ensure against a repetition of Mii'h treatment of an important section of the Commonwealth Parliament. It is it lasting disgrace that the Australian Country party has not been invited to be . represented on the committee, and I deeply resGi.it our liaving been accused of n*t ha ving any interest in the committee. The right honourable member for Yarra, exercising his shrewdness and great ability in debate, sought to distract honourable members from the main issue. The right, honourable member for Cowper was reluctantly com polled to take the action he took to reply - to ' accusations made against him in his absence by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr . . Haylen). The weight of numbers on the Government side was exerted on Tuesday to prevent the right honourable gentleman from making a personal explanation a bout thir matter when lie asked the indulgence of the House to do so. The main issue is .whether Mr Rawling is a f it and proper person to w r it "" the biography of the first Australian poet, Charles Harpur. . The honourable member for Cowper based his case on the merits or demerits of Mr . Rawling compared with those of other available authorities, who, he said, were more qualified to write proper'biography of Harpur. The only . authentic records of Harpur's filed and indexed at the Mitchell Not one article, let alone one book, has been written by Mr Rawling life and work of Harpur. verifiable at the Mitchell Library. no record of any request made by Mr. Rawling to examine the material Harpur that it has available. Mitchell Library maintains a record of every borrower and the books he reads, and the officials have never heard of Mr. Rawling as an authority on The Attorney-General is chairman of the Mitchell Library Trust, and he shouldask the librarian what requests he has received from Mr Rawling to the Harpur records. No research into Harpur's life could be undertaken at the Mitchell Library, for there is no other source of information. No evidence exists that Mr Rawling, who has been preferred to other authorities, ever interested himself in the authentic information that must be used to Mr Fadden. write Harpur's biography, '.rhe right honourable member for Cowper has made out an unanswerable case. .Efforts inii.de to counter it provide sufficient evidence, if evidence should lie needed, of the desirability of bringing Mr . Rawling's fellowship into the light of day in order that the taxpayers may know what is being done with their money.",37
109,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"Fremantle) [4.55] Notwithstanding the speech of the leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Eadden), the issue before us is not the'martyrdom of the; Australian Countrv party, but a straight issue of civil liberty, it is on that basis that I propose to discuss the matter raised by the. right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle' Page). The leader of the Australian Couniry party and the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) have attacked the right of Mr Rawling to receive a Commonwealth Literary Eund fellowship.",38
110,Mr FADDEN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"I did not. right,",38

I said Library. that .he should not have been preferred to other people more qualified. on the Mr BEAZLEY - The right honourable That is gentleman has no information about his It has qualifications.",38
112,Mr FADDEN,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,I ask the honourable on member not to twist on what T said. The,38
113,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"Order ! The right honourable member has. concluded his speech and is not entitled to Harpur. ""intrude on the speech of the honourable member for Fremantle.",38
114,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"The statement made was that before the war there was no evifor access dence that Mr Rawling could write. T bought a book written by Mr Rawling except that appeared in instalments called, A Short History of the Australian People. It contains some original research on early exploration, as is shown by the has marginalia and the bibliography. T can bene - tly say, from considerable reading of history, that I have never read a better account of the work of Dam pier than that written by Mr Rawling, in matter, interpretation, and literary style. Therefore,"" to .assort, without a. tittle of evidence, ae the honourable member for Richmond did. that there is no evidence of Mr Rawling's literary merit is to assert something totally ii n true. Apart from whether he was, or was not, a Communist, or whether any one else, who has been given a fellowship, is or is not a Communist, there is another question. It concerns civil liberties. No one knows who speaks for the Liberal party, because the tune sung by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) is entirely different from that, of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), and I am glad to see the honourable member for Barker nodding agreement. The Leader of the Opposition made a clear statement after the last general elections that the policy of the Liberal party was not to ban the Communist party but to prosecute it for any overt, or illegal act done by it . It would not ban the Communist party on political philosophy as such. Therefore the policy of the Liberal party is to ro'.cognize the Communist party as a legal party. On what, grounds, then, would the Liberal party exclude Communists from receiving fellowships from the Commonwealth Literary Fund? Obviously, if it made the Communist party illegal, it would have the right to exclude Communists. The policy of the Australian Country party is at least consistent. It declares that it will ban the Communist party; hence, its objection to Communist authors or those accused of being Communists, ' is coherent and consistent. But that is not the policy of the Liberal party, and I should like to know just how deep is the concern of members of ihe Liberal party for civil liberty because - ititside this House they want one thing, and inside the House, they either sit in silence while the Australian Country party goes through its usual opening gambit, or certain of its members, like the honourable member for Barker, if he can be described as a Liberal, support them. In my mind, fJie word ""liberalism "" is associated with Gladstone, Oampbell-Bannerman and Lloyd George. To call the honourable member for Barker a liberal is as j a r r in g to my sense of the fitness of things us it would !>e to put coronation robes on an orang-outang. Among the authors who have received a grant from the.Commonwealth Literary Fund, there is one who, I understand, is a Communist. I am not following the usual practice of smearing people, under the cover of parliamentary privilege. She is Katherine Susannah Pritchard, or Mrs K . S. Throssell. I understand, that she has never sought to conceal the fact that she was a. Communist. She received a grant to write a .novel set in the gold-fields of Western Australia. I presume that the novel, is her recent, work, The Roaring Nineties. I read the novel with great interest. W it h her political views, - I disagree entirely. I have heard her speak publicly, and I disagree entirely with what she stated; but if the Commonwealth .Literary Fund had deprived Australian literature of the novel which she wrote, it would have done a disservice to Australian literature. I consider that nothing could dramatize the whole issue which is before the House better than this clear separation of her political convictions whatever we may think of them, and her literary ability."" The list of persons who have received assistance from the f u n d is very extensive. Some of the authors are Frank Dalby Davison, Xavier Herbert, Stella Miles Franklin, Mrs. Ernestine Hill , M a r j o r i e Clark, Marjorie Barnard, of Barnard Eldershaw fame, E . J. Brady, and Roy Connolly, who wrote a novel dealing with freakishness in heredity. Looking at honourable members opposite, I believe that this book is probably a very valuable piece of research. Other well known names in the list of distinguished authors are-S . J. Baker, Mrs K a f e r in e Susannah Pritchard, J. H . M . Abbott, Dame Mary Gilmour and Mrs Daisy Bates. Summing up, I desire to make certain comments on Mr Rawling himself. I heard a broadcast that he gave over the national stations. If I remember aright, the broadcast took the form of an interview with an announcer. Mr . Rawling broke with the Communist party over the Russian invasion of F in land. He considered that the habit of the Comniunist party of apologizing for every item of - Russian foreign policy reprehensible - He stated that Russian actions, as he saw them, had nothing to do with the philosophy of communism. In that broadcast he accused the Australian Communist party of being not Communists but Stalinists, who might aptly be described as they were drawn in Low's cartoon. AH the little boys were in bed with "" Eather Joe "", and if father burned, they all turned. That was his description of the Communist party at this time; not that the fact that he might be a Communist or was once a Communist has anything to do with the question whether he should be awarded a grant to enable him to write on a li'.erary subject. But since his literary ability has been impugned, it is necessary for me to state these facts. . If the evidence of Mr. Rawling's literary ability is provided in his Short History of the Australian People, then the committee, in deciding to make this grant to him, had good grounds for so doing. When the Minister for Transport, (Mr Ward) objected yesterday to the right honourable member for Cowper being granted leave to make a statement, I personally disapproved of his action.",38
115,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,But the 'honourable member voted for it.,40
116,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"I voted for it because I have no intention of behaving as an individualist, as the honourable member for Barker has done .",40
117,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,Where is personal liberty now ?,40
118,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"I a,m very glad now that the Minister did object, because his action has led to this debate, which has revealed how contemptuous is the attitude of the Australian Country party towards civil liberty. I am glad also that the Australian people have had this revelation of how there is in their midst a party of Junkers, who would drop their jackboots squarely on Australian literature.",40
119,Mr HOLT,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"Fawkner) [5.6] - What ever else may be said by honourable members opposite about the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page), the concluding remarks of* the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr. was Beazley) were entirely unwarranted. If honourable members will recall 'the .facts they will remember that the right honourable member for Cowper accepted the statement - made by the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley), and did not press the matter further. In that way, he avoided causing any embarrassment to Mr Rawling. It was not until the right honourable gentleman himself had been savagely attacked in this House, in his absence, and then denied the right to make a personal explanation by those who now claim to uphold the right of personal liberty, that he raised in the matter again.",40
120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,Order ! Now that the honourable member has made that comment. I ask him to address his remarks to the subject before the Chair.,40
121,Mr HOLT,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"Wit h respect.

The leaders of the political parties constituting the Opposition should set an example to their supporters. I ask that order be observed while the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) addresses the Chair and I also ask the honourable member to address his remarks to the subject associated with the motion. I have allowed him certain liberty, as I have allowed other honourable members, in approaching this subject, but I consider that he has gone far enough.",40
122,Mr ANTHONY,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"I rise to order. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr. Beazley) and other honourable members who have spoken in this debate, roamed very widely, and I consider that a member of the Oopdsition is entitled to reply to their statements.",40
123,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,That is not a point of order.,40
124,Mr HOLT,BUSINESS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS AND,"At any rate, enough has been said by honourable members on both sides of the House about personal liberty, but the issue implicit in the submission of the right honourable member for Cowper is this: Is there, by .some accident or through inadequate vigilance on the part of the committee controlling the Commonwealth Literary Fund, a danger that some of this money, which is provided by taxpayers, will be used to enable certain people, who themselves would deny to us (lie right of free speech, to undermine and white-ant the democratic institutions of fins country? One of the most remarkable features of this debate is that, although members of the committee presumably investigated the literary record of Mr Bawling, the only person to submit to the House today evidence of those activities was the right honourable member for Cowper. No one has suggested that Mr Bawling has written matter other than that contained in the list provided by the right honourable member for Cowper. We are told that although Mr. Bawling has written on the subject of communism in the past, he is now a convert, who is so moved to continue his literary activities that he has applied for a Commonwealth Fellowship. However. T point out' that he has refrained from producing, during the last seven or eight years, any literature which would give a denial to the views which he previously expressed in print. Why, if he has this consuming desire to record himself in print on one subject, has he not been prepared to publish statements which would undo any damage which his previous utterances had caused? The fears of the Opposition go beyond the issue raised in this particular instance. We are concerned, because we find on the part of this Government a reluctance to bring to the light of day the activities of people who are conspiring to undermine the Commonwealth. The Government refuses to say where the funds are obtained that enable four publications to be carried on by the Communist party in Australia. We hear that certain persons are no longer members of the Communist party. How many of them have gone underground because they look to the day when the activities of some of their comjades might deprive them of the opportunity to carry out their foul work in white-anting our democratic institutions? If the Government desires to repudiate the charges levelled against it on this occasion, and wishes to allay the concern and misgivings which the Opposition and many people throughout Australia feel on the subject of communism, let it face this issue as a real challenge! Let it examine the activities of the Communists in Australia, and bring into the light of day the source of the funds which enable the Communists to publish those journals!",40

The proposals which it . is desirable to validate principally, gave effect to the reductions of duty introduced by the Government in connection with its 1946-47 budget. No absolute period of validation has been prescribed in the bill. This follows""the course established in previous validation bills introduced into the House, and will secure uniformity with validation acts which are at present operative. This bill does not preclude the individual items in the proposals being debated by honourable members, as a tariff debate is necessary before such items can be permanently included in the schedule to the Customs Tariff Act. A tariff debate will be held as soon as circumstances permit.",41
126,Mr HARRISON,CUSTOMS TARIF F VALIDATIO N,"Wentworth) [5.15]. - I do not intend to oppose the passage of this bill, but, I consider it necessary to point out that it is time that honorurge able members wore given an opportunity to discuss the specific tariff, items volved. When the last Customs Tariff Validation Bill was before the House the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) gave an arranged, assurance that, at a. very early date, honourable members would be given opportunity to discuss the tariff schedules, yet here is another validation bill and we still have not. been provided with thar opportunity. Because of trade discussions which are proceeding overseas I, am aware that this might, not, be. an appropriate opportunity, from the point of view of the Government, for a tariff CUSTOMS. TARIFF debate. The Minister, in his second reading speech, saidThe present validation hill does not preclude tln> individual items in the proposals being debuted by honourable members!, as a tariff debate is necessary before such items can be permanently included in the schedule to the Customs Tariff Act. A tariff debate will be held as soon as circunistances permit. That, however, does not give any indication that a tariff debate will be arranged at an early date. Moreover, the Minister pointed out that the validation now being sought is for an unspecified term. We may therefore be precluded from engaging in a tariff debate for many more months, or even, in. some circumstances, for years. Other tariff validation bills may follow this one. This procedure does not do justice to the responsibilities - of honourable members in relation to tariff policy. In view of the great development of our manufacturing potential during the war years there is every reason for requesting an early tariff debate. It .ma.v be that. some of the industries which are at present receiving protection may not need it, or they may not. need such high duties as are at present being applied. Other manufacturing industries now in their early stages of development may require a greater degree of p.rote -;.ion than they are receiving. It may be that at this moment, some of our newer industries are having the headman's axe applied to thern in the overseas discussions to which I have referred. In these circumstances a fulldress tariff debate is vital to the welfare of industry in Australia. I strongly protest against the frequent introduction of validation bills of this description, and il/V. Harrison. the Government to provide an early opportunity for a proper tariff debate. I inask the Minister .to give the House an assurance that the promise of the Prime Minister that a. tariff debate would bo at an early date will be fulfilled. This is necessary in the interests of an Australian industry generally. Question resolved in the affirmative.

The purpose of this bill is to validate the 1 collections of duties of customs imposed hy Customs Tariff (Southern Rhodesian Preference) Proposals No. 1. introduced on. the 1.4th November, 1946. The bill has a. similar effect to that of the Customs Tariff Validation Bill which has just been passed.",41
127,Mr HARRISON,CUSTOMS TARIF F VALIDATIO N,"Wentworth) [5.21'|. - J should not have risen on this occa given me the assurance that I asked for a few moments ago, that an early opportunity would be provided for a debate on the individual items involved in the several schedules covered by these validating bills. I had the honor to negotiate the original Southern Rhodesian preference agreement while I held the portfolio of Minister for Trade and Customs, so T am. well aware of the implications inherent in this measure. I am not out of step with the desire of the Government to validate the duties included in the schedule that w-as tabled last November, but I reiterate that a full dress debate on our tariff policy is necessary in the interests of Australia. We ought to know where we are heading in our customs tariff policy. It will doubtless be of interest to honourable members and to the country at large to be reminded that tariff receipts for the first eight months of the present financial year show an increase'of £17.000,000 over the estimate. The total is made up of £11,000,000 from customs duties and £6,000,000 fro m excise duties. Tho estimated budget collection for the full financial vear is £89,000,000. The revenue for ""the ten months ended the 30th. A p r i l, totalled £34,224,860. The collections up t ill the SOth A p r i l were £21,858,600 more than the corresponding ten months of the previous financial year. The total collections for A p r i l alone were £8,377.900 which was £1.807,000 more than for A p r i l of .last year. There will probably be a continually increasing revenue from customs and excise duties until the depleted .stocks in the stores of this country have been replenished. It may suit the Government to have a "" r o c k e t in g "" customs revenue and that very circumstance may prove an incentive to it to defer a full consideration of customs policy for as long as possible. In that event we may expect a continuation of the policy of introducing validating bills of this description; hut the abstraction of money from the pockets of the people by such means is not justifiable. That is another reason why there should be a prompt review of customs policy. I cannot fathom why the Government should wish to continue to abstract money from the people in the way that it is doing by both direct and indirect means. It is thereby imposing a financial burden, on the people which I am sure they will not be willing to carry much longer. 'Ihe Government's policy is impoverishing industry to an extraordinary degree and it is hindering full recovery. I consider, therefore, that it. is incumbent upon me to impress upon the Minister and his colleagues the need for an early tariff debate so that, to use an expression of which Government members are fond, we may '-streamline"" our 1:(riff policy. The present policy of the Government is undoubtedly having an adverse effect on some worthy importing enterprises.",42
128,Mr LANG,CUSTOMS TARIF F VALIDATIO N,"Reid) [5.26] - I listened with interest to the two speeches that were made on the validating bill which the House has just passed, and I was somewhat surprised that, the Minister who in not give an explanation, to honourable members of the need for it . Everybody knows that anything done in validly is illegal. Consequently when the Parliament is invited to pass a bill to validate something that has already been done,, it may be assumed that the invalid action was illegal. If something illegal has been, done honourable morn hers should be informed of the full facts. The bill now before us contains the expression, "" all duties of customs demanded or collected "". That means, I presume, that duties which have already been collected have been illegally collected. Therefore the illegal action needs validation. Presumably, duties to be collected . in the future under the tariff proposals to which this bill relates would also be illegal if ibis validating bill were not passed. I submit therefore that the Minister should explain the reason why such a. measure as this is necessary.",43
129,Mr SCULLIN,CUSTOMS TARIF F VALIDATIO N,"Y a r r a ) [5.28] - I desire to refer to the points"" raised'by the honourable member for Reid (Mr . Lang). The action taken by the Government in relation to these tariff matters was not illegal. Under legislation passed by this Parliament many years ago duties specified in tariff schedules that were tabled became operative at once. The reason for such action is clear. If the duties did not become operative immediately they were notified there would be a temptation for people immediately to rush forward prospective - imports, or to remove goods from bond. Eor that reason duties .become effective immedia.telv schedules are tabled. Another law passed! by this Parliament provides that tariff schedules which have been laid on the table must be validated within a given time - I believe within six months. That period, in respect of these schedules, will expire in a. few days, and unless the'Parliament passes a validating bill covering a further period, the duties will .lapse! I remind the honourable member for Reid that while I was Prime Minister numerous tariff schedules were introduced, by means of which existing industries, and iiic finances of this country, were protected at a very serious period of our history, and the foundation of many more valuable industries was laid. Eventually, the Parliament validated those schedules. Now, because the law has been amended, the period during which tariff schedules can continue to operate without validation is only six months. It. does not matter what may be the number of schedules, they have to be laid on the table of the House, and should a majority of the Parliament, so decide, any one or all of them may be disallowed. Such action is not taken, becati.se the Parliament always approves of them.",43
130,Mr WHITE,CUSTOMS TARIF F VALIDATIO N,"Balaclava) [5.31] This proposal is rather unfair to the House, even though the matter may be urgent. What the right honourable memtrue ber for Yarra (Mr Scullin) has said true enough, but he did not tell the whole story. Validation bills were brought down during his period of office and that of the Lyons administration, as I know full well, liaving been Minister for Trade and Customs for six years, because lack of time in which to discuss them. .For about five years there has not been a tariff debate in this Parliament, and is high time there was one. The protest of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang) is timely. Yesterday I pointed out to the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) that the Minister for Trade and Customs should be a member of the House of Pollard) Representatives and should not, be stowed away in the Senate, but, the right able gentleman did not deign to reply to me. That Minister is responsible the administration of the trade of this country, the collection of a large its revenue, and multifarious matters which concern customs duties, which large measure were fixed when the Ottawa Agreement was ratified in 1933. All sorts of restrictions upon imports and exports have to be administered by officials, are doing the best they can within compass allowed to them. Undeniably, Australian commerce is getting into very chaotic condition because of the absence of parliamentary discussion. am sure that the Minister for Commerce  that a tariff debate is needed. He deals with export matters, and has not the necessary facilities for obtaining all the information that he needs. Every' honourable member knows that when a question in relation to a customs matter is asked in this House the information sought cannot be supplied, and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has to promise to obtain it from his colleague. I challenge any honourable member to name one of the customs duties that are affected by these bills. I cannot be told what amount has been collected, what the primage is. or anything else. 1 protest against being asked to agree to the passage of a validating bill in those circumstances, and request the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to place the matter before Cabinet with a view to having all tariff schedules debated in this House. It is that when a tariff schedule is laid on is the table the duties it imposes become operative. I realise that we cannot, do other than allow the bill to pass.",44
131,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIF F VALIDATIO N,"Barker) [5.35J - It is many a long day since there was a tariff debate in this House. of The last, occasion which comes to my mind at all vividly was, I think, late in 1939, when the government of the day it met its "" Waterloo"" one night in connection with oil duties. The tariff has a. vital influence in the country areas of Australia. I believe that the Minister for Commerce ' and Agriculture (Mr. appreciates that point at least, because the costs of production of prihonormary industries in Australia depend largely upon the nature of the tariff, for that we keep in force, and in addition the possibilities of those industries securpart of ing markets overseas are affected thereby. At the present time. I am prein pared to concede that the Government is represented at a. trade conference that is being held at Geneva. My guess as to what may be the results of that conferwho ence is as good as that of anyone else. the The Minister and I may agree in that respect, and that would be rather dana gerous. My prediction is that, for all useful purposes, the results will be pracI tically nil. So the most which the Government can urge in support of this validating bill is that it desires to see the shape of what is produced at Geneva before involving the Parliament in .a - first-rcJass tariff debate. If we could bave - an undertaking given from the treasury bench that immediately the results of the Geneva conference were known the Government would initiate a full tariff -.debate, rand ithe various interests affected could begin to look at the - tariff, with 4II its .complexities and varieties,, .from 'the (Standpoint of postwar Australian conditions, .then I should 'be quite 'happy to let the bill pass without further comment. But I put it that the Government cannot expect the Parliament *to validate tariff s<""bfidules indefinitely noay 'that we : are in a period which, ,at :any rate, passes for peace, when Australian primary /and - secondary industries .should Jiave some concrete idea of what will b.e the .con-cli'tioiiis under which they will be permitted to operate. I frankly admit that all sorts of considerations in u-qgard to exchange, preference and so forth, are associated with this matter. If we are to be guided by press statements bearing upon the attitude of the United States of America in regard to wool duties which have appeared within the last few days, then the outlook is rather a murky one. Nevertheless, it may became clear. I put it to the Government very firmly that there s'liould be a full-dress tariff debate before 'the end of this year. Let us arrive at an understanding of what is to be the tariff policy of Australia for the next few years.",44
132,Mr HOLT,CUSTOMS TARIF F VALIDATIO N,"Fawkner) [5.39] -. I wish to add.a brief comment to those of other honourable members who desire that there shall be a .full review of our post-war tariff policy. I concede, with them, that there are very great practical difficulties in flic way of a complete review by the Government today. But surely the Government recognizes that both primary and secondary industry is in a state of uncertainty as to future possibilities! The question is not one merely of tariff - protection, or of .the degree to which ex.cise duties, imposed to meet the erncr,g.ency needs of war, are likely to become .a ^permanent >part of our revenue-raising methods of the future. There are also administrative developments, which have occurred during the war and are continuing today, and in respect of those .developments .the commercial and industrial community of Australia needs some guidance if it is to be enabled to plan efficiently for the future. One of those developments is governmental control of the importation of goods, sometimes for tie .purpose of conserving exchange, and at other times, perhaps, with the object - of - enabling Australian industries to .obtain an abnormal share of the markets - that are offering for their products. During the war there were security lieasons which made reasonable the im-position of these abnormal restrictions. But we are now .approaching ,the second full year of peace, and some of those emergency provisions are in line for :i-e\iiew. What is true of the restrictions on - the importation of goods is also true ijn like degree of the restrictions which operate today on the export of many, of rthe-products of Australia.. Far too much responsibility has been left with depart-mental officers, and too little with the body which should safeguard the interests of the community as a whole-the Parliament of the Commonwealth. Perhaps that was inevitable during the war years. But the time is long overdue, for the rea.sserti.on by this Parliament of its financial authority, its right to control what are really great policy issues in respect of these commercial - matters. Within recent months, and even years, the determination of the right kindof policy to pursue in - relation to the importation of goods and the .restrictions which should be imposed on She export of goods has beeu left to departmental officers. Their decisions may have .been, in the main, sound. Nevertheless, in the past decisions of that kind have rightly been veserved as being among the most important of those which this Parliament should make. So I suggest to the Government-and here T somewhat cut across what has been said by my colleaguesthat before the conclusion of the discussions at Geneva we should have a clear indication of - the Government's future policy in relation to these administrative procedures. I hope that, if .the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Pollard) does not feel fully equipped to deal with the .issues at this moment, - he - will have them - in mind as the subject of an early-statement to the Parliament.  Commerce and Agriculture) [5.48] in reply-The . honourable for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) has asktid to be assured that the Parliament will have an early opportunity to discuss tariff problems generally. That is a perfectly reasonable, request, and I assure him that it will be so considered. Immediately the circumstances reasonably permit an opportunity .will be afforded for a debate on tariff and excise policy generally. On the other hand, as the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) has pointed out, it is impossible at the moment to state specifically when, that event will occur. The honourable member for Barker has referred to the conversations that arc proceeding at the International Conference on Trade and . Employment, at Geneva. It would be impracticable for the Government, to bring down revigionary tariff or excise proposals nefore the outcome of those conversation** and of the conference discussions bad become known, bec-iinso it would, not know whether there would be an almost immediate need to make a. further revision j and the time of the Parliament would have been wasted, whilst there might ensue a state of chaos in industry generally and a state of industrial disturbance all round. In the circumstances, I hope that the Opposition will accept my assurance that a tariff discussion will take place immediately the circumstances make if, reasonable. I do not know that it is desperately urgent; because, as the result of war activities, and of the fact that, Australia has come out of the conflict less injured in regard to its industrial capacity than has any other country, our secondary industries, in particular, are happily in a rather sound position. It is a rare thing to receive from the representatives of any secondary industry a request for additional tariff protection, and as for rhe primary industries, insofar as they are affected by the country's fiscal policy, it is seldom that any coinplaint is heard. I agree substantially with the honourable member Fawkner (Mr Holt ) , who argued that export and import restrictions and prohibitions should be reduced to a minimum. I hope that the International Conference on Trade and Employment at Geneva will be successful, and that when, the agreements reached there eventually come member before this Parliament for ratification they will be discussed in a non-party manner', and that honourable members, when considering them, will be actuated only by a desire to raise the general standard of living in this and other countries.

SKCO.NI> RKADI.NH.  for Commerce and Agriculture) [*>.47|. - by leave- I moveTlnifc tire bill be now rend it second time. The purpose of this bill is to validate collection of duties and excise imposed by excise tariff proposals No. 1 of the 14th November, 1946. The bill has a similar effect to that of the bill just passed by the House. Mr MCEwEif - On what items were excise duties imposed?  on petrol, shale products, and coke and coal distillates, as explained when the proposals were introduced in November last.",45
133,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"Barker) [5.50] - I should like to learn, from the Government just what is the present, position of the shale oil industry, because there is an excise duty upon shale oil. When the original legislation was passed setting up a shale oil industry in .Australia, I was on the other side of the House, and I was somewhat critical of the proposal. I did not believe that it would be successful, and I said so'. I said that for not enough money was being appropriated for the purpose, and I added that if the Australian Navy had to depend for oil on what was produced at Glen Davis it would never get to sea at all. That was before the war. We have not had a complete story of what has happened since, and it would be a good thing if the Minister were to make a statement setting out the financial commitments of the Commonwealth under the Glen Davis scheme. I understand that, by the exercise of certain powers during the war, without reference to this Parliament, the Commonwealth commitments have been increased. Under the original arrangement, New South Wales was to provide 25 per cent, of the capital for the enterprise, the proprietors of Davis Gelatine (Australia) Proprietary Limited were to provide 25 per cent, and the Commonwealth was to provide 50 per cent. I should like to know what are the financial coiniuitments of the three parties under the existing arrangement. What losses have heen incurred by the Commonwealth on this interesting enterprise, and how much crude oil has been produced at Glen Davis? I have no authentic information on the subject from government sources, except what I have gleaned from the Auditor-General's report, and such reports, although sometimes very revealing, are in many respects unsatisfactory. It is doubtful whether the Minister for Commerce and Agri of this measure, is .able to give the information which I seek. Therefore, I suggest that when the hill gets into committee further consideration should be postponed until the information is available. I understand that excise duty is to be collected on spirit distilled from wheat, just as it is collected on spirit distilled shale. from sugar-cane products. A great deal of Commonwealth money has been exHouse pended on the erection of power alcohol distilleries in Australia. Some of us believe that there was a good deal of party political influence exercised in determinfor ing the location of the distilleries, even so though we might believe that, in no circumstances, would a government stoop to placing a distillery in a particular locality in order to improve the political chances of an independent member, who were was one of the Frankenstein, brothers.  member suggest that party politics played any part in the Glen Davis project?",46
134,Mr AECHIE CAMERON,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"If the Minister will look up the records, he will see that I criticized the Glen Davis project from the beginning, and he must now admit that my criticism has been justified by events. I could never understand why we should expect a man, who had been successful in making gelatine out of calves' hoofs to be eqtially successful in producing oil from shale. Thedistilleries erected for the purpose of making spirit from wheat are still in existence. There is one in the electorate of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull), and another in the electorate of the honourable member for Grey (Mr Russell), while others are scattered in various places throughout Australia. The war is now over, and we ought to be told what is the policy of the Government regarding such enterprises. Some of the revenue from excise duties levied upon other industries has been used, I have no doubt, to build power alcohol distilleries. .",47
135,Mr SPEAKER,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,This bill has nothing to do with the products of those distilleries.,47
136,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"I appreciate that, because the distilleries have, in fact, produced nothing.",47
137,Mr SPEAKER,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,Neithe r can the honourable member go on producing speeches about them.,47

139,Mr WHITE,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"Balaclava) [5.57] - The was very generous to allow the previous bills to go through without much debate; but this bill, which provides the collection of millions of pounds in excise, duties, cannot be allowed to pass easily.

Mr WHITE - AV e have not been told what it is about. I refuse to let the bill go through until we arc given an adequate explanation.",47
140,Unknown,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,Sitting suspended from 6 to S p.m.,48
141,Mr MCEWEN,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"Indi) [8.0] - Before the suspension of the sitting we were endeavouring to debate a bill which had been brought before us by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Pollard) regarding the invalidation of certain excise tariff collections. I purposely said that we were endeavouring to debate the bill because honourable members had been reduced to complete inability to do so intelligently because of the absence of information regarding the items on which the duties are to be validated by the bill. Just bow meagre was the information given to the House may best be illustrated by a perusal of the notice-paper fcr today in which, nnder government business, we find notice of motion No. 3, which reads to briny in a'bill foe an act to provide validation of collections of duties of excise under Excise Tariff Proposals. All honourable members will agree that that conveys no more than that some proposal was to be brought, before the House relating to an excise tariff. Just what the proposal was to be we were not told. Honourable members thus bad no opportunity to give it serious consideration nor to decide how they should vote upon it. It was upon that foundation that the Minister made what, by courtesy, I must describe as a second-reading speech. It was so brief that I might be permitted to read it in full. The honourable gentleman saidThis bill seeks to validate the collections of duties of excise imposed by Excise TariffProposals No. 1 of the 14th November, 1940. The bill has a similar effect to that of the preceding validation bills. Upon that comprehensive array of information the House is invited to record its vote. I do-not know whether the Minister himself knew what it was all about. It is obvious that he must have known because when I asked, by interjection, what items were involved, the honourable gentleman replied that they embraced petrol, petroleum, shale products, coke and coal distillates. I ask the House, and the wider audience which the Government has been good enough to make aware of our proceedings, if it is not complete abrogation of the purposes of the Parliament to bring down a bill of this kind and without any explanation of its purpose expect honourable members to vote on it? In my spare time during the suspension of the sitting I endeavoured to discover what was proposed. I have not the slightest doubt that honourable members arrayed behind the ministerial bench, who may be depended upon to fall into line and vote for all government measures, have not the foggiest idea of what this measure is designed to achieve. Not one of them can say by interjection just what is proposed.",48
142,Mr SPEAKER,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"Order ! The honourable member must, not encourage interjections.",48
143,Mr MCEWEN,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"You r .protection, Mr Speaker, was never more kindly extended. I have been listening for a lone interjection, but there is complete silence. for the Obviously, no honourable.member opposite knows what it is about, but all of them are prepared to vote for it. Was there ever a greater travesty of parliamentary government than that? It is fantastic to think that a measure such as this, which involves millions of pounds, is one about which not even one honourable member sitting behind the Government knows anything:  were tabled in November, 1946, a memorandum was circulated which explained, them fully. I did. not think it necessary to circulate the memorandum again.",48
144,Mr MCEWEN,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"The Minister says that a memorandum was circulated! Why, we are constantly doing our best to avoid being inundated with explanatory memoranda by the Government. I am trying to discover what circular was issued to members in the month of November, 1946, which related to excise duties. The. bill does not say whether these excise duties relate to beer, petrol, tobacco, or carbonic acid gas; it merely refers to duties of excise. The Minister has told us the' month and the year in which the explanatory memorandum was eiiv.ulated, and upon that foundation we are expected to proceed to work - In respect of ordinary legislative matters I have said frequently that the Government has ""reduced the Parliament to a .mere rubber stamp. Legislative proposals are endorsed in the Labour caucus room where final decisions are made. They are then submitted to the Parliament for approval, the Government invariably using the weight of its number to bludgeon them through. As Omar Khayyam saidTlie moving finger writes: mid having writ, moves on: Nor all your piety nor wit Shall lure it back to cancel half a line Nor all your tears wash out a word of it. Omar Khayyam must have bad some prescience of what would happen under Labour's administration. We are not even treated with the courtesy of being told what items of excise duties are to be validated, whether they relate to beer, tobacco, playing cards or the numerous other items that are the subject of excise track at last, duties today. By devoting much time f,o research, I have discovered that bill relates to the Government's proposal to reduce the excise duty on petrol by a gallon-wit h some trimmings, of course - bu t there is something about beer in The schedule defines beer and provides that the rates are to be unaltered.. We can perhaps agree to that with priate disappointment.",48
145,Mr CHIFLEY,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"Wit h respect to beer, the proposal is to adopt a different method of levying the same toll.",49
146,Mr MCEWEN,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,The Government does not change its method of levying a tolL without some motive for doing so.,49
147,Mr CHITXET,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,The new method will save man-power and reduce expense.,49
148,Mr MCEWEN,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"I thank the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) for filling in some of the gaps left by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. I have ascertained that, the schedule proposes a reduction of the excise on petrol. If we had had adequate warning of the purposes of this bill many of us would undoubtedly have expressed strong views on the quantitative amount of the reduction and on the destination of the revenue raised from that source.  reduction of exruse duty on petrol in the bill.",49
149,Mr MCEWEN,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"There is exactly nothing in the bill beyond the fact that its purpose is to validate certain collections of excise duty. From my researches I have discovered that the schedule to which the bill relates refers among other things to petrol, petrol products, benzine, and napthalene, on which an excise of 8£d. a gallon is imposed. I understand that the purpose of the measure now before us is to reduce the excise duty on those items by Id. a gallon,- the excise being formerly 9kl. a gallon. The Minister says there is nothing about a reduction "" of excise duty on petrol, but it is obvious that, the only purpose of the bill is to reduce that duty, by Id. a gallon.  has corrected himself. He is on the right",49
150,Mr MCEWEN,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,In his second-reading the speech the Minister did not say enough about the bill to need to correct himself. Id . Upon examining the schedule one finds that there is a discriminating excise on it. petrol in favour of petrol produced by National Oil Proprietary Limited-the Glen Davis project. There is a. sad .story approabout the Glen Davis project.,49
151,Mr DEDMAIT,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,Who started it?,49
152,Mr MCEWEN,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"To its great credit a government formed by the present Opposition started that project. It is, however, not responsible for the calamitous loss incurred on the venture. The project was designed to enable this country to some degree to avoid dependence on imported petrol and it is regrettable that it was not as successful as its originators hoped it would be. Private citizens as well as governments are financially involved in it. The balance-sheet of National Oil Proprietary Limited shows that of the total capital the Commonwealth invested £2,000,000, the Government of New South Wales £166^000, and Mr George Davis, of New South Wales, £325,000 in the venture. The project was never regarded as anything but experimental. As I have said, its objective, which was to make this country to some degree self-sufficient, was of the highest national importance. Mr Davis and his associates have not received a penny in return for their investment, and are no doubt in jeopardy of losing the whole of it. Had I been given time to consider this legislation properly I probably should advocate that the excise on the product of the National Oil Proprietary Limited, might well be abolished, instead of reduced by only i d . a gallon, because the Commonwealth Government owns 90 per cent, of the shares. But, having been denied the opportunity of considering the implications, I do not commit myself to that. The House is entitled to time to consider all proposals that come before it.. Mem, bers ought not be forced say, as I have had to say, "" I am not . sure what I would do if I had time to consider the matter "". This proposal refers also to excise on petrol produced by The Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. The capital invested in the company is £750,000, as near as I have been able to discover in the little while I have had available to me since the bill was brought down. The Commonwealth Government holds 5 per cent, of the shares,, and an overseas company the remainder. The balance sheet for 1946 shows that this - government-controlled enterprise sold its produets at such high prices as to reap a net profit of nearly £224,195 after paying £690,000 tax. The company is half-way towards socialism. We have been told by members of the Labour party that the object of converting an enterprise from private ownership to government ownership is to protect the people against exploitation by great companies and financial organizations. Socialized enterprise is supposed to be Mr Mem wen. non-profit making. Labour 'claims that most of the terrible things that afflict mankind spring from the profit motive. Yet that company in 1946 made a gross profit of nearly £1,000,000, which, after payment of taxes left a net profit of £224,195, on which it paid a dividend of 12 per cent. This legislation may or may not, be approved, but the Parliament is at least entitled to be told its implications by the Government. Yet the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and  reading speech of only five lines. Private motorists and people dependent on petroleum products for industrial purposes in this country might well consider that the Government could do with less revenue from the company of which it is the parent. Under ho previous administration has it been able to exploit the people as it must have exploited them last year. Casting my eye over its profits I find that in recent years, in round figures they were £224,000 in 1946, £156,000 in 1945, £197,000 in 1944, £95,000 in 1943, £15,000 in 1942, £13,000 in 1941 and £93,000 in 1940. I have not been able to ascertain the profits in 1939, but they decline on a steady curve to £57,000 in 1936.. If an enterprise established on governmental capital is to be used to exploit the people to that degree, it should be understood that that is the way that the Labour policy operates. This has a far-reaching effect not only on the people that buy the products of The Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited but also on the profits of its competitors. 'Sales of The Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited are incomparably smaller than of other petrol companies. Who sets the tune? Do the great British and American companies, the Shell Oil Company Limited and the Vacuum Oil Company Limited set the price level or does The Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited? If last year the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited which made a gross profit of £946,000 and a net profit of £224,000 is as inefficient as most governmental enterprises how much higher must have been the profits of its competitors with their vastly greater turnover and more efficient management? The Labotir party has something to answer there. I hope the G overnment does "" not think that we are so inept that it can get away with this sort of thing. We - will not let it. It is time the cynicism of the Labour party towards parliamentary government was brought to a halt. Every time the Government treats the parliamentary in stitution so cynically as to introduce an important measure like this with a. fiveline second-reading speech we will expose it. We will, not tolerate the Parliament being made a rubber stamp to endorse, the decisions of the Labour caucus. We will bring that policy to an end or expose it to the public gaze whenever it is applied. The bill proposes to validate the collection of an excise duty of Sid. a gallon on petrol. Perhaps when the petrol duty was originally imposed, it. was of importance mainly to private motorists, but, increasingly, petrol is becoming a. highly important factor in industry, both primary end secondary. It is of immense importance to men on the land, on whose behalf ! spvak. Yet. we were to have been tricked into missing the opportunity ol expressing opinions on the maintenance of a punitive tax of 8-id. a gallon on petrol, which is only I d . less.than the wartime rate. That small reduction has been made when the Government is embarrassed, not by a shortage of revenue, but by the excess of revenue pouring into the coffers of the .Treasury. When the Federal Aids Roads Agreement Bill is introduced I shall have something to say. about the distributionof revenue from petrol. I content myself now by condemning the Government, for the manner in which if is treating the Parliament. We will oppose, and expose every instance of that sort of treatment of the Parliament by the Administration.",49
153,Mr LANG,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"(Beid) [ 8 . 2 9 ] - I quite innocently raised the question why this and other like bills were brought down. On the face of it. this is a bill to validate collection.'- of excise. It aroused my curiosity. Why does the Government want to make legal something that is illegal? Tho first, measure which the Ministe'r introduced was the Customs Tariff V a l idation Bill . Not knowing the procedure of this House thoroughly, I looked on and marvelled. When the Minister (Mr . Pollard) introduced the second bill, 1 asked him for an explanation. The right honourable member for Yarra (Mr . Scullin) was good enough to .explain to use that in .19(52, when tin: financial and economic depression gripped the world, be bad been compelled to take extraordinary measures in order to combat its effects in Australia. Then the Minister rose to enlighten me f u r the r ; but a discussion developed on another matter, and he overlooked me. The House is now considering - the Excise Tariff Validation Bill , and it has aroused my innocent curiosity. During the suspension of the sitting. I examined the tariff proposals which the Minister laid upon - the table of the House last November. He explained that, those proposals must be validated before the 14tli May next. If they are not validated, they will become in operative. Even so, the Government should not attempt to rush this legislation through the House. The Government should not say. "" Time is pressing, and we must pass this legislation as a matter of urgency. "" Froin the stand-point of the Government there is no urgency, because it controls the sittings of the Parliament,. However, the Government chooses to ignore that fact. Mr CONKI.A.V - The honourable member for Beid will lie running away next month;",51
154,Mr LANG,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"-The honourable member for Griffith (Mir. Conelan) has run away often, but no one has ever seen me run away. Mr COI\\I-.I.AN- - The honourable member ran away when he was Premier of New South Wales.",51
155,Mr LANG,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"I did not. The honourable member ran away from Australia when he was being pressed. It is regrettable that lie represents a constituency bearing the name of a great Australian. If the honourable member wants to hand it out. he can have it back. . He has a loud voice and screams interjections at my back. But I can deal with him. I was saying, when I was so rudely interrupted, that the Government has the authority to determine how long this Parliament shall sit, and how long it will require to finish certain business. The Government cannot claim that it is pressed for time, because it controls days and hours of sitting. That being it. so, the explanation which the right honourable member for Yarra offered regarding pressure of time disappears. Therefore, some other reason must exist for this baste. Of that reason I have no knowledge. It may be good, and I may be prepared to accept it when I am told what it is. However, the .Minister has not courteous enough to explain why the vernment is endeavouring to force this legislation through the Parliament with such haste. In the circumstances, every sugar . . . "" honourable member has a duty to examine these proposals. The excise and tariff proposals, which alcohol. the Minister laid on the table of the House last November, cover many items. I. have not had time to examine all of them thoroughly. I had no knowledge, and I am sure that other honourable memcovered bers did not know that this matter would be raised today. These bills have been suddenly sprung on the House. Honoromitted. able members will notice that an asterisk is placed against these three bills on the notice-paper, indicating that appeared on the notice-paper for the first time. .In other words, the Minister did good logic. not obtain leave to introduce them day, present them and move that they be read a first time on the second day, and then move the second reading on the third day. The Government hopes that these bills will be hurried through the House in a few moments. I hope that they will not. Making a rough scrutiny of the annual report of the Auditor General upon the Treasurer's statement of receipts and expenditure, several interesting items - For example, on page 1'3G I found under the heading "" Power Alcohol Distilleries "" which are covered ""by the Excise Tariff Validation Bill",51

I realise that it may be difficult to police these matters; but it - is important that farmers should know exactly how they .are affected by this in situation.

Commerce and Agriculture) [S.51J - in reply- I wish to refer, first, to the display of mock indignation by the honourable member for ' Indi (Mr MCEwen) who has complained that he has not been supplied with sufficient information on (lie bill now before us. The plain fact is that the schedules to which, this bill and the two associated measures relate were tabled in the House last November, and at that time. I not only explained the purpose of the schedules, but also circulated memorandums in relation to them which gave full information regarding both the customs and excise duties.",53
174,Mr MCEWEN,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"I have read the Hansard report of the Minister's remarks on that occasion and there is no reference in it to the item to which I referred. Mir. POLLARD - I made a full explanation, and that is the plain truth. The honourable gentleman's mock indignation is the more remarkable seeing that lie was absent from , the House this afternoon when I introduced the first of these measures.",54
175,Mr MCEWRIV,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,I was in the House this afternoon.  gentleman was present and could not understand the import of the bills that is no fault of mine. He quoted from Omar Khayyam this evening. I shall also make a quotation from that source.,54
176,Mr SPEAKER,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"I hope that the Minister does not intend to bring the jug of wine here.  Speaker. I direct attention to these words:Myself, when young, rlicl eagerly frequent, Doctor and saint and heard great argument, About it and about, but evermore Went out by that same door as in I went. That applies to the honourable member for Indi . Hud be been present in the House when I introduced the first of these vji.lidfi.ting bills this afternoon he would have realized .that the schedule referred to therein provided for a reduction of customs duty of I d . per gallon on petrol. The measure now before the House validates a reduction of excise duty of I d . a gallon. The first-mentioned amount, relates to oils and petrols imported in refined condition : the' second-mentioned, to oils and petrols refined from shales in this country. The reason for the reduction of I d . in each case was to preserve existing margins. In that respect the Government is honouring an undertaking given by previous governments, including the Menzies Government. The margin operating in respect of imported refined petrols and oils is 5J;d. a gallon, and that in respect of petrols and oils refined from .local shales is 7.5d. a gallon. When the original proposals were introduced an undertaking was given by the Menzies Government that the margins would be preserved until .1.955. The introduction of this measure, therefore, honours a. promise of the Menzies Government.. In these circumstances, I am astonished that the honourable member for Indi should have spoken in opposition to the bill. I am surprised, also, because the reduction of excise is beneficial to the users of tractors in primary-producing industries, as well as, of course, to other people. It is for the reasons that I have given that I consider that the honourable member for Indi has been responsible for a display of mock indignation. Had be taken the trouble to refresh his mind on the history of this subject, he would not have spoken as be did. Apparently, the honourable gentleman did not read his notice-paper this morning, otherwise he would have realized that these measures were listed for consideration today. I hope that, the honourable member for Reid (Mir. Lang) does not consider that. I have jmen. guilty of any studied discourtesy' to him. I believe that he will admit that since he has been, a member of this House I have carefully refrained from indulging in discourtesy towards him. The time was, of course, when I was in the habit of being courteous .to him. I have had no occasion to be discourteous. The only reason why I did not reply to the second-reading speech of the honourable gentleman was that 1 was forestalled by the right honourable member for Yarra.

193,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"Barker) [9.7] - The purpose of the clause is to validate the collections that have been made under the excise tariff proposals that were introduced in this Parliament last November. In those proposals, there is a reference to the imposition of differential duties on the products of National Oil Proprietary Limited. view of the statement that, for each gallon not exceeding 10,000,000 gallons produced in any one year commencing on the 1st, day of January the duty shall he 3d. a gallon, and for each gallon exceeding 10.000,000 gallons in each year comrnojncing on the 1st day of January the duty shall be Sid. a gallon, it would appear that a differential duty of 5£d. a. gallon operates as soon as the production exceeds 10,000,000 gallons a year. I.should like to know whether the Minister has been good enough to obtain the information for which I asked before the suspension of the sitting, with a. view to enabling the committee to have some idea of how this imposition of excise is affecting the production of oil from shale at Glen Davis. T am deeply concerned about this matter because, as the Minister will recall, I was severely critical of this project when it was first brought down by the Government. I have noted from the Auditor-General's report that the Government's commitment has increased from an initial amount of £334,000. To-day, the capital invested is £334,000, but there have been additional loans from "" the Commonwealth amounting to £2,246,000. The losses are rather staggering. This duty may be affecting the ability of the company to pay dividends. Up to date, the company has not paid a dividend. The committee should have before it information which would enable it to decide whether the rate of duty is affecting the ability of National Oil Proprietary Limited, as it is now called, to pay a dividend to its shareholders. The losses would not be so great were it not for the undisclosed amount of duty which the company is paying. Those losses have been: On the , first year's operations in 1940, £1S0,000; in 1941, £177,000; in 1942, £263,000; in 1943, £296,000; in 1944, £303,000; and in 1945, £343,000. One is . led to ask what is the effect of the differential duty upon the profit and loss account of National Oil Proprietary Limited. What strikes me most forcefully is that the annual loss becomes greater with every Wales. . I do not know whether the State increase of Government advance. The Mr Archie Cameron. committee is at a great disadvantage in arriving at a decision,, because of a complete lack of information. The Minister In has not been prepared to take us into his confidence, and tell us w hat is the annual 7 rate of production - at Glen Davis, how much of its production is bearing an excise duty of 3d. a gallon and how much a duty of S-Jd. a gallon, either during his second-reading speech, or on that other famous occasion last November to which he has referred in such forceful terms in reply to the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen). If the committee had that information, it would be in a position to arrive at a decision. This is not the end of the Commonwealth's commitments. The Auditor-General has shown that the Commonwealth Bank loaned the company £250,000. The Commonwealth Government must have repaid thatamount to the Commonwealth Bank at some time in 1944. It would appear that the Commonwealth Bank considered that the duty imposed was a little too "" hot"", and that the security was not, sufficiently . good. Therefore, the Commonwealth Bank came to the conclusion that the financial ""baby"" had better be carried by the Commonwealth Government rather than by itself. That is another important point. The Auditor-General has stated that the loans advanced by the Commonwealth for the purpose of this undertaking amounted to £3,091,000 at the 30th June, 1946. Since then, the company has bad another advance of £325,229, and a. bank guarantee of £100,000; with what bank has not been stated. It is estimated that a further amount of £250,000 will be necessary to finance the undertaking to the stage of production. An advance of this amount was approved by Cabinet in June. 1946, and £200,000 of it had been paid to the company when this report was being compiled. Interest accrued, but unpaid from the 1st January, 1942, to the 30th June, 1946, on advances made by the Commonwealth, amounted to £287,000 a year, in addition to those duties that are due to the Commonwealth, which are very definitely affected by the amount of excise which the company will have to pay on whatever the production may be. There is also the interest that is due to the State, of New South is receiving that interest or not. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang) might have been able to enlighten us, but for the fact that he has been out office there for a considerable time. have noticed that be has seemed a little diffident in lindyig his way about in this rather peaceful place, having come from - the more stormy atmosphere of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. The point that. I want to arrive at is, whether the Minister will make a stateconfirms my belief. ment before the passage of this validating measure or, in the event of the Governsaid that. ment once again using its brutal majority to push it through the committee, whether he will salve our wounded feelings to extent of undertaking that, in due course, lie will make a statement to the House showing very clearly the production, the commitments and projected committhe ments of the Commonwealth in respect of National Oil Proprietary Limited. I am most anxious to have the figures relating to production, because, when legislation went through the Parliament originally, I was one who severely critiself cized it, and said that, if we bad to rely on Glen Davis, as it was then called, provide crude oil for the Australian Navy, our naval vessels would never go sea. .F should be very interested to the extent to which the production National Oil Proprietary Limited enabled the Australian Commonwealth to keep going during the last war.",55
194,Mr MCEWEN,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"Indi) [9.13] - Clause 3 is the operative clause of the bill. purpose is to validate the collections have been made under the excise tariff proposals, and to perpetuate until there further legislation the collection of excise at the rates fixed. At the second-reading stage, I made clear a point which I shall now repeat, namely, that I support the proposed reduction of excise duty. fortunately, I cannot move an amendment which would have the effect of increasnot ing the amount of the proposed reducvernment, tion. At the second-reading stage I also made it clear that if I had any criticism to offer it was that the reduction was not sufficient. The Minister for Commerce  sented me when he said that I was opposed to the reduction.  of the sort.",57
195,Mr MCEWEN,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"If the Minister maintains that he did not say anything of of the sort, I accept his assurance. But I that is what I thought I heard him say. and that is what all my colleagues who sit behind me also understood him to say.  as is the honourable member.",57
196,Mr MCEWEN,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"Every one of them Mr TuRifBu LL - Yes , the Minister",57
197,Mr MCEWEN,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"The Minister the chatters so much that he can scarcely be expected to remember what he said. I am not concerned with that, but I want and to make my position-clear. I support reduction, and I criticized it only on the ground that it was not large enough. My general criticism of the incajure arose from the fact that the explanation the given by the Minister was inadequate. The Minister has again addressed himto the subject, but he has left us to still substantially uninformed. I shall not persist in a hopeless effort to obtain to full information, but I wish to ask the learn Minister a question about one matter of which concerns my constituency perhaps more than any other-What is the excise duty on benzol? It appears in the schedule under the general classification of coal tar and coke distillates. Most of the tobacco produced in Australia Its is grown in my electorate. Some years that ago, the industry was'almost wiped out, by a. disease known as blue mould, which is attacked the plants as seedlings. Due to the magnificent work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, under Dr Angel, it was discovered that seedlings could be raised by growing them in Unan enclosed place containing trays of benzol. This research was carried out, during the regime of the present Gobut under that of the Lyons Government, which established a special fund for the purpose. If benzol were not available it would be impossible to continue the tobacco-growing industry, a with which all tobacco growers, in Victoria at any rate, will agree. I do not know what the position in regard to blue mould is in tropical districts.",57
198,Mr A HERMANN,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"The position same in the north. Mr M.cEWEN - Then it is the same all over Australia. It follows that if the industry would be wiped out through benzol being unobtainable, its existence could be seriously threatened if benzol became too expensive. I am being invited to vote for this measure, and I ask the Minister in charge of the bill what is the excise duty on benzol? He is now going off to make an inquiry of some one else, showing that he has come hero in charge of this bill without knowing much about it. According to the schedule, the duty could be 3d. a gallon or 4-J-d. a gallon, or there could be no duty at all.",58
199,Mr CHIFLEY,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"Macquarie - Prime Minister and Treasurer) [9.20] - There i> no desire to hide 'from Parliament any particulars regarding the operation of National Oil Proprietary Limited. Honourable members are aware that this enterprise was embarked upon during the term of office of the Lyons Government, the idea, - being to produce from shale petrol that might be available in case of emergency. I have no quarrel with the original objective. I was not in Parliament at the time; but I was always very doubtful of the prospects of success, even, though the Newnes shale deposits happened to be in the electorate which I hoped to represent. The technical advice submitted in tin; first place was apparently very bad. As a result of this advice, retorts of a kind used in Scotland and Czechoslovakia were installed, but at Glen Davis they did not produce the expected results. Newnes shale has a very high oil content,- and the retorts at first used were not capable of recovering much more than. half , of it. Mr Keith Butler, manager of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited in Newcastle, is chairman of directors of National Oil Proprietary Limited, and he has great faith in the ultimate success of the enterprise. He is giving his services absolutely free in this capacity, not even drawing expenses, and he has been able to give valuable advice on the technical side. His confidence in the undertaking is so great that the Government is prepared to continue its support, in is the the hope that this confidence will be justified. I do not believe that all the capital which has been put into the project can be recovered, but if a reasonable amount is written off it might be economically successful. As Treasurer, I should have liked to make a statement to Parliament setting out the financial position, but I have been asked by those associated with it to let the matter stand over until the.y can prove that the reorganization now being effected is cap-able of producing results. I am responsible for the Commonwealth money being used, but, as Mr Butler is so confident of ultimate success, we are prepared to give him an opportunity to justify his confidence.",58
200,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,What is the annual production?,58
201,Mr CHIFLEY,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"It is estimated at. 10,000,000 gallons a year. I repeat that there is no desire on the part of the Government to conceal anything, and I am not withholding a statement because the enterprise is situated in my electorate. .1 believe that the experiments now proceeding will be successful.",58
202,Mr LANG,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,How long will those experiments take?,58
203,Mr CHIFLEY,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"I understand that the production of oil per ton of shale has already improved greatly. With the old retorts it was approximately 50 gallons a ton, whereas it had originally been hoped to recover between 90 and 95 gallons a ton. The new retorts, I believe, are recovering about 80 gallons a ton. A full statement regarding the enterprise will be made in due course.",58
204,Mr ANTHONY,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"Richmond) [9.25] I am grateful for the explanation offered by the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley). As a Minister of the Government which was in office in 1941, I remember that we were very much concerned over the losses being sustained in this venture. It was originally proposed that the deposit? should be worked by a private company, which would receive assistance from the Government of New South Wales and the Commonwealth Government. The company contributed £166,000, the Government of New South Wales a similar amount, and the Commonwealth Government £334,000. However, as time went on, the company more or less disappeared from f l it picture been use it found that its finances did not permit it to carry, ou. The Commonwealth, being committed to the project, was compelled to go on, particularly as war had broken out. and it was necessary to get petrol at any cost. Iii 1937-3S the Commonwealth Governiiie:ii't advanced £334,000; at the present rime, its total contribution to the enterprise amounts to .C2_.500.000. The Prime Minister said he was hopeful that, as a result of receiving new technical advice, and installing new retorts, some success would be achieved. That was the story told us in 1941. It was then said, "" Only give us time. The original company made a great mistake in installing obsolete retorts, which were uneconomic in the production of shale oil. Let us get new retorts from the United States of America. W the Commonwealth will only put in a little more money, we will make good."" That was in .1942. Since then the losses have been as follows:Wiir. 104 2 .. .. . . 2fix.oof i V.I4S .. ' . . 2'lll.i'UO. 1044 . . - iOM.OOO 1.0-10 H42.000 Those are the Auditor-General's figures, and they show that every year the loss has been increasing. The Treasurer is the custodian of the taxpayers' money, and I should like to know how innc.b patience ho has in the expenditure of that money on an enterprise which is not giving a f a ir return. I realise the immense difficulty of making a decision in a case like this, but there must be some point beyond which the Government will not continue to advance money for unproductive work. The old story of the retorts being obsolete has bad a fair trial. I . hope that the Prime Minister, who has close, personal knowledge of the Glen Davis project, will inform the House of the latest costs, because the figures supplied in the Auditor-General's report bring us up to 1945 only. We do not know what losses were incurred last year or this year, or whether the company has yet turned the corner towards success. Honourable members are entitled to up to date information on these matters. The Minister might also furnish figures relating to production. ",58
205,Mr ANTHONY,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"T t is more or kvs a, formality to impose an excise duty on the product of the company and at the same time recoup it for its losses. Excise of 3d. a gallon levied on 10,000,000 gallons proilucts a ' revenue of £125,00(1. an amount less than one-half the loss sustained by the company in one year. The excise charge, is merely a bookkeeping entry which, as far as. excise revenue is concerned is misleading. The Treasurer should look into the matter with a view to relieving the company of the excise charge until such time as the venture Decom.es a profitable undertaking.  Coniuierce arid Agriculture [9.32] - The honourable member for Barker (Mr . Archie Cameron) and the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) requested information concerning the production of oil from shale and other aspects of"", the great undertaking at Glen Davis. The Labour Administration first took office in 1941 and cannot be held responsible for the situation that existed prior to that year. The company's figures show that for 1.94.1 -42 the quantity of oil produced from shale was 1,769.000 gu 11 on s. and - 111 at the re veni I e. collected thereon in the form of excise was £29.483. In 1.942-43, under the direction of a Labour government the output was so improved as to read a total of 2.142,1 Si gallons, the yield of revenue in the form of excise amounting to £35,C9S. By 1943-44 there was a'substantial drop in.production, due to lack of man-power and the fact that we were then in the most critical stage of the war, and also, no doubt, to some deterioration of the plant. In that year production dropped to 1,322,000 gallons, and the revenue from excise to £22,000. In .1944-45 production improved slightly, the output being 1.492.000 gallons, the excise being £24.000.' In 1945-46 due to the factors referred to by the Prime Minister to-night, and no doubt, to the very efficient, management supplied gratis by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company L i m i ted, and to improved plant and better methods of operation, the output increased to 2.032,000 gallons and the excise to £34,000. It may appear strange, as the honourable member for Richmond has said, that, notwithstanding that the losses incurred by the company are still being met by the Government, excise duty is still imposed on the company's products. That is possibly due to the fact that some machinery has to be established for the collection of the excise from I Itu consuming public. That is a matter for the financial wizards of the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Cus-' toms to work out. If excise duty were not imposed it would be difficult to collect the full price from the consuming public. Another factor which must be borne in mind is that a small quantity of oil from shale is produced elsewhere than at Glen Davis. The honourable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen) very pertinently asked what theseproposals meant in relation to benzol which is used by tobacco-growers in various parts of Australia, particularly in his own electorate. Like the honourable member for Indi, I have always been very interested in the welfare of' the tobacco-growers and it has been my constant aim to do every thing possible to assist them. The use of benzol for the prevention of diseases that attack the tobacco plant is a new development and the bill proposes"" a reduction of Id a gallon in respect of excise duty levied on benzol used for that purpose.",59
206,Mr FADDEN,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"Darling Downs Leader of the Australian Country party) [9.37] - I was interested to hear the  to the. advances made by the Glen Davis project under the sympathetic administration of Labour Governments. The honourable gentleman failed, however, to relate the true financial results of that venture. According to the Auditor General's report, in the year 1941, before a Labour Government became responsible for the undertaking the loss sustained was £177,219. In 1942, after Labour had assumed office, the loss increased to £263,123; in 1943 to £296,981; in 1944 to £303,788: and in 1945 to £342,055. The results for 1945 arc the latest available figures. 1 draw specific attention to the comments made on this venture by the Auditor-General. In his report for 1945I 46 the Auditor-General saidBetween. 1st January and 30th June, 1940, the Coimnonwea.lth advanced amounts totalling £185,918, increasing the amount of Commonwealth funds advanced for the purposes of this undertaking to £3,091,735. This amount includes £325,22!) for the Pish River Water Scheme, and £150,000 for working expenses, but does nut include a bank guarantee of £100,000 also for working expenses. It was estimated that a further amount of £250,000 was necessary to finance the undertaking to the stage of production. An advance of this amount was approved by Cabinet in June, 194(i. £200,000 of which had been paid to the Company when this report was being compiled. Interest accrued hut uivpaid from 1st January, 1942, to 30th June, 1.940, on advances made by the Commonwealth amounted to £2S7,009. So, in addition to the losses I have outlined, there is an accumulated loss of £2S7,069 in respect of unpaid interest. When the Minister points with pride to the increase of the output of this venture, he also should say that it has resulted in great financial loss to the taxpayers and the nation.",60
207,Mr BARNARD,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"Bass-Minister for Repatriation) [9.40] - This measure has relation to the excise on oil from shale processed at Glen Davis. When, in 1937, the National Oil Proprietary Limited Agreement Bill was introduced into this House by a. former Minister for Defence, Sir Archdale Parkhill, the honourable gentleman in glowing terms predicted a very bright future .for the venture, stressing the great advantages it would confer upon the nation. I believe that the only honourable member supporting the government of the day who opposed the measure was the present honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), and he offered trenchant criticism of the proposal. In introducing the measure, Sir Archdale Parkhill paid a great tribute to the former honourable member for Macquarie, Mr John Lawson, for the important part he had played in the negotiations which led up to the establishment of this industry. It is true that the venture has not measured up to the high hopes held by the government responsible for it. What does the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr. Fadden) suggest should be done about it?",60
208,Mr FADDEN,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,That is not the point. object to the Minister merely telling half truths about the undertaking.,60
209,Mr BARNARD,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"It is easy to be critical. I remind the right honourable gentleman that he was a member of the Government responsible for the establishment of the undertaking and that its management has not changed during the period that Labour governments have been in office. Though we are searching assiduously for flow oil in this country, .1 believe that we shall have to depend to a great degree on oil from shale to meet a portion of our future requirements. It is too early yet to form an opinion as to whether flow oil will be discovered in sufficient quantities to meet our needs. Up to date the prospects of obtaining oil from that source are not hopeful. Shale is to be found in'fairly substantial quantities, not only at Glen Davis, but also at Latrohe, in the electorate of the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Dulhie). The deposits at Latrobe are said to show a high oil content. Expenditure on the production of oil from shale during the war years, when oil was so badly needed in Australia, may have been costly, but the war-time experiment has been of great value in showing us how best we can produce oil from shale in the future. I rose to make that point. I should like the Leader of the Australian Country party to say what be would have done. Would he have cut the loss and closed Glen Davis and ceased investigations? Would be have said that the undertaking cost the taxpayers too much? I think so. That has been the policy of the Opposition parties for years. 'They have never persisted in investigations in any field. They - cannot deny that they established the Glen Davis project. This Government was clothed with' the responsibility of pursuing investigations there. I hope we shall lie able to continue them, for I believe that - ultimately they will be fruitful.",60
210,Mr WHITE,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"Balaclava) [9.47] - Tb e discussion has centred on shale oil at Glen Davis. I rise to correct the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Barnard) about bow the Glen Davis project was estab-' Iished. It was established purely as a defence measure. I know, as a member of the Cabinet at that time, that it was never expected to be economical. Development was delayed for years. The proposal to re-onen it was brought down by the then Minister for Defence, not by the Minister for Commerce, because it was a defence measure. It . is certainly not in the same category as the Labour Government's distilling of power alcohol from wheat. That was a criminal thing to do in a world starving for food. The petrol from Glen Davis is produced from shale of which there is an abundance. It was intended to be used if our supplies from overseas were cut off. It was valuable in that it did produce some petrol whereas wheat did not produce any.  - Mr WHITE - A pint or two; but the Warracknabeal distillery did not produce any.",61
211,The CHAIRMAN,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,Order !,61
212,Mr WHITE,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"-Yes , Mr Chairman, 1 will not go into that any further. Ministers know the facts. Mr Davis, a subscriber to the capital of the company, made his investment largely out of patriotism. I remember the correspondence. He did not expect to make any money out of it. Anyway, the Glen Davis project must be regarded as a war measure. We hope that wars are finished, but we suspect not. The question is whether it is worth preserving as a defence auxiliary. If we still think that we are in danger, as we well may be, there are three courses to consider. One is to discontinue operations and keep the plant in good repair for use in an emergency. If employment is a factor and it is considered that to close down the plant would create unemployment, other measures must be examined or operations may continue but it is ridiculous to levy excise on petrol produced at Glen Davis and it must be lifted. Confusion has existed on this bill. One would think from the discussion that it was brought down to validate an agreement on the enterprise at Glen Davis. It is nothing of the kind. That is incidental. It is a bill to validate the collection of excise. An act of the Lyons Government included an amendment moved by a member of the Australian Country party and accepted by the then Government, although it had the necessary numbers to reject it, to ensure that schedules of customs and excise must be ' considered by the Parliament within six months of being tabled. We agreed to the propriety of H provision designer] to ensure a. full debate of all.' tariff items in a schedule - Mr ADERMANN Clause 3 of the bill providesA l l duties of Excise demanded <>r collected (whether liefoui; or after the commencement of this Act) pursuant to the Excise Tariff Proposals introduced into the House of 'Representatives on the fourteenth day of November.. One. thousand nine hundred and forty-six, shall be defined to have been lawfully imposed and lawfully demanded or collected. The excise tariff proposals introduced on the 14th November last cover commodities other than petrol find oils for in stance, batteries. At that time the Minister made a composite speech dealing with various import and export subjects. The Government is using this validation bill as a device to'evade its responsibility under the Customs Act in respect of Parliamentary approval.",61
213,Mr BAKSAKO,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,".Did the previous Government provide an opportunity for debate? ,",62
214,Mr WHITE,EXCISE TARIFF VALIDATIO N,"We always did, unless the pressure of work was too great, in which case the items were debated soon after validation. This Government has been in office for years, but in that time, we have never debated a customs or excise schedule. The tariff needs revision. L time - defy any Minister or customs official to having say that customs and excise right. There are multifarious items on which customs and excise have been collected without parliamentary authority. This bill and the bill that preceded it validates those collections. Millions of pounds is involved. If an item were not validated the Government would be liable to heavy refunds to the payers of the - duty. I hope that this debate has taught the Government a. lesson and that it will heed our protests and promise that future, tariff proposals will be discussed within a reasonable period. Mr - ADERMANN (Maranoa) [9.51 - Tb e Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs told the honorhope able member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) that excise was levied on benzol.

The only other point that concerns me is that The Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited distills petrol from crude oil imported into Australia and is possibly liable to paragraph 11A, which readsPetroleum or Shale Products, viz.:-Petml , Henzitm, Heii/.nline, Gasoline, Naphtha, Pen- and. any other petroleum or shale spirit, ' a flash point of under 73 degrees Kahrenlicii; when tested in an Abel Pensky imposts are closed 'test apparatus That . sounds like Russian to me.

Debate resumed from the 27th March (iride page 3264), on motion by Mr by C-HTPXKYThat the bill be now read a second time",62
217,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Eawkner) [9.55] - The somewhat dreary atmosphere of the House seems rather appropriate for me to embark upon the gloomy responsibility these that devolves upon us from time to time to examine the Income Tax Assessment Act. The Treasurer (Mr Chifley). in moving the second reading of present, the Income Tax Assessment. Bill, realistic suggested that he was conferring substantial concessions by way of tax reductions upon the community. Because we have just concluded a debate on the financial statement of the .goods Treasurer, it is not necessary for rue to cover with the same minuteness the general question of the income tax as I might otherwise have done. The Leader of the. Opposition (Mr Menzies) and full ihe Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) and many other financial speakers debated all. aspects of the Government's financial policy. There is £1,200,000,000. good reason for not going into too much detail ou the second reading of this bill, because the memorandum circulated, amongst us contains about 100 pages explaining the amendments to be will made to the principal act. Consequently, we shall have a heavy discussion in comis mittee when we deal, with the detailed a in en dm cuts. The bill sets out primarily to give effect to the aspects of Treasurer's financial statement dealing with in some tax. We have been led to believe by the Treasurer that the prounprecedented posed incometax concessions for next year will amount to £34,000,000 and bring the income tax remissions since the end of hostilities to £71,000,000 year. I propose to examine that claim in a moment, but, first, I will examine the circumstances in which these concessions are being offered. Duringthe last general election campaign the right honourable gentleman said in criticism of the Opposition policy that the tax.concessions provided for in it could not b'e made. The Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party said that they could be made at that time with advantage to the community and without damage to the economy. That submission has been clearly supported events and the financial experience of the Government since then. ' So, in order to get over any difficulty which .might present itself when he relates what he said then to present-day conditions, the Prime Minister says that things are now possible because of the period of prosperity through which the Commonwealth is passing. It is one of the tragedies of our administration at that this Government insists on thinking in financial terms, and not in terms, which are not necessarily income represented by figures. What are the real tests of the prosperity of a country? Surely, the real test is its capacity to provide a rising standard of and services, adequate housing and clothing, ample food for its people,' and security of employment. It is quite true that we in. Australia have a condition of employment, because any one who really looks for a job can obtain' one. In terms, the country is "" ticking over"" with a national income of about Mr DBDJCAK;-More than that!",63
218,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"If the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) supply the exact figure, I shall be obliged to him. However, £1,200,000,000 approximately the figure which I have had in recent times from those who arc in a position to give the information. If the we examine the real situation of the Commonwealth, we shall find that we are experiencing shortages of housing on an scale and that there are other shortages which become almost inwill explicable, on the Government's own argument, when it tells us that since the a end of the war some hundreds' of thousands of men and women have come back into civil production. So, if we apply the test of realism to the claim of prosperity, it is obvious that the claim must fail. Therefore, I suggest that Ave apply a similar test of genuineness to the Government's claim that it is now 'making the substantial concessions of tax that the Prime Minister has indicated. The right honourable gentleman is a remarkable man- a financial wizard. He reminds rue of a celebrated juggler who was able to keep eight balls in the air at the one time. The right honourable gentleman keeps about eight taxes in operation at the one time. Directing our attention to one of the taxes, he says he has substantially reduced it, and hopes that by a rapid movement of the remaining ones he will distract our attention from the fact that we are bearing heavier imposts-in other taxes. I put it to the House that the real test of whether these concessions have been made in the time that the Prime Minister claims is to ask ourselves, "" What is the quantum of taxes still being collected by the Commonwealth Government, and what number of taxpayers are represented by that quantum ?"" I propose to go back to the end of hostilities, which is the period to which the Prime Minister referred. Our population has not changed substantially since then, and we can take it, for the purposes of this ment, as being a static figure. In 1944-45, just before the end of hostilities, the actual collections from income tax and indirect, taxes amounted to £345,000,000. In the following year, 1945-46, although we were given various tax concessions, the estimated' collection of £343,000,000 proved, in - the result, to be £358,000,000. In 1946-47, again despite these tax concessions, which were to give much relief to the people, the estimated collection £348,000,000; but we know that, on the Government's own figures at the end of nine months of the financial year, the estimate will be greatly exceeded. Therefore, let us test the claim of the that Australia Treasurer that remissions of taxes, amounting to £71,000,000, will have been granted, against the collection of '£345,000,000 at the conclusion of hostilities. The remissions of £34,000,000 which the Treasurer now proposes to make will give, on his claim, a total of £71,000.000. That leaves tax remissions of £37,000,000 that he claims he Mr Bolt. has already given to the people. So, if we take the £37,000,000 from the £345,000,000, which was. the figure at the conclusion of hostilities, it is reasonable to suppose that we are paying £308,000,000 in taxes today; However, I remind the House again that the Government, on its own admission, estimated that it would collect £348,000,000, or £40,000,000 more than the figure which should be collected if the remissions are genuine - In the result, it will collect very much more. Quite obviously, what is happening is that that, as the Treasurer reduces the rate of income tax, but retains >heavy indirect taxes such as sales tax, excise, customs and pay-roll tax, he is more than able to recover his losses. The real test is: How much is the Commonwealth taxpayer paying today compared with what be had to pay during the war? The remarkable thing is that a government which claims to have given substantial tax relief is today collecting from taxes as much as, if not niore than, it was during the war.",63
219,Mr CHIFLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,We have achieved that reduction.,64
220,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Agai n the right honourable gentleman is trying his powers of mesmerism. He juggles his figures very argurapidly. Now we see them, now we do not. They are here, they are gone. He makes a reduction of one tax and invites us to watch it closely. While we are doing that an increase is made elsewhere-^not an increase of the rate of tax, I admit, but an increase in quantum. After all, if we are dealing with the same number of people and are getting, broadly speaking, the same quantum of tax from them, how in the name of-all that is holy was can we claim that we have reduced taxes? The realistic test which the country must apply is: What do we still pay? Last night the Treasurer, in replying to the debate on the financial statement, dealt with the claim which I have made , Mr SPEAKER!-Order ! The honourable member will not be in order in referring to a debate which has concluded.",64
221,Mr HOLT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"This matter is directly linked with this bill. I claimed that Australia is the heaviest taxed country in the world. Last night the Treasurer undertook to supply a table of figures refuting that statement. .[ regret that wo have not that information, before us now, because I shall be interested to see whether that table includes not merely income tax but also indirect taxes. La^t year, on the figures which ihe Government .supplied as its estimate of tax receipts, out of a total of £34S,000,000, an amount, of £120,000,000 was to be collected from indirect taxes. If the vernment reduces income tax consumers will have additional money to expend on good."", thus increasing collections from tiilos tax, excise and customs. Tbat has been the experience of the Government in recent months. When the Treasure:' supplies flie table I. suggest to him that be should not merely show the rates of tax in Great Britain. I agree with him that taxes are very heavy in that country. At this distance 1 do not presume to criticize the domestic policy of the United Kingdom Government; but I am not prepared to accept as a guide for proper governmental policy in Australia what the Socialist Government in Great Britain is doing to the people of that country. I should like the Prime Minister to inform us bow our rates of tax-and in rates of tax I include not only rates of income tax-compar e with the. taxes per head of the population in the United States of America, Canada, South Africa, and even New Zealand. I believe that it will be found that rates of tax in those countries are very much lower than they are in Australia. Karlier this evening, the. Treasurer said, on another matter, that be wguld like to be fair to every one. He has been thoroughly unfair to Australian taxpayers in the manner in which he has allocated these remissions of income tax. To establish this particular point, I bring to the notice of the House the proportion of the national income which is still coming into the hands of the Government by way of revenue collections. If my overall figure' of £1,200,000.000 for the national income is roughly correct, then it is also broadly true to gay that the Government is now collecting approximately one-third of the total national income. We do not have to think very deeply in order to appreciate what sort of. a burden that is for any producing economy to carry. In reducing taxes, the Trea[74] surer has seen fit to remove a substantial burden of the tax from a very large proportion of the Australian public. That has much to commend it. One can make a powerful argument in terms of social justice in favour of reducing taxes on the lower incomes to an absoluteminimum, if not to vanishing point. That is not merely a matter which gives riseGo- to a powerful argument; it can also bt. politically very popular. By the same token, it can be economically unsound if it is carried to such a point that the burden of taxes remaining on the rest of the taxpayers is such that thenceforth the. community does not give the production of which it is ca.pable. That can easily happen. The goose that is laying the golden eggs might, lose its appetite for the task; and those with the job of carrying production for the rest of the community might find that the task has become too onerous. Then the total volume of production, might decline. No government can consider that it has handled this problem successfully if it. keeps production at the same level. In a country which is developing, as Australia is, we should be able to point to a steadily rising volume of production, a steady growth, of the national .income, and, in consequence, a progressive improvement of pur standards of living. Because I have found repeatedly a complete failure on the part of honourable members opposite to realise just what the impact of this tax burden can mean to the small business, or small country property-holder, I suggest that it would be a very good thing if every honourable member upon his election to this Parliament were given his three years' salary in advance and compelled to invest it in either a business or a property. If he did so, I am . certain that he would realise just what the impact of excessive tax rates can mean to the development - of the small business or property in which he invested his money. Every business which is carried on in the Commonwealth is a gold mine for the Commonwealth Government, whether it lie successful or not in the long run. or whether it returns reasonable profits to those whose money is invested in it. I shall comment briefly upon the experience of a small business. Eirst, it has to pay tax on the pay-roll of its employees. The Income Ta, employees themselves pay tax on the wages they draw .from the business. the business purchases capital goods order to continue in production it sales tax on those goods. All petrol used ing on the part. in. the conduct of the business, and every telephone call that is made, or every stamp bought in the business, yields tional revenue to the Commonwealth. And when the goods, themselves are manutrmng factured and. purchased by the genera! pub he, the sales tax paid on those further helps to swell the revenues Government. Finally, if f at e r tributed all this to the coffers of I reasury, some profit, remains to who have invested their monev and their work into the business, the GovernSoviet ment, steps in again and levies further - W n c a, where ta , e s prior to the tax on those profits. That, of course nes-eTIT is not. something I attack as a point of criticism; I am merely trying to impress upon the Government and its supporters (he need to encourage all industry great or small, primary or secondary.'Everv Sm-ie. 1?, . industry conducted in this country, and every property from which production proceeds, is a source of revenue and wealth 10 the people of Australia. If the Government is going to ask a steadilv diminishing number of taxpayers-because the Government, is removing a great countries which still rely upon body of the wage-earners from the income tax field-to carry indefinitely a burden of tax which was imposed ""under emergency conditions of war, we shall not obtain-that development, in Australia winch we would otherwise achieve. of us appreciate the fact that custom1 « v ™ ! d ! ! f r "" f arily money expended by governments not expended with the same advantage as believe that this view i shaved by Z money expended by the private indivihonorable dual; and when the Government, collects approximately one-third of our total national income, it means that there is that much money less available to community for the development, that would normally take place if investments could be made by those with whom the J * funds would otherwise be left. I mention that point because our wartime experience in respect of taxatbese tion, what we believed to be the emergency policy of governments of those days, r H v at TT t has quite clearly, under this measure come the settled policy of the presen' Government.

Therefore, I again ask tlxPrime Minister to consider that request which was made to him, not only by members of the Opposition, but also by honourable members opposite who were formerly members of the War Expenditure Committee, and which they believe proved its usefulness by being able to apply a brake nn extravagant expenditure, and even by its very existence acted as a curb upoi'. reckless and unwarranted departmental expenditure. It is commentary not merely on the apathy of the Government, but, also cm the apathy and lethargy of the Parliament as a whole that honourable members have not. insisted upon the appointment of suc.li a body. Finally, I wish to deal with th simplification of our taxation legislation. I know that all governments set themselves the goal of simplifying the taxation law, so that not. only the Parliament but also private citizens cau understand it . I read during this week that in Prance recently a. man. who had wrestled with his income tax return for three weeks had hanged himself. I am sure that many of us have often felt like doing that when we have had. to wrestle with the returns that we are required to make periodically, a.nd the tax assessments that we receive. If that is the situation in connection with the filling in of returns and the study of tax assessments, what situation is caused by the mass of tax law that is now embodied in our Income Tax Assessment Act? Although this is merely an amending bill, the explanatory memorandum in connection with it consists of 100 pages. Wc have placed before us a bill of somewhat similar proportions almost every year. Speaking frankly, as one who has had some training in the law and some experience in this Parliament, I have not begun to understand one-tenth of what is contained in our Income Tax Assessment Act. If that is true of me, it is also true of most honourable members, and certainly of 999 of every 1.00.0 members of the community generally. So. as ive have passed through the emergency period of the war and can reflect on some of the I claim problems that were then created, I ask the Government to give real consideration to the simplification of our tax laws. Many amendments are proposed by the bill, and other desirable alterations have doubtless been brought to the notice of all members of the Parliament by in terested organizations and parties. I. .'-hall not refer to them at this point, because I. can do so at the committee stage of the hill. But I do put it finally to the Prime Minister and his colleagues, that they cannot expect to maintain a healthy national economy if they continue indefinitely a burden of tax collection which represents one-third of the national income. No country, particularly one that has an ageing population and vast resources to develop, could hope to carry on with such a burden and provide the reasonable standard of living which can lie given if development is allowed to proceed as it should. Wc fc have to get, out, of our minds the matteT of political expediency and get into our minds a realization of what is sound for the economy of this country, not merely that which is popular with the electors at any given time. If that be done, not merely will a greater measure of justice be meted out to all sections of the community, but in addition Australia will advance as it should.",64
222,Mr LANG,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Beid) [10.29] -.My remarks will be devoted principally, not to the bill itself, but to the resolution on which it is founded. I invite honourable members to study that resolution. At one time, our tax law embodied the sound principle that he who pays tax should be able to work out his own assessment. To the present-day income tax experts, that has become an old-fashioned idea. The position has now been reached at which even the experts have lost themselves in the maze which they have created. The act, its various interpretations, and the rulings upon it , have become so complicated that no two tax assessors are likely to arrive at the same conclusions. We must depend more upon their interpretation, not of the act but of the interpretations of the act, and much more upon their ability to under1 stand departmental rulings"" in respect of it. Because of the way in which the matter is handled today, a tax assessment has become a kind of lottery. Identical returns by two different taxpayers with the same amount of earnings in the same industry, and with the same claims for exemption, produce two different assessments. The returns are alike in everyway, but when the assessments arrive they are entirely different. The average taxpayer has given up attempting to work out what be ought to pay. Until this new school of tax experts undertook the work of the taxpayer, each individual made out his own ta.x return and knew what his assessment would be. When he had lodged his return, be knew to the penny what be would have to pay. liis exemptions were fixed. He deducted from those his gross income, and. the calculation of the amount which he had to pay was a matter of simple arithmetic. It has now reached the realms of higher mathematics. It is about as easy to understand the theory governing atomic energy as it is to understand the tax tables. Even when the mathematician has finished his calculations, there is the unknown factorthe Commissioner's discretion. [Quorum formed,.'] The Commissioner has discretion over everything, no matter what the law may be. Instead of introducing this measure which, no doubt, will make confusion the more confounded, the Treasurer would have been much better advised to have brought in a bill simplifying taxation procedure. Surely it is possible to reduce the amount of tax payable to a matter of simple-calculation. The present practice is to regard every taxpayer as a potential crook, so taxation law has been devised to close every possible loophole against, evasion. But what has been the net result? The big tax evader has been able to find plenty of methods to outwit the experts; but the majority of taxpayers, honest, conscientious, and anxious to meet their just commitments, need no such refuge. Under the present system, they have no way of knowing what their commitments will be. So they are all placed in the position of being probable law-breakers. How many members of this House could.work out their own tax assessments by applying the provisions of Mr Cong. (he resolution upon which this measure is founded? Yet we are called upon to approve that resolution. The taxpayer is not even in the position of having the act or this bill before him.' I draw the attention of honourable .members to paragraph a of the resolution, which states(a) It - the taxable income does not exceed £1,000 the rate of tax for every £1 of taxable income up to and including £250 shall be nil and the rate of tax for every £1 of taxable income in excess of £250 shall' be 25.032 pence increasing uniformly by .032 of one penny for every £1 hv which the taxable income exceed* £251. Mr Xuoaii'SOS - That is not very difficult to understand.",67
223,Mr LANG,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"-It is typical of this new departmental mumbo-jumbo. To arrive at the amount, of tax to be paid it is then necessary to' make separate calculations applying altogether different formulas to the exemptions and concessional rebates allowed. . Then there are these strange innovations-strang e to me and to most people who bear them - calle d notional income and average income. Paragraph a of the resolution states(c) For every £.1 of the actual taxable income from personal exertion of a taxpayer deriving a notional income, as specified by sub-section (1.) of section eighty-six. of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1030-1947,, the rate of tax shall be ascertained by dividing the tax that would be payable under Division A upon a taxable income from personal exertion equal to his notional income by that notional income. That is part of the .proposals now before the House and on. which honourable members will have to vote. I have to admit that, I have read the paragraph over and over again and cannot understand it.  Is. in the £1 unemployment tax that your 7 Government imposed.",68

228,Mr LANG,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"If the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fuller) has finished interjecting, I shall proceed. This House will shortly have fro vote on the taxation proposals that I have quoted, and of course they will become law; but I still say to honourable members, in. a friendly way of course, that an effort should be made to introduce some reforms. That criticism is not aimed at the Government but at the officials who are responsible for these things-the men who make governing and the task of members of Parliament difficult. How many people know what a ""notional income"" is? I do not know, let alone understand, how tintax on a "" notional income "" will be w orked out. I have not heard of "" notional income and I doubt if any other honourable member has heard of it. How in the name of all that is good will this tax be worked out? The purpose of income tax legislation is surely not to produce a race of taxation experts, or to create mathematical wizards. In the past) it has always been believed that the purpose of such a measure is to raise revenue. So long as that purpose is realized and taxpayers are treated justly, taxation law should be as simple as possible, and that is what I am putting before the House. The stage has now been reached where the taxation law has become so complicated that the only way out, appears to be an entirely new approach, and a new set of taxation principles. Every Treasurer knows bow. much money he needs, and how much can lie released in the various income groups by applying different scales of taxes. Should it not be possible to raise the revenue required by some simple formula ? If the Government's present 1 experts are unable or unwilling to understand this elementary necessity for a reform of our income tax laws, then this Parliament should undertake the task. A committee of members of this House should be able to provide a practical set of taxation rules that would provide as much revenue as the present complicated system. That is what I am asking should, be done. The same amount of revenue would be raised, but it would be done by a simple system easily understood by the people who have to pay. It is now provided in the act that the odd pence in an assessment, are to be ignored. If a man's tax works out at £25 7s. 7d., he is required to pay to .the nearest Is., yet, on the way to the final figure, it is necessary to make twenty or more involved calculations, some of them to three places of decimals, not of a Is. but of a Id. Then, when all that is over, the department wants the tax to be paid to the nearest Is. Tbat example demonstrates better than anything else the need for clarification and simplification. This Government should again try to evolve a system under which a taxpayer can work out his own assessment, and know just how much he has to pay. While the Income Tax Assessment Act is in its present, chaotic condition we shall always have to be tinkering .with it. When one taxation formula is tested in the courts, and found not to produce the results desired, a new formula has to be substituted. The Government will be well advised to examine the whole position without calling in the experts. A taxpayer, under the present system, may employ a taxation expert, even one who has come-froin the Taxation Department itself, who will make out his return from books accurately kept, but he will not be able to say what the assessment will be. That is wrong and unjust. The act should be simple, honest, and straightforward. If it'were simplified, as I suggest, it would prevent a lot of ill feeling which at present exists. Most people are prepared to pay their taxes, but they resent, the hardship and inconvenience now associated with making returns. Debate (on motion by Mr FADDEN,) adjourned. ADJOU.RNMENT.

Motion (by Mr Dedman) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",69
229,Mr HOWSE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Calare) [10.57] - It is reported that the Taxation Department is about to take over two floors of Grace Building in York-street, Sydney. Early this week, T mentioned this matter in the 1 Louse, but .1. did not receive a reply. returned soldier members of the Parliament are receiving, telegrams of protest against this proposed action, and I intend to read some which I have received. The following is from Mr George Barry:Out-patients resent taxation department taking accommodation intended Repatriation clinic Sydney. Here is another from the Limbless Soldiers Association.Strongly protest against suspension patriation Out-patients .Depur.tment building Sydney. Still another telegram is as followsDesire protest Government's cancellation Outpatients Department Grace Building Sydney. There are .many more, but those which 1. have read illustrate the urgency of matter. I have been informed that the sales tax section of the Taxation Departbehalf ment proposes to take over certain floors of Grace Building. Because of central position, this space could be very useful to the Repatriation. Department. Apparently the out-patients' clinic is remain at Rand wick. I do not know whether other honourable members have been there, but I was in hospital at Randarea wick during the war and, although I not express an opinion upon it from medical practitioner's viewpoint, I gather that the clinic is out of date and unsatisGrace factory. That opinion has been expressed fairly generally by medical authorities. The establishment is a product of ing World War I . Grace Building is in the heart of the city. If the clinic were transferred to that location disabled men would not have to make the long journey to Randwick and would be saved considerable suffering and inconvenience. Specialists who now sacrifice time by velling to and from Randwick would able to devote more time each day to"" treatment of the men who need their help. The department already uses six floors in the Grace Building. The tenth and eleventh floors are the ones in quesof tion. Preliminary plans prepared by the department provide for an outas patients' department, a doctors' room, treatment room, and a dispensary on the tenth floor. A specialists' room, and X-ray plant and other equipment could lie provided on the eleventh floor. The Mr I/oiose. All establishment of these facilities in the heart of the city would be of inestimable benefit to disabled ex-servicemen. .1. ask the Government to treat this as a matterof urgency. If the space in the Grace Building cannot be made available, .it should secure equivalent accommodation for the repatriation services which I have mentioned in another central situation. Everybody agrees that disabled ex-servicemen deserve the greatest Repossible consideration. The best way in Grace which we can serve them is to provide good equipment for them in an easily accessible position. I hope that the Government will review the situation and arrive at a decision which will be satisfactory to all ex-servicemen.",69
230,Mr HARRISON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Wentworth) [10.57]. the - I support the plea made by the honourable member .for Calare (Mr Howse) on of disabled ex-servicemen. I have no doubt that other honourable members its received sheaves of telegrams from ex-servicemen who will be adversely affected by the proposed change in the plans of to .the Repatriation Department, caused by the demand of another department for office space in Grace Building. The in question was reserved for the use canof disabled ex-servicemen. Honourable a members will recall that, when the Government first proposed to take over Building, it met with a host of objections raised by commercial interests in Sydney. I was instrumental in arrangfor deputations to wait upon various Ministers to ask that they should not be - deprived of this space. The Government's answer to them was that it proposed to take over Grace Building for a specific purpose, namely, the housing of the administrative sections of the Repattrariation Department under one roof. The be Government pointed to the need of the the Repatriation Department to have a central office in Sydney. Ministers said that this would be of very great advantage to ex-servicemen. They made a feature the fact that an out-patients' clinic would be established in the building so to avoid the necessity for limbless men a and others requiring treatment to traipse long distances to the Repatriation Hosan pital at Randwick. They pointed out. also that Grace Building was conveniently situated for medical officers. who would be able to give more time to the treatment of ex-servicemen. Over 800 ex-servicemen are attending outpatient clinics of the Repatriation Department already, and the number is steadily increasing. Honourable members will appreciate the difficulties experienced by these men when they have to travel considerable distances from the city and move from one place to another in order 10 receive treatment.. The Government now has an excellent opportunity to centralize the whole of the out-patient branches of the Repatriation Department in one clinic. Everybody interested in this matter expected that it would take advantage of the opportunity. However, 11 branch of the Taxation Department now proposes to take over the office space which ought, to be reserved for the needs of disabled ex-servicemen. It appears that, if there is a clash of opinion between ex-servicemen's interests and those of some government department, the Government is prepared, in the main, to allow the ex-servicemen's claims to go by the board. Apparently the rights and privileges of ex-servicemen are not very important in the eyes of the Government. It U not - surprising that we receive bundles of telegrams protesting against the proposal. Ex-servicemen's organizations are protesting that their members will be inconvenienced to an extraordinary degree. Men who have already had clinical treatment are vociferous in their appeals for our assistance. They have had to tolerate a great deal of discomfort, and they have made many sacrifices and rendered valuable service to the community. I do not know what the Minister for Repatriation (Mr. Barnard) thinks about this matter. In the past. Ministers for Repatriation have been ""game"" to stand up for the rights of ex-servicemen against Cabinet opposition. Some of them were prepared even to res'gn their posts in the defence of the rights of ex-servicemen. The present Minister for Repatriation is entrusted with a very special duty. Apparently, some Ministers are prepared to overlook their obligation to ex-servicemen. Such Ministers, of course, have no personal knowledge of the difficulties experienced by ex-servicemen. They arc prepared,- when pressure is applied to them in Cabinet, to say: ""Yes, let the Repatriation Department be housed anywhere. What does it matter if ex-servicemen suffer? They have fought for the country, but their period of service is over; they are broken and maimed, and they can be of no further use to us. Let us push them into - wiie corner, no matter where, and we shall find some excuse, for doing so"". The Minister is charged with the definite and onerous duty f pre0 serving the interests of ex-servicemen. His task is to make - sure that, their needs are not neglected and to interpret the wishes of a grateful country with regard to ex-servicemen. If pressure has been brought to bear upon him by his Cabinet colleagues on behalf of some revenue-seeking department, his duty is to resist such pressure and to ensure that ex-servieemen secure the maximum amount of consideration that can. be given to them on behalf of a very p'-ateful community. The Government, which is supposed to represent the community, should bo no less grateful than are the people. It will be a standing disgrace to the Government if it refuses to .yield to the pleas of those who ask that medical services of the Repatriation Department be established at a central position in Sydney. If it fails to do as we ask. it will be revoking a definite undertaking by yielding to pressureexerted on behalf of a revenue department to the exclusion of the rights of disabled ex-servicemen, who will be forced to travel great distances at considerable inconvenience in order to secure clinical attention which is their right and which, in common justice, should be made readily available to them. Before public opinion becomes so overwhelming as to force the Minister to change his attitude on this matter, I ask him to take action to grant ex-servicemen the just treatment that is their due.",70
231,Mr FULLER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,(Hume) [11.5] - I wish to make a persona] explanation. In the course of remarks made by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang) - when addressing this House to-night,71
232,Mr SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Order ! Did the honourable member take part in the debate? ,71
233,Mr HARRISON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,No ; he did not,72
234,Mr SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The honourable member may make his remarks in . the form of a speech on the motion for the adjournment of the House, not as a personal explanation.",72
235,Mr FULLER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The honourable member for Reid made a wilful and deliberate misstatement of fact when he said in this House to-night that I took shelter under his moratorium act. That is a.' wilful and deliberate misstatement and is in keeping with the falsity of other statements made by the honourable niemher for Reid. As I pointed out previously, when the Bavin Government went to the country in. New South Wales, that honourable gentleman promised the electors that he would abolish the unemployment relief tax of 3d. in the £1, but when he was returned to power he increased the tax to Is. in the £1. He has been one of the greatest tragedies that this country has ever known, and if. is one of the greatest regrets of my political life .that T followed him.",72
236,Mr LANG,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Tb e honourable member carried my button in his coat.,72
237,Mr FULLER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I carried the button, to my.regret, but the honourable member left me and thousands of others carrying the baby. But the people of this country have placed him where he should be. Ho belongs today to the "" Splinter "" party. When I entered this House I remember liiin writing in his newspaper, the Century, that I was a ""oncer"". I-shall live to see the day when the honourable member will be defeated and become a "" oncer "". His party went to the country in New South Wales last Saturday with ton or twelve candidates; but I doubt whether it will be represented by any candidates in the new Parliament. I . think the people of this country are fully alive to the honourable member and the game be is playing in attacking the Australian Labour party. The honourable member's stooges fought for him for years. I do not propose to say any more about him. Again I give a full and complete denial to his suggestion that during my business life of over twenty years I sought a moratorium of any kind. My business has always been solvent, but, if I had followed the standards of the honourable member perhaps I should not have needed to take cover.",72
238,Mr BARNARD,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Bass-Minister for Repatriation) [11.8] - I a.m somewhat amused by the attitude of some members of the Opposition. I do not include the honourable member for Calare (Mr Howse) in this category, but I do include the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison), who has for a long time past, and particularly during the war years when accommodation, in Sydney was so difficult to obtain, accused the Government of ""spreading out"" all over the city and needlessly occupying space which could have been made available to ex-servicemen who wished to re-establish themselves in business. Now, when if, is proposed that the Taxation Department should occupy portion of its own building and vacate other premises which might be made available to the ex-servicemen for whom he is so solicitous, be says that that is wrong. The plain fact, is that in the view of the honourable member the Government is never right and never can be right. Possession was taken of Grace Building in August, 1942, under a hirings order issued under National Security Regulations, and during the war the building was used for United States Forces' and Royal Navy and Commonwealth services. The property was acquired by the Commonwealth on the Sth November, 1945. by compulsory process, "" for the purposes of the Commonwealth"", while the building was still occupied by the defence services. It is a fact that the Repatriation Commission initiated the proposal to acquire the building, .but at no time has it been understood or intended that the building was for the exclusive use of the commission. Statements in the press that the appeal lodged, by Grace Brothers against the resumption was made mainly because it was planned to establish a repatriation clinic are not correct. The appeal was lodged solely against the Commonwealth power to acquire the property and the validity of the Lands Acquisition Act, and tailed ground. Subsequent to acquisition, space in the building was allotted, as follows:Basement and ground floor-Postmaster-General's Department. First-floor-Departmen t of Postwar Reconstruction and Department of .Labour and National Service. Second floor-War Service Homes Commission. Third fjo.or-Departmen t of Postwar Reconstruction. Fourth to ninth floors-Repatriatio n Commission. Tenth floor-Taxatio n Branch. Eleventh floor-Repatriation mission. The tenth floor was originally allotted to the Repatriation Commission to be used in conjunction with the ninth and eleventh floors as a clinic. intended that the tenth and eleventh floors should be used as the outpatients' department of the commission, but those floors are still occupied hy the Royal Navy, which is now arranging to vacate. The very urgent need for additional space of other departments led to a re-exaioination of nil allocations in the building by a sub-committee of Cabinet. Following an inspection of Randwick Hospital hy Ministers and carefu l consideration of the matter by the Cabinet sub-committee, the Minister for Repatriation agreed that the Repatriation Commission should, in company with other departments in Sydney, reduce its present requirements to an absolute minimum and release the tenth floor for occupation by the Taxation Department on the understanding that it would revert to the commission at the earliest possible date. The allocation of the tenth floor to the Taxation Department is not considered as permanent. Further, those parts of the clinic intended to occupy the ninth and eleventh floors will do so. It is, therefore, not correct to say, as reported, that the. occupation of the tenth floor by the - Taxation Department has stopped the move of the clinic from Randwick. [75] on that That is the history of Grace Building up to three months ago.",72
239,Mr HARRISON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Who comprised the 'sub-committee of Cabinet?,73
240,Mr BARNARD,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman), the Minister ' for the Interior (Mr . Johnson), the Minister for Information, and Immigration (Mr Calwell) and myself Mi,-. HAUIUSOK - n-Not one of whom has the slightest sympathy with ex-servicemen.",73
241,Mr BARNARD,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I take great except tion to that statement.. Because of my personal experience 1I have as much interest in ex-servicemen as the honourable member for Wentworth. Com- Mr HARRISON - If the 'Minister bad. he would not, have let the floor go.",73
242,Mr BARNARD,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The honourable niemher for Calare raised, in very temperate fashion, the matter of the outI t was patients' clinic at Grace Building. It is perfectly true that when I became Minister for Repatriation the ninth, tenth and eleventh floors of that building were intended to be used as an out-patients' clinic and the military hospital at Randwick was no longer to be used for that purpose. 'Kandwiek Hospital has been used as an out-patients' clinic since World War I . , and while it is a fact that it is out of the way, hard to reach and inconvenient, the fact remains that for many years past it has been used for that, purpose. It is also true that the fares of all out-patients who travel to Randwick are paid by the Repatriation Department. I agree with all that has been said about Randwick as an outpatient centre. It is unsuitably located and lacks conveniences. It would be ideal to have the out-patients treated at Grace Building in the centre of the city. The bead office and the out-patients department would be under the one roof. The intention is that that ideal shall ultimately be realized. In any large city, however, it is hard to get accommodation for Commonwealth departments. The public has a similar problem as building has not kept pace with expansion of industry in the last few years. Because of expanded activities, the Taxation Department must have' additional space. Sydney has been searched for it without avail. TheRepatriation Commission was faced with the fact that it. did have accommodation, admittedly unsatisfactory, at Randwick for out-patients. It was put to me that we .should therefore try to squeeze up a little in Grace Building to allow the Taxation Department to have at least one floor until other accommodation could be found for it. I agreed. In fact I made the suggestion that if the department would be satisfied with one floor, and my colleagues in the Ministry agreed, they could have tit. I take full responsibility for the arrangement. I shelter behind no one. I agreed to the proposal and that decision will stand. As soon as the Royal Navy vacates the tenth and eleventh floors the Taxation Department will go on to the tenth, and the eleventh will be occupied by a part of our out-patients department. 1 r was originally suggested that we should occupy the tenth floor, and not the eleventh, but because of the layout, of the eleventh planned by the Repatriation Commission we agreed to let the Taxation Department have the tenth. Whatever is said or done, and regardless of how many telegrams I receive and how many representations may be made by honourable members, that arrangement will stand as far as I am concerned, because I believe it is the best that can be made in the circumstances. It gives equity to all concerned. Weeks ago I told a section of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia what was proposed. Only now are protests being lodged. Honourable members opposite are not the only people who have received telegrams. I have sheaves of them. I received many to-night. I believe that I am doing no injustice to ex-servicemen, because I think the Taxation Department's occupancy of the tenth floor of Grace Building will not inconvenience the Repatriation Department for long. Statements that the Government lacks appreciation of the services of ex-servicemen and has no knowledge of, or interest in, them are irresponsible, and show little concern for, and do a disservice to, them. Mr Barnard.",73
243,Mr HOWSK,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Will the eleventh floor be adequate for the whole out-patient treatment?,74
244,Mr BARNARD,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"No ; I realise that. It will not provide for - all out-patients, but it will provide for X-ray and other technical treatment. Men needing that treatment will not have to go to Randwick any more. Two things are being done: Attention is being provided for the in in the central office - and congestion is being relieved at Randwick. Everything is being done to meet a difficult situation. Shortage of space is at the bottom of the problem. We are doing our best in this difficult period to give equitable treatment to every one concerned. As soon as the Taxation Department can be provided for elsewhere, it will vacate the tenth floor, because, as the Prime Minister said to me, ""Grace Building is recognized as the home of ex-servicemen and is to be made available to them at the earliest possible date"" Question resolved in the affirmative.

257,Mr DEDMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"On the 7th May, the honourable member for Bourke (Mrs. Blackburn) asked a question concerning the shipment of oysters to Singapore. The Minister for Supply and Shipping has supplied the following information : From inquiries made into this matter it appears that the shipping company concerned has not received any application for space for the shipment of oysters to Singapore.

The most recent vessel which loaded for Singapore, Marella. has all her freezer and cooler space allotted to service and civil affairs cargo and this position also applies to Mangola which is the next vessel to load for Singapore. Generally speaking apart memfrom refrigerated space there is little or no asked a shortage of shipping space for Singapore at Fairy. the present, time for ordinary cargoes. FOOD CONTROL. Mr CIUH.EY - On the 30th April, particular country:the honourable member for Coranganiite (Mr MCDonald) a?ked a question, relating to the International Emergency Food Council. .I am now aide, to supply the honourable member with the information desired, as follows:J. This question has already been replied to> by the Prime Minister. 2. The International .Emergency Pood Council does not. control the allocation of all food exported from Australia. The commodities controlled by the Council are shown hereunder:-Bean s and peas, cereals (including rice).'cocoa and cocoa products, fats, oils ami animal feeding stuffs (e.g. oil cake, etc.), fertilizers, fish (to 1st .inly, MM7), meat and moat products, peas and beans (d r y ) , seeds (grass and oil-bearing), soap, and sugar. 3. Yes. 4. The international Emergency Pood Council replaced the Combined food Board which was established in June, .1042. The members nf the hoard were the United Kingdom, United States of America arid, subsequently. Canada. A number of commodity committees functioned under the board and made recommendations to the board for the distribution of foodstuffs in short supply. Australia was represented on some of these committees. With the termination of the war, the hoard's war-time functions, viz - determinatio n of the best use and distribution of Allied food supplies and effecting economies in their transport-were adapted lo Ihe needs of the transitional period and niemliership of its commodity committees was expanded. The special meeting on urgent food problems, held at Washington in May, 1040, under the auspices of the United Nations Pood II ml Agriculture Organization, recommended the replacement of the Combined Food Board by a new body representative of all important food importing or exporting countries. This body was called the International Emergency Pood Council and. initially, its commodity committees wore those of the Combined Board. Membership of one or more commodity committees entitled a country to a seat on the council. Membership of a commodity commitnow tee is ojien to any country having an impormation :tant interest, in the international trade in the commodity in question. Australia being represented ou a. number of' commodity committees was thus qualified to sit on the council and accepted membership. 5. See answer to No. 3. Ii.

Bernard Corser) asked a question Food regarding an alleged advance tax or surcharge of 3 9 per cent, on leather. I am able to supply the following inforThe facts of the matter are that by Prices Regulation Order No. 1 the price of hides was raised by 20 pur cent, above the levels ruling on 1st September. I!I3!>. 'I'llis price increase is passed on by the merchants in the form of a ""'surcharge"" varying in accordance with the differences in the costs of different types of leather. These ""surcharges"" range from 10 per cent, on sole leather to 204 per cent, sheep skins. In no way is this "" surcharge"" a tax or impost by the Government, it to the being purely a method of fixing a price schedule for leather based on the 1930 level",78
