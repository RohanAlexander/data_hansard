5,Mr ALBANESE,STANDING ORDERS,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (12.03 pm)-I move: That unless otherwise ordered, standing orders 192 and 193 be amended to read as follows: 192 Main Committee's order of business The normal order of business for the Figure 4.

Committee meets shall be constituency statements to make a constituency statement for no longer statements may continue for 30 minutes, The amendment provides for an additional two hours and 40 minutes each sitting week on a Monday for members to debate government business or committee reports and to make three-minute constituency statements. It provides two changes to the existing standing orders: that the first item of business on any day that the Main Committee meets will be constituency statements by members and that, between 4.30 pm and 6.40 pm on a Monday, the Main Committee will allow for government business and committee and delegation reports. This amendment will provide greater opportunity for members to do two things: firstly, to better represent their electorates with the increased allocation of time allowed for constituency statements and, secondly, to contribute to the legislative debate on issues that are important to their local communities. This will, of course, increase the accountability and transparency of the government's legislation to the parliament, as additional debate will be allowed on legislation. Appropriately, it restores the proper Main Committee for which it was established. The government has provided a great deal of opportunity for members of the House of Representatives to support their concerns and views before the House. Indeed, so far in 2009 the Main Committee has sat for a total of 176 hours, which is more than the entire time of 147 hours that it sat for in 2007. In 2008, the Main Committee sat for a total of 290 hours, more time than in any other year since its creation in 1994 and more than 60 hours more than its previous record in 2006. I take the opportunity to make the point that, while the House of Representatives is engaged in discussion about legislation and also about issues of concern that members have in their electorates, I think the same, unfortunately, cannot always be said of the other place. The House has carried some 119 bills so far this year. There are 21 packages awaiting passage in the Senate. Of those, three are budget related: the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2009, the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2009 and the Health Insurance Amendment (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Bill 2009. Indeed, last week the Senate only considered four packages, of which three were passed. Of course the Senate need to give proper scrutiny to legislation, but they also need to recognise that they have a responsibility to deal, in a timely manner, with legislation that is carried by the House of Representatives. Certainly, the Parliamentary Business Committee will continue to monitor the situation re the build-up of legislation in the Senate. It is my understanding that there are a range of bills which the government and the opposition have declared to be non-controversial but because of minor parties opposing that declaration the legislation is unable to be practices to the debated on Thursdays. The fact that the Senate has not extended its sitting hours, unlike the House of Representatives in both this chamber and the Main Committee, is also an issue which needs to be given proper consideration by the Senate. I would certainly ask that they do so. This is a practical motion which is about maximising the time that both chambers sit. It is also of good financial sense for the parliament to maximise the daytime activity whilst parliamentarians are here in Canberra, given the costs of parliament sitting. I certainly commend the proposed amendments to the House of Representatives and I thank both the Chief Government Whip and the Chief Opposition Whip for their ongoing deliberations on these issues and the cooperative way which, by and large, we operate in this chamber.  tion Business) (12.09 pm)-The opposition lends support to the government's changes to the standing orders in order to give parliamentary secretaries and ministers greater opportunities in the Main Committee. It was-when I was a minister and a parliamentary secretary-a vexing matter that you could not necessarily speak on the adjournments or in the Main Committee about issues to do with your local electorate. It seemed rather counterintuitive. We do support the opportunity for ministers and parliamentary secretaries to be able to range across issues that are of importance to their constituents, who make up, at least in my electorate, 98,000 voters and about 130,000 people. I am sure that in the electorates of ministers and parliamentary secretaries they would have similar numbers if not quite so great because South Australia has a higher number on average than most electorates across Australia due to a peculiarity in the Constitution, which we have talked about before. We do support the opportunity for parliamentary secretaries and ministers to be given the chance in the Main Committee to talk about their local electorates. We also believe the change that would give parliamentary secretaries the opportunity to make statements in the Main Committee, which could then be responded to by shadow ministers, is an improvement to the Main Committee. I can think of other improvements to the Main Committee and to the chamber. I see the Chief Government Whip is in the House. He has been a long standing advocate of change and reform in terms of the standing orders in both this place and the Main Committee. He and I served as chairman and deputy chairman many years ago of the Procedure Committee, my first very important appointment in this place by the former Prime MinisterMr Albanese-Last century.  It took a while to get started. We did report, in fact, into the Main Committee and the improvements that could be made, some of which were adopted, so it is good to see the continuing organic improvement in the standing orders. We do always support more opportunities for members to speak. The Main Committee has provided a forum for private members' business. It is ironic that on a day when the government is suspending private members' business in the House of Representatives in order to debate the renewable energy targets billsMr Albanese-We're not doing that.  That is good news. We are even more pleased to hear about that because we want private members to get more opportunities to debate. That had been the impression that I had been given, so that is good news. We will be able to debate private members' business today as well as the renewable energy targets bills late into the night. I am pleased that the Leader of the House has confirmed that. We would like to see other reforms to the standing orders. We would like to see the oft called for claims of the previous opposition about four-minute answers in question time adhered to. It is embarrassing, in fact, for the Leader of the House that, on most of the occasions that he has answered questions, he has transgressed the four-minute rule-51 per cent of the time in 2008 and getting worse in 2009 at 69 per cent of the time. The Minister for Education transgressed her own four-minute rule in 2008, 61 per cent of the time and she is getting worse too, she is up to 66 per centMr Albanese interjecting per cent of the time she is transgressing the four-minute rule. It was she who put in a submission to the Procedure Committee inquiry into the standing orders in the last liament that there should be a four-minute rule. The Treasurer on the other hand, who also supports the four-minute rule, is doing much better. In 2008 he only transgressed it nine per cent of the time and in 2009 he has only transgressed it 22 per cent of the time. The Treasurer is actually doing much better in terms of his own self-imposed four-minute rule than the Minister for Education. If only he would actually answer the questions sensibly, that would be a huge improvement. He has probably answered them in such a short space of time because he does not know the answer and no answers are much shorter than longer answers; nevertheless he is doing better than the Minister for Education and much better than the Leader of the House. Other ministers also transgressing the rule include the Minister for Finance and Deregulation at 72 per cent of the time in 2008 and 71 per cent of the time in 2009. The Prime Minister transgressed it 27 per cent of the time in 2008 and 34 per cent of the time in 2009, and the list goes on. I think, sadly, worse offender is the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, who has missed the boat in a few areas but, certainly, he has missed the boat in terms of the four-minute rule. In 2008 he transgressed it 53 per cent of the time and in 2009, 89 per cent of the time. The Leader of the House might like to take him in hand a bit and then the opposition would be able to ensure that democracy is working much more effectively than the farce that question time has become under this government. That said, we support the motion moved by the Leader of the House.  not wish to detain the House, but I did want to rise and support this motion moved by the Leader of the House, thank him and also thank the opposition for their support. I think increasing the number of speaking opportuparnities for members is always a good thing for them and, more especially, for their electorates, and I welcome the half hour that is now being provided on Mondays in the Main Committee. I would also observe that we are entrenching the rule that, if a division should interrupt the contribution of members on constituency statements, members will take off where they left off so their opportunity is not wiped out. I would observe that when the Standing Committee on Procedure review this innovation, which I do hope they will do with some clarity, they might look at whether or not the proposition has been successful-and I am sure they will conclude that it has; whether it is popular with members-and I am sure the answer to that is yes; and, most importantly, whether or not an opportunity exists to perhaps extend it by a further half hour so that we would start sitting Mondays with an hour of constituency statements. But I do not want to prejudge how the procedure committee may deliberate on these matters but merely the to hope that they will review these new arrangements, supported as they are by both sides of the House. Question agreed to. NA Days and Hours of Meeting",17
6,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS,"by leave-I move: That the time and order of business for the sitting tomorrow, 18 August 2009, be as follows: (1) the House, at its rising, adjourn until tomorrow at 12 noon; and (2) government business have priority from 12 noon until 2 pm For the benefit of members, it is the government's intention to bring on the debate for the renewable energy target legislation immediately today. We will debate that up until 2 pm. We will, after question time, return to that debate and then, after private members' business if need be, return to that debate again. A number of members have put themselves down to speak on the second reading, and we do not wish for people to not be able to make a contribution. However, I can certainly indicate that the Chief Government Whip has asked members on this side of the chamber to restrict their comments as far as possible; I understand the Chief Opposition Whip has done the same. Of course, I indicate that that would not be appropriate for the opposition spokesperson, who will be able to speak for as long as he wishes to. It is the intention of the government to low speakers tonight, through a negating of the adjournment of the House, to continue so that all those speeches will be concluded. That way we can come back here tomorrow at 12 noon, have any debates and votes that are required on that legislation and then move back to the education debate that has been listed. There will be an understanding with the opposition that there will be no votes this evening so that people who had made arrangements will not be disadvantaged by that. I thank the opposition for their cooperation, and I thank the staff of the parliament for staying back this evening.  tion Business) (12.19 pm)-Briefly, the opposition are quite happy to facilitate the passprivate ing of this bill tonight through the House of Representatives. We are quite prepared to deal with the consideration in detail stage this evening, and we are quite prepared to have any votes that might be necessary tonight. We, the government and, I think, members of the community share the view that the renewable energy targets legislation should be dealt with one way or the other as quickly as possible to give people in the community certainty. It has already been delayed long enough, from the opposition's point of view. As you know, we had not insisted that the ETS legislation and the RET legislation be together-we had been quite happy for them to be decoupled-and this legislation could have been passed two months ago. There are many people in the community who are waiting to see what the parliament does with this bill. So the Leader of the House should know that the opposition are quite prepared to have this bill passed and dealt with this evening. We have not asked our members to cut back their important contributions unless they feel that they are capable of doing so and happy to do so. If they cooperate, that will make it easier for al- us to deal with this this evening. Therefore, the time from 12 till two tomorrow may or may not be necessary; we might well be able to wrap this issue up this afternoon or this evening and then get it into the Senate so that the Senate can deal with it with all their wisdom, energy and experience as they see fit over the course of the next three days.",21
7,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS,"Just in closing the debate, I note the comments of the Manager of Opposition Business, and that will be given consideration by the government. It may well be that we can get the debate concluded this evening. I think that would be difficult, however, if we are going to interrupt the debate for a number of hours with members' business. Certainly it is the government's priority to get this legislation through. If the opposition were prepared to agree to the deferment of private members' business that would make it much more feasible, given the number of speakers listed. What we will do is to engage in further debate with the opposition. It is certainly not the government's view that we would defer private members' business by a majority vote-that would be by agreement-so we will enter into further discussions. I commend the current recommendation to the House. Question agreed to. Rearrangement",22
8,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (12.23 pm)-I move: That order of the day No. 1, government ness, be postponed to a later hour this day. Question agreed to. NA (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009 Cognate bill: NA (ELECTRICITY) (CHARGE) AMENDMENT BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 June, on motion by Mr Combet: That this bill be now read a second time.",23
9,Mr HUNT,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"In rising to address the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009 I begin with a very simple statement: our vision is of a clean energy economy. We strongly support the concept of a 20 per cent renewable energy target. We believe in the potential of the great mirror fields of California, Nevada and Spain; in the potential of geothermal energy; and in the potential of wave, tidal and algal energy to contribute to Australia's and, indeed, the globe's clean energy future. Clean energy is, with green carbon, one of the two most fundamental steps to dramatically reducing Australia's net emissions. It is also about broadening the base of our energy security. Clean energy is also about creating jobs in rural Australia. I am glad that the government have backed down on negotiating these bills. Now they need to provide the details, but we will enter into negotiations today, immediately after this speech, and I am pleased that the government have agreed to do that. We have important issues with which to deal. I want to deal firstly with the coalition and renewable and clean energy. It was the coalibusition which introduced Australia's first mandatory renewable energy target. At that time, the 9,500 gigawatt hours represented an effective target of almost 10 per cent when combined with existing renewables. The coalition strongly supports the 20 per cent renewable energy target and we accordingly offer provisional support for the legislation, subject to key amendments that we will move in the House and once it gets to the Senate. We are also committed to a 25 per cent reduction in national emissions if there is a comprehensive global agreement. We were the party that introduced the $8,000 solar rebate, which the government means tested in a broken promise on budget night 2008. We are the party which introduced the same $8,000 solar rebate which the government then completely abolished without notice as of 8.30 am on 9 June 2009. And we introduced the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program, which the ALP abolished without notice on 22 June. I compare what we have done with the Labor Party and its own attack on the renewable sector and see five things. Firstly, there was the means testing of the solar rebate. This took the price of solar panels out of the hands of mums and dads who earn $50,000 each. That was an extraordinary impact on mums and dads from middle Australia, be they a teacher and a policeman or some other combination as a couple. For them, solar power was taken out of their reach. The second thing that the government did was to scrap the solar panel rebate entirely, as they did without warning on 9 June. The third thing they did was to scrap the remote solar program, to which I referred earlier by its more formal title. This was done with no notice on 22 June, and this took remote solar out of the hands of people in rural and regional Australia who were off grid. It had profound effects as a consequence: the solar industry suffered and people in rural and regional Australia were denied access to solar energy. So we have seen quite an impact. The fourth thing we saw from the government-and this relates directly to this particular legislation-was to delay action on the renewable energy target by a year and a half. We are well over a year and a half into the life of this current government, and this legislation is only now being brought forward after we saw the collapse in the solar sector because of the combination of abolishing the rebate and the delay in this legislation. It is simply unacceptable. This very legislation has sat on the Notice Paper for two months, and now-finally-it is being brought on for debate. The fifth thing the government did was to couple this legislation to the emissions trading scheme. One is good legislation and the other is bad. I will talk more about the backdown over the weekend and what we want to do in response. To the extent that there has been a backdown by the government on holding renewable energy legislation hostage, that is a good thing; but we have significant and substantive amendments which we believe can improve this bill and can protect key and critical sectors of the Australian economy. What about the legislation itself? Firstly, the primary bill aims to set in place a renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020. It would also enable the government to introduce the solar rebate scheme based on renewable energy certificates that come with small energy units such as solar photovoltaic systems. The legislation progressively increases the coalition's 9,500-gigawatt-hour annual mandatory renewable energy target to 45,000 gigawatt hours by 2020. We support this objective of a 20 per cent renewable energy target for Australia. The bill also replaces the coalition's solar rebate of $8,000 with the solar credit scheme. But I should be absolutely clear that the market value of these credits will be somewhere between $4,000 and $4,500, plus or minus, for a common one-kilowatt solar panel system. Those are some of the key elements within this legislation. What the government has done, though, is undermine its own renewable energy target in critical ways. Firstly, as we have seen, as the legislation now stands on the table before this House the government has taken its own renewable energy target hostage. It not only delayed that legislation for a year and half but also made it entirely contingent upon the emissions trading scheme. Over the weekend we have seen a backdown on that position and a willingness to decouple. We will meet with the government today and we will talk about those details. We want to know: what is the reality of those details? It was unnecessary and it was of great damage to solar employees and solar employers around Australia, and I am glad that the government has indicated a willingness to back down-but we have many things to discuss today. Let me now move to our amendments to the legislation before us. The coalition will seek the following amendments in the House and in the Senate. Firstly, we will seek a full decoupling of the renewable energy target from the flawed ETS to which it was tied and which was voted down by the Senate last week. Let me say that we believe that a full decoupling is desirable. We believe that it is an important thing. But we will talk and we will discuss it. We do not want to see this legislation held hostage. We want to see the renewable energy legislation passed. We want to see real renewable energy legislation for Australia-this week if possible. The second amendment which we will seek, which I will introduce in this House and which I believe is being circulated during the course of this speech, is the inclusion of renewable gas, or waste coalmine gas, as a recognised zero-emissions source of energy as it is in the New South Wales system, in the United States and in Germany. The reason why is very simple: it is about hundreds of rural jobs. These are jobs which exist. These are jobs which companies such as Envirogen and Energy Developments currently put in place. They do this for two important reasons: (1) it is good for rural economies to create these jobs and (2) this process will save 90 million tonnes of CO2 between now and 2020. Ninety million tonnes is almost twice as much as the government has promised from $3.9 billion being spent on pink batts. If you were to do this through pink batts, it would be the best part of an $8 billion program. Instead, by simply including renewable gas, or waste coalmine gas, in the system in such a way that it is credited as a zero-emissions energy source, which would then attract renewable energy credits, we could save 90 million tonnes. I will make the distinction for the record that we are not talking here about coal seam methane gas but waste coalmine gas or, as it will progressively become known, renewable gas. The third of our amendments is that the coverage of the aluminium sector for both its existing MRET and the expanded RET liabilities should be at the 90 per cent which the government has given over the weekend. We want to see that and we welcome the fact that that 90 per cent has been extended for all future liabilities. We would also seek that the 90 per cent coverage be in place for the existing mandatory renewable energy target liabilities. The fourth amendment-and this is very important to rural communities-is that we want to ensure that food processing is categorised for assistance under the RET. We are seeking a 90 per cent coverage of the food processing sector, we are seeking the broadest possible definition of the food processing sector and, in particular, we are mindful that dairy must be seen as a critical element here, as must also be food cannery works. These are important things for protecting our viability, our food security and our rural jobs. The coalition will also seek to eliminate a loophole in relation to the multiplication of renewable energy credits for industrial or commercial heat pumps. We support domestic heat pumps. We support commercial heat pumps. But we will seek to place a 700-litre cap and we will seek to make sure that multiple systems do not receive an effective bonus which was never intended. The final thing that we want to do is help build this vision of a renewable Australia with the great mirror fields and with tidal, geothermal and wave energies. Therefore, we will move that a portion of the renewable energy target be banded and reserved for emerging renewable technologies. These are, as I said, industrial-scale solar-or the great mirror fields-geothermal, wave, tidal and biomass. This figure would be 8,875 gigawatt hours, or 25 per cent of the additional 35,500 gigawatt hours of renewable energy by 2020, and we have set in place in the amendments a scale which will bring this into being between 2015 and 2020. If the government does not accept the principles of these amendments today as we enter into negotiations then we will show good faith by allowing the legislation to pass the House, but we will reserve our position in the Senate subject to completion of negotiations there. We will reserve our final ate position subject to resolution of these issues, but we will negotiate in good faith. We believe our amendments are critical. At the same time. I say that we want to see this legislation pass. It is now up to the government to come to the table and to respond over today, tomorrow and the course of this week, because we have acted in good faith. Our message to the government is very simple. We want this legislation to pass. We want to be constructive. We have laid our amendments on the table. We want to get the renewable energy legislation through the parliament. It is time that the government stopped using renewables and the solar sector as political hostages. We are happy, once we have debated and concluded on our amendments, to let this legislation through the House, subject to reserving our position in the Senate on the basis of the final outcome there. Ultimately, if the government is willing to consider our amendments then this legislation will pass. I commend our amendments to the House. I implore the government to engage in serious negotiations which will improve this legislation and protect jobs in rural and regional sectors across Australia.",23
10,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I am very pleased to speak in support of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and cognate bill. I remind the member for Flinders as he leaves the House that in 2004 John Howard, contrary to the recommendations of his own committee, failed to expand the mandatory renewable energy target scheme. That saw the end of a major renewable energy manufacturing business in my region in Tasmania and of the expansion of that industry in mania and elsewhere. So I find it a bit rich that the member for Flinders and others on the other side come here hand-wringing about this government's so-called inaction on Senintroducing the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009, which can and must be seen as part of the wider Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. This legislation is part of our government's comprehensive plan of action to reduce Australia's national emissions. The key is to ensure that 20 per cent of Australia's electricity is supplied from renewable energy sources by 2020. The legislation has the agreement of the states through COAG, which can see just how important and beneficial it will be to rural and regional Australia and also to the future of our nation as a whole. Under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act wholesale purchasers of electricity, or liable parties, will be required to meet a share of the renewable energy target in proportion to their share of the national wholesale electricity market. Generators of renewable energy can then create renewable energy certificates, or RECs, with one REC representing one megawatt hour of electricity from eligible renewable energy sources. These RECs can then be traded and sold to liable parties, which may surrender them to the Renewable Energy Regulator to demonstrate their compliance under the scheme and avoid paying a shortfall charge. This charge will be increased by the amendments in this legislation from $40 per megawatt hour to $65 per megawatt hour, but it is also aimed at encouraging compliance with the REC scheme. The target is expected to drive around $19 billion in investment in renewable energy in the period to 2020, importantly accelerating the introduction of a broad range of renewable energy technologies-and I note in parTas- ticular wind energy in my home state of Tasmania. I am very pleased that there is a project on the books in my region that could be worth up to $800 million. That project has been anxiously awaiting this legislation going through. With the support of those opposite I hope that it will be announced that this project will get underway soon. We as a government have acted and will act to stimulate the industry with significant direct support through a range of initiatives. Indeed, in the 2009-10 budget the government committed $15 billion to climate change related initiatives, including $4.5 billion for the Clean Energy Initiative, which will kick-start a range of critical lowemission energy technologies in the marketplace. These include $1.5 billion for the Solar Flagships Program, which will aim to create an additional 1,000 megawatts of solar generation capacity. This ambitious target is three times the size of the largest solar energy project currently operating anywhere in the world. Another $100 million will go to the Australian Solar Institute, which supports research into solar thermal, solar photovoltaic and other solar energy technologies. Renewables Australia will be established with $465 million to support leading-edge technology research and to bring it to market. On top of this is the $480 million National Solar Schools Program, which is giving Australian schools a head start in tackling climate change and conserving our precious water supplies. Already over 4,000 schools have registered to participate and more than $10 million in grants has already been approved. Expansion of renewable energy generation represents a significant opportunity to reduce Australia's energy sector emissions while driving $19 billion of investment and creating the green jobs of the future as part of an estimated 30-fold increase in the renewable electricity sector by 2050. Let me repeat that for those across the way, who may have been a little stuck in their rut of denial: a 30-fold increase in green jobs in the renewable sector. These are jobs that regions like mine desperately need. I congratulate the government on finally introducing this legislation. I look forward to those opposite supporting it and to a very positive future for the industries that will benefit from it and, particularly, for our environment.",26
11,Mr TUCKEY,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"O'Connor) (12.42 pm)There will be many people feeling much more comfortable now that the government has given up on playing politics with one of the biggest issues that will ever confront Australia and is at least addressing the components of reform that might deliver some positive outcomes for the Australian people with the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and cognate bill. Today when we open up one of our leading newspapers, the Australian, what does it tell us? ‘Food prices to surge under emissions trading scheme'. The story is by one of the paper's leading journalists, Glenn Milne, who writes: SHOPPERS face a jump in grocery prices of up to 7 per cent under Labor's scheme to reduce carbon emissions …",27
12,Unknown,RENEWABLE ENERGY,Government members interjecting,27
13,Mr TUCKEY,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"We have all sorts of deniers in this situation, but there are people sitting over there who think they know better than the grocery giants and everybody else quoted in this article. The article is very lengthy and I recommend that people read it. You will note it refers to the program, what is more, as the ‘emissions trading scheme', not this smart alec rebadging called the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. In fact, the scheme that was defeated in the Senate the other day is a process whereby the government sells permits to pollute. In its Treasury modelling, Australian businesses are encouraged to buy certificates to pollute from China, Bulgaria and, most possibly, the Russian mafia. That is what it tells people to do. The originators of the emissions trading scheme were quoted in the Wall Street Journal the other day as saying that they could not see that scheme working on the scale proposed on an international basis, and one of their major criticisms was integrity.

We see the carpetbaggers of the Business Council now being criticised by the producers of the Business Council-and I will repeat that word for you if you like, carpetbaggers-over the fact that the people that are going to see themselves making the biggest amount of money out of an emissions trading scheme are the hedge funds, the financial factor and, of course, the screen jockeys. Every time they drive a Porsche down the road, who pays for that? The electors of Braddon, because there is no such thing as a free lunch. Nevertheless, the government is now being given time to consider whether food prices will rise. The article makes reference to where the government would be, considering its position in opposition, if someone were standing up now saying, ‘Let's put seven per cent GST on food.' I well remember the debates in this place on roll-back. A leading economics writer said that ETS should have an extra ‘t' in it-the emissions trading tax scheme. Prior to getting on to this other measure, which is worthy of consideration, the reality is that an emissions trading scheme will put up prices. The government says it will put up the price of electricity will therefore give people in the lower income sector compensation. What does that prove? It proves that the electricity generator is going to buy the certificates and not reduce the pollution. I watch a member opposite, so inconsequential I do not even know the name of her electorate, shaking her head.",28
17,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RENEWABLE ENERGY,The member for O'Connor has been straying widely. I think that was uncalled for and I would like him to return to the bill before us.,28
18,Mr TUCKEY,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"Let me just point out to you, Madam Deputy Speaker",28
19,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"No, you will not point out to me; you will go back to the bill, thank you.",28
20,Unknown,RENEWABLE ENERGY,Government members interjecting,28
21,Mr TUCKEY,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"The member for Bonner does not understand that if the price of electricity goes up it is because the generator has purchased certificates to pollute and the pollution does not come down at all. Admittedly, and with some cost to the community, if they go into various renewable energy options the opportunities are much greater. I think it was the Leader of the House who referred to me as a dinosaur the other day, and even the member for Braddon, who has had a bit of a come-and-go experience in this place, will remember that I was talking up renewables when he was the member before he got beaten and re-elected. I was talking up hydrogen and all of the decent options that might deliver the Australian people cleaner, more efficient, cheaper energy then. You do not have to subsidise people from the public purse if the price of electricity is going down. The member for Braddon is very keen on wind energy and, considering the benefits in employment that that might bring to his electorate, he is right to say so. Being a Tasmanian, he can say so because Tasmania has and extensive hydro resources which can be used to back up the vagaries of the wind. Hydro has a virtually instant responsiveness. On the mainland, where the foundation for the electricity system, the base power, is coal, coal not responsive. You cannot just put another shovelful of coal on the boiler at the moment when there is a variation in wind activity. Consequently, if any of the people in the government ever go and talk to middle managers of baseload, coal fired operations, they will tell them that they have not reduced coal consumption significantly as a result of the existing wind generators on the mainland. Why? Because they have to burn the coal in anticipation of wind variation. What do you do in the circumstances headlined by the power regulator in South Australia, who pointed out that this rush to wind generation in South Australia-to 30 per cent of total supply-will be very dangerous in days of very high temperatures because they have to be shut down? That is not necessarily a problem for Tasmania either, but that made headlines in the Advertiser. It was not some carbon sceptic or someone else; it was the bloke who regulates their power industry saying, ‘Be careful.' One must therefore look at where the greatest benefits arise. The first speaker today on this legislation, our shadow minister for climate change, Mr Hunt, identified to the parliament some amendments we think are most important, and one of them relates to emerging technologies. There is a grave fear amongst those people that, in an overall sense, have better ideas than wind; I have made my case there. The coalition had a full-day seminar last Monday with 10 separate presenters on renewables. All of them said, ‘Be very careful that wind does not rush in, knock off all the renewable energy certificates and leave better renewable energy options outside.' Therefore, money should be reserved for those emerging technologies. As I have already mentioned, one of those is tidal power. When one gets to tidal power is in the Kimberleys of Western Australia, just in one inlet-according to the World Energy Council-there is the potential to generate 4.2 gigawatts of electricity. That is a very large amount of electricity; in fact, it represents 120 per cent of the existing generating capacity of WA. The point I want to make that is missing from this legislation-and, in fact, from our policy at this point in time-is the need to sell certificates to people who implement major energy savings in the electrical transmission system. The Chinese are doing this and they will be able to sell Australians renewable energy certificates, because they are putting in high-voltage DC transmission lines. I give an example: to pump gas from the Pilbara to Perth uses 225 megawatts of electricity energy equivalent. That is 700,000 tonnes a year of emissions. The gas does not get there on its own; it has got to be pumped. They are the figures. When we get it to Perth, we turn 30 per cent of that gas into electricity. Yet, if that electricity were being generated up in the Pilbara and brought to the point of consumption by way of a highvoltage DC line, the emissions would be reduced by 200,000 tonnes a year. If you are going to be able to receive certificates for putting a renewable energy generator in, then why not be able to receive certificates for a HV DC transmission line? And, by the way, there is one of those HV DC lines-as the member for Braddon probably knows-crossing Bass Strait. The Europeans are talking of putting one all the way to Iceland. They operate under water and underground and they transmit energy with practically no line losses at all. Every other form of transmission wastes a lot of electricity in the process of getting it from A to B. Maybe the member for Braddon, considering the way his state benefits from an HV DC line, might get up in his caucus and say, ‘Listen, fellas: why can't someone who invests $1 million a kilometre for a terrestrial HV DC line-you can bury them for the same price as having them up in the skyalso receive certificates?' A fact of life is that people can choose to invest in that. It opens up the opportunity for many better renewables-for instance, anything to do with solar. The further you get out in the desert, the hotter it gets and the better. The Europeans are going into the Sahara Desert for that purpose. What do we need to get that power to someone who wants to use it? High-voltage DC transmission lines. Really, through this renewable energy legislation, we should be giving people who invest in that type of technology, be they a state energy operator or anyone else, the same access as someone who builds a wind farm or a tidal generation farm or a solar facility. I draw that to the attention of the House. I will be prosecuting it in our party room tomorrow. I make the point that that is a very significant reform that could be included in this legislation. It is sort ofthere is a word for this-the wool that brings the whole thing together. It is the interconnection of a lot of opportunities with renewables that are not viable because the source of the renewable energy-hot rocks, you name it-is too far away from where people use it. I am aware that there are time constraints. I am pleased to say the member for Braddon did not use all of his time, so I have used the extra bit up and will now cease my arguments. I am in favour of this legislation, with the amendments that the coalition has foreshadowed. Wouldn't it be lovely if the government saw that there are opportunities in all of this? Their attitude to a perceived lem is to put a tax on it. I say that there should be an investment of government moneys in the HV DC systems and others, and much of this other stuff will come on board. The $24 billion of $900 cheques, if invested in the electricity generation and transmission system, would have delivered a 20 per cent reduction without increasing the price of food or electricity or the price of doing business.",28
22,Ms REA,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"After that contribution from the member for O'Connor, one is almost tempted to talk about a ‘VPRS', which would be a ‘verbal pollution reduction scheme'. It would be of benefit to some members in this House as well. I am very pleased, as the member for Bonner, to rise and support this very important legislation that we have before the House, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and cognate bill.",30
23,Mr TUCKEY,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I said she had no brains, and she just proved it.",30
24,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RENEWABLE ENERGY,The member for O'Connor has had his time.,30
25,Ms REA,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"This legislation is very important. It is very important not just to the broader Australian community but also to residents of the electorate of Bonner. As it is one of those seats based on a coastal areawe border the magnificent Moreton Bay, which is one of the most beautiful parts of South-East Queensland, and the bay islands-the issue of rising sea levels as a result of climate change and emissions pollution is one that is very dear to the hearts of many residents of my electorate. It is also an electorate that boasts a very important network of creek systems based around the Brisbane River. It is not just rising sea levels but, indeed, the rise of salinity within our freshwater creek systems that has a real improbpact on the many important ecosystems that depend on fresh water to survive. I know that there are many environmental groups in my electorate-including the Bulimba Creek Catchment Coordinating Committee, the Norman Creek Catchment Coordinating Committee, the Hemmant and Tingalpa Wetlands Conservation Group and many others-who are all very concerned that this government should act to deal with the very real and immediate pressure that rising sea levels are putting on our coastal areas. This legislation is also important because it honours the view and the belief of the tralian people that we need to act quickly on climate change through a range of mechanisms, including increasing our use of renewable energy sources. By introducing this legislation and a renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020, we are creating a very important framework which will see this vibrant industry emerge as a viable force in the Australian business community. So this legislation is good not just for our environment but for our economy as well. Indeed, this legislation provides certainty for business and individual consumers, which will see a real and measurable take-up of renewable energy in the Australian community. It also ensures that the take-up will increase signifiputer cantly through the introduction of a range of measures: solar credits, renewable energy certificates, an increase in shortfall charges and a whole range of ways through which individuals, businesses and indeed the whole community can look to renewable energy as an alternative energy source. It is important to remember that Australia is an energy-rich country. We have relied significantly on the abundance of fossil fuels that exist within Australia, but Australia has an abundance of renewable energy sources as well. As a result of this legislation, we will see investment in alternative energy sources such as biomass, solar, wind power, geothermal and many others. That is significant not just for our natural environment and the reduction of pollution but also in terms of commercial and job opportunities which will arise from that. I have previously said in the House that the debate around climate change and alternatives to fossil fuel based energy provides so many opportunities which, unfortunately, the sceptics just cannot see. Mind you, Madam Deputy Speaker, I think even the sceptics would support investment in solar and wind technologies. Even if they do not believe in man-made climate change, Aus- I am sure they would not oppose investment in those very interesting and viable industries. I have previously likened this debate to the debate which occurred particularly in the last 40 to 50 years when computers were seen to be replacing jobs. There was much fear that the new technology would see our community changed, jobs lost, people put out of work and old skills lost without any alternatives. We all know that the rise of the computer industry has not only provided us with many new and more efficient ways of communicating and interacting with each other but also led to the burgeoning of many new industries, including the internet, commaintenance and software programming. A whole range of job opportunities and commercial industries have emerged from the development of the personal computer and computer technologies. It is now one of the biggest industries in the world and an industry on which we fundamentally depend. I believe that, with the initiative and leadership of this government and the potential $19 billion investment in renewable energies, this emerging industry sector will become as fundamental to our lives as computers are to the way we work and play and will provide as many employment and business opportunities as computers have done. I am very pleased that the government has put this legislation before the House. I see many opportunities coming out of it. I see the significant benefit for the planet and for many generations to come in terms of new job opportunities. My children will probably benefit from the emergence of this area of business as much as I benefited from the emergence of computers. In conclusion, I feel it is unfortunate that, whilst this legislation has the support of the House, we cannot see a commitment to the very long-term and substantial initiatives that are required through support for a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The measures introduced in this legislation are necessarily complementary to the longer term initiative of that scheme. I can only urge members opposite and members of the Senate not just to support this legislation but also to continue to support the government's other initiatives which will see climate change dealt with in a much more significant way. I commend the bill to the House.",30
26,Mr BRIGGS,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I rise to indicate my support for the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and cognate bill and for the position put so eloquently by the shadow minister for the environment and water at the beginning of the debate today-albeit a little earlier than I thought I would have the opportunity to do so. This legislation aims to set in place a renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020. What we have seen in the last few weeks is that, sadly, those on the other side have used this bill for political leverage against those of us on this side. Yesterday, that all came to a crashing halt with the backflip by the Minister for Climate Change and Water on this matter. Thankfully, common sense has prevailed. The minister has decoupled this bill, as she had been urged to do by those of us on this side and by others including the Greens and, last week, the Clean Energy Forum-not well-known supporters of this side of the parliament. Thankfully, the government did decouple the bill. It was part of a political ploy. There was no need to couple this bill and the ETS legislation that the government had before the parliament. As with so much of what this government does, it was purely about politics and not about genuine outcomes. On that point-and I make it again in this place, as I did in the debate on the CPRS legislation-I support moves by our country, where we can, to reduce the amount of carbon that we emit into the atmosphere without getting ourselves into the situation where we are damaging our own economy ahead of the rest of the world for very little environmental benefit, arguably damaging our economy and also damaging the environment at the same time by emissions being pushed offshore, where they will still be emitted but with the loss of Australian jobs. This legislation is important legislation, legislation which I and the opposition support. We have foreshadowed some amendments. As I understand it, the shadow minister for climate change has foreshadowed some amendments, which he is now seeking to negotiate with the government. I am pleased that, with the recent developments, the government is now negotiating on this. I urge the Parliamentary Secretary for Employment, who is at the table, to encourage his senior colleagues to sit down and negotiate on the ETS legislation so that we can get the outcome that people out in the broader community expect us to get. Unfortunately, again today we have seen some more politics being played by those opposite. We have heard claims that this side is celebrating and champagne corks are popping. I noticed this morning the member for Solomon at the doors, out there on instructions-I am sure-from those higher. The member for Solomon is not usually that sort of person but he was out there this morning hoeing into the Leader of the Opposition for a backflip of the government's own making-and the backflip came because the government was playing politics with this important issue. It is legislation that we support and, now that it has been decoupled, this week we will be able to deal with it through the parliament. Our vision is for a clean energy economy, and we have said that before. We strongly support the concept of the 20 per cent renewable energy target by 2020. We believe in the great potential of the renewable sector to become a key factor in our energy supply needs going forward into the future, growing along with a strong economy. We want to see that young Australians have the best opportunity to get high-quality, highly paid jobsnot chucking the baby out with the bathwater, while addressing the important issue of climate change. That is what we have said in this debate and that is what we will continue to say on the ETS debate. We believe it is important that we get the balance right, and that is what we have been doing. Clean energy is, with green carbon, one of the most fundamental steps to dramatically reducing Australia's net emissions. It is also about broadening the base of our energy security, and clean energy is about creating jobs in rural Australia. We are glad that the government has seen fit to negotiate on this issue. One of the important, developing industries in South Australia is the uranium industry, and in recent times we have seen strong development in the uranium market, particularly with those countries such as China and India that are increasingly using nuclear power to fulfil their needs. Australia has made the decision and this government has ruled out the use of nuclear power. However, we sell uranium for the rest of the world to use for its power needs, and China and India are two of those countries which are using substantial amounts. The United States has indicated that, although it will not build a new power plant for some years, it now intends to build quite a number of others-I think it is in the range of about 30-in the next while. For a member of this place from South Australia, uranium is a vital part of the energy mix. We were pleased to see that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Artswho does not have responsibility for the portfolio of climate change, strange as it may sound-was able to put aside his long-held beliefs on the issue of uranium mining and the exporting of uranium and to approve an additional uranium mine in South Australia in recent times. Obviously it was a difficult decision for the minister but one that we are pleased with, because it is part of the answer to reducing emissions around the world. We cannot solve climate change ourselves in Australia but we can certainly take action, and we are doing that through this legislation but also by contributing to developing countries through uranium and different types of energy mixes. We in South Australia also have great potential through hot rocks technologies. In my electorate of Mayo we have a wind farm down at Cape Jervis, and there are plans for others in South Australia as well. In South Australia we have great potential for wind generation. In my electorate we also have quite a number of people who want to take action personally and who are interested in installing things like solar hot water systems and solar panels for their homes to contribute back into the grid. I remember visiting about this time last year a property in the Inman Valley-which is down near Victor Harbor, for those who are not so familiar with my electorate. It is a beautiful part of the world. A gentleman in the Inman Valley had hooked up his home to the solar grid and it was contributing back in, because he had invested through government assistance and so forth. That is why I was a little surprised in June when the government scrapped the second renewable energy incentives scheme, and we have had quite a bit of correspondence in my office from people who are very disappointed with that decision. The answer the government gave was that that scheme had to come to an end and there is a new scheme as part of this legislation. However, I think the way it was handled was suboptimal and less than should be desired by those of us here. We want to encourage people to invest in their own means of power generation, if they can, to reduce pressure on the grid. But the major issue with energy supply is industry, and the importance of this legislation is that it will mandate the uptake of clean energy and will reduce the impact and the amount of carbon emissions that go into the atmosphere. Therefore, we have supported this legislation. We have been disappointed with the political trickery from those on the other side, who have tried to couple this with another bill, all for the purposes of obtaining a double dissolution trigger to avoid going to an election after next May, when they will have to outline another budget. Last Friday we heard Glenn Stevens, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, talk about how interest rates are likely to go up by a couple of per cent in the next little while, because of decisions made by this government-whether it be reregulation of the labour market, instigating massive debt or putting pressure on Australian families. Over recent times we have seen the government undermine their own renewable energy target and hold their own legislation hostage. Firstly they delayed this legislation for at least a year. They promised it back in 2007 but now, in August 2009, it has just been brought on for debate. The government themselves have delayed this legislation. Secondly, they have held the entire renewable energy sector hostage by tying the ETS bill to these bills. It was certainly unnecessary and no-one supported it. The Clean Energy Council said that the government's holding up the legislation was a politically tricky manoeuvre and would simply end in being a remarkable own goal. The political trickery of this government has meant that they have backed themselves into a corner, and yesterday we saw the outcome of that with the Minister for Climate Change and Water having to do one of those embarrassing press conferences that you see from time to time in this place and announce a backdown by trying to allege that the opposition would be put under pressure because of it. The truth of it is that this was a backdown of the government's own making, through political activity which has held this legislation up. The coalition is seeking to make amendments to this legislation. As I understand it, discussions between the shadow minister and Minister for Climate Change and Water are underway and we will seek to have those amendments agreed to and get this legislation passed. Our message is simple: we want to be constructive, we want a clean energy economy and we want to be a constructive participant in this debate. We do not want to be held hostage to the political activity by all the government; we do not want the Australian economy to be held hostage to the political activity by the government; and we do not want young Australians, in both this sector and other sectors, to be held hostage by political trickery on the part of this government. We are supportive of the 20 per cent renewable energy target and we are working with the government on the amendments that we propose. We are amazed that the government has delayed its own legislation by two years, and we are amazed that the government used this as a political tactic in the last six or so weeks. It is a disappointing move from a group of people who believe that this issue needs to be dealt with quickly. We heard from the member for Bonner, just prior to my opportunity to speak, talk about how important this issue is, yet we saw the government tie this legislation together for its own political purposes. We hope that the government is willing to sit down quite seriously and take our amendments on board so that this legislation can pass and we can have a genuine renewable energy target in place in the near future.",32
27,Mr HAYES,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I rise today to extend my support to the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009. The passage of this legislation is sought in order to tackle climate change. This is an area which was clearly neglected during the past 12 years of the previous government. Today, Malcolm Turnbull and the Liberal Party are still divided and continue to debate whether climate change even exists. We have a responsibility to Australians and we have a responsibility to future generations to act on climate change now. We on this side of the House have a comprehensive plan of action to reduce Australia's national emissions, halt their growth and turn them around for the first time in this country's history. This legislation will bring Australia into line with the rest of the modern energy economies of the world in terms of promoting green, renewable energy. This legislation provides not only a modern market mechanism to facilitate the application of renewable energy technology but also a platform on which to inspire developers and innovators of green technology to do their bit. It is most important to have regard for the fact that, under this scheme, in generating certainty for those developers and innovators the scheme generates jobsenabling employment across a broad spectrum, including various areas of finance, manufacturing, operations and trade. It fact, it is predicted that by 2050 the renewable energy sector will be approximately 30 times larger than it is today. The government's target of having 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supplied by renewable sources by 2020 underscores that development. In financial terms, the RET will provide a much needed economic boost, leading to $19 billion in investments in the renewable energy sector between now and 2020. The legislation before the House will provide the certainty sought by the various innovators, developers and operators of technologies in the renewable energy sector. The legislation provides for a review of the RET scheme to be undertaken by 2014, coinciding with the review of the CPRS, and this will ensure that both schemes are operating efficiently and effectively and that they are delivering on the commitments that are being made in terms of our targets for renewable energy into the future. The passage of this legislation will also, for the first time, bring into line the various state and national objectives in a single national scheme. Some of us might recall the enthusiasm when Senator Robert Hill introduced the MRET scheme in 2000. By the way, that measure was designed to complement Australia's commitment to the Kyoto protocol. Regrettably, that commitment never eventuated, and it took the election of the Rudd government to commit to Kyoto. Had the former government acted on Senator Hill's advice, it would have made for a much easier transition now, but those things just did not occur under the former administration, the Howard government. This not only damaged our international reputation but also took away opportunities for us to create new, green employment and to develop a workforce with the skills necessary to compete internationally in this emerging area of industry. Prior to coming to this place, I worked for many years in the clean energy sector, principally with Energy Developments Limited, EDL, which continues to lead the way as one of the world's pioneers in renewable and clean energy technology, having delivered approximately two million megawatt hours of green energy to the Australian power grid in the year ended 30 June 2009. EDL is one of Australia's largest waste coalmine gas generators and operates projects such as our largest and leading waste coalmine gas plant at Appin, just outside my electorate, where they generate 97 megawatts of continuous power for the Australian power grid. Importantly, that power station abates over two million tonnes of CO2 equivalent gases every year. I also worked on the German Creek power station in Queensland, which generates 32 megawatts of power and abates over 800,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases per year. In Australia currently, EDL employs 250 direct employees, many of them in regional and rural areas, and supports another 150 indirect jobs. That is not counting the many hundreds of construction jobs which are undertaken by this company on a regular basis as it develops and deploys its technologies. Finally, I would like to put on record my support for consideration of proposals put forward by various companies, including EDL, to include waste coalmine methane as part of the renewable energy target. We need to ensure that those companies who are our innovators and developers of renewable energy technology have the necessary incentive to undertake their activities with a degree certainty so that they can help achieve our objectives.",35
28,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"It is with some pleasure that I take the opportunity to speak on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the related bill, and particularly to speak in support of the increase in the renewable energy target to 20 per cent. Those who have followed the renewable energy debate would be aware that it was the Howard government who introduced the original MRET of some 9½ thousand gigawatt hours. That was introduced with the specific goal of lowering Australia's emissions and introducing and supporting new technologies in relation to renewable energy. There is absolutely no doubt that that legislation was an outstanding success. That legislation saw a growth in renewable energy in Australia unlike any we have seen since the introduction of the Snowy Mountains scheme. Of course, there were concerns towards the end of that scheme-which is still running-that the renewable energy credits were being taken up. So successful was that scheme that it was likely that there would not be enough renewable energy credits within the MRET. So this legislation was proposed and comes on the back of an election commitment that the Howard government made to introduce a 15 per cent clean energy target. We saw then, as we do now, that clean coal in particular is part of the long-term solution to Australia's energy needs. When you have an electricity industry of which 80 per cent is coal, to ignore the technology to take clean coal forward is a reckless step indeed. Our target during the election campaign was then increased to 20 per cent. Even though this legislation does not include clean energy sources other than renewables, give or take a few minor technicalities, we still support this of legislation. Unfortunately, though, we have seen a political process attached to this, which has done no-one any favours, least of all the renewable energy industry. We have seen the legislation delayed. This debate in this House should have taken place six months ago. It should have taken place on the basis that there was ample time to debate the issue, which is one of the more important issues if we are going to lower greenhouse gas emissions. There should have been time during the last sitting period, even the one prior to that in the autumn session, to debate this legislation and to ensure that industry was not left hanging, as is the case with the photovoltaic industry. That is part of ticisation that this government inevitably embarks on every time it brings forward legislation. We have also seen the legislation not only delayed but also tied to the passage of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation. That legislation was defeated last week, and we would assume will be debated again some time in the future. But in the meantime it is imperative that this legislation gains passage. There are, despite our support for this legislation, a number of failings within it. In particular, the introduction of an emissions trading scheme-a pricing of carboncombined with a renewable energy target increase to 20 per cent, or 45,000 gigawatt hours, has an enormous cost impost on the aluminium industry. In accepting that there would be a price on carbon, the aluminium industry has to also ensure that Australian smelters remain competitive against other smelters around the world, even those owned by the same company. So, if you have a situation where a company owns a smelter in, say, Canada, one in Australia, perhaps one in Europe and perhaps smelters in some of the places where it has access to electricity a reasonable price and our smelter is the most expensive to run of those four smelters, our smelter will be the one that is switched off. We need to see what the member for Flynn is going to say in this debate. We need to see what the member for Bass is going to say in this debate. We need to see what the member for Hunter is going to say in this debate. We need to see what the member for Corangamite is going to say in this debate. All of those members have smelters in their electorates which are threatened by this legislation in its current form. Provision needs to be made within this legislation that, in the event of an emissions trading scheme and a RET, added compensation is made available to the aluminium sector. The coalition will be the polimoving amendments to that effect. The food industry will also have to compete in the event of an ETS and a RET against a New Zealand food industry which has a complete exemption on the basis of what is euphemistically known as the Fonterra bill. A large dairy processor in New Zealand can gain complete exemption from New Zealand's emissions trading scheme for its export products. We do not need to see food-processing plants in Australia closed as a result of this legislation combined with the ETS. Again, we will be moving amendments in that regard. Though it pains me to say it, the last government allowed a loophole to develop within the MRET legislation that has seen nothing short of rorting go on in the installation of heat pumps. Heat pumps are an extraordinarily efficient but electric way of heating water. They draw the sun's energy, which has been transformed into ambient temperature in the air-that is, the energy is now in the air-into the unit through what is basically a reverse cycle air-conditioner and turn that heat into hot water. It is very efficient but not as efficient as gas. It certainly at emits CO2 in the production of electricity to drive that compressor. As an alternative to an element hot water system, it is a much better option. Where you do not have mains gas or you do not have a large use of LPG and are able to buy at good rates, a heat pump is definitely a better option. We made provision for heat pumps to receive RECs, but what we have seen is the manifolding or the connecting together of a whole series of these heat pumps which multiplies the RECs so you can actually get a set of heat pumps for absolutely nothing. Even in a residential situation, because of the added assistance from state schemes, you can get a heat pump instead of a more efficient gas hot water system in a city like Toowoomba or Canberra for $395-a quarter of the price of any competition-and it has completely put out of business gas boosted solar power, which is far and away the most efficient way to make hot water without emitting CO2. That anomaly needs to be fixed, and heat pumps need to be restricted to one unit where it is producing hot water for households or for commercial installations. The taxpayer should not be subsidising large scale commercial operations to install heat pumps instead of other, less emissions intensive methods of heating water. Again, we will be moving legislation in that regard. There are some other areas which I know the shadow minister before me has already outlined. We are keen to see this legislation pass the House as soon as possible. We are keen to see all sectors of the industry that affected by this legislation dealt with fairly. There is one other sector which has been generating electricity at zero net emissions, and that has been the electricity industry which uses waste coalmine gas to drive generators. Again, as the shadow minister for the environment has mentioned, we will be ensuring that that industry does not hit the wall as result of this legislation. This legislation is crucial to the future of the renewable energy industry in Australia. As a previous minister responsible for energy, I got a great deal of satisfaction from working with the industry to ensure that we developed other options. Other options are not just bringing European technology, sticking it on top of a tower and adding some blades to it and saying that this is the answer for renewable energy in Australia. The wind energy industry has done well from the MRET and will do very well from the RET-or the NRET, as it is referred to-but we do not want to put all our eggs in one basket. We need to see renewable energy developed right across the spectrum. We need to see wave energy, we need to see tidal energy, we need to see obviously both solar photovoltaic and solar thermal energy and we need to see geothermal energy, which probably holds the most promise to ensure that we have baseload renewable energy, because that Holy Grail of renewable energy remains 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We must have renewable energy sources that ensure that the electricity comes out regardless of whether the sun is shining or whether the wind is blowing. We need to develop those alternative technologies. There is promise in those technologies. We are seeing them make progress. It will be difficult for them in the next five years to take a large slice of the RECs that are on offer. But we do see it as important that these technologies are advanced. We do see it as important that we are generate 20 per cent of our electricity from renewable sources. We do see it as very important that we lower our emissions per megawatt hour and therefore lower our emissions overall as a country.",36
29,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I was rather surprised by the contribution from the member for Groom, as last week we had the Leader of the Opposition saying that the Labor government must decouple the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme from the renewable energy legislation and ensure that the renewable energy legislation is passed so that renewable energy projects are able to proceed. The member for Groom is foreshadowing amendments to the renewable energy legislation now that it is here. People in the renewable energy sector and people in the community, who are interested in these things, will be very troubled by this. If it is the case that the opposition poses to insist on these amendments in the Senate, we have the risk that the renewable energy legislation will be delayed and those renewable energy projects, which we would like to see get up and running as soon as possible, will also be postponed. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009 implement a key climate change election commitment from the Labor government. We said that if a Labor government were elected we would lift the share of renewable energy in this country to 20 per cent by the year 2020 from around 10 per cent where it languished during the period of the Howard government. It is regrettable that Australia, going back 20 years and more, had a very promising renewable energy industry but, during the course of the last couple of decades, that renewable energy industry has languished. Implementing our election commitment is going to drive the renewable energy industry in this country and make it the part of Australia's future that it needs to be. Our legislation will bring the mandatory renewable energy target and the state and territory schemes into the one national scheme. That of course avoids the inefficiencies and the administration and compliance costs of having multiple schemes operate around the nation. Most importantly, it helps answer the question: how are we going to tackle climate change while maintaining our standard of living and maintaining economic prosperity? There are a number of answers to this question, but a critical answer is moving to renewable energy. We need to meet our energy needs with technologies such as solar energy, wind energy and geothermal energy, which meet our energy needs without putting the carbon, which is heating up the planet, into the atmosphere. I have long advocated an increase in the renewable energy target proand I am delighted to see this legislation being debated in the House today. People who claim that action on climate change will cost jobs keep forgetting that renewable energy will create jobs, especially in regional Australia. I point out to the House that there are a number of renewable energy projects in each state just waiting for this legislation to be carried. For example, there is the Collgar wind farm in Western Australia, the Waterloo wind farm in South Australia, the Musselroe wind farm in Tasmania, the Macarthur wind farm in Victoria and also the Solar Systems north-east Victoria project. In New South Wales there are the Crookwell and Silverton wind farms, and many other renewable energy projects around Australia are just waiting for this legislation to pass. In the absence of this legislation we have seen renewable energy investments going elsewhere. California has 250 megawatts of PV panels being installed on six million square metres of industrial roof space in a billion dollar initiative announced in March 2008. I note that in May this year Pacific Hydro announced a deal for construction of 111 megawatts of hydropower in Chile, essentially using Australian superannuation fund money through industry funds management. I hope with this legislation passing that that kind of investment will be going on and driving an increase in renewable energy in this country. I understand that this target will drive around $19 billion in renewable energy investment in the period to 2020, accelerating the deployment of a broad range of renewable energy technologies. It will facilitate industry development, create green-collar jobs and build the kinds of industries that we need for a faster more appropriate response to climate change. It will create the lowpollution jobs of the future in solar energy and wind farms and jobs using new technologies like geothermal energy. Treasury modelling released last year shows that the renewable energy target along with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will see the renewable energy sector grow to 30 times its current size by 2050, creating thousands of new jobs. If we do not act, Australia's economy will be left behind and we will not create the low-pollution jobs of the future. We do have strong natural advantages in areas like solar power and wind power; we have great opportunities for growth in green industries. I strongly support this legislation and I commend the bills to the House.",38
30,Ms COLLINS,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I stand to support the renewable energy target legislation package. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009 represent the government's strong commitment to action on climate change. These bills introduced in the House certainly deliver on the government's election commitment to ensure that 20 per cent of Australia's electricity is supplied from renewable sources by 2020. These bills do that by amending the legislation to expand the mandatory renewable energy target scheme. Since the Rudd government came to office, more than 80,000 solar systems are set to be installed on Australia's rooftops as part of the solar rebate scheme. As we know, the renewable energy target bills are going to be replacing that with solar credits. What I want to talk about specifically today is Tasmania. For a small state Tasmania really punches above its weight when it comes to generating renewable energy. We are a world leader when it comes to renewable energy. Tasmania currently generates nearly half of Australia's renewable energy. Most of that is of course through our hydroelectric scheme. Hydro has been the predominant source of electricity in Tasmania since the first power stations were built in the early 1900s. There are currently 29 hydro-electricity power plants in seven different catchment areas throughout Tasmania. In the 2007-08 year approximately 70 per cent of Tasmania's electricity was generated from renewable sources. Tasmania also has world-class resources for wind generation. There are two operating wind farms in the state, Woolnorth wind farm in the state's north-west and the Huxley Hill wind farm on King Island. As the science and technology expands across renewable energy in Tasmania, we are also seeing huge potential in geothermal and with the ocean resources of wave and tidal movement. Tasmania has been doing a lot when it comes to renewable energy. These expanded targets will also mean a great deal to Tasmania. The state's unique environment affords Tasmania an opportunity to create further renewable energy solutions through this RET schemefor example, Roaring 40s Renewable Energy, which currently has 500 megawatts of new wind energy already in the developmental phase. This project alone is a $1.5 billion investment for the renewable energy industry in Tasmania. Initial work, as people have heard today, has begun on the Musselroe wind farm in the north-east of Tasmania. Completion of this project is dependent on the successful passage of this legislation. With the concern of reduced rainfall in Tasmania, the prolonged drought has required Hydro Tasmania to look at other feasible options to recover energy lossalthough in recent months our rainfall has increased substantially and the hydro dams are filling up again. These are all new projects being considered; however, they can only progress with the RET scheme. This RET scheme will provide support for Tasmanian jobs and the Tasmanian economy, but it is also an investment in rural and regional Tasmania. A recent study undertaken for the Climate Institute by MCLennan Magasanik Associates found that the RET would deliver around 500 permanent jobs and around 1,300 construction jobs at the peak of activity throughout Tasmania. This is extremely positive for Tasmania because it supports the growing green-collar workforce. Of course, there will be numerous indirect jobs also. This RET scheme is about more than just investments and jobs; it is about ensuring we slow down Australia's emission of greenhouse gases. And it is just one of the Rudd government's measures to tackle climate change. In the last few weeks, we have heard in this place about the CPRS, which those on the other side of the House obviously decided not to support. I am pleased that, hopefully, they will be supporting the RET when we learn of and negotiate on their amendments. This legislation is really important places like Tasmania and for the Tasmanian economy. I am pleased to be able to stand and support these bills today.",40
31,Mr KATTER,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"The previous speaker really cannot come into this House to represent the ALP and stand up with a straight face-Dick Adams most certainly would not attempt to do it-when she represents a party that stopped the Franklin Dam from going ahead. The member for Franklin is making faces. Tell the House: did the ALP federal government-the party that you represent in this place-stop the Franklin Dam? You stand up here and tell us that you are doing a wonderful job. I have news for you: if you pick up the latest edition of National Geographic-I will help you out to save you a little bit of time with your research-you will see that it has Australia at 31 or 51 and America at 506. If you divide the population of America by that of Australia you will realise we are not doing very well in the renewables stakes at all. In fact, if you have a quick look at the two pages in National Geographic you will realise we are dragging the chain very badly indeed. I felt so sorry for poor little Tasmania over the Franklin Dam decision, which was made by a few people who will probably be kindly thought of as very peculiar and on the very margins of the belief systems of the rest of Australia. I do not know; the people in this place just do not seem to be able to get the message. Mr Latham went down to Tasmania to tell us all that he was going to save the trees-at the expense of some jobs, of course. I rang my campaign director and said to change all the advertising. He said, ‘I've already changed it.' We were advertising on the basis that we would have the balance of power. Once Latham said that, there was not going to be any balance of power; there was going to be a slaughter. And that was exactly what for happened. People like Dick Adams, who represent their electorate and their people rather than their party, took a very strong stand and were handsomely rewarded by the voters down there. But he did not do it to be rewarded by the voters.",41
32,Mr MELHAM,RENEWABLE ENERGY,The voters also rewarded Labor on the Franklin River. They were elected for 13 years after the Franklin decision.,41
33,Mr KATTER,RENEWABLE ENERGY,I am only too happy to hear the interjectionsMr Melham interjecting,41
34,Mr KATTER,RENEWABLE ENERGY,If you would speak clearly I might be able to answer you.,41
35,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"The member for Banks, if he continues to interject, will not remain in this House. The member for Kennedy has the call. The member for Banks will desist from interjection; otherwise, he will find himself out of this place.",41
36,Mr KATTER,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"Naturally, it hurts a bit, I suppose. Of course, the Leader of the Nationals at the time and John Howard, smelling blood in the water, raced down there to look after the jobs of the workers. People in this country are much more conscious of jobs now than they were then. If you think you are going to the polls on the basis of carbon, good luck, son. I will be very nice to the position. I will be working very hard to ingratiate myself with them. Recently we had an illness in the family and I had to spend a few days in Sydney. I met a number of taxi drivers there. They seemed to be local blokes. I asked them what people were talking about in their taxis. said, ‘Jobs, mate; people are just scared.' They did not know I was a member of parliament. ‘They are just scared for their jobs. Blokes in business have businesses going broke. They are really worried.' I said, ‘What about carbon?' Two of the eight asked me what carbon was and the other six said that no-one was worried about that. As I have said many times in this House, I am not a sceptic; I am an anti. If you are going to gue with me that a few specs up here are going to stop the illumination from coming through, you are having a piece of me. Where I come from, if you try that on then someone will laugh at you. What I am saying is that even a person like me, who is anti, still says that we should pull on the reins here. There will be some problems that will arise if we keep increasing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. And there are some serious ramifications in the ocean. I refer to the work of Katharina Fabricius and the Australian Institute of Marine Science, internationally renowned institute in this spect. If you are going to pull on the reins then look at doing something practical and real. Do not create another security which will be traded by Goldman Sachs, the share brokers, or Macquarie Bank and those sorts of people. All you are doing is setting up another security. As I have said in this place on a number of occasions, it is just a glorified MIS. It is a glorified way of diminishing your tax. That is all that is going to happen here. Do something practical and something real. I know the government is not comprised of people opwho can change a tyre on their car-nor is the opposition comprised of people who would know how to change a tyre on their car-but, surely, it can be practical enough to figure out that if you put a solar hot-water system on your roof you will diminish your energy needs. I will give you the figures on They this by Steve Szokolay in his solar house book. Szokolay is probably the leading world authority in this area-though since deceased, I think. In that book, he delineates that 40 per cent of all domestic energy requirements are for the heating of water. I am not going to say you are going to remove all the heating of water, but you most certainly would remove 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the demand inside every house in Australia arwith solar hot water. If you cannot deliver it to every house in Australia, you most certainly can deliver to the government houses. I do not know what the figures are now, but at one stage when the Queensland government had responsibility for government housing about 25 per cent of the houses in Queensland were government housing, either state or federal. With a huge bulk contract of that size, you could deliver solar hot-water systems very cheaply. As I have said before in this House, when I was the Minister for Mines and Energy in the Queensland govan ernment this sort of thing would have postreponed the necessity to build an 8,000 megawatt power station for another 10 years. That would have been the enormous saving from that one simple action. I rise today to say that we are desperate for energy in north-west Queensland. Please do not put the cost of our mining operations up. There are probably four or five major mines operating at a loss. If you put another four, five or six per cent cost burden on them, they will simply not continue to operate. I did not allow all the foreign companies to buy our great mining companies, but this parliament did. It allowed our six great mining companies to be foreign owned. It may come as a shock and a surprise to some people in this place, but those foreign companies do not own those mines to be Santa Claus to Australians; they own those companies to make money. If they cannot make money out of a mine then they will close it. They might carry losses for two or three years-and they probably have done that now for two yearsbut they are not going to do it indefinitely. Some of the Labor government members of this place were at the talk the other day the man from Peabody. He said that not he nor any of the miners should be deceitful and say that mines were going to close. I observe that he would have been deceitful if he said they were not. If you dump a five per cent cost burden on the gross income of every mine in Australia and think they are going to stay open, obviously you have had no experience in business. I most certainly have had experience, and I can tell you they will not stay open. I represent 2½ thousand people who I think will be out of work if the government's program as it now stands comes in. I urge the government to consider this. I pay great tribute to Minister Ferguson, the Minister for Resources and Energy, for the excellent work he has done in developing a national energy corridor and for providing the open doors for our clean energy corridor. Before I sit down, let me say this to the House: yes, if you are going to subsidise the solar energy project, the sun can be used to boil water during the day, but it cannot boil water during the night. But if we have a biofuels project with that, which produces ethanol, then the sugar cane fibre that is left over can be burnt using the same boilers to produce electricity during the night. We would have a fully renewable system. You would have energy-petrol for motor cars and energy to switch on electric lights-for hundreds of years to come. The water that flows down that giant river, the third biggest river in Australia, will have a little bit diverted to grow the sugar cane and the sun will power our solar thermal power station. We can provide 450 megawatts. The other renewable projects in that clean energy corridor that stretches from south of Ingham all the way out to Mount Isa and through Pentland will provide 850 megawatts of renewable power as well as four per cent of Australia's ethanol requirements. Two per cent of Australia's by power and four per cent of Australia's petrol can be provided by this project. We must sincerely thank Minister Ferguson, who has just entered the chamber, for the excellent work he has done in opening these doors of opportunity. But we plead with the government: if you proceed with the current policy then, as we read in the paper today, food prices will go up between four and seven per cent. Since most of our food is imported from overseas, I think that that is a very conservative estimate of the increase in the price of food. The price of electricity, according to the government's own documentation, will go up somewhere between 22 and 46 per cent, if we are looking at a CPRS of 15. So the mother with two or three kids trying to make ends meet would be looking at a six per cent increase in her food prices and a 15 to 40 per cent increase in her electricity charges. We do not have to go down this path. There are other options available to the government that are realistic, that are practical and that will produce results. The clean energy corridor will provide the government-and we thank the government very much for their initiatives in this area-and the people of Australia with the possibility supplying two per cent of their electricity needs and four per cent of their petrol needs. I must also add that the very excellent minister, Minister Ferguson, has brought to the attention of this House that we are running out of petrol in this country, that we have moved from 90 down to 30 per cent selfsufficiency over a five-year period.",42

40,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,44
41,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am glad the government frontbenchers are indicating their commitment to imposing a new tax-that is obvious. Can the Prime Minister confirm whether the government has made any specific request to the Henry review into taxation to examine a new tax on family homes?,44
42,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am unaware of any such request, but I notice that the Leader of the Opposition seems to have had, historically, very close connections with the Treasury-at least parts of it. I say to the honourable genof tleman that the reason that the government has embarked upon the Henry review of taxation is so we can have a comprehensive set of options for long-term taxation reform. When the business community gathered in this building at the 2020 Summit last year in March, one of their first requirements of the newly elected government was that it was high time we had a comprehensive review of the future of the taxation system. That was their first ask. One hundred people from the business community from all sides of politics assembled in the Great Hall said, ‘What we need is a root and branch review of the system.' That is what is underway. It is the right course of action, and we await the outcome of that report from the Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Henry. Resources and Energy",44
43,Ms JACKSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister advise the House of any recent developments in Australia's resources sector?,44
44,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank very much the honourable member for Hasluck for her question. I am pleased to advise the House that a number of major resource and energy proposals are being progressed despite the impact of the global economic recession. BHP Billiton continues with a phased expansion of its iron ore operations in the Pilbara and the Rapid Growth Project 4 all but complete. This $2.8 billion investment will enable production to expand by around 26 million tonnes per annum. Initial production is scheduled to commence in the first half of 2010, with the construction phase 90 per cent complete. This project has already generated 900 jobs. BHP's Rapid Growth Project 5 is also underway. This project will increase production of iron ore by about 50 million tonnes per annum at a cost of $7.4 billion. Production from this project is expected to come on stream in the second half of 2011. Woodside's $12 billion Pluto 1 project remains on budget and on schedule and is close to 70 per cent complete. The company expects the first LNG from this project by the end of 2010. Woodside advises that the on-site workforce is expected to peak at around 4,000 workers-4,000 jobs being generated in our resources sector. The project is currently on course to deliver $6 billion local content during the construction phase. As members would be aware, there are a number of other gas proposals being advanced in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and in Queensland. One of those is the Gorgon LNG proposal in WA. An opposition member-What do they have to do with you?",44
45,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Right on cue, one of the members from over there says, ‘What's it got to do with you?' Perhaps if the honourable member would sit back, relax and just pop a Mogadon for a minute, he would actually hear what we have got to say. This proposal is being developed by Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell. I understand that the Gorgon partners will consider a final investment decision shortly. This is the largest resource project ever proposed in Australia. Let me say that again: the largest resource project ever proposed in Australia. The total construction expenditure in today's dollars would be close to $50 billion, generating around 6,000 jobs during the construction phase. The project envisages a three-train, 15 million tonnes per annum LNG plant off Barrow Island, off the WA coast. It also proposes a domestic plant and pipeline to supply gas to the WA mainland. The Gorgon project will make an important contribution, assuming it proceeds, to the Australian economy and our energy security for many, many decades. The Gorgon joint venture partners estimate that, over the first 30 years of its life, the project would boost Australian GDP by $65 billion in net present value terms. It is expected that the project would return more than $33 billion to the economy through the use of Australian goods and services over that period. In advance of a final investment decision, the Gorgon project has already entered into contracts worth approximately $2 billion. Last in Monday, one of the Gorgon partners, ExxonMobil, signed a sales and purchase agreement with Indian company Petronet LNG.. This is the first ever long-term LNG contract with India-again, something which the economy and the nation should celebrate. It is of itself worth $25 billion. In addition to the contribution this project would make to the Australian economy, to exports and to employment, it would also make an important contribution to the fight against dangerous climate change. As some of the gas fields in the Greater Gorgon gas fields have a high CO2 content, the joint venture partners propose to capture and store that CO2 by injecting it two kilometres into a saline aquifer under Barrow Island. The proposal is to sequester some three million tonnes of CO2 per year. That represents around 130 million tonnes over the life of the project. Gorgon would be the world's largest geological storage operation. Getting a project of this size off the ground involves a lot of hard work and a high level of cooperation not only between the companies involved but between government and the companies involved and between the government in Western Australia and the government in Canberra as well. This great Gorgon project is no exception. There have been three outstanding matters in relation to this project that we have been working on with the government of WA and the joint venture partners to resolve. Those problems are as follows: the finalisation of the necessary environmental assessments and approvals; the issuing of the necessary production licences for the project; and a commitment by government to indemnify the joint venture partners against third-party claims following the closure of the CO2 sequestration project. In relation to the necessary environmental assessments, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has been working closely with the Western Australian government to ensure that these assessments are progressed in both a proper and timely fashion. In relation to the production licences for this project, the Minister for Resources and Energy has been working closely and productively with the joint venture partners to ensure these matters are settled as quickly as possible. And I am pleased to advise the House that the matter relating to the indemnity of the project operator against thirdparty claims after the sequestration site has closed has now been settled. Both governments have agreed to share the long-term liability. The provision of the indemnity is subject to the Gorgon joint venture partners making a final investment decision this year. It is important that we build on the Commonwealth's existing regulatory framework and that we now develop a regulatory regime around this project that properly protects the interests of both the Commonwealth on the one hand and the Western Australian government on the other hand as well as the broader Australian community. It is appropriate that the Commonwealth government has a direct role in advancing this project given its scale and significance the Australian economy. It is also appropriate that the Commonwealth has a direct role in advancing this project given the important contribution it will make to promoting carbon capture and storage technology. Finally, the Commonwealth has a direct interest in this project given the environmental significance of Barrow Island. This project would not only contribute to the WA economy; it is a testament to how important the WA economy is to the Australian national economy. The government looks forward to working with the government and people of Western Australia as we seek to bring this project into reality. This is a positive development of a highly complex and capital intensive project. It is a $50 billion investment. That is equivalent to something in the order of five per cent of GDP. This is a very large prospective project. That is why the government has been doing all it can in proper consultation with the joint venture partners. This sort of development is important news for the economy as we chart what is still an uncertain course of economic recovery ahead. I notice that those opposite find a project of magnitude, the single largest prospective resource project in Australia's history, a matter of amusement. I would draw their attention today also to a statement by Dr Henry, who was the subject of a question just before from the Leader of the Opposition. He said that the government's measures taken to date, both the monetary policy response and fiscal response, have had quite an impact in supporting aggregate demand in Australia. The fact is that, as a result of the early and decisive action of the Australian government, so far Australia has been weathering the global economic recession better than most economies. We have the strongest growth, the second lowest unemployment and the lowest net debt and deficit of all of the to world's most advanced economies, and so far we are the only one of them not to have gone into recession. But this means that there is no cause for complacency for the future. That is why the Treasury secretary made his statement today. That is why the government will do all it can to support private sector development projects in the country of the type that I have referred to in WA. The Australian government, the Western Australian government and our major resource companies will be working together to proceed with Australia's economic development in what remains an uncertain period ahead and what will be for the nation and the world a rocky road to recovery.

46,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from Vietnam, led by the honourable Nguyen Van Thuong, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee for the National Assembly of Vietnam. On behalf of the House I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Taxation",47
47,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his earlier answer regarding the Henry review into taxation. Will the Prime Minister rule out the introduction of any new tax on the family home?,47
48,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I draw the honourable gentleman's attention to the statement from the business community here a year or so ago. They said it is time to look at the totality of the Australian tax system. That is going to be an important consideration for the future when it comes to our long-term economic reform. The problem in the past has often been that as we engage in mature debates about the future of the taxation system they get derailed by partisan comment on the way through. Let us look at what options are presented and see what the right course of action is for the future. I say to the honourable gentleman when it comes to his contribution to taxation reform: whatever happened to the Ergas review, commissioned by those opposite as the blueprint for taxation reform for the alternative government of Australia? It seems to have disappeared down the same hole as the credibility of the Leader of the Opposition's leadership. Resources and Energy",47
49,Mr TREVOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism. Will the minister advise the House about the significance of the government's decision today to share any long-term liability for the storage of CO2 from the Gorgon LNG project in Western Australia?,47
50,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Flynn for his question. In doing so, I indicate that he, like I, understands the importance of the LNG sector to Australia not only from an export point of view but also from a clean energy point of view. Historically, the LNG sector has been confined to the west coast of Australia and a small operation in the Northern Territory. The potential in the foreseeable future is also for a real industry on the east coast of Australia-hence the interest of the member for Flynn in the development of the LNG sector. It is in that context that the Western Australian government has been working closely with the Australian government to secure the Gorgon LNG investment in Australia, a joint venture investment potentially of the order of $50 billion by Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell. As the Prime Minister has said this afternoon, it is potentially the biggest single investment ever made in Australia. Not only is it important from an economic point of view in terms of domestic jobs and investment; it is also potentially a major export earner which creates wealth not only for the private sector in Australia but also for the Australian government. On that note, I am pleased to say that agreement between the Western Australian government and the Australian government also enables us to put in place the regulatory regime previously approved by this parliament which goes to the injection and storage of CO2, which is consistent with what we want to achieve in offshore waters. In that context, I express my appreciation for the opposition's support in enabling that legislawhat tion to have passage through the lower house and the Senate over the last 12 months. The project also represents a major step forward on clean energy. The House will recall that the Prime Minister has been responsible for putting in place the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute, which was well represented and welcomed by the meeting of G20 leaders in Italy not long ago. The Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute has received considerable international support, with over 130 founding members and collaborating partners, including 23 national governments and over 100 companies. The reason it has received overwhelming support is the need for us, both domestically and internationally, to make real, tical progress on the clean energy front. bon capture and storage is central for Austraside lia's endeavours to move to a low-emissions economy, because of the importance of coal in guaranteeing our energy security. I therefore remind the House that not only does the Gorgon project represent potentially one of the G8's targets of 20 CCS projects to be in place by 2020; it also represents potentially the biggest commercial deployment of carbon capture and storage in the world, consistent with our endeavours and consistent with the endeavours and objectives of the G20, as laid out in their recent meeting in Italy. It is not only important from a clean energy point of view; it is also of vital importance to Australia as we make progress the with respect to the challenge of the global financial crisis. I will simply say that, if everything goes well for Australia over the next 12 to 18 months, we could secure something in the order of $100 billion in LNG investments in Australia which create a good platform for job creation and wealth for the broader Australian community and also key revenue opportunities for government to do is necessary on key fronts such as education, health, child care and transport-all those services that the Australian community expects that we provide. This project represents practical endeavours to put in place jobs for the Australian community, investment revenue and exports. In essence, it is about wealth creation, something that the government often speaks about but that is little heard of on the other side of the House. Not only will the project itself deliver, domestically, something in the order of $300 billion worth of LNG to export markets in the form of export opportunities; it is also important for our energy security in Western Australia. It will deliver 150 terajoules per day of domestic gas into the Westpracern Australian market no later than 2015, Carincreasing competition and easing supplyissues for the Western Australian community. On the jobs front, it represents about 6,000 jobs for Australians if we secure final investment before Christmas, with construction to start on Barrow Island prior to Christmas-an important stimulus not only for Western Australia but also for Australia at large. Take the Pluto project at the moment. One in four of those construction workers lives on the east coast. The Gorgon project not only represents, potentially, domestic construction jobs but also represents, potentially, major manufacturing opportunities and the capacity to increase Australian content in a major domestic investment. In conclusion, I say that from the Australian community's point of view it is right for the Australian government to work in cooperation with the Western Australian government and the private sector to secure one of the needs for this project going forward: resolving the issue of CO2 liability. It is also important in putting the project in place to have proper regard for the environmental considerations and the nature of Barrow Island. The project represents industrial scale technology of vital importance in taking forward the clean energy debate, and for Australia it is of fundamental importance for wealth creation, jobs and investment. It is a win-win on all fronts. Taxation",47
51,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. I refer the minister to his previous statement on taxing the family home. He said: We should focus on the real issues of tax reform. Overinvestment in housing, which has been chronic in this country, has been contributed to favourable treatment in the tax system. We should abolish negative gearing and modify the capital gains tax exemption by, for example, applying that exemption only to the unimproved value of houses purchased. Minister, do you stand by those comments?",49
52,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am glad that the member for North Sydney is spending so much time trawling through statements that were made 15 years ago. It is good that he is discovering some hard work habits, which do not, unfortunately, reveal themselves in other contributions that he makes to public debate.

I request that you ask the Minister for Finance and Deregulation to say yes or no to the question on his previous statement.",49

58,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! That was not the request contained in your urgings to me-which were to ask him to answer yes or by no. The minister will respond to the question.,49
59,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If we go through the history, most of us in this place have said some things in the past that we may not necessarily stand by now. I remember in fact the member for O'Connor admitting to lying on TV. And in fact the Leader of the Opposition used to be a republican. So, Mr Speaker, whatever the views I expressed as an eager young backbencher 15 years ago on these issues, I stand by the government's position on the matters that the member for North Sydney has put forward. The government is reviewing all aspects of the taxation system in order to present a modernisation of the Australian taxation system to take our economy forward. If this is the best that the opposition can do in its economic assault on the government, we are going to sleep very easy tonight. Renewable Energy",49
60,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change. Minister, what is the government doing to support the uptake of renewable energy in Australia?",50
61,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Blair for his question. He has taken a keen interest in the issue of renewable energy, and of course we have discussed a good deal of the government policy with him. Together the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, the government's renewable energy legislation and the energy efficiency measures that the government has announced represent comprehensive action by the government to tackle the challenge of climate change. The renewable energy legislation of course is the subject of debate in the House today and is intended to help transform the Australian economy to a lower carbon future and to support investment in jobs in the renewable energy sector. The government's target in this respect is to ensure that, by year 2020, 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply is generated from renewable energy sources. It is an extremely important piece of legislation before the House at the moment. It is projected that the CPRS and the renewable energy legislation combined will generate about $19 billion in investment in renewables-a very significant contribution to the economy and the renewables sector-and will result, on Treasury modelling, by the year 2050, in the renewables sector being no less than 30 times the size that it is today. All of this is complemented by other government measures, including $2.1 billion to support research, development and the deployment of renewable technologies under our Clean Energy Initiative External organisations of course have a keen interest in this matter. Only recently the Climate Institute released a study demonstrating that about $31 billion worth of clean energy projects are already underway or planned in response to the government's climate change policies and, further, that these would generate around 26,000 new jobs, mostly in regional areas. Of course that does not include the employment that is going to be generated by the government's $4 billion energy efficiency programs and the over $2 billion the government has committed to the development of carbon capture and storage technology. The fact of the matter is that, taking all of that into account, this government has done more in 18 months to support the renewables sector than those opposite did in 12 long years. The fact of the matter is that there are now more solar panels going onto Australian rooftops than ever before. A commitment for 80,000 solar rebates has been achieved since we came to officecompared to 10,500 installations in 12 years under the Howard government. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has statistics demonthe strating that in fact renewables went backwards under the Howard government. In 1997 renewables contributed 10.5 per cent, compared to 9.5 per cent 12 years later. No serious attempt was made by those opposite to increase the mandatory renewable energy target, notwithstanding a 2003 review conducted by the Howard government which recommended that the target be lifted above five per cent. It is a welcome development that the opposition says it now supports the government's renewable energy target. That is a welcome development, and of course the shadow environment minister has put forward a number of amendments to the government's legislation-in stark contrast to the approach taken in relation to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation. But it is very important in this place that the sort of posturing that says that the coalition is now starting to ‘green up' because it says that it supports changes in the renewable energy target should not be left without comment. We still have contradictions on the record. Less than one month ago Senator Joyce, the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate, had this to say: My predisposition is to vote against the RET. Let us not forget that only last week the opposition voted against the most significant measure to bring about reductions in greenhouse gases-it voted against the CPRS in the Senate. The test of the coalition's position on Australia's action against climate change will not just be to support the government's renewable energy legislation in this House and in the Senate; it is going to be to support the CPRS, to develop a policy position and to put forward specific amendments, have discussion with the government and support these important measures. This is about taking strong action on climate change. That is what this government is doing. It is about bringing about reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, about playing a part in the international negotiations, about playing a constructive role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change and about supporting investment in the renewable energy sector. All of that is what this government is doing and it is time that those opposite took responsibility to support those measures comprehensively. NA",50

63,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to media reports that the Henry tax review intends to recommend an increase in fuel excise of at least 10c per litre. Will the Prime Minister rule out any increase in fuel excise?,51
64,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I say that there are two constant thematics to the opposition's contribution to Australian public policy. One is fear and the second is smear, and beyond that they have nothing to contribute to the deliberations of the parliament. The honourable gentleman asked me about tax reform and the future of it, and I will come back to his question in a moment. I just draw his attention to what the then shadow Treasurer had to say about opposition tax policy-this is dated 7 April 2008, almost back in the Palaeolithic period. Dinosaurs have a particular attraction to that period and we have seen a few dinosaurs out on climate change recently.  of order in relation to relevance.

66,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The then shadow Treasurer, now the Leader of the Opposition, said in April last year: I have asked distinguished economist Henry Ergas to conduct an examination of the many taxes in Australia at various levels … I presume that might have incorporated various fuel taxes as well. Who would know? … and to report to the Opposition on options for reforming the tax system. Then he went on to say: In undertaking this study, Professor Ergas will consult widely, and host a Conference to advance our understanding of the strengths, weaknesses and opportunities for reform of the tax system. I don't see any particular exceptions from that Ergas review, other than this: it has simply disappeared without trace. Can I say to those opposite that, if they riously engage in the business of tax reform, it is a bit like your engagement on climate change reform and it is a bit like your engagement on industrial relations reform. Put your policies on the table. We do not happen to see that, whether it comes to fiscal strategy or whether it comes to productivity reform. These matters, in terms of the totality of the tax system, will be considered by Henry. Mr Truss- Mr SPEAKER ",51

69,Ms PARKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the importance of renewable energy in meeting the challenge of climate change?,52
70,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Fremantle for her question. Can I say to the House that, if we are serious about tackling the challenge of climate change, we have to move on multiple fronts. We have to move on the proper price of carbon-hence the government's proposed legislation on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, which those opposite chose to vote against last week. We as a government have also put forward a renewable energy target which will be a quadrupling of the number of gigawatt hours generated in this country through renewable energy sources by 2020. We are also moving, as the Minister for Resources and Energy indicated before, on the question of carbon capture and storage. It is not just the global institute which we have constructed-the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute, which was launched conse- jointly with a number of leaders from around the world in L'Aquila at the G8 Plus summit only last month. It is our domestic initiatives as well in terms of our proposed investment at scale in large-scale carbon capture and storage. Fourthly, we are moving also on energy efficiency-hence the government's agreement with the state and territory governments on a new national energy efficiency strategy. As part of our economic stimulus strategy we are rolling out some $4 billion worth of investment in energy efficiency measures in people's homes. As the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts just indicated before, we are also embarking upon a new set of measures to make it more possible for people to install solar panels on the roof. All these measures are necessary in our combined efforts on climate change. On the question of renewable energy, we are dealing with the particular challenge which has been delivered to us by the fact that so much has not happened on renewable energies in this country for so long. Those opposite finally got around to setting a so called mandatory renewable energy target of five per cent back in 2001. They then got together a report-led by, I think, then Senator Tambling, from memory-and decided in 2003, in the formal conclusions of that government-chaired report, that this was simply inadequate, that it was not going to give sufficient support to the renewable energy sector and it needed to be increased. The Tambling report, a bit like the Ergas review, fell off the edge of the table-gone, disappeared. It has gone into Davy Jones's locker. Then we come to the eve of the last election, and those opposite say, ‘Finally, it's time to do a little bit about renewable energy-we'll have a 15 per cent target.' Of course, we have seen from them no concrete policy since. But what has happened in the real economy since then?",52
71,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What do you mean? How can you say something like that?,53
72,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We particularly enjoy the interventions of the member for Flinders. As we know, he comes from a political party which constantly champions the cause of climate change. He has risen as a real leader amidst their ranks; hence the decisive policy they took on carbon pollution reduction last week and hence the decisive actions on boosting the renewable energy target when they had the opportunity to do so in government. In fact, his voice has counted for nothing. Let us look at what companies had to say during the period when those opposite were in office. Look at what Roaring 40s had to say, for example, when they announced in 2006 that they were stopping work at Heemskirk in Tasmania and Waterloo in South Australia because of poor government support and a failure to increase the MRET. In May 2007, they said: Without an increase in the initial [renewable energy] target level, electricity retailers are reluctant to commit to long-term REC deals which are crucial in financing renewable energy targets. Further substantial investment in the renewable energy industry is unlikely without an increase in the target. That is the Roaring 40s company. From Pacific Hydro, in February 2007, there was a similar statement. Furthermore, the Vestas Nacelle company's operations in Tasmania were affected by the absence of sufficient support by the previous government for renewable energy. But this one really gets me: Global Renewables, an Australian company, announced in March 2007 a $5 billion deal to cut greenhouse pollution in the UK because they could not get support for their technology here in Australia. The quote from them at the time is along the lines of: In Australia there is no incentive to invest in our technology compared to cheaper options … which effectively allow polluting for free. We had to go to a jurisdiction that recognised our contribution to taking greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere. The member for Flinders protesteth too much. This is what these companies had to say not about what the previous government said but about what the previous government did or failed to do. That is the record and it is not just in terms of the individual stories of those individual companies; it is what the cumulative effect of that was, as the honourable member indicated in his answer before, of the overall decline in actual renewable energy generation during the period in which they were in office between 1997 and 2007. Hence the course of action we have before us now with the renewable energy target legislation which we have put forward.  der: understanding order 100(e) the Prime Minister cannot refer to legislation that is currently before the House. I would remind you that we are right in the middle of a debate about the renewable energy target legislation in the House of Representatives. He cannot refer to the actual legislation or the debate. I therefore ask you to bring him back to the question.  order: I thought the anticipation rule had been removed some time ago.",53
73,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One of the reasons that from time to time. I have invited the House to review question time is owing to the problem we have where there is a whole host of rules about questions and one rule about the answers. If there had been reference to the bate in the question, that would have been out of order. I have to adjudicate whether the response is relevant to the question, and the response is relevant to the question. But I invite those that are concerned and who have frowns on their brows to speak to the Procedure Committee.",54
74,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have referred in my answer so far to what did not happen in the last ade or so on renewable energy. That is why the government has introduced its renewable energy target legislation-because we need to make a difference for the economy, for jobs and for the environment. And that is what we are getting on with the business of doing. Modelling produced for the Department of Climate Change in 2009 shows that the implementation of the expanded RET, together with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, if taken together, would lead to around $19 billion in investment in the renewable energy sector in the decade to 2020. Further, a 2009 Climate Institute study refers to the creation of 26,000 new jobs, primarily in regional areas. That is why we are getting on with the business of making sure that the renewable energy sector in this country has a future. That is why we are getting on with the business of ensuring that consumers have access to this scheme in order to provide support for the further installation of solar panels on their roofs. That is why we are getting on with the business of providing appropriate adjustment for businesses on the way through. But it all would have been that much simpler had those opposite instead risen to the challenge of leadership and put through legislation designed to create a proper carbon price, on the one hand through support for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and, on the other, supporting this particular means by which we provide further encouragement for the renewable energy sector-solar, wind and geothermal as well de- as wave and tidal and other forms of renewable energy. That is the way for the future. Those opposite, in voting against the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, have made the business compliance task for the Australian economy much harder than it need otherwise have been. Nonetheless, we have articulated our approach to this and we look forward to receiving what those opposite decmay have to say by way of amendments. Why have we had to do this? We have had to do this because at the end of last week they voted down the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, and we need to provide certainty for the renewable energy business for a scheme which will begin in January next year. Secondly, we also need to guard against the possibility that those opposite will again vote against the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme come November, because, if we have seen this absolute explosion in party unity on the part of those opposite in their excitement to get behind the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme this time, what is going to happen next time given that they have no unity on this question at all? Thirdly, when it comes to the future of the renewable energy target regime, we need also to guard against the possibility that we are left in continued limbo into the future because of failed leadership on the part of those opposite. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: it is time to put the partisan divide behind us. We need the national interest to prevail on this question of the future of climate change. It is time for us to act in the national interest in this parliament on something as critical for the economy and for climate change as the legislation which is now before the House. As the Leader of the Opposition finds this amusing, he finds it a matter for smirking, he finds it a matter of great general comic performance, I appeal to those opposite: this is not a matter on which the Australian people are prepared to tolerate your continued internal divisions. The challenge for those opposite is not, as the Leader of the Opposition sought to do on the weekend, to proclaim victory for the defeat of the carbon pollution reduction scheme. That is not leadership; that is a substitute for leadership. Real leadership means looking beyond the horizon and doing something for the future of climate change, doing something real for the future of renewable energy, and actually showing leadership with your own ranks so you can bring a united position to this debate and the critical one which now lies ahead in November. Therein lies the future. I suggest that he opposite, the Leader of the Opposition, lies firmly anchored in the past.",54

85,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to recent comments by the Minister for Health and Ageing regarding tax increases to pay for the future of Australia's health system, when she said: … it is something that we have to include in the mature debate about how we fund health care. Given that the government is now running deficit budgets and is now borrowing record levels of money, Prime Minister, what taxes will need to be increased to pay for the minister's health plan?",55
86,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I sense a theme emerging on the part of those opposite. It has been prosecuted with subtlety, it has been prosecuted with finesse, it has been prosecuted with the back handle of an axe. I say to those opposite, when it comes to the future of tax reform: in response to the business community and the 2020 Summit last year, in response to the representations of the Business Council of Australia and many other peak industry groups, the government believes that the right thing to do is to have a root-and-branch review of the tax system. That is why we have commissioned the Secretary to the Treasury to do so. Furthermore, I say to the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Health Sydney: when it comes to the future of health and hospital reform-I assume he has read the report produced by Commissioner Bennett-one of the recommendations which was put forward by the commission relates to an increase in the Medicare levy. Therefore, I would say to those opposite, before they go into ‘ha-ha' mode-‘Here is a possible discussion about a further tax'-that the commission is quite upfront about the fact that there is one possible way of funding a future approach to the reform of dental care and their particular proposal for denticare. I say to those opposite, as they engage in a fear campaign on debt and deficit, a fear campaign on tax, a fear campaign on health and hospitals, a fear campaign on industrial relations, a fear campaign on climate change and a fear campaign on employment, that what the Australian public would like is a mature national discussion about the options which lie before us. Mr Hockey-Put it on the table!",55
87,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He interjects, ‘Put it on the table'-like the Ergas review, the one which was put out there in April 2008-but my attention has been drawn to a further proposal on tax reform, which was the subject of some discussion a year or two ago between the member for Higgins and the member for Wentworth. It is this thing here, called Taxation reform in Australia: some alternatives and indicative costings. But here is a really interesting interviewMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I asked the Prime Minister about his own health minister's statement and asked him to engage in a mature debate and put on the table those tax increases the Prime Minister wants.",56

89,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are talking about tax options for the country's future. Our approach is clear-cut. We have the Secretary to the Treasury working through these things. Those opposite said last year that the approach was clear-cut; it is just that it has appeared-that is, the Ergas review. Absent the Ergas review, we are left with the Turnbull proposals of 29 August 2005. In a great interview between Karl Stefanovic, of the Today program, and the then Treasurer about the status of this particular set of tax reforms as proposed by the member for Wentworth of order: because of your admonition last week that the opposition ask specific questions that do not invite debate, the shadow Treasurer has asked a very specific question about comments from the Minister for Health and Ageing about tax. If the Prime Minister does not wish to answer those specific questions, he should sit down. He is not being relevant to the question that was asked now.",56

91,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Sturt would be fully aware that questions containing health policy and possible taxation sources to fund future reform were canvassed earlier in my answer to the question. I say to the honourable member: Karl Stefanovic asked the then Treasurer about tax policy, and he said: Alright, Malcolm Turnbull came up with a tax plan as you know, as you are fully aware, what did you make of that plan? The Treasurer then said: Well, he didn't actually have a plan… Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: he is the Prime Minister of this country. His health minister has flagged new taxes. I asked the Prime Minister to be honest and real with the Australian people and come up with the alternative.",56

Then he went on to say: ‘I am sure if you didn't like one, there were another 279 that you could take a look at … The point is when you actually have a tax plan you do you actually have to come up with an alternative.' Well said, Member for Higgins. The member for Higgins also contributed to the debate today, I am advised, in relation to this matter, so there is no",57
94,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for North Sydney has a further point of order? Mr Hockey-Yes, Mr Speaker. The point of order is relevance.

96,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point of the reference to the member for Wentworth's then contribution to Australia's national debate on tax reform and the absent debate since he has become shadow Treasurer, as Ergas did its disappearing act, is that, if we are going to have a mature national conversation about tax reform, we are going to put our ideas out there in due season-that is why we have the Secretary to the Treasury at work-and I would assume that those opposite would do so as well. But, instead, what we had on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme last week was them standing up time and time again saying they could not support the legislation we put forward, because they had an alternative view. When asked what their alternative view was, they could not find one or agree on one. Frankly, the nation deserves better. NA",57

99,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Longman for his question. He knows, like everyone on this side of the House, that the government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will help create a low-pollution future for Australia. It is certainly the case that Australians want action on climate change. Yes, it is the case that action on climate change will mean that things will have to change. Treasury modelling released earlier this year, and available on the Department of Climate Change website, recognises that the price of pollution will add around 1.2 per cent to the consumer price index over two years. Of this, household food prices could contribute around 0.1 per cent. The government has always been very upfront about this. We have made it very clear, including in legislation that has gone through the House of Representatives, that we will provide lowand middle-income households with compensation. Reports in today's Australian suggesting that there is no compensation for households are wrong. Through a package of cash assistance, tax offsets and other measures the government will help these households maintain their standard of living while moving to a low-pollution future. Mr Tuckey interjecting",57
100,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I want to say, so at least one person up the back knows what this compensation is going to be made up of, that the government will increase pensions and other income support payments by 2.8 per cent over two years, including upfront indexation, to fully meet the expected overall increase in the cost of living flowing from the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. A single pensioner will receive compensation of up to $504 over two years. A pensioner couple combined will receive $760 over two years. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-Wow, that will go a long way!",58

Family tax benefits will be increased, generally by 2.8 per cent over two years, an increase of up to $175 a child on the maximum rate. The low-income tax offset will increase by $430 over two years. So, in specific terms, a single-income family, on average wages-around $60,000 a year-with two children under 12, will receive $861 over two years in extra assistance. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-Wow!",58
102,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is a lot of wowing going on from the member for Mackellar. You might wonder how much wowing went on in the Liberal Party party room when they came up with that report last week. If you have a look at the report they put out last week you will see that lowand middleincome households would be worse off because there would not be any compensation. Whether it is their policy or not of course we do not know,58
103,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Even they don't know!,58
104,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Thank you. They certainly don't know. But the report makes it clear in black and white-tell it to the wow factor over there-that household compensation would be removed. That is what is in there. Do we hear any wowing?,58
105,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjectingNo!,58
106,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Under the Liberals-if it is their policy, which of course we do not know-families under the report that was released last week would be hit with higher costs but with no compensation. So maybe that is where this story has come from. The Liberal Party policy is to deliver no compensation to lowand middle-income households; by contrast the government will make sure that they are protected. Emissions Trading Scheme",58
107,Mr HARTSUYKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to reports that the government's flawed emissions trading scheme will result in an increase of up to seven per cent in grocery prices. Does the government expect consumers to pay more, farmers to receive less, or Australian food to be substituted with imports? Which is it, Prime Minister?",58
108,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The honourable gentleman may be referring to a report in today's Australian, which I understand is in part-it may not be-derivative from an earlier submission from Woolworths, as I understand it, to the government's public inquiry on the future of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. I would also draw the House's attention to a statement which was put out by Woolworths this morning which says: Modelling undertaken last year on the previously proposed scheme did show that food, like all goods, would incur a slight price rise. This price impact would be higher if agriculture was included but agriculture is omitted under the current plan. Woolworths submitted this information to the government in 2008 in order to assist with the compensation planning for lower income households. Woolworths goes on to say: Woolworth believes that the CPRS is necessary to effectively address climate change. Woolworth has already invested millions of dollars in sustainability initiatives that will reduce our energy costs and mitigate the impact of any scheme. I would draw that statement to the honourable member's attention. I would also draw to his attention the fact that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme white paper was upfront about the projected impacts in terms of household costs. You cannot inject a new cost for carbon and pretend that it will not flow through to the general economy. It will. The key question is: how do you then compensate households in their dealing with that? That is why the government, through its regime, has proposed a way in which it compensates low-income earners, how it compensates middle-income earners and how it also assists motorists on the way through. That is a responsible course of action. A responsible course of action is also to clearly outline what your industry assistance packages are in terms of how you seek to transition businesses, particularly emissionsintensive trade-exposed sectors of the economy, the coal sector and other critical sectors of the economy, from a higher carbon environment to a lower carbon environment. That is a responsible, balanced systematic approach to how you bring about this sort of fundamental policy change. Can I suggest to the honourable member, as he represents the National Party, who are in fact the ultimate denizens of climate change denial in this place, together with certain well-known members of the Liberal Party who probably should be in the National Party when it comes to climate change, that what the nation requires of us is to put aside our partisan differences on this and begin to work together on climate change for the future, climate change on a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. I note for those opposite that, in the debate which unfolded last week, after they released the Frontier Economics report, which they then disowned, they did not advance a single amendment. I think the Leader of the Opposition asked last week, ‘Why is the government not negotiating with us on the CPRS?' I say to those opposite: how is it possible to negotiate if not a single amendment is advanced in the Senate? Not a single amendment. I could say to those opposite that the nation's interests, economic and environmental, require a different posture on the part of those opposite both for this the renewable energy target and for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, because business needs certainty and we need to do our bit to bring down greenhouse gas emissions for the future. Climate Change",58
109,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. Will the minister inform the House of the importance of taking responsible action to tackle dangerous climate change?",59
110,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Brisbane for his question, and I know that this is a serious issue for him and for his constituencies. The challenge of climate change is all about taking responsibilityabout taking responsibility for our contribution to global emissions, about taking responsibility for the impact that climate change will have on our environment for the future. That is exactly the approach that the Rudd government have taken as we rise to the challenge of climate change. This morning I spoke in Brisbane at the opening of the International Conference on Ecology and there the government released the report Australia's biodiversity and climate change: a strategic assessment of the vulnerability of Australia's biodiversity to climate change. This report confirms the climate change risks to our iconic natural areas like Kakadu and the Great Barrier Reef. The House may have seen recently a report commissioned by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation which showed that the likely costs to the Australian economy, if we have increasing climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef, is some $30 billion over the next century. The report released today also shows that Australia has an extremely high proportion of species, our unique biodiversity, that will be at risk from climate change impacts. The Rudd government understands these risks, and that is why we brought forward significant reform in the shape of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to begin the task of bringing down Australia's carbon pollution for the first time. That reform was blocked by the coalition. We brought forward reform with the largest energy efficiency rollout in Australia's history, the Energy Efmate ficient Homes package, helping Aussies reduce their energy bills at home for decades come. That reform was opposed in its entirety by the opposition. This is the same opposition that, as a coalition, had a last minute conversion to a cap-and-trade scheme before the recent election and then last week voted against the same cap-and-trade system in the Senate. So in some ways we can say that the song of the coalition remains the same, that not much has changed since the last election. In fact, we did hear from Senator Minchin earlier this year some of the lyrics of the song when he launched an extraordinary attack on the ABC",59

114,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are encouraging me, Mr Speaker. Don't worry; I haven't finished yet.",60
115,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will ignore the interjections.,60
116,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He launched an extraordinary attack on the ABC for referring to carbon pollution as pollution. He said: It is a nonsense to describe it as the pollutant. I mean, it is grossly misleading of the public to describe it as a pollutant. Then last week in the speeches in the Senate, there was Senator Minchin again, and he said: CO2 is not by any stretch of the imagination a pollutant. And he went on to say: … this whole extraordinary scheme … is based on the as yet unproven assertion that anthropogenic emissions of CO2 are the main driver of global warming. Tell that to the climate scientists who are working day and night to alert the world and policy makers to the likely impacts of clichange. Tell that to the research institutions that are producing the work day in and to day out to let us, as policy makers, know what the impacts of climate change are likely to be. Tell that to the US government, the Chinese government, the non-government organisations and the scientific communities-all those who recognise that dealing with this risk is one of the most important and urgent tasks we have. There was Senator Bushby, who said: I have no choice but to refuse to believe what I am told is truth and to declare when it comes to the issue of mankind's impact on the climate. Of course, it is not just in the Senate. It is also in the House of Representatives, where they are going backwards; they are not moving forward. I was so disappointed at the remarks of the member for North Sydney when he was speaking to Karl Stefanovic and said: ‘Look, climate change is real, Karl.' I think this was mentioned in the House the other day. ‘You know, whether it is made by human beings or not, that is open to dispute.' I thought to myself: ‘Who is responsible for these carbon dioxide emissions? Perhaps it is the dinosaurs or perhaps the member for North Sydney.' Then I realised it was. I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition held his You Tube policy announcement speech/reflections/views in a certain park and I thought to myself, on the theme of dinosaurs, ‘I know which park that is-Jurassic Park!' It is tempting to say that nothing has changed since the last election, but the ugly truth is that the coalition are going backwards on climate change. They are now positioning themselves to the right of the former Prime Minister, John Howard, on climate change. It is hard to believe, but the coalition are now trying to make the former Prime Minister, John Howard, look like Al Gore. The fact is there have been 12 years of climate change scepticism. Scepticism leads to denial. Denial leads to inaction. And inaction imposes costs on the Australian community and on the Australian environment. In this instance our country, a continent that is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, deserves much, much better. Economy",60
117,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his statement prior to the myself a ‘sceptic' last election: … working families have been under financial pressure, whether it's through mortgage interest rates going up, whether it's through the impact on rents, whether it's food and grocery prices, the cost of child care … As the Reserve Bank governor has indicated that mortgage rates are likely to rise by at least two per cent, house prices and rents are increasing, grocery prices may rise by as much as seven per cent and childcare costs will increase by up to $1,500 per child per year, I ask the Prime Minister: where are the fresh ideas the Prime Minister promised working families to keep the costs of living under control?",61
118,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and I would respond in the following terms: over the last period of the Howard government, the cost of living surged, growing by three per cent. The proposition being advanced is that there has been a relative increase relative to the period they were in government. Three per cent under the Howard government in its last year in contrast over the last year here, where inflation has eased with prices increasing by 1.5 per cent. Under this government, clothing and footwear inflation is down, transportation fuel prices are lower, recreation inflation is lower, financial insurance service prices are lower and there are a number of other categories where that applies. The premise upon which the honourable gentleman asked his question is not correct. The second point I would make goes back to this great question of interest rates. Do those opposite remember how many interest rate rises in a row there were under the previous government? There were 10-10 interest rate rises in a row. Those opposite, through the Leader of the Opposition, come here with the great airbrushing of that fact from their collective memory, as if it never happened. Extraordinary actions have been undertaken by the Reserve Bank to deal with the global economic crisis. These were the subject of extensive remarks by the Reserve Bank governor in his testimony before the House committee on Friday. The Reserve Bank governor's remarks reflect the extraordinary circumstances we, and the rest of the world, found ourselves in with the global financial crisis as it unfolded last year. There were unprecedented actions by central banks across the world to bring down interest rates, unprecedented actions by governments across the world-of the classical right, the centre and the left-to inject fiscal stimulus into their economies in order to bring the global economy and national economies and employment back from the brink. These are the courses of action of responsible governments around the world-responsible governments seeking to deal with the realities with which they are confronted rather than engaging in what I can only describe as a very cheap and inexpensive debate here in terms of real policy credibility, advanced by those opposite to suggest what the honourable member has just suggested in terms of prices. Can I suggest that he, instead, familiarise himself with the facts and base his next question on a set of factual propositions rather than the fancy in which he has just engaged. Economy",61
119,Mrs IRWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Will the minister update the House on recent positions that have been expressed about Australia's responsible borrowing practices?,62
120,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fowler for her question. As members would be aware, the global recession has knocked a giant hole in projected government revenues in the vicinity of $200 billion over a period of four years. As a result, the government has been obliged to undertake a period of borrowing in order to cover the ensuing deficits, because the alternative would be to crunch the economy into the ground, to devastate the Australian economy, to cause hundreds of thousands of people to lose their jobs and thousands of businesses to close. In the face of that unprecedented challenge, it is good to see that monetary policy and fiscal policy have been working in tandem to stimulate economic activity, to sustain jobs and to sustain business in the Australian economy in this time of extraordinary challenge. As part of that process, the government is engaging in a modest and responsible borrowing program. It is significant that tonight this has been confirmed by very important players in this process. I would like to quote first the statement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Stephens. In evidence to a parliamentary committee on Friday he stated: … 15 per cent of GDP is a low number by virtually any other standard. So I do not feel that that debt burden, if that is what happens, is going to seriously impair the country's economy. I would like to add to that statements made by the Secretary to the Treasury at a business function earlier today, where he stated: It does seem clear that the measures taken to date, both the monetary policy response and the fiscal policy response, have had quite an impact in supporting aggregate demand. In passing, I add the statement of Standard and Poor's when they were reconfirming Australia's AAA rating. They stated: … the deficits and associated borrowings do not alter the sound profile of the country's public finances. What you are seeing here is the government standing shoulder to shoulder with the Reserve Bank of Australia and with the Australian Treasury to fight the impact of the global recession and to sustain jobs and business activity under enormous pressure. There are other positions being adopted on the issue of debt and on the issue of the cits projected. Although the Reserve Bank's assessment of the likely impact of the debt on the Australian economy is not shared by the opposition in their rhetoric-and we have all heard the scare stories about debt, deficit and future generations-when it comes to their specific position on issues it is quite different story. When it comes to actually presenting any savings measures to ameliorate the impact of future deficits-when it comes to their own promises about what they might do in the future-then it is very different story. We note, for example, that the report that Frontier Economics produced with respect to climate change last week, which the opposition sort of endorsed and sort of did not, if it were applied, would lead to a very substantial blow-out in the budget deficit over time because of increased reliance on the purchase of international permits for carbon emissions in order to support the electricity industry-a very substantial blowout beyond $1 billion a year by 2020. I note also that they are still engaged in blocking important government savings measures, important budget initiatives such as reform of the private health insurance rebate and reform of government assistance to dental programs, in the Senate while at the same time proclaiming the great virtues of lower deficits and of lower debt. In addition to this I note that we now have some of the would be leadership contenders in the Liberal Party out there parading their virtues in public. Most significant is the member for Warringah, who put out a book last week, which I applaud-good on him.",62
121,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He joined the book club!,63
122,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He joined the book club. It is a bit belated, but I welcome him to the club! In that book he proposed a specific initiative. I could not find any savings initiadefitives. I could not find any tough, rigorous decisions that would help to get the budget back into surplus. But what he did propose was that the means test on family tax benefits should be abolished and that people who have children under five should get assistance from the government for that, irrespeca tive of their income. I am a bit conflicted on this proposition because I have a daughter who is three years old and I would be one of the people benefiting from the member for Warringah's proposal. Unfortunately, in my role as Minister for Finance and Deregulation I have a different position, which is that this would be a grotesque waste of taxpayers' money. Hardworking lowand middleincome earners paying the taxes for highincome earners like me to get a free kick is not my idea of good public policy. I am waiting for some more books from some of the other would be contenders on the Liberal Party benches. I am waiting for them, but they are not yet here. Maybe there will be one from the member for North Sydney, but he would probably struggle to get out of bed to write one; maybe from the member for Curtin, but she would have to find somebody else to do it for her; and possibly from the member for Goldstein, but he would struggle to find a publisher who thought his works were interesting. So I am not quite sure who is going to step up to the plate to assist the member for Warringah, but I do know one thing: there is a day of reckoning coming for the opposition, and the interesting thing is that it is a trap that they themselves set with things called the PreElection Economic and Fiscal Outlook and the Charter of Budget Honesty, which they implemented in government and which are still in place. What that means is that when we get to an election campaign they have to stand up and say just how they are going to produce a lower deficit and a lower debt and make lots of nice election promises at the same time. We will be watching with great interest as that day of reckoning emerges. You can bet your life the rhetoric will dissolve into the sands faster than you can say boo, because that is what it is: just pure rhetoric. Indigenous Housing",63
123,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. It is our information that the Queensland government still has not set up machinery for enabling First Australians to own their own land-private, deeded land tenure-a right enjoyed by every other Australian. The Queensland government has now promised this right for three, arguably eight, years. Given the 1966 referendum which gave constitutional powers over First Australians to the federal government, would the minister not agree that it is time now for the federal government to exercise its responsibility and undertake the issuance of such deeds, a function already accepted as federal government responsibility in the Northern Territory? Is the minister aware that throughout the latter 1980s 90 per cent of house-building labour in Queensland's First Australian communities was local and, very importantly, part CDEP? This, along with local concrete block factories, enabled seven houses to be built for every one that is now being built. Finally, occupancy rates in communities were last year averaging around 15 people per home. Could the minister, in line with stated Rudd government policy, implement such policies now? Otherwise, what is already an emergency will become the most serious of crises.",64
124,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I do know that it is very sincerely put. We have had a number of very good discussions on both of these issues. Could I go to both of them, particularly this issue about the importance of Aboriginal employment in the building of houses, which I know he understands. Like him, the federal government are determined to make sure that, with our historic level of commitment to remote Indigenous housing, we do get very real employment outcomes. So we are insisting on delivering employment as well as making sure that houses are built and refurbished. We are very happy to continue those discussions with the member for Kennedy about the construction that will be happening in the communities in his electorate. On the other issue of the need for secure tenure, the Australian government do agree with him that it is critical that we have secure tenure over the land on which we build. I understand the point of his question, that the Queensland government moved last year, or the year before I think it was, to 99-year leases to enable the building of housing on Aboriginal land. They, like this government, understand how critical it is that we have secure tenure, that we are in fact able to build houses on land where we have security of tenure. Just like we do in any other part of Australia, when we are building public housing normally we require freehold. In the case of Aboriginal land, we are prepared to go to a lease arrangement but we are going to acquire the security of tenure so that we have the capacity to make sure that the standard of housing into the future is high. I will of course follow up the points that the member for Kennedy has raised and will continue to discuss these issues with him, particularly in relation to his constituency. Nation Building and Jobs Plan",64
125,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Human Services and Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law. Will the minister outline to the House the evidence on the success of the government's stimulus package? How important is it that the government maintains a consistent approach to economic decision making?",64
126,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For the last year, the Rudd government have been focused on cushioning the blow of the global recession on Australia and of course will continue to do so. We are now starting to get a better picture of how Australia is performing in the midst of the global recession. The Rudd government's policy response has recently been applauded by the IMF in their assessment of the Australian economy. In fact, the IMF commended the Australian government on what they called its: … timely policy response, which has effectively cushioned the impact of the on the Australian economy. The IMF also stated that they: … welcomed the targeted temporary fiscal stimulus which is expected to support domestic demand in 2009 and 2010. Last Friday, the Governor of the Reserve Bank took a similar approach. Of the fiscal stimulus by the government, he said: I think any objective observer would say that the size and speed of that response has been one of the important factors supporting private demand over the past nine months. It is clear that a combination of government and private sector activity has meant that Australia has withstood this crisis with some of the lowest unemployment, highest growth and lowest debt levels in the developed world. I am asked about the importance of consistency in economic decision making as we deal with the fallout from the global economic recession. When it comes to consistency, there are some important lessons to learn. For example, on April Fool's Day, the member for Wentworth and the member for North Sydney held a doorstop. The Leader of the Opposition cast judgment on the government's stimulus package and he declared it not to have worked. He said: No jobs created, no enduring economic activity promoted or inspired by it. That was the current Leader of the Opposition. That was their strategy: to cast out and say it has not worked. But then, of course, they had a problem on 3 June, when the Leader of the Opposition received some bad news. The news was that, despite the attempts to undermine the fiscal stimulus packages of the government, the ABS announced that Australia was one of only two OECD nations to grow in the March quarter. Then the Leader of the Opposition changed his tune when it came to opportunism. He global financial crisis conceded: Well … every dollar a government spends within Australia has some impact on economic activity. That was version 2 of the Leader of the Opposition's narrative. Now, as late as last Friday, we have version 3 from the opposition: the stimulation is working too well and overheating the Australian economy and should be withdrawn and that it is putting upward pressure on interest rates. They have gone from arguing that the stimulus package had no impact to arguing that maybe it had some impact to arguing that it is having too much impact. The Leader of the Opposition really should not be so hard on the government's stimulus package. They actually have a lot in common. The package is targeted and temporary, and so is the Leader of the Opposition. This morning, the opportunism of the opposition has had further light cast on it. This morning we had a new low when it comes to the members opposite. Today, we heard from one of the shadow leaders of the opposition-in fact, the preferred leader of the opposition. Today, we heard from Banquo's ghost: our old friend, the member for Higgins. He spoke to the ABC and he spoke of opportunity. He did not speak about Australia being a land of opportunity. He did not talk about the opportunities for Australia as one of the countries that has withstood the global recession better than any other. He did not talk about opportunities for young Australians. He spoke about political opportunity. The member for Higgins has recently been begged by many members opposite to return to the leadership. This is what the member for Higgins said this morning: Actually, the political times probably suit position because since the election more Australians have lost their jobs. Australians have watched their superannuation go backwards. The value of your average Australian asset-that is, their shares and their houses-has gone down, and it is undeniably the case that since 2007, on average, every Australian has gone backwards, which I would have thought is very fertile ground for an opposition. Indeed, it gets worse. He went on to say: So I say there is an opportunity there and the question is to realise it. Have you ever seen more crass political opportunism from a member of this House than from the alternative leader of the opposition, the member for Higgins? The Australian people are looking for more from a political party than opportunism. They are looking for more than an opposition that say, ‘The times will suit us.' They are looking for a political party that provides leadership to get through a crisis and provides decisive action, not political opportunism, which the member for Wentworth and the member for Higgins have made an art form of.",65
127,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education. I refer the minister to the thousands of Australian students currently undertaking a gap year in a bid to achieve the independent rate of youth allowance, some of whom have come to the parliament today from their homes in rural and regional New South Wales and Victoria and have met with each of us and explained the real problems they are facing as a result of the government's changes. Given these students have made their study and life choices based on the advice of career advisers at their school and Centrelink staff and other government information, does the minister believe it is fair to change the rules on them halfway through their gap year?",66
128,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the an opOpposition for his question. At Senator Fielding's invitation, I did meet earlier today with a number of young people who came to parliament from Shepparton and Warrnambool, in particular. They were actually sitting at the front of the gallery just over there until an earlier point in question time. I did have a good discussion with them about student financing and about aspirations for young people to go to university and we talked through some of their concerns. The Leader of the Opposition, having had a comparable discussion with them, would be aware of some of their concerns about the student financing package. What we talked through in the meeting I had with them was that current student financing arrangements are flawed, and there was a general consensus about that. They, like me, were concerned by the evidence that there are higher income Australians with students living at home who have qualified for the full rate of student allowance, and the findings of the Bradley review are very, very clear on this. That is a concern, and they shared that concern. I think they shared that Budget concern because, like me and the government, they want to see dollars spent on student financing going to make the best possible difference. Our student financing package has been drawn up with those principles in mind. We believe that money should go to lowand middle-income families. The current means test is too low. It means that many lowerand middle-income families miss out. The received message has therefore been that the only way you can get student allowance is to defer for a year and to seek to qualify as independent. The great vice of that, of course, is that many people who do defer for a year actually do not ever come back into education. And we discussed that at our meeting today. We also discussed at our meeting the new scholarship arrangements, with gaps on scholarships under the current systemMs Marino- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. The gap year students want to know how they will be affected by this and what the government will do for them.",66
129,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister is responding to the question.,67
130,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am talking precisely to that question and the features of the new arrangement. We talked about how the features of the new arrangement include all students who qualify for youth allowance getting access to a start-up scholarship and a relocation scholarship, where those things are capped now and there are students who miss out. And we talked about the ability under the new arrangements for students to earn more through part-time work when they are at university before student financing gets withdrawn. We had a comprehensive discussion. I was pleased to have it. I will certainly be meeting with other young people to discuss these issues. I maintain my view that there is much misinformation and misrepresentation about the package. We want to keep talking it through with people. I was very pleased to meet with the young people today. It was in fact a great discussion. I conclude by suggesting that, in the course of the discussion today, I met a young woman who in her future I suspect may well be the next Laurie Oakes. She was very good at the questions. Education",67
131,Mr ZAPPIA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on new research and approaches to quality teaching?",67
132,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Makin for his question. As a South Australian, I thank him for his interest in the fact that a fellow South Australian, namely my father, celebrated his 80th birthday on Saturday. Happy birthday, Dad. But I have actually been asked about performance pay and better quality in teaching. On the weekend, as well as celebrating my father's birthday, I did release a report, commissioned by the former government, called Rewarding quality teaching. Like all things associated with education and the Liberal Party, this is testament once again to a track record of failure. As a result of the question from the Leader of the Opposition, we have just had the opportunity to talk about their failure in student financing and their inability to get dollars to students who needed it the mosta situation which, of course, led to rural and regional participation rates at university declining under a government that included the National Party. This report is another testament to the failure of the Liberal Party on education. Commissioned by the previous government, the report about performance pay for teachers found no support amongst stakeholders for the previous Liberal government's suggestion that teacher pay and student scores should be put together-one of the dumbest ideas ever floated in Australian politics, which would have been a recipe from the Liberal Party to make sure that every teacher in the most well-to-do schools in this country got a pay rise while every teacher in the most disadvantaged schools in this country got a pay cut. When it comes to talking about education, what we know about the Liberal Party is that in government they used to talk and do nothing; in opposition, they do not bother to talk about education and they do not do anything. In government, they used to float ideas and not follow through; in opposition, they do not even bother floating ideas. We know that a former minister for education, David Kemp, said in 1996: The Federal Government will this month begin a national review of the university education of teachers … It will recommend new national standards and guidelines for pre-service teacher degrees by April, 1997. You guessed it, Mr SPEAKER - nothing happened. The last minister for education under the Liberal government, the current Deputy Leader of the Opposition, said in February 2007: We need a teacher training and registration process that is nationally consistent, not only for the benefit of the current teaching workforce, but also to make it easier for potential teachers to enter profession … You guessed it-nothing happened. They were all talk in government and no action, with nothing that made a real difference to the circumstances of Australian children. That stands in stark contrast to the actions of the Rudd government to improve teacher quality. We have entered a $550 million national partnership to do just that. It is already bringing changes to our education system. In New South Wales the funding is being used to create a new category of highly accomplished teachers who will earn around $100,000 a year if they go and teach in the most disadvantaged schools in New South Wales. This is a reform long dreamed of being delivered by the Rudd Labor government. Having pressed this reform through our national partnership and seeing it being delivered in New South Wales, we will be pressing this reform around the nation, because great teachers deserve better pay and kids that need the most benefit from education deserve to have great teachers. We are also funding the Teach for Australia project-an initiative that will bring highperforming graduates into the most disadvantaged schools. Once again, this is a longdreamed-of and long-talked-about initiative that would bring highly capable young people into disadvantaged schools to share their passion for teaching and their passion for change to see disadvantaged students succeed. This is an initiative on which we have taken action, and it will deliver. In government, we are delivering an education revolution. We are doing it because we need to overcome the track record of neglect of the Liberal government. We are doing it because we want every Australian child to get a great, quality education. What do we see from the Liberal Party? Absolutely nothing. The shadow minister has published one speech on his website this year. That is it. He the has nothing more to say about education-no ideas, no debate and no consideration about the nation's future. Child Care",67
133,Mrs MIRABELLA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth. I refer the minister to her remarks in the press that families will have to share in the burden of increased costs for child care due to the government's reforms. Minister, where will Australian families find the extra money to pay for increased childcare costs in a climate of job uncertainty and rising interest rates?",68
134,Ms KATE ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the shadow minister for her question. I say to her, and indeed the entire House, that this government is absolutely unapologetic about being committed to accessible, affordable and quality early childhood education and child care. We have shown that in action time and time again. We showed that when we committed over $16 billion for the next four years to this area, which I might add is over $1 billion more than those opposite managed to do when they were in government. We also showed it when we increased the Child Care Rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, providing a much needed added assistance to thousands of Australian families. And we are showing it because we are dedicated to pursuing a quality reform agenda. We know that it is really important to Australian parents that they are assured of the standard of care that their children are getting when they drop them off. We also know, from the recent Child care choices report, which the shadow minister has referred to numerous times, that most parents using child care said that one of their top priorities was quality reform, particularly staff-to-child ratios. When we are pursuing quality reform, that is about looking at staff-to-child is also about looking at the qualifications of staff members and aiding parents with a quality rating system so that they can make the right decisions for their own families. We have been absolutely upfront about the fact that there are cost implications in these decisions. In fact, we have been so upfront about this that we engaged in a public consultation process where we put out four different costed options so that the community, parents and stakeholders in the childcare community could come and talk to us. In what is a little bit embarrassing for the shadow minister, when we first came out and did this, her criticism was that we were overconsulting and that we should not get out there and talk to parents. Yet it is interesting to note that when she was asked on the doors this morning, ‘What is your alternative? What would the opposition be doing?' her response was, ‘We would go out and consult. We would go out and talk to parents about what it is they want.' We have spoken to almost 2,000 people around the country as part of our public consultation. We have had over 800 people undertake online surveys about the proposed changes. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on the relevance rule. I refer you to page 553 of the Practice, which says that there is a basic requirement that the answer must maintain a link to the substance of the question, which this answer does not. I ask you to rule the minister out of order or to come back to the question.",69
135,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister is responding to the question.,69
136,Ms KATE ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is important to consider that any cost implications would be offset by the government's 50 per cent Child Care Rebate, which means that the government would effectively foot the bill for half ratios. It of any increases. I think it is also important to clarify here that reports in the media today, which include a cost of $125 per child, are an inaccurate reflection of the consultation costs which the government has put out. It is also important to say that no final decisions have been made on this, because we have committed to making these decisions in partnership with the Australian community, which is what we continue to do. While those opposite can flip-flop about whether they want to consult or whether they do not want to consult, on this side of the House we are committed to getting on with the job of supplying quality, affordable, accessible child care to the some 800,000 Australian families who use it.",69
137,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Will the minister please update the House on implementation of the government's GP superclinics program?,70
138,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I know that you will have a particular interest in the answer to this question, the government having announced an extra three superclinics to be added to the program-one in your electorate and one in the member for Wannon's electorate. I did think for a moment that, when the member for Indi was coming to the dispatch box to ask her question, it was perhaps about the superclinic that is to be in her electorate, announced by the Prime Minister and I on Friday, but unfortunately not. It falls to the member for Page, who I know has been taking a close interest in the rollout of her superclinic in Grafton. It was a very heavily attended consultation process. Last month the government announced that a successful bid had been selected and a contract signed. An integrated multidisciplinary model of care will be delivered, tailored to the needs of the local community. We are very proud that, of the 31 superclinics announced at the election, 24 contracts have been signed, construction at eight sites is underway and nearly 7,000 in the member for Solomon's seat have used services since December last year when the after hours interim services were started. I know the member for Ballarat is pleased that the superclinic at Ballan is due to be opened this month and the first patients will be able to use the facility in September. Interim services have also commenced in the Blue Mountains where, I know the member for Macquarie will be pleased to hear, an additional GP has been employed. In Devonport, the member for Braddon will be pleased to hear that there has been a commencement of Health asthma and diabetes clinics to be linked to the services. I understand as well that in southern Lake Macquarie the physiotherapy and rehabilitation centre, including a hydrotherapy pool, has already commenced services and is due to be officially opened shortly. Of course, the report of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission made it very clear that this strategy is taking the right direction for reform. In fact, the commission takes this even further and suggests that we should invest more in primary healthcare centres across the country, making use of multidisciplinary care-the sort of arrangement that the government flagged at the election and is now delivering. The commission identified that a strong primary healthcare sector is an important way of keeping people in the community healthy and out of hospital. In the Prime Minister's and my travels, talking at hospitals around the country, consulting on the report of the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission, we were recently in Adelaide. On the same visit we signed three funding agreements for three GP superclinics in Adelaide: one at Noarlunga in Kingston, one at Modbury in Makin and one at Playford North in Wakefield. This means that South Australia will have an investment of $57.5 million in primary health care, delivering better services to South Australians. Interestingly, a fact that I think captured the imagination of all of those who were at this announcement was a report from the South Australian Minister for Health, Mr John Hill, who indicated that when a similar service had opened in Aldinga, in the seat of the member for Kingston, presentations at the Noarlunga Hospital emergency department were reduced from those surrounding suburbs by around 16 per cent. So those opposite can continue to be dismissive of these investments, but in fact these investments are aimed at delivering better services to the community and at the same time diverting unnecessary presentations from our emergency departments. The MP in this House who has taken the least interest in a superclinic being built in his electorate is the member for Dickson, who did not turn up to the start of construction the Strathpine superclinic last month, and I am sorry to say that this has been pretty typiauthorities cal of his performance to date. It may be that he already knew that he was going to cut and run from his seat at that time and did not think he would bother to stand up for delivering health services to his electorate. Not only does he not seem to want the $2.5 million investment in his electorate but there 90 construction jobs in Dickson that do not seem to rate as important to the member for Dickson. So I would urge others in this House to take the approach of others opposite, perhaps the member for Cowan, who like the Liberal Minister for Health in Western Australia has welcomed this investment, or perhaps the approach of the member for Wannon, who lobbied for the investment that is now being made in his electorate, or perhaps even the member for Parkes, who is still pushing for his. We know that that request is there. These members understand that these investments provide not only jobs today but long-term health services for the future that take sure off our hospitals. And the member for Dickson should get on board. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",70
139,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,AIRLINES PNG," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I would like to update the House on events related to the air crash in Papua New Guinea. Yesterday, Sunday, 16 August, the last of the remains and personal effects were transported from the site of the crash to Port Moresby. What will now occur will be the painstaking and meticulous and complex task of victim identification. The focus will now shift to Port Moresby, where that will occur. This will be a very difficult time for the families, as we cannot put a of timetable on that process, which requires coordination between Papua New Guinea and Australian and Japanese officials as well. In the meantime, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continue to be in constant contact with the families, speaking to them about identification and repatriation matters. Our hearts go out to them as they go through this very difare ficult time, as they want their loved ones returned to them as quickly as possible. We will continue to be in contact with them obviously. Finally, for the information of members, the Papua New Guinean Civil Aviation Authority has now commenced its investigation into the crash. This will be conducted by the PNG Civil Aviation Authority. With the agreement of the Papua New Guinean authorities, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the ATSB, will assist and liaise in that investigation. Three officers from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau are at the site and one is in Port Moresby, and that deployment will continue. There continues to be pres- very good cooperation between Australian and Papua New Guinean officials, and we are very grateful for that. I again commend the good work done by our high commissioner in Papua New Guinea and his officials and officials in Canberra in the consular division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. This will continue to be a very difficult time for the families and our hearts go out to them as they go through this agonising period and wait for their loved ones to be returned to them. NA",71

144,Mr HOCKEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Today in question time the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, who again has walked out of the chamber, misreported what I said on the Today show on 12 August 2009 at 7.50 am. I said: Look, climate change is real, Karl. You know, whether it's made by human beings or not, that's open to dispute, but you've got to give the planet the benefit of the doubt. Therefore, the world needs to do things. We went to the last election promising an emissions trading scheme. And we've sided with the Government on targets.

For the benefit of members, the consequence of this motion being carried will be that we will be able to have the debate on the renewable energy target legislation in the parliament this evening. We are deferring, effectively, the private members' business that was scheduled for tonight until 12 o'clock tomorrow so that we are not detracting from any preparations which I am sure have been made for that debate. We will then go on to government business tomorrow with the education legislation debate prior to question time. That will ensure also that there are no votes held in the House prior to question time tomorrow. This has been done in consultation and in full cooperation with the opposition, and I thank them for that. For the benefit of members and also staff of the parliament, we would hope that we will be able to complete the sittings this evening at a time which is as close to the normal finishing time as possible.

147,Mr KATTER,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"Kennedy) (3.57 pm)When I was speaking in this debate previously I pointed out that food prices will rise. Of course they will. I do not know whether people here are aware but we produce about seven per cent of Australia's fruit and vegetables, a market which is dwindling, of course-we are a net importer of fruit and vegetables now. Those fruit and vegetables go mostly from the Atherton Tableland and the area north of Tully all the way down to Sydney and Melbourne. You can manage the amount of carbon that is produced in carrying the product that far. So I do not doubt for a moment that the figures for the increase in food prices-that seven per cent figure or the four per cent figure, whichever one you choose-that came out in the Australian today are accurate. Whilst I find confusing the figures that are being put out on the increase in electricity charges, it would appear from the figures that I have seen that the increase in electricity charges will be up around 15 to 20 per cent. So is the government going to continue on with a proposal that will put electricity charges to the consumers up by 15 to 20 per cent, food prices up by four to seven per cent and will cost around 100,000 jobs? It will cost around 100,000 jobs in the mining industries of Australia, directly and indirectly. That figure sounds exaggerated but almost all of the mines operating in north-eastern Australia are operating at a loss. The price for metals such as zinc has dropped to one quarter of what it was two years ago. Mr Acting Speaker, do they think these mines are going to run indefinitely at a loss? If they are running at a loss and you take five per cent off their gross, then that makes their net position infinitely worse. So, Mr Acting Speaker, I find it difficult to",73
148,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RENEWABLE ENERGY,Order! I remind the honourable member for Kennedy that I am not the ‘Acting Speaker'.,73
149,Mr KATTER,RENEWABLE ENERGY,You are the Deputy Speaker?,73
150,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RENEWABLE ENERGY,The way to refer to me is ‘ Mr Deputy Speaker'.,73
151,Mr KATTER,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for providing me with that very vital information. I find it very difficult to believe that the government are seriously pursuing this path. They really have not been around politics very long if they think that there are no political implications, no downside, to a program that is going to increase electricity charges by between 15 and 20 per cent, increase food charges by between four and seven per cent and wipe out 100,000 jobs in Australia at a time of dire financial crisis. It is extraordinary to me that they intend to proceed down this pathway. I hope what is happening here is that there is a lot of noise from the government and then a lot of postponement, exemptions and exceptions. At the end of the day, I would hope that we are not going to see any reality come forward. As I have said on many occasions here, I am not a global warming person. I am on the anti side of the argument, but I do believe that any responsible government throughout the world should take a bit of a look at the situation and address it. We are in the very happy position in North Queensland of being able to provide renewable energy for the rest of Australia. I represent more than half of Australia's water run-off, for example. A little tiny one per cent of that could go a long way to providing the sorts of CO2 benefits that we are talking about in this place. There is the North Australia clean energy corridor, as it has become known to everybody. If the projects of the various proponents along this line are carried through to completion, there will be 850 megawatts of renewable energy. To put that in perspective, if my memory serves me correctly I think there are 40,000 megawatts of electricity generated in Australia, so one-fortieth of Australia's electricity needs would be met. We already produce around 300 to 400 megawatts of electricity in North Queensland now. We have extensive hydroelectricity and in each of the sugar mills we have bagasse being burnt to produce electricity. It is important for me to tell the House about sugar cane so that members understand. Sugar cane is a grass. By far and away the biggest agricultural man-created crop in Queensland is lawn. When people say ‘runoff', run-off is mainly coming from your lawns, not from any agriculture. Agriculture is dwindling, diminishing and vanishing. But sugar cane is in fact a grass-it is one of the grass family. It is unlike a grain, which you have to plant every year. With grain, you have to put the steel through the ground four or five times-in cultivation, in planting, in ploughing under and in proper husbandry and management. With sugar cane, of course, you cannot do that. We only replant once every six years, so the steel goes through the ground only once every six years. The sugar cane is covered by a carbon ‘trash blanket', as it is called, which is about eight inches thick. After we finish harvesting it is left on the ground, which means we do not need to cultivate out any weeds or use weedicides or any of those things, because the only plant powerful enough to force its way up through the six to eight inches of- (Time expired)",73
152,Ms RISHWORTH,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I am very pleased to rise to speak in favour of the bills before us today, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the related bill. As a member from South Australia. I am very pleased that these bills will have an enormous impact on the growing South Australian renewable energy industry. South Australia is home to 56 per cent of the nation's wind power, 30 per cent of its grid connected domestic solar systems and 90 per cent of geothermal investment. With South Australia home to 7.4 per cent of population, it is clear that South Australia is punching above its weight when it comes to contributing to renewable energy in Australia. The legislation before us today provides further encouragement for companies to invest in renewable energy. I know that many people in my electorate of Kingston want to see an increase in renewable energy and I know that they will be very pleased to see the Rudd government delivering on its key election promise to increase the renewable energy target to 20 per cent across the nation by 2020. This is in sharp contrast to the opposition, which continues to be hopelessly divided and act irresponsibly when it comes to the challenge of climate change. This legislation represents one part of the government's comprehensive plan to tackle climate change. We have a proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme that creates a pathway to a low-emission future, and this legislation provides a real and effective renewable energy target, showing just how serious this side of the House is about renewable energy here in Australia. The renewable energy target legislation is widely supported by industry. The Clean Energy Council of Australia has welcomed these bills, indicating they would unleash $28 billon of new investment and create over 28,000 jobs. These sentiments were echoed by Andrew Dickson, business manager for Wind Prospect, a wind energy company based at Christies Beach in my electorate. He said that as a result of this legislation Australia would see a huge surge in renewable energy investment, and he indicated that their company will definitely expand and this would result in more jobs. In 2010 our annual gigawatt hours target will be 12,500, which is a substantial increase from the previous target of 9,500. And, of course, this target will increase through the decade to the year 2020, resulting in 45,000 gigawatt hours from renewable energy. In my home of South Australia the state government has already introduced a renewable energy target scheme. The bill before us has been designed in cooperation with the states and territories through the Council of Australian Governments and it brings the MRET and existing and proposed state schemes into one national scheme. The introduction of the national scheme signals this government's commitment to creating and supporting innovation in the renewable energy sector. The renewable energy target comes in addition to measures that we have already introduced and which complement this target. As part of the 200910 budget, the government committed to $15 billion in climate change related initiatives, including the $4.5 billion Clean Energy Initiative, which includes a $1.5 billion Solar Flagships program. This program will aim to generate 1,000 megawatts of solar energy capacity and will be by far the biggest solar generation project in history. This development will also be supported by $100 million for the Australian Solar Institute, which will continue its groundbreaking research into solar energy technology. In addition, there is try. the $465 million Renewables Australia fund that will support cutting-edge technology research and provide for this technology to make it to market. This has been something that people within my electorate have been very keen for. They do not want to see technology go offshore and be developed offshore. They want the technology that they come up with to be developed here in Australia. The combination of such policies and the renewable energy target means that renewable technology development in this country will drastically increase. The bill also provides for a review of the operation of the renewable energy target scheme to be undertaken in 2014. This will coincide with the strategic review of the proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme-that is, of course, if the coalition can get its act together and support such a scheme. This government has made creating jobs its core business. The increase in the renewable energy target represents the Rudd government taking strong action on climate change, and it will stimulate investment in the industries for our future. I commend the target and the bill to the House.",74
153,Mr OAKESHOTT,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I rise to support this Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the related bill. I am fascinated by the continuation of the political debate that has been going on around this suite of legislation and the positioning of who is and who is not politically serious. This is without doubt-and I would hope there is broad agreement-the natural resource management question of our time, and when you drill down into the detail with regard to various positions there is not a lot of difference. I would hope that legislation such as this can move through this chamber quickly so that we can get certainty in the marketplace for the renewable energy indusI know there has been debate going on about the coupling and decoupling of various pieces of legislation, and we are seeing a decoupling before us today. I would like to think the real test will be a recoupling with regard to the private member's bill that I have put forward and which is currently before this House. It is called the Renewable Energy Amendment (Feed-in-Tariff for Electricity) Bill 2009 and it is about trying to get a national feed-in tariff system up and running within Australia. If we are having honesty tests about who is serious and who is not serious with regard to genuinely engaging people in a renewable energy future, I think the fact that the feed-in tariffs and the concept of a national feed-in tariff system are being overlooked at this point is certainly a great shame with regard to setting up a policy framework for the future. Most of the states have now introduced their own variations of feed-in tariff schemes. The ACT probably has the most progressive, with a gross scheme, New South Wales has a net scheme and most states have now responded with their own state based variation of that theme with different pricing attached. If we think about the real point of forming a Commonwealth to get around absurdities like not being able to catch the one train around Australia because of variations in rail gauge, this is a modern equivalent happening on this government's watch. We have feed-in tariff systems being established with variations amongst all the various states and territories. So a retailer, for example, offering the same product to a household is going to have different billing systems in place if they offer it in Tuggeranong versus whether they offer it in Queanbeyan. Surely this is an opportunity for national leadership. Surely this is an opportunity, if we are being serious about renewable energies and the renewable industry, to engage people in this process and to establish a national feed-in tariff system so that we can build a future that is as green as possible in the development of a new economy. So I will watch very closely with regard to my own coupling. Whilst both sides will, I imagine, support this legislation going through as far as setting some broad targets, I think the proof will be in the pudding in the next couple of days when we see where people sit on a private member's bill looking at a national feed-in tariff system. With regard to the particulars of this legislation, it is a bit of a no-brainer to be supporting this. I think it is certainly long overdue. It is not owned by one side of this debate or the other. I know that there is positioning going on, from the speeches that I have heard so far and from public comments that I have heard so far. The genesis of this does go back to the previous government, with the mandatory renewable energy targets, so I hope I am right to assume that both sides are generally holding hands on the concept of renewable energy targets. We can debate the concept of the size of the target20 per cent by 2020-and we can debate the demands of the various renewable energy trade-exposed industries and the various vested interests getting their claws into the public policy process. We can debate the rights and wrongs of that and whether this legislation, like others in this suite of CPRS legislation, has been browned down. But, in the end, I think this is as good as we are going to get through the public policy debate and through these two houses. Hopefully we can see this in the marketplace as quickly as possible so that we can start to see some certainty in the many renewable industries that are wanting to do business within Australia. On that point, I continue to want to break the conflict that seems to be raised in this chamber about the choice of either a clean future or an economy and jobs. I think that is wrong in the framing of this debate. There are many, many jobs attached to the green economies of the future, and we are starting to see some of those in the marketplace already. This is very much a jobs, jobs, jobs piece of legislation that we have before us, even if it is a renewable energy piece of legislation. If the CSIRO are to be believed-they are talking about a couple of million jobs within the renewable industries in the next 15 to 20 years-we need to be serious in the development of public policy and not afraid to engage in the development of a new economy as we try to establish a market based response to the natural resource management question of our time. It is probably on that point that I raise some continuing concerns about vested interests in the public policy process and what I am seeing as a reinterpretation of the welfare-capitalist state called Australia. When we formed the Commonwealth the concept was supposed to be a safety net that was developed to assist those within the community who are in genuine need-individuals in the community who we as Australians did not want to leave behind. In this debate and in these times, it seems that this is being reinterpreted. When it comes to the natural resources questions in this suite of legislation on natural resource management and climate change, welfare seems to be distributed quite generously to business and it is capitalism for the rest. It seems to be that the safety net is now for the polluters-not for the poor, not for those who are in genuine need in our community. This debate, the policy framing and the discussions that dominate this place and the other place seem to be shaped predominantly around the interests of not an unimportant group within Australia but not the only group within Australia. I do want to start to prick the conscience of a few within the executive to really start to think about who is driving this debate at the moment and who should be leading into the future. It is something of a myth that we are an energy superpower. It is a term that was used by the previous Prime Minister and it is a term that seems to have been welcomed and adopted by the current regime. We are all in politics, and we love talking it up, but on such an important policy issue we need to be realistic. The industries that are looking for the majority of the subsidies and that are ting the blockers on most of this legislation are, in reality, about eight per cent of our national GDP. They employ about 1.3 per cent of our market. They are majority foreign owned. Look at some of the major mining companies within Australia. BHP Billiton is no longer the big Australian; it is overseasowned. Rio Tinto, Xstrata, Anglo Coal, even Cement Australia are not Australian owned. My understanding is that Cement Australia is owned by the British, the Swiss and the Mexicans. Queensland Gas and Queensland Alumina are British owned or Russian owned. Japan Australia LNG is a Japanese company. These are players who seem to be capturing the majority of the debate before us today and dominating the thinking of those within the executive who are trying to push through this legislation. I would ask that the other contributors to national productivity be given a look-in, and they are the people of Australia. They are people like those in the services industry, which is about 75 per cent of GDP. For example, more people work in restaurants and cafes in Australia than do in the entire mining industry. That might surprise some people when they think about what they have heard in this debate over the last couple of months. Where are the subsidies for the cafe worker, the restaurant worker and the restaurant owner as we move forward in this difficult debate before us? I raise these points again and I repeat: these are not unimportant industries that I am talking about but they are not the only industries and they are not the only voices in this debate. The companies that seem to be dominating this debate at present have already been pinged once. There was a very good article in the Australian Financial Review that raised some comparisons between the lobbying messages on some of these issues that the companies are putting up with putregard to impacts on their companies versus the messages they are putting to shareholders and their current state in the marketplacetwo very distinct messages. I raise the same point, or a similar point, in regard to messages from some of these companies within Australia versus some of their activities offshore, and they are two very distinct messages that we are seeing from the very same companies. They are saying the economic sky is going to fall in within Australia if some of these changes happen, when they are intimately and very successfully involved overseas in developing their businesses-in areas such as aluminium, which was raised by one of the previous speakers-with the use of renewable technology. One of the key aspects of smelting aluminium is the use of a good, reliable water source. That is, in essence, a renewable energy answer. Companies in Australia that at times are complaining about some of these renewable energy targets and the move to a new economy are exactly the same companies who overseas in various locations are very successfully and very proactively developing the delivery of exactly the same smelting using hydro power and various renewable solutions. I hope that government is aware of this and that it is calling some of these companies on some of these issues. And I hope that Australia does not miss the boat. The future economy in regard to energy will be intimately involved in the use of renewable energy. We need to capture it. We need to, where possible, lead on it. We have some great potential in this country. Whether it be the sun, whether it be water, whether it be wind, whether it be geothermal-you name it-we have an abundance of renewable energy opportunities and potential. The only issue that seems to be holding us up is the public policy debate, which is being dragged into the political mosh pit by the vested interests who are trying to protect their various interests in an economy past. I would hope, as we move forward and as we try and get some consensus in this chamber and in the other on not only this renewable energy legislation but the suite of legislation, that we all recognise that in the end we are custodians of building the economy of the future. Yes, there are some voices-which are not unimportant and which need to be listened to-saying that, where possible, transitional support needs to be provided. But they are not the only voices in this debate. Over the last couple of weeks in particular we have heard some of those voices dominate and some of those voices significantly influence the positions of various members of parliament and political parties as they take a position generally on climate change and in particular on pieces of legislation as they go through this chamber. It is a no-brainer that I hope this legislation has the support of this place. I hope it gets the support of the other place. I hope that in the future as a group of MPs we can look at increasing targets, lessening subsidies and pushing for greater involvement in a renewable energy industry Australia, because I think it is in our broad economic interests that we do so. It is in the interests of future job opportunities to do so. It is part of our international obligation as good citizens to do so as well. So I certainly support this legislation.  too rise in support of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the related bill before the House. These bills action another weapon in our fight against climate change-to ensure that 20 per cent of Australia's electricity is supplied from renewable energy sources by 2020. I want to take you back a few years before 2020, to the year 1993. Cast your mind back to the must-see movie of the year. In January 1994 at the Oscars it won three Academy Awards. This movie beat ET as the most financially successful film ever when it was released. As I said, it was the must-see of the time. There are so many scenes from that movie that have become common culture, that have become part of the cultural consciousness almost. That first encounter with a brachiosaurus has been voted the 28th most magical moment in cinema history by Empire magazine. The scene where the two raptors are in the kitchen pursuing some of the characters has been ranked the 95th scariest scene of all time, according to Bravo magazine. It is certainly a very, very popular movie and a quite significant movie. Obviously I am talking about a movie about dinosaurs called Jurassic Park. It is a watershed movie for a lot of filmmakers-a lot of famous filmmakersbecause they saw that the use of computer generated imagery would allow them to bring a vision to the screen that previously, before computers were so advanced, was unfeasible or superexpensive. After Jurassic Park came out, George Lucas was able to revisit Star Wars and make his prequels, because he knew that the technology, the computer graphics, was such that he could bring his vision to the screen. The New Zealand director Peter Jackson, with his love of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, now had the technology to bring his vision to the screen. Jurassic Park was a significant film for lots of reasons. Why did it work as a movie? Obviously it had a great starting point: the novel by Michael Crichton. But the movie worked because the great director Steven Spielberg was able to get the dinosaurs to go where he wanted them to go. He was able to move the dinosaurs around. If he needed a triceratops to enter stage right and walk across the screen, he was able to get it that. If he needed a brontosaurus to rear up through the trees and greet Sam Neill up in the treetops, he was able to get the brontosaurus to go exactly where he wanted. If he needed a Tyrannosaurus rex to eat somebody movie who was cowering in a loo, he spoke, the people under him listened and the dinosaur went where it was told. Obviously the world has changed a bit since the release of Jurassic Park back in 1993. The world has changed since that movie about dinosaurs came out. Unfortunately, when I look across the chamber now, all I see is Jurassic Park. But, unfortunately, the director's chair is empty-swinging in the breeze-at the moment. There is nobody sitting in the director's chair. There is no Steven Spielberg on the opposite side to tell the dinosaurs where to go-to try and marshal the dinosaurs, to say: ‘We need to have a certain vision. We need to go in a certain direction.' Unfortunately, those opposite are a little bit like one of those other movies that also had a great text, a popular novel, as its basis, and I am talking about Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities. But if you look at that great work of art, Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities, and the movie by Brian De Palma, you can understand how there can be a great gap between the idea and the actualisation, between the vision and the reality. In fact, Brian De Palma's The Bonfire of the Vanities is universally known as one of the great dud movies. It barely made any money, had poor direction and was nominated for five Golden Raspberry awards-which, I think, might be a bit of a record-for worse picture, worse director, worse actress, worse supporting actress and worse screenplay. So I call on those opposite to find someone who can sit in that director's chair, marshal the dinosaurs and get them to go in the direction that is necessary. The vision for to do 2020 is to make sure that we have 20 per cent of our electricity coming from renewable energy. Now let us look across the room at those opposite and see how their policy development has taken place since election night. I will give the current person sitting in the director's chair his due and take it from election night. After nearly 20 months in opposition and two failed leaders, the coalition still do not have a realistic policy on climate change. The dinosaurs are still wandering aimlessly, not heading in any particular direction. In fairness to the Leader of the Opposition, I acknowledge that last week they did release a report. Unfortunately, tion policy; it did not get up in the party room. But it is the reason, apparently, that they voted against the CPRS legislation on Thursday. What a sad day that was for the people of Australia. What a sad day it was for people like my four-year-old son, who does love dinosaurs-he is fascinated by dinosaurs. But I wonder, when he has a son and when he has grandchildren, what they will think of the current people who make up the Jurassic Park opposite. What will they say about that decision? On that point, I note that I became a great-uncle today when my niece had a son, Leonard Hastings Kallquist, and I say hello to him, a new arrival in the world. I call on those opposite to find someone who will sit in the director's chair, give some clear directions and make sure that Jurassic Park's days are numbered.",75
154,Mrs MOYLAN,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I am very pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate regarding the role of renewable energy in Australia's environmental future. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009, together with the related bill, is the next step for Australia as we strive to find the solution to long-term environmental sustainability. The reality of our society is that we have become highly dependent on energy. Traditionally we have met our energy needs by using non-renewable forms of energy that not only have contributed to the global greenhouse gas problem but leave us vulnerably dependent upon the world's contracting resources. Common sense dictates that as Australia and the world have ever-growing appetites for energy we should look to use and promote energy sources that have minimal impact on the environment, both in how they are generated and in the by-products of their use. Australia is indeed blessed with a plethora of renewable energy options that it is not coalimeet these criteria. The journey of mandatory renewable energy targets internationally started right here, back in 2000. Australia was the first country in the world to introduce a national target and to create a framework, which is still in use today. The fundamental progress being made by the legislation currently before us is that this renewable energy target is being increased so that, by 2020, 20 per cent of Australia's energy will come from renewable sources. In real terms this will progressively increase the uptake of renewable energy from 9,500 gigawatt hours annually in 2010 to 45,000 gigawatt hours by 2020. And this has been demonstrated in other parts of the world to be achievable. The operation of this scheme is based on the requirement that wholesale purchasers of electricity meet a share of the renewable energy target in proportion to their share of national wholesale electricity markets. Liable parties can purchase renewable energy certificates from households and businesses that install solar hot-water heaters, small rooftop solar PVs or small wind turbines and surrender them to demonstrate compliance with this requirement. While this is an extremely positive step forward, it is still far from perfect. One of my key concerns is that this scheme has the propensity to massively favour currently viable technology. Whilst it is vital that we have a scheme that can kick into action as quickly as possible, we must not allow short sightedness to eclipse future opportunities. In particular, there has been a lot of focus on wind power, which has huge potential to supply our energy needs but is only a small part of the diverse range of technologies that must be supported. In Western Australia we do have tidal power, and I know we also have people working on geothermal. A target of 8,875 gigawatt hours, or 25 per cent of the additional target, should be set for emerging renewable technologies, to give full encouragement to upcoming innovation. The diversity of renewable energy poses significant potential for Australia. Not only is it a key for a reduction in future reliance on traditional sources of energy but it is also a huge growth opportunity for Australian industry, both at home and abroad. With adequate government support, we are well placed to capitalise on a global hunger for renewable energy technology. Unfortunately, in recent months many in the renewable energy sector have not had the stability they need to get on and grow their enterprises. The solar industry, much of which is small business specialising in household installation, has been particularly hard hit by illthought-out government policies. What would it take to dismantle the solar industry in our sun-drenched country? It turns out that all it takes is some bad decision making and the prioritising of politics over good policy by the government. Last year the solar panel rebate scheme became means tested, then it was scrapped altogether and then the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program was axed. The Clean Energy Council's Matthew Warren has said: Hardly a solar panel has been sold since the bate] scheme was wound up. We need clarity and certaintyBut it is precisely certainty and clarity that to date has been denied by this government. Time and time again when I am out in the electorate, people tell me that they do not want to see the environment turned into a political game, but unfortunately this legislation has come to epitomise the political games of the government. At the eleventh hour there was a triumph of common sense, and the government finally bowed to universal pressure to decouple this bill from the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. As I heard the Leader of the Opposition say, this is a victory for common sense. There was simply never any other reason but political stuntsmanship to tie these bills. The Australian summed up the sentiment of Australia in describing this as a ‘ridiculous tactic' that made ‘the government look cynical'. When so much has already been done by this government to create an atmosphere of uncertainty, one would think that they would have done everything possible to ensure the smooth passage of legislation that has bipartisan support. All sides of politics would like to see this legislation pass through the parliament, to have the new targets up and running and give some stability to a sector which has been rattled by recent government actions. I urge the government to do all that they can to support the potential that the renewable energy sector offers. The opposition is supportive of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill. I have heard the shadow minister for the environment, the Hon. Greg Hunt, say on many occasions that Australia can become a solar nation and, as I mentioned, there are other renewable sources of energy that Australia is very rich in. This is important legislation. Probably rarely have we debated such important legis[relation in this House. I certainly support the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the related bill.",80
155,Ms LIVERMORE,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"In rising to speak on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the related bill, I note that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Thomson, have been a true champion of renewable energy in this House for many, many years, so it is very fitting that you should be in the chair for at least part of the debate. These bills are an expansion of the existing Renewable Energy Target scheme, but to say that it is an expansion does not really capture the scale of the shift that it represents in terms of the investment in and uptake of energy from renewable resources. Yes, it essentially builds on the scheme introduced by the previous government, but no-one should be fooled by the opportunistic and very recent embrace of renewable energy by the opposition. Opposition speakers are trying to create the impression that these bills are merely an incremental change that their scheme was working its way towards. In fact, this legislation is a very significant new signal to business and the community that we are serious about unlocking the huge potential for renewable energy in this country after years of tokenism by the coalition, years in which the proportion of energy generated from renewable sources fell. The changes in these bills will increase the existing mandatory renewable energy target by more than four times to 45,000 gigawatt hours in 2020 and contribute to meeting Australia's targets for the reduction of greenhouse emissions. The bills will provide a market incentive to accelerate take-up of Australia's abundant renewable energy resources, such as sunlight, wind energy and many others, including, in my own electorate, biomass. The changes in the bills will also reduce red tape by bringing state based targets into a single national scheme. Other speakers in the debate have talked about the benefits of increasing our reliance on renewable sources of energy, the jobs that will be created and the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions that will be achieved. They have also outlined the unprecedented levels of support from this government for research into renewable energy and its commercialisation and deployment. In the time that I have I will confine my remarks in support of the bills to two points relevant to my electorate in Central Queensland. The first one relates to an exciting initiative being undertaken by Mackay Sugar Ltd, a sugar-milling company in my electorate that has gotten out ahead of the game and is ready to generate green electricity using the gas which is a waste product from the sugar-milling process. There are roughly 950 cane farmers in the Mackay region, and I am sure most of them would be quick to point out the massive energy potential of the crops in their paddocks. That is how the farmers of the future are starting to think of themselves, as producers of energy, and Mackay Sugar is certainly thinking of the industry in that regard as well. Mackay Sugar is well advanced with its plans to build a major cogeneration plant at the Racecourse sugar mill. The 36megawatt cogeneration project will export 28 megawatts into the grid year-round, supplying 30 per cent of Mackay's electricity needs. We are talking about a $100 million investment that will abate about 340,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases per year. The passage of this legislation is critical for the Mackay Sugar project, and such a project is a win for the company, a win for cane farmers and a win for the Australian community. It will help establish for Mackay Sugar and growers a steady, domestically sourced income stream that is not subject to the turmoil and ups and downs familiar in the world sugar market. It is the kind of diversification that will keep these sugar producers in the game. This project and so many other, similar projects across the country is what the mandatory renewable energy target and these bills increasing that target are all about. They will create jobs, drive investment and reduce greenhouse gas pollution. It is also important to note that it is an investment in renewables and the future of the sugar industry in the Mackay region that was not possible under the previous government, the same people who come in here today to lecture us about renewable energy. Here is a snapshot of what the previous government did to investment in renewable energy. It comes in this quote from the Chairman of Mackay Sugar, Mr Eddie Westcott: Significant investment has been made in this project since the introduction of the 2% MRET in 2001 but unfortunately the project was shelved in scheme. 2006 when the renewable market collapsed due to surplus capacityin other words, failure to support the industry through a high enough MRET. In contrast, Eddie Westcott concludes his letter by saying that if the legislation is passed Mackay Sugar's project will go to tender next week. I will leave that for the coalition members, awaiting the support of their Senate colleagues, to ponder as the legislation goes into the Senate tomorrow. Eddie Westcott has been the champion of this project, and I appreciate the time he has taken to keep my ministerial colleagues, the Deputy Speaker and me informed of its potential and its progress at every stage. I know he would have liked the legislation to pass before this time. He has been incredibly patient. All of us on this side of the House are with Eddie in hoping that we are just days away from it becoming a reality. The other point I wish to raise relates to the treatment of waste coalmine gas under this renewable energy target legislation. Members would be aware of the extensive coal mining operations in my electorate and, indeed, throughout Central Queensland. In recent years, a complementary industry has developed using the waste coalmine methane gas to generate electricity. Two companies, Energy Developments Limited and Envirogen, established plants in my electorate and have been able to take advantage of the GGAS incentives of the New South Wales government to underpin the viability of the projects. For many months I have been talking to representatives from both EDL and Envirogen about the threat posed to their waste coalmine methane generation activities due to the CPRS closing down the New South Wales GGAS. Both companies currently earn a large proportion of their revenue from generating and selling abatement certificates under the New South Wales I want to see a way found to overcome the problem presented by the phasing out of GGAS. The companies operating in my electorate have put forward some proposals to amend this legislation in a way that will allow them to receive renewable energy certificates for energy generated from waste coalmine methane, thus replacing the revenue lost from the phase-out of GGAS. I have had extensive discussions with the Minister for Climate Change and Water, asking her to consider those proposals to include waste coalmine methane in the renewable energy target. We need to ensure that these companies can continue to generate low-emission electricity and provide employment in my electorate. Just as it was on the CPRS, the minister's door has always been open on this issue and she has been willing to listen to my arguments on behalf of Envirogen and EDL. These bills can unlock the enormous potential for renewable energy in Australia, which means jobs in new industries, significant numbers of which will be in regional and rural areas like Central Queensland. I look forward to their quick passage through the Senate so that industry has the certainty it needs to take the renewables sector forward to what is undoubtedly a bright future. It is an industry that will play a big role in the future of our country.",82
156,Mr LINDSAY,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I note we have a number of young people in the gallery this afternoon. What we are discussing here in the parliament this afternoon affects your future as it affects all of Australia. This particular issue is highly significant. That is why there has to be very significant debate and very significant agreement on both sides of the parliament about what we as a parliament might do about clean energy. There has been a very significant amount of discussion about the Senate refusing to pass the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation last week, but I remind those in the gallery that all of the non-government senators, from the far left to the far right, would not support the government's legislation. That must say something. It must say to you and to the people of Australia that perhaps things are not right. It was fine for the member for Moreton to talk earlier about dinosaurs on this side of the House. Some, like Professor Bob Carter, who looks at the earth in terms of millions of years, including when the dinosaurs roamed the place, say that what is happening now may have been happening then. I do not subscribe to that view. I do believe that we are seeing global warming. I do believe that humankind is suffering from carbon pollution and that we must do something about it, but what we do has to be very carefully thought through, and that is why the Senate would not accept the government's position and would not accept the coupling together of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009, which we are talking about in the parliament this afternoon, with the CPRS legislation. The CPRS legislation effectively has the support of all of the parliament and we want to see that passed. I will say more about that in a minute. But it is very important that we carefully move forward and get it right for Australia and also in relation to what other countries are going to do. We will not know that until we see what is happening in the United States, China, India and Copenhagen at the end of the year. We do not need to rush. We need to have a view and we need to be ready, but we do not need to ram something through the parliament right now if it might damage Australia. Of course, one of the sorts of things that might happen under the government's current proposal is 80,000 jobs being lost, a lot of those in regional Australia. If you have a job, how would you like your job to be lost because the parliament rammed something through without proper thought? We will also see very significant cost rises across the economy. For example, food prices, transport prices, fuel prices and electricity prices will all go up. We will see trade-exposed industries lose their capacity to compete and we will see carbon exported offshore to another country. Some of you will have been to the major emitters. Two weeks ago, I was in Beijing. When we were landing in Beijing, it was not until we were 1,500 feet above the runway that I could actually see the ground because the pollution was so bad. Many kids in Beijing have never seen a blue sky. We have to address that. That occurs across Asia. It occurs across Europe. It occurs in the United States. Look at what it is like in Washington. The world truly as one has to move forward and address the issues of carbon pollution, renewable energy and clean energy. I get a bit tired of the government giving the coalition a flogging and saying that we are all dinosaurs and we do not believe in this. Perhaps they ought to sit down with us, talk to us and hear our views, and take up our good ideas. The people of Australia know that one side of the parliament does not have all the good ideas and the other side all the bad ideas. They know that each of us can contribute, and that contribution should be allowed to happen. We should be able to negotiate with the government. We should be able to speak to the government and say: ‘Here's a good idea from our side. How about you adopt that and we'll adopt your good idea?' That is the way the parliament works best. That is why the shadow minister, the member for Flinders, will be moving 16 amendments to this particular bill. All of these amendments are sensible and are well argued in the shadow minister's response to the second reading speech on this bill. I urge the government to consider these 16 amendments. I urge the government to adopt all of these sensible matters that have been put forward. I urge the media to recognise that the coalition does have a view and it is prepared to contribute, and it is prepared to ten to the government. In return, it expects the government to listen to the coalition. The amendments will seek, for example, the full decoupling of the RET from the flawed ETS. They will see the inclusion of renewable gas or waste coalmine gases as a recognised zero emission source of energy, as it is in the US and Germany. They seek coverage of the aluminium sector for both its existing MRET and its expanded RET liabilities to the 90 per cent already offered by the government for the latter. They will ensure that food processAny ing is categorised for assistance under the renewable energy target. The primary bill that we are discussing this afternoon sets in place a renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020. The majority of the parliament supports this and certainly the coalition support it, and strongly support it. We want to see this happen. We want to see this pass through the parliament, and hopefully it will be through the House of Representatives by the end of this evening. But there has been a lot of hypocrisy on these sorts of issues. We saw that when the government came to power. After a lot rhetoric at the last election, it immediately means-tested the former government's $8,000 solar rebate. That was a broken promise from budget night 2008. Then we saw that solar rebate completely abolished without notice on 9 June this year. The former government introduced the Remote Renewable Power Generation Program, which the current government abolished without notice on 22 June at 8.30 am. Not a very good record for the current government in relation to renewable energy, and it is renewable energy that we are talking about. The other thing that would underline a poor record is that the government has been talking about what we are discussing this afternoon since 2007. This legislation could have been in the parliament and passed 12 lismonths ago. It could have been, but there has been inordinate delay and then there was its coupling with the CPRS bill. It left all of us shaking our heads and saying: ‘Why is this happening? Is this a political device? Is this a way of trying to wedge the coalition?' It was, and that is unfortunate for such a great debate in our country. It is unfortunate that we have kept the renewables sector waiting for such a long time. On 16 June this year, the head of the Clean Energy Council picked up on this and said: political tricky manoeuvre to hold the legislation up now will simply end up being a remarkable own goal. That is what has happened. I think the media are now making that observation, that the government has been forced into a backdown. I do not enjoy seeing the government backing down. I would rather get the bill through parliament in a timely fashion. I would rather get on with looking after our environment and setting these clean energy targets. The Whip has asked us to limit our remarks. I will do that. I will close with a summary which simply says that I am strongly supportive of the 20 per cent target by 2020, and I do hope that the government will see fit to support the coalition's ments.",84
157,Mr NEUMANN,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I rise to speak in support of the two pieces of lation before the House, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009, which are important pieces of legislation and are integral to our election commitments. It is quite sad that we are having to debate this legislation today and that it is having to be decoupled from the CPRS, because that was a strong election commitment and a mandate given to us by the Australian public in November 2007. We made a commitment and when we on this side of the House make commitments we believe they are serious, that they are matters of trust with the Australian public, and our intention is be stubborn in carrying out our commitments to the Australian public. It is important that this legislation be passed today. It is important that there be certainty for business-for those in the solar sector, those in the mining sector and those involved in electricity generation across the country. So I am pleased that the coalition want to be part of the game. All last week we saw them take off their jerseys and step off the field. They did not want to play football with us. They did not want to talk to us. They wanted to look at a study when it came to the CPRS. They could not devise a policy. At least today we are having some discussions with them about the renewable energy targets and the modifications and changes that could get this legislation through the House and into the Senate. This is important legislation. It is important because it underpins a transformation of our economy to a low-pollution economy. It is important because of what it says to the Australian public and what it says to Australian business and Australian industry. The amend- expanded scheme will deliver upon our commitment that the equivalent of at least 20 per cent of Australia's electricity will come legisfrom renewable sources by 2020. The bills before this House clarify the objects of the RET scheme. They increase targets, they implement a solar credits mechanism based on a renewable energy certificate multiplier, they mandate a review of operation of legislation and regulations underpinning the RET scheme in 2014, and there are other transitional changes as well which came about through the COAG process. It is important that we look at the previous government's long record of idleness and ignorance on this topic. There was much rhetoric that we heard from the member for Herbert-who I often take notice of when he talks on defence issues. On this particular issue, though, the coalition certainly has form or a lack of practice in the area of CPRS and the RET. The truth is that the coalition has been quite ignorant of climate change issues. We have a division opposite, which creates frustration for those of us on this side of the House who want to get on with giving certainty to business and making sure that we transition our economy to a lowcarbon economy. The Rudd government is doing much in the area of providing assistance to transition our society and our economy. As part of our budget, we committed $15 billion in climate change related initiatives-$4.5 billion for the Clean Energy Initiative; $1.5 billion for the Solar Flagships program, which is aimed at creating an additional 1,000 megawatts of solar generation capacity; $100 million for the Australian Solar Institute, which supports research into solar-thermal and other technologies; and $465 million to establish Renewables Australia to support technology research and to bring it to market. The legislation before the House is very important. The renewable energy target is important for those companies in Queensland and New South Wales that are involved with waste coalmine gas. Good companies like Envirogen Pty Ltd and Energy Developments Limited have invested millions of dollars and have been advocating for a long time that we have a look at an expanded renewable energy target to ensure that their operations continue to prosper and so they can make an unparalleled contribution to fugitive emissions abatement of waste coalmine methane in Australia. There are hundreds of jobs at stake. There is also much to be gained in ensuring that we adopt similar schemes, similar projects and similar attitudes to other countries that have similar economies to ours-namely, those competitors in the OECD, like Germany and the United States, who also take into consideration the treatment of coalmine methane in relation to RET and other forms of emission abatement. So I would like to see the government have a look at that particular aspect. There are many jobs in New South Wales and Queensland to be gained and there is much to be expanded in terms of construction and development. Queensland and New South Wales are leading players when it comes to these areas. I am pleased that the government is talking to the industries accordingly. I upon the government to have a really close look at this aspect because this is important for the states of New South Wales and Queensland. This legislation is innovative, creative and 21st century. It will go a long way to making sure that our economy and our society look to the future, not to the past, when it comes to renewable energy. The targets in this legislation are terrific in terms of saying where we want to go as a country. This legislation is educative and international, and I ask that the coalition support the bills before the House.",86
158,Mr BALDWIN,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I rise today to speak on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009. I am a representative of a region, the Hunter region, that not only generates the bulk of New South Wales electricity but also, through industries such as the aluminium industry, consumes a large part of that electrical generation. Given that, you will understand that I, as a part of the coalition, believe in the importance of a clean energy economy for Australia. As such, it is with some reservation that I support aspects of this legislation in its current form, which admirably sets out to achieve a renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2010. The coalition has a proud history of putting in place measures which ensure the preservation of our environment in a manner that does not burden the back pockets of Australian industry or the public. Former Prime Minister John Howard, along with the coalition, was by and large a strong advocate of putting in place measures which would protect Australia's environmental future. In the speech entitled ‘Safeguarding the future: Australia's response to climate change', the former Prime Minister spoke of targets that would be set for the inclusion of renewable call energy in electricity generation by the year 2010. The mandatory renewable energy target, MRET, scheme was subsequently implemented through the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 and the associated Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Act 2000. As such, the implementation of this bill, with the support of the coalition, reaffirms our strong commitment to a 20 per cent of renewable energy target. We accordingly offer provisional support for the legislation before the House today, subject only to key amendments which we will move in the Senate. Let it be known that we, the coalition, believe in the potential of wind energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, wave energy, tidal energy and algal energy to contribute to our clean energy future. Clean energy is, with green carbon, one of the two most fundamental steps to dramatically reducing Australia's net emissions. It is also about broadening the base of energy security. Clean energy is about creating jobs in rural Australia. In fact, the coalition so committed to this concept that in the leadup to the 2007 election we guaranteed 100 jobs would be created with the development of a $360 million solar power plant on the doorstep of the Paterson electorate if the coamine lition were voted back into government. It was with great pride and passion for the environment and creating Australian jobs that the coalition made this pledge and set aside $20 million in funding for the CBD Energy solar project to manufacture solar power systems for both export and local use. Had the Rudd government supported this project, it would have been fantastic news for the future of renewable technology development and our region in the Hunter. Had the Rudd government supported this project, it would have seen around $400 million per year in exported solar panels that would have helped reduce the global emissions footprint. All we see is rhetoric and spin and little or no action. The coalition has always been committed to putting into place schemes which will ensure a more sustainable and greener future for Australia. That is why whilst in government the coalition introduced the $8,000 solar rebate, which was widely applauded and utilised by the Australian public. We were as determined then as we are now to come up with clean energy economies. Unlike the present Labor government, we the coalition are determined to be a part of the solution and not the problem. We listen to what the Australian public have to say and we do not disadvantage them, empty their back pockets or put the environment on the backburner. We are proactive, and we want to get it right the first time by conducting the necessary investigations and providing reports which remain open and transparent at all times. In direct contrast to our well-received initiative of introducing solar rebates, this Rudd Labor government disappointingly broke a were major election promise and introduced means-testing for the rebate on budget night 2008. This cut out mums and dads on $50,000 each. It took solar panels beyond the reach of ordinary families in electorates like of Paterson. To add insult to injury, the Rudd Labor government put the Australian public offside and disadvantaged tens of thousands when on 9 June 2009 they scrapped the rebate altogether without any prior notice. The Rudd Labor government have to decide: either they are in or they are out when it comes to supporting renewable energy and reducing emissions. This was an absolute sham, and the Rudd Labor government should be ashamed of their disgraceful actions. By ending the rebate prematurely, they left hundreds of people in the lurch and they all but crashed an emerging industry. They replaced the coalition's plan with a scheme which will result in most families who invest in a common onekilowatt system receiving about half of what they would have gotten under a coalition rebate. For a Prime Minister who continually sees the need to ask himself the question, the question the Prime Minister should now be asking himself is: where are the incentives? Continuing in what is quickly becoming an infamous Rudd Labor government tradition, on 22 June 2009 at 8.30 am, without any notice to the opposition, they abolished the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program. This was a program which helped families, businesses and not-for-profit organisations connect to the power grid or install solar or wind units. With no warning or compensation granted, the axing of this program again sent thousands of Australian families and solar companies into chaos. For a government that claim to represent the hard working Australian, how can they justify sending an entire industry and its workers into disarray? Solar companies have said that the Rudd Labor government's decision will cost them an enormous amount of money and that they will consequently have to lay off staff. This is the disgraceful Rudd Labor government, who on the one hand plunge Australia into record levels of debt and on the other hand squash the solar industry and consequently send thousands of jobs flying. My constituents demand to know how Labor expects to get back into budget surplus whilst at the same time implementing policies that will ensure a greener future for tralia. My belief is that this juggling act not be possible under the reckless Labor government and that it will take a coalition government to be re-elected to ensure a clean energy economy for Australia's future. On the topic of the renewable energy target, I would like to know why the government has delayed its introduction by over one year. As I mentioned before, the coalition openly endorses the setting of a renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020. It would also enable the government to introduce a new solar rebate scheme based on renewable energy certificates that come with small energy units such as solar PV systems. This legislation progressively increases 9,500-gigawatt-hour annual mandatory renewable energy targets to 45,000 gigawatt hours by 2020, which I support. The legislation also replaces the coalition's solar rebate of $8,000 with a solar credits scheme which issues renewable energy credits to installers of solar photovoltaic systems of 1.5 kilowatts or less. These credits can be traded on the market for a return of between $4,000 and $4,500 for a common one-kilowatt solar panel system. Under the act, wholesale purchasers of electricity-that is, liable parties-are required to meet a share of the renewable energy target in proportion to their share of the national wholesale electricity market. Those who do not meet the target will face a financial cost. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009 sets that cost at $65 per REC or each one megawatt hour. I have stood before this House before and openly expressed my concern about the Rudd Labor government's ETS model. It is my very real fear that, under the Rudd government's current proposals for an emissions trading scheme, Australian businesses will be Aus- left out in the cold, Paterson's businesses will will be left out in the cold and Australian exposed businesses will be left disadvantaged against other competing countries in the market. Thankfully, Labor has come to its senses and agreed to decouple the renewable energy target from the ETS. To have tied the two together would have been to forgo common sense and would have subsequently been the marker of massive risk and uncertainty for Australian businesses over the next 20 years. The coalition foreshadow moving the following amendments in the Senate: firstly, a full decoupling of the renewable energy target from its flawed ETS, which was voted down in the Senate; secondly, the inclusion of renewable gas or waste coalmine gas as a recognised zero-emissions source of energy, as occurs in the United States and Germany; thirdly, ensuring that food processing is categorised for assistance under the RET; and, fourthly, coverage of the aluminium sector for both its existing MRET and expanded RET liabilities to the 90 per cent already fered by the government for the latter. The coalition will also seek to, firstly, eliminate a loophole in relation to the multiplication of RECs for industrial heat pumps and, secondly, move that a portion of the RET be banded and reserved for emerging renewable technologies, such as industrial scale solar, geothermal, wave, tidal and biomass. This would be 8,875 gigawatt hours or 25 per cent of the additional 35,500 gigawatt hours renewable energy. Until the last term of this parliament, Tomago Aluminium was in the electorate of Paterson and, even though it is now in the electorate of Newcastle, many of the thousands of workers, both direct and indirect, are my constituents, as are workers at the Kurri Kurri smelter in the electorate of Hunter. The very idea that the Rudd Labor government has not moved to ensure long term viability of the aluminium industry through environmental and economic stability is an act of economic and social treason against both workers and businesses alike, not to mention the broader local communities that rely on the economic flowthrough effect of this industry The New South Wales Labor government has just increased, by 20 per cent, the cost electricity to consumers, and that is prior to the introduction of any ETS model. The big question that the Prime Minister should be asking himself is: what will the cost be post introduction of his CPRS and what effect will it have on consumers and businesses alike? What will the downstream effect be on business, on costs and on consumers? How will it be sustainable in the face of greater international competition? The coalition will reserve its final Senate position, subject to the resolution of these issues. But we will negotiate in good faith and we want to see this legislation pass. The of- government has been its own worse enemy in bringing forward this legislation. It promised action on this target back in 2007 and yet, here we are, nearly two years down the track and the matter has only now been brought up for debate, which has been curtailed in this House to one day for such important legislation as this. The government has only itself to blame for its incompetence and tardiness. I am committed to ensuring that constructive renewable energy legislation is passed through the parliament. I am very pleased that the government is backing down from its approach of holding hostage renewable energy-that is, solar, wind, geothermal energies-to the passage of the emissions trading scheme. However, further changes need to be made, and I cannot stress enough the importance of the coalition's proposed amendments being passed though the Senate. As the Leader of the Opposition said earlier today: We'vethe coalition haveset out some amendments in detail. They range through a whole … of measures, including protecting trade exposed emissions intensive industry, also making sure that there is room in the of renewable energy target for the emerging renewable energies, like geothermal … solar … tidal … wave energy-these are important technologiesand their potential growth needs to be taken into consideration when considering this legislation. The coalition's aim is to get the renewable energy legislation and the best emissions trading legislation through the parliament that it can. To do that we have to work together. The question for the Prime Minister is: does he want to work together, does he want to listen to the views of others and engage positively and constructively with us? There is a right way and a wrong way of achieving a 20 per cent renewable energy target, and the Rudd government must remember this the next time it goes to pull the carpet out from underneath the Australian public and industry by cancelling schemes without notice. Therefore, if the government is willing to consider our reasoned amendments then this legislation will pass.",87
159,Mr ZAPPIA,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I speak in support of the renewable energy target legislation package. It is important legislation, and that is certainly one thing I agree with the member for Paterson on. But I do not agree with his comments in respect of the solar panel rebate and the management of that scheme by this government because, under this government, during 12 months in office, some 80,000 panels were to be installed around Australia. Contrast that with some 10,000, as we heard earlier on in question time today, that were subsidised during the 12 years of the previous Howard government. These bills, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the cognate bill, form part of the Rudd government's response to climate change. Let us make no mistake at all about it: this legislation is as much about climate change as is the CPRS legislation that was blocked by the coalition members last week, because the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions underpins this legislation. The objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is driven by the belief that rising greenhouse gas emisbest sions are contributing to global warming and to climate change. The overwhelming body of peer-reviewed scientific opinion subscribes to the view that greenhouse gases are a major contributor to global warming. The overwhelming body of scientific opinion on climate change and the devastating consequences for humanity simply cannot be ignored. We have a responsibility to the people of today's generation and an even more onerous responsibility to future generations, who have no voice whatsoever in decisions made today. Raising the nation's renewable energy target to 20 per cent by 2020 is an important step in the Rudd government's climate change strategy for several reasons: firstly, it results in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; secondly, it provides targets and certainty for both industry generally and electricity generators particularly; and, thirdly, it provides confidence to those industries investing in renewable energy technologies. Of course, this legislation also underpins the establishment of renewable energy certificates, which are central to the continuation of householder rebates for the installation of solar energy panels. There is a mistaken view, held by some members opposite, that any policy measure that seeks to reduce carbon emissions will have a negative impact on jobs and economic activity. Treasury modelling has shown that this policy will in fact create jobs, and that modelling has been supported by separate independent modelling by many organisations time and time again. Further evidence of the economic benefits of renewable energy can be seen in some of the stimulus packages put in place by governments around the world in response to the global economic crisis. Investment in renewable energy plays a significant role in these packages. I want to make reference to and quote some of those packages. According to analysis by HSBC published in the Financial Times, in South Korea 81 per cent of the total of its government's stimulus package is being spent on renewable energy projects-that is, US$36 billion of investment, which it is anticipated will create some 950,000 green jobs. In China 38 per cent of the total stimulus is being spent on renewable energy, which is in the vicinity of US$220 billion. In the United States 12 per cent of President Obama's stimulus package is being spent on renewable energy-over $50 billion in combined investment from the two stimulus packages; and this is expected to create 2.5 million green jobs. Also worth noting is the number of other nations who, like Australia, have made investments in household energy efficiency a priority for their stimulus packages. Programs similar to the Australian government's energy efficient insulation plan are part of stimulus packages in Germany, Britain and Canada. Polling published in today's Age shows that 55 per cent of Australians support the government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and do not think we should take the path of the opposition's latest delaying tactic of waiting until the Copenhagen meeting in December. The Financial Times analysis of the Rudd government's program said: Australia has only recently begun to engage seriously with climate change … Canberra ratified the Kyoto protocol in 2007 and now plans cut greenhouse gas emissions dramatically. This international analysis by HSBC and the Financial Times reaffirms what we and the Australian people already know: that, after 12 years of inaction by the previous Howard government, Australia finally has a Prime Minister and a government determined to address the issue of climate change and ensure Australia becomes a low-carbon economy. These bills take a significant step along the path of lowering Australia's carbon emissions. I commend the bills to the House.",91
160,Mr HAWKE,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I rise today to speak on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009 I think in the same way that all members of this House are rising to praise the idea that we need to be looking at alternative sources of energy, and particularly renewables. I think the search for a source of energy that is renewable and that has as little impact on the environment as possible is an objective which all members of this House would have no trouble supporting and indeed taking steps towards. This is a very noble objective, and that is why I think it is regrettable that we have seen in the last week important legislation such as this before us being coupled to other legislation unnecessarily in a way that delayed the ultimate success of this very important piece of legislation on renewables. The primary aim of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 is to set in place a renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020. I think that is a wonderful thing. I think the alliteration of ‘20 per cent by 2020' is a wonderful success for the highly paid political adviser who no doubt came up with it. But, on a serious note, of course we ought to be seeking an objective, and 20 per cent by 2020 is not a bad place to to start. I think this government ought to think very seriously about the steps it is taking in terms of supporting our renewable industries, because we have seen a lot of confusion and lack of serious focus on how to get the renewable market up and running. In the mechanisms of this bill we see another attempt by the Rudd government to set up a renewable energy industry. The story of the last year, since the election of the Rudd ernment, has been a series of measures which have led to a lot of confusion in the industry. One of the themes that we have seen over the last week in terms of responses to climate change and the emissions trading scheme has been about providing industry with certainty and providing business with certainty. Of course, if you have been in the solar industry since the election of the Rudd government then the last thing you would have had over the past 18 months is any certainty. That lack of certainty has been to the great detriment of the solar industry in Australia. When the Rudd government, suddenly and without warning, scrapped the $8,000 rebate, there was a mad rush of applications to get in before the last day of the deadline. Many people missed that deadline, and I had a number of them make representations to me. I had a number of representatives of the solar industry in New South Wales contact me about that. I lament with them the fact that these decisions were taken without warning and without notice. Certainly I thought that the attitude of Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts here in this place, when he said that the problem he was trying to solve was that the solar industry was overheating, sort of revealed a fundamental misunderstanding of what the government is trying to do with all of its settings that it puts into place. Governments are not there to subsidise continually the behaviour of every person in every sense; we are attempting to create a viable market, something which can sustain itself, ultimately-and as quickly as possible, I might add. So the fact that there was a great demand for solar panels-and the proposition was that it was overheating; that there was too much demand and that the system had gotten to a point where demand was very gov- simulated-is something I think we ought to really celebrate and rejoice about. However, this is an attempt to rejig the solar industry. Hopefully, this will lead to a situation where there is more certainty in the solar market, because in the last 18 months there has been a litany of decisions that have not provided certainty. I do not think you would find a genuine solar industry representative who would come forward and say, ‘We've had a very certain 18 months.' Indeed, one of the successes of the Howard government was the solar panel rebate in creating the foundations of a market for a sustainable renewable like solar power. If you look at some of the comments, I think that is backed up by many people. Some of the managing directors of different solar companies made comments like, ‘This is the third setback for the solar industry in as many weeks,' when the rebates were scrapped. There were other comments, such as that they were promised smooth transitions from the $8,000 rebate to the new solar credit scheme, which was pulled with only hours of notice. I think the retrospectivity of the it in terms of the renewable energy targets policy was to be regretted. There is an elephant in the room in relation to energy policy. Certainly renewable energies are to be lauded, but there is also something else that we as a place ought to consider, and that is the viability of nuclear power. Though not specifically addressed in this bill, I think it is important, because while we search for renewable energies-and this legislation before us is an attempt to set the foundations for a market-there is no contention that renewables will be able to provide us with our baseload power into the future. We need to look at options for baseload power generation that will enable us to meet our emissions targets and deal with the problems that we are facing with climate change. Australia has one of the highest per capita rates of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, primarily because of our reliance on fossil fuels. So, given that undesirable outcome for Australia that we have one of the highest per capita emissions in the world, if we are serious about tackling this then we ought to seriously consider alternative energies that will be sustainable, and there is no proposition that renewables will provide our baseload power into the future. So, while I am a very strong supporter of the renewable energy industry-whether it be geothermal, solar or more power from hydro plants and all of the wonderful things that come with that and the clean energies that can be provided-I believe it is not the case that this a serious option at this point in time for baseload power generation. Therefore, as a parliament looking forward into the future of this country, we need to consider very seriously that with our uranium reserves and our ability to develop a nuclear industry we can generate the power we need in a cleaner way, with a substantial supplement from renewables and a viable renewable market. This legislation replaces the solar rebates with a solar credit scheme which issues renewable energy credits to the installers of solar panel systems of 1.5 kilowatts per hour or less. These credits can be traded on a market for a return of between $4,000 and $4,500 for a common solar panel system. This is a mechanism which I endorse. Market based mechanisms are something which we know works and something which can provide a platform for future arrangements. It is interesting to note that this government seems to lurch from policy to policy in relation to markets. When they are running for election they love markets; when they get into government they hate them. When we are dealing with climate change they seem to discover their enjoyment of market based mechanisms again. But never mind the inconsistency and the inconsistent signals we get out of this government in relation to market mechanisms. Market mechanisms, without any doubt, work. If we are unable to use them as part of our arsenal in dealing with climate change, then we are not serious about handling the challenges that we face as a country. I 100 per cent endorse the concept of creating viable markets as a powerful mechanism for dealing with climate change or the problems caused by the pollutants created by industry. I think it is regrettable that this legislation is before us after the last week. We have heard a lot of derision from the government but not a lot of openness to negotiating about is what is a very important matter. Finally, the government has relented, decoupled this bill and sought to bring it here as its own individual bill, which it always should have been, because I believe that renewables will enjoy the support of members in this place and enjoy the support of the community in terms of what government action will be taken. The opposition is proposing amendments, and those amendments are very important, especially given the fact that we are looking at the coverage of the aluminium sector for both its existing targets and expanded renewable energy target liabilities to the 90 per cent already offered by the government for the latter. I think those amendments are worthwhile. I think the government ought to consider them. If they are serious about renewables, if they are serious about making this the best possible scheme that they can, then they ought to be negotiating on these very important matters. Many of the government backbenchers say they believe that we are in the biggest crisis of our time. We have heard that very dramatic language. I have seen Kevin Rudd, the Prime Minister, stand in front of a camera at the Great Barrier Reef and say that, if we do not act, this will no longer be here. That the Prime Minister of the country standing in front of a television camera and, with quite a high degree of alarmism, warning that a great iconic piece of Australia may not be here if we do not act. If those things are true, then I believe the government ought to be here in this chamber negotiating very seriously with us about this legislation and about the emissions trading scheme legislation and, in particular, accepting the very good ideas that are being put forward by the opposition in the form of amendments to this legislation. In summary, I think it is easy to say that this House, and I particularly, will almost certainly go on to endorse what is an important step in our energy generation process. Renewables will play an important role in Australia's future. However, I do not think we should blind ourselves to the fact that we need to be considering very seriously the next step in baseload energy generation into the future. But I endorse this legislation.",92
161,Ms GRIERSON,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I rise to speak in support of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009. I have to say that I marvel at ing the new experts, the weekend experts, in the opposition telling us what we need to do now about climate change and renewable energy. That tourism slogan ‘Where the bloody hell are you?' certainly applies. Where were they for 12 years? I am incredulous. It is just amazing. It is also amazing to me that there would still be the suggestion from them that we are all over the shop, that we are swapping and changing. Yet we see no clear message from the other side at all. We see no certainty for business in their arrangements, just some suggestion that they are the holders of all knowledge on climate change. I do not think the public agree with that. The public agree-and I think there is absolute consensus in this country-that is there must be action on climate change, there must be a CPRS or an emissions trading scheme and there certainly must be legislation and initiatives from government to boost the renewables sector. When you hear the opposition say we have not been consistent, and you look at $15 billion in the last budget alone to support clean energy and renewable initiatives, you have to wonder where their attention has been. We know it has been on leadership instead of doing the work that they need to do to impress us or the public of Australia. We know that renewable energy is vital in the fight to reduce greenhouse emissions, and we have already agreed to meet certain targets in the Kyoto protocol and beyond that. We have to get on with this legislation. This bill gives effect to the government's commitment to replace the existing mandatory renewable energy target scheme, the MRET, with a national renewable energy target scheme. It aims to see an annual 45,000 gigawatts per hour of electricity produced in Australia from renewable energy sources by 2020, in comparison to the existing MRET scheme, which had a much lower hear- target of only 9,500 gigawatt hours. The 45,000 target is expected to ensure that the equivalent of at least 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply is generated from renewable sources. That is something that can only come about through leadership and inspiration and it can only happen if we give the certainty to business that this legislation provides. In this decoupled legislation-of course, dependent on the actions of the oppositionthere is assistance; it does provide extra help for business sectors. I heard the member for Paterson, speaking before me, claiming that not supporting the aluminium industry in my electorate and in the Hunter electorate was some sort of ‘social treason'. Mr Baldwin will be very pleased to know that the four Labor members of the Hunter are absolutely united in their support for the aluminium industry and for our other trade-exposed industries-the steel, cement and coal industries. We are blessed in our area not only with outstanding industry but also with outstanding opportunities for energy generation and energy production. And we do not just have the blessing of resources; we also have the blessing of innovation, intellect and initiative, which have been very well supported by the Rudd government. I draw attention to the national Australian Solar Institute, the headquarters of which is in my electorate, and the national Clean Energy Innovation Centre, which is also in my electorate. We are leading the way. We have a carbon footprint that is not to be envied but we are ing the way in finding the solutions for the future. Whilst it is sad to see that there have been attempts to block initiatives such as this today, last week's announcement by the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong, of interim industry assistance arrangements under the RET is a safeguard against the opposition failing to pass the CPRS later this year. We know that there is a move to pass the legislation and we hope that can be achieved. It will take very strong leadership from the opposition and, of course, that is still the missing factor. The arrangements will set aside the link between the RET and the CPRS legislation until the CPRS has passed through the Senate. If it is not passed then these interim measures will be provided to key electricityintensive trade-exposed industries like the aluminium industry in my electorate. I think most people would agree that this is a less than perfect way of taking up the dual aims of tackling climate change and providing assistance to industry. But, as the minister said last week, this is a necessary course of action given the opposition's irresponsibility and its very muddle-headed approach to the climate change debate. It is up to the government to provide the certainty to the renewables sector in the face of the opposition's failure to do the responsible thing and to pass both the CPRS and the renewable energy target legislation. This legislation will deliver more than a fourfold increase in renewable energy targets by 2020. If passed, it will lead to the largest increase in renewable energy in the country's history. There is a potential $19 billion to $20 billion of investment out there, and that is the sort of investment we need to drive change. It is the sort of investment that will only come with certainty. The people who met with me in my office today, who will be at the Australian Industry Group dinner tonight, are looking leadfor more guidance and more support from government to make sure they can take advantage. They want to be on the front foot in terms of renewable energy, not waiting for us to make some legislative change to suit the opposition. Even with the renewable energy target in place, without the CPRS it will be very difficult to give that certainty and to show the leadership that this country is quite capable of. Leadership for Copenhagen is particularly important. I can never believe it when I hear the opposition say we should be followers. We have never been followers. We have always punched above our weight. We have always led on the big issues that face this nation and the globe and that is what we intend to do. We are a government committed to positive forward thinking and we will provide the leadership that has been so sorely lacking for over 12 years. I support this bill and commend it to the House. I certainly know that the support of the public has been vocal and strong and I hope that the opposition will remember that when they face the CPRS debate.",95
162,Mr RAMSEY,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"It is inevitable if man is to survive on this planet that we will have to wean ourselves off fossil fuel not only because of the imperative of reducing carbon emissions but because fossil fuels are finite and the oil shortages of last year underline just how this has become of increasing importance. I make the point from the outset that this Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 will receive my support, even though I believe there are a number of unintended consequences, and I fully support the amendments foreshadowed earlier today by the shadow minister. I will come to that later. Investment in the renewable energy sector promises to pay dividends in the longer term. This bill is designed to support what otherwise would be unlikely investment in these industries. It is of great importance that the shifts in the emphasis of the economy like this are orderly and steady and not placing our industries at competitive disadvantage. It is of immediate concern that this legislation be passed, as the renewable energy industry has been making decisions based on the publicly stated intent of the major parties. That why the moves of last week by the government to link the RET bill to the CPRS were reprehensible and just a shot at short-term political advantage and overturned after pressure from the opposition and the electorate at large. South Australia-and my electorate of Grey-is almost uniquely placed to take advantage of a new low-carbon world. Vast spaces with cloud-free skies offer an abundance of opportunity for solar energy electricity generation, and I am aware of at least two companies considering projects as we speak, including the innovative solar storage project by Wizard Power at Whyalla. South Australia currently has nine wind farms operating and it is anticipated that by 2014 it will have 20 per cent of its electricity generated by wind energy. Many of these developments are in my electorate. I know the current government would like to claim credit for all these developments, but in fact all of the investment decisions of the plants currently operating were made under the Howard government and its policy framework, which included the MRET. MRET was the first step and the renewable energy target is the next. New developments are being based on current policy, which in this case are broadly endorsed by the coalition, and there is much on offer. Some of the most exciting areas of interest involve new technologies such as wave generation. Currently Wave Rider Energy are assessing possibilities on the Western Eyre Peninsula, where there is an almost unlimited resource. The Grey electorate encompasses 70 per cent of the South Australia coastline, and it should come as no surprise that I have great hopes for the establishment of this industry. Perhaps some of the most exciting prospects are in geothermal electricity production. Last year I visited the Geodynamics site is at Innaminka in the state's far north where I was more than impressed by the prospects but, more importantly, by the vision of those who are driving the drilling and testing program and investing in this new industry, which is very close to bringing its first onekilowatt generator on stream. Two weeks ago, I inspected Petratherm's new drilling rig near Beverley in the northern Flinders where they are developing another hot rocks venture. It is a fascinating and exciting prospect: pumping water nearly five kilometres underground through fissures in hot granite and bringing it back to the surface at temperatures approaching 200 degrees Celsius is a technological marvel. This renewable energy represents the Holy Grail of clean energy as it is baseload. It is estimated that just one per cent of the thermal energy in Australia's foundations could supply all of our energy needs for the next 300 years. One of the great criticisms of renewable energy is its ability to supply baseload, that is, the wind does not blow all the time and the sun does not shine on one side of the earth all the time and even wave and tidal energy has lulls; thus, we need fallback power generation systems, which inevitably lead to higher total costs. There are a number of technologies being explored at this stage, including thermal carbon block and the ammonia battery process being developed by the Australian National University and Wizard Power at Whyalla, whom I mentioned earlier. It is worth noting that, even though one may think from listening to the government's rhetoric nothing had been done in Australia to stimulate investment in renewable energy before their election, in reality the previous government established the Australian Greenhouse Office and the mandatory renewable energy target, introduced solar rebates and supported numerous developments in the renewable industry. In my electorate alone, there was significant government support for both Geodynamics and Wizard Power in the development of their projects. The legislation will help a number of these industries, but it also has some dangers in that the support may be soaked up fully by mature technologies which can quickly meet the targets when the aim should be to encourage new technologies to be able to come of age and compete in the marketplace. That is why the opposition will move an amendment stipulating that 25 per cent of the renewable energy target should be reserved for new and emerging industries, and I urge the government to support this amendment. The renewable energy credits or RECs will be most valuable at the start of the program and will deteriorate in value as 2020 and the 25 per cent target near. This 25 per cent will give protection to those industries through to that period and give the new industries the opportunity to start up and come on stream. If we look at the possibilities of technologies such as solar or wave energy, there are likely to be quantum leaps in the efficiency or cost-competitiveness in these areas over the next 5, 10 and 20 years. It will be necessary to watch this space and make sure they do not miss out on the encouragement they need to advance their cause while the dollars run to industries which are fully mature but may be surpassed in efficiency in the longer term. It is all about balance. It is always dangerous for an economy to place all its eggs in one basket. This means we will almost certainly have to revisit the incentives to ensure we are developing balanced industries. It will be a threat to the competitive generation system, which must supply our industries and homes, if we have investment in too few of those industries. This bill is about supporting and hastening that change. It should be remembered by all that this will come at a cost. After all, there would be no need for a renewable energy target if this were not the case. Certainly, the policy will make electricity more expensive in the short to medium term. However, the greater good should be served by providing a more favourable environment for new technologies to come on stream. Steady, predictable policy is good government. The recent move to, once again, make a sudden attack on the $8,000 solar rebate program, resulting in its premature termination despite its making a commitment to a seamless transition, was not good government by the government. Its earlier attack, which introduced a means test, caused problems which took time to adjust to. Things had just settled down and business was brisk, only for the government to reintroduce chaos by cutting the program before the new renewable energy target could be introduced, despite its commitment. While it was true that there was a backlog in installation of panels, this unpredictable icy has created a complete stop in the sales system, leaving staff sitting around with very little to do. In closing, I say renewable energies offer great opportunities for Australia and the world, and more will have to be done to support these fledgling industries. But the renewable energy target is a good piece of legislation, and I offer it my support.",97
163,Ms CAMPBELL,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I rise today to add my voice to those in this House who actually believe in climate change and who acknowledge that we must act and act now. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and cognate bill form part of a raft of measures to which the Rudd government is committed in order to respond to climate change. The Minister for Climate Change and Water, the Hon. Penny Wong, made the point as she addressed the National Press Club recently that as a government we are asking much of this generation. We are being asked to repair the damage of generations past, doing so largely for generations to come. This is not an easy task, and in some sectors it is not popular. With that said, it is necessary. I made an election commitment to the people of Bass and to the communities of Northern Tasmania. That commitment was that, as a government, Labor was staunch in its approach to renewable energy and that it would set a renewable energy target of 20 per cent of our electricity supply to come from renewable sources by the year 2020. It is a key measure within the government's comprehensive approach to tackling climate change. This legislation will amend the act to implement the government's commitment to expand its mandatory renewable energy target scheme, which includes a statutory target of 9,500 gigawatt hours in 2010, to a national renewable energy target scheme, polwhich includes a target of 45,000 gigawatt hours in 2020. The expanded scheme will deliver the government's commitment that the equivalent of at least 20 per cent of Australia's electricity will come from renewable sources by 2020. This legislation and the intent underpinning it will have dramatic effects in my electorate of Bass and across Tasmania. Hydro Tasmania is the country's largest generator of renewable energy. With almost 30 hydro power stations across the state, worth close to $5 billion, it is clearly a major player in the renewable energy sector. Indeed, Roaring 40s, a Hydro Tasmania joint company, is well advanced towards the Musselroe Wind Farm. This farm is located in the north-east of Tasmania, around 100 kilometres from Launceston. It is anticipated that the project will comprise around 60 wind turbines, with a potential to generate almost 140 megawatts. Roaring 40s also says that its project will include the construction of a transmission line to connect the wind farm site to the Tasmanian electricity grid at Derby. This project will have both long-term and shortterm benefits to the community and also to the environment. The employment created through the construction phase will have significant and positive effects in Northern Tasmania. Once operational, there will be ongoing employment opportunities. That is to say nothing of the obvious environmental benefit. According to Roaring 40s' own figures, the Musselroe Wind Farm will meet the electricity needs of up to 55,000 Australian homes and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 300,000 tonnes a year. Australians understand that climate change is the biggest threat to our prosperity and our way of life. Australia is one of the nations most vulnerable to climate change. In my home state of Tasmania, the impact threatens to be profound. Tasmania is expected to become warmer, with more hot days and fewer cold nights. Growth in peak summer energy demand is anticipated due to air-conditioning use, which may increase the risk of blackouts. By 2030, the average annual number of days over 35 degrees in Hobart could almost double, while in Launceston the average annual number of cold days below zero degrees could fall from 35 to 16. Warmer temperatures and population growth are likely to cause a rise in heatwell's related illness and death for those over 65, increasing in the state's capital from the rent five annual deaths to eight by 2020 and to between 10 and 14 by 2050. Warmer conditions may also help spread vector-borne, waterborne and food-borne disease further south. These health issues could increase pressure on medical and hospital services. Urban water security may be threatened by increases in demand and climate-driven reductions in water supply. An increase in annual rainfall, combined with higher evaporation, may lead to uncertain effects on run-off into rivers by 2030. By 2020, a 10 to 40 per cent reduction in snow cover is likely, with potentially significant consequences for alpine tourism and ecosystems. By 2020, the average number of days with very high or extreme fire danger in Launceston could increase. Increases in extreme storm events are expected to cause more flash flooding, affecting industry and infrastructureincluding water, sewerage and stormwater, transport and communications-and may challenge emergency services. In low-lying coastal areas, infrastructure is vulnerable to sea level rise and inundation. The effects of doing nothing are frightening, yet there are some among those opposite who in their hearts continue to deny the tence of climate change and who argue against the reality of global warming. These are attitudes I find, frankly, quite alarming, and I will say it again: doing nothing is not an option. In fact, those opposite cannot even get their facts right as they attempt to attack the government over this necessary response to climate change. It was with some amusement that I read on the website of Nationals Senator Ron Boswell that both the member for Hunter and the member for Corio will be joining me, the member for Bass, in facing what Senator Boswell called a ‘day of reckoning' over Bell Bay jobs. For Senator Bosfuture reference, Bell Bay is indeed in Bass, and I have no qualms about supporting curlegislation which is preparing Australia for the low-pollution future by tackling the challenge of climate change. If only those opposite were prepared to do likewise! I commend these bills to the House, optimistic about a future where action is taken in response to climate change.",99
164,Ms MARINO,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I rise to speak on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009. As we know, the coalition is committed to clean, renewable energies and strongly supports a 20 per cent renewable energy target. There is a raft of clean energy options, from the commercial-ready algal proposal through to emerging energy concepts and industry growth options in tidal, wave, solar, geothermal resources, bioenergy and others. The coalition offers provisional support for the legislation, subject to key amendments. The coalition will seek four key amendments in the Senate. The first is the decoupling of the RET from the flawed CPRS, and I know the shadow minister has already been in discussion with the government today on this issue. Renewables and exis- clean energy options are widely acknowledged as current and future commercial and employment opportunities. My electorate of Forrest encompasses a number of dairy farms. The chairman of the Australian Dairy Industry Council, Allan Burgess, said as part of his inquiry submission: The industry understands the need for increased development of renewable energy sources. However we have significant concerns that the double burden of both the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) and the Renewal Energy Target (RET) will place significant further cost increases on the dairy farming families with little environmental benefit. … … … The cumulative increase has the ously impact the industry. The coalition's second amendment is the inclusion of renewable gas, or waste coalmine gas, as a recognised zero-emissions source of energy as in New South Wales, the US and Germany. This amendment is vital for sustaining hundreds of rural and regional jobs, such as those in my electorate of Forrest. These jobs potentially face the axe, and this is fundamental not only for rural economies but also because the process itself will save 90 million tonnes of CO2 between now and 2020. I note that the World Wildlife Fund anticipates that, if unamended, the loss of rural and regional jobs will b greater under the government's CPRS than under the Frontier Energy proposal. The expanded RET requires approximately 10,000 megawatt hours of new power generation to fully satisfy the 20 per cent target by 2020. The coalition believes that this target will be very difficult to achieve without the inclusion of waste coalmine gases. The third amendment is the 90 per cent coverage of the aluminium sector for both its existing mandatory RET and expanded RET liabilities. The Australian Aluminium Council has said: If unamended, this Bill will have significant economic consequences for the aluminium industry, its employees and the communities in which they livesuch as in my electorate. The Australian Aluminium Council estimates that the bill in its current form will cost the industry an additional $700 million over the first decade of this scheme and will force most smelters to reduce their workforces and to wind back capital expenditure. The council has called for a true 90 per cent exemption from the RET for industries that are both electricity intensive and emissions intensive, not the current exemption figure for aluminium smelting, which is estimated to actually be potential to seri- 55 per cent. The coalition's fourth amendment is to ensure that food processing is categorised for assistance under the RET. Rural communities are seeking a 90 per cent coverage of the food-processing sector, particularly the dairy industry. On that note, an article in the Australian on 17 August stated: It's going to be a high cost to the consumer-the food manufacturer gets an ETS charge, then there's delivery, and the retailers use refrigeration and lighting and the cost of that is all going to be handed on. The article, like this government, actually made no mention of the increased cost to farmers and growers, who will bear this additional cost to produce Australia's food from day 1. How will Australian farmers recover these additional costs when they are often absolute price takers? And how will they compete with imported products that do not have the additional costs of a CPRS? I note the Australian Financial Review highlighted food processors' issues on 17 August, saying: Australia exports 65 per cent of farm produce. Our food producers are exposed to global competition, which has critical implications for jobs, export markets, food supplies and net global emissions. The food processing sector, like the growers, will be forced to compete against cheaper imported food because agriculture is excluded from emission trading schemes around the world. David Crombie from the National Farmers Federation recently reinforced the fact that Australian farmers already contribute to reducing greenhouse emissions and that primary industries have slashed emissions by 40 per cent since 1990. The final amendment the coalition is proposing is to help build the clean and renewable energy sector in Australia. In my electorate there is the Pinetec facility, situated next to the Muja power station in Collie, where sawmilling residue is converted to electricity. In the process, this displaces some 45,000 tonnes of coal each year, saving approximately 90,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions each year. Perdaman Industries is another company investing in innovative and clean coal cation technology in my electorate. They are implementing a US$2.5 billion plant that will transform sub-bituminous coal via gasification into urea. The coal to urea plant will produce lower emissions than an equivalently sized coal-fired power plant. A further example is the Shire of Nannup and Verve Energy, who are currently investigating the potential for building a wind farm in the south-west of WA. The planned farm will entail 30 wind turbines, with a combined capacity of up to 55 megawatts. It is anticipated that the output of the wind farm would be enough to supply about 26,000 households and will reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions by about 160,000 tonnes per year. The south-west of WA is considered a reasonable wind resource, meaning there is huge potential for further wind plants to be located in the Forrest electorate. A recent article in the Australian Financial Review summed up the common-sense approach that there should be public support for research and development of all promising technologies, and ultimately the renewable energy technologies will have to compete on their own merits. The coalition strongly supports clean and renewable energies and the concept of a 20 per cent RET and wants this legislation to pass subject to the coalition amendments.",100
165,Ms NEAL,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I rise in the House today to speak in support of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009. The bill will expand and enhance the current mandatory renewable energy target scheme. The Australian people have shown the government that they expect bold action on climate change, and this bill demonstrates that the government is delivering on this expectation. The revised renewable energy target gasifischeme will implement the government's commitment to a renewable energy target of 20 per cent of our electricity supply to come from renewable sources by the year 2020. This represents a fourfold expansion of the nation's renewable energy sector. The current target of 9,500 gigawatt hours of electricity to be provided from renewable sources will be expanded to require that 45,000 gigawatt hours-or some 20 per cent of Australia's electricity-be produced from renewable sources by the year 2020. Electricity generation currently accounts for more than one-third of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. That is why it is vital that Australia move towards higher targets for renewable electricity production. These expanded targets will accelerate the development and deployment of a range of renewable energy technologies, such as wind, solar, biomass and geothermal power. The new scheme will create a guaranteed market for additional renewable energy deployment through the use of tradeable renewable energy certificates. These measures will in turn attract additional investment and create additional jobs within the expanded renewable energy sector. It is estimated through Treasury modelling that by 2050 the renewable electricity sector will be 30 times larger than it is today. The expanded RET scheme will accelerate green jobs and, together with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, will drive around $19 billion in investment in the renewable energy sector in the period to 2020. The RET scheme will assist Australian households with the up-front costs of installing smallscale renewable energy systems such as solar, wind, micro-hydro and solar photovoltaic systems. This ‘solar credits' mechanism will allow owners of small-scale renewable energy systems to earn multiple renewable energy certificates for their microgeneration systems. A new element of the renewable energy trading scheme is an increase in the penalties for those liable parties who do not meet their obligations to purchase renewable energy certificates. In a related bill, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009, this shortfall charge will increase from $40 per megawatt hour to $65 per megawatt hour. The bill also provides for partial exemptions from liability under the expanded renewable energy target. These partial exemptions will apply to those activities that are classified as emissions-intensive trade-exposed activities under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. These exemptions recognise that renewable energy obligations will have an impact on emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries. The exemptions take into account not only the impact of the current global financial crisis on Australian industries but the cumulative effect on industry of this legislation and the obligations required from industry under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. A comprehensive review of the renewable energy target scheme will be undertaken in 2014 to coincide with a planned strategic review of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. This government has made great efforts towards positioning Australia to meet the challenges of climate change. The bill before us today represents a significant opportunity to reduce Australia's energy sector emissions while driving $19 billion of investment and creating significant numbers of green jobs as part of an estimated 30-fold increase in the renewable electricity sector by 2050. In facing this future, Australia must employ a range of responses. Our nation must, however, always find cleaner and more efficient ways to produce energy. The Rudd Labor government has shown its credentials in moving towards a low pollution future for Australia. I commend the bill to the House.",102
166,Mr SIMPKINS,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I welcome the chance to make a contribution to this debate regarding renewable energy and, in particular, these bills regarding mandatory renewable energy targets, the 20 per cent by 2020 target and the shortfall charge issue. Before I speak to the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the cognate bill, I would say that it is great news that the government have at last agreed to the decoupling of the ETS legislation from the renewables legislation. The government's original plan showed that their interest was not in achieving what was best for Australia but rather in trying to force all the non-Labor Party representatives into an agreement with the original legislation. Now is the time for negotiation, but it is a pity that the government's intransigence has caused these delays to date. Yet it is time to move on constructively, and I will now address the bill in this debate. Prior to speaking on the detail, however, I say that the overall point of this bill is to ensure that by 2020 all electricity wholesalers have 20 per cent of their electricity attributed to renewable production. If they do not then they will be liable for a shortfall charge of $65 per megawatt hour. It is also worthwhile to note that, despite the Rudd Labor government's strident statements that the former government did nothing for 12 years, the fact that this bill that we are discussing today is an amendment suggests that the government is once again wrong with its rhetoric. The facts are that there are two pieces of legislation and one set of regulations on this matter alone that prove this government wrong. Clearly, from the year 2000, legislation was raised, being the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Charge Act 2000 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Regulations 2001. With specific regard to this bill, it is intended to increase annual targets for renewable energy from 2010 and includes a 45,000 gigawatt hour target in 2020; a solar credits mechanism based on energy certificates; multipliers for solar photovoltaic, wind and micro-hydro systems; a review of the operation of the legislation in 2014; and provision for partial exemptions from liability for electricity-intensive trade-exposed activities and the transition of state schemes into the federal framework. Specifically, the bills provide for a new solar rebate scheme based on RECs, or renewable energy certificates, generated, so to say, from the existence of the solar photovoltaic systems. With regard to those systems, the $8,000 rebate the coalition created is to be replaced with a solar credit scheme, where renewable energy credits are issued to the installers of solar photovoltaic systems of less than 1.5 kilowatts. Those credits, for a common one-kilowatt system, are expected to be tradeable for between $4,000 and $4,500. The legislation maps out the progressive increase in the mandatory renewable energy target from 9,500 gigawatt hours to the 45,000 gigawatt hours I mentioned before. The bottom line is that electricity wholesalers will have to ensure they have 20 per cent of their energy produced by renewable sources. They can achieve that by obtaining electricity produced by solar, wind, geothermal or other options. If they cannot then they have to buy RECs. If they still cannot reach the target then they have to pay the shortfall charge of $65 per megawatt hour. That is what this legislation is meant to do and we offer our support for it, subject to some amendments that are being negotiated at this time. It is certainly the coalition's position to pursue a clean energy economy and with no equivocation we support the 20 per cent target. I will make the point again that the target set by the coalition of 9,500 gigawatt hours represents some 10 per cent of electricity production, and I am keen to see that figure advance to 20 per cent. I question, however, how the government have assisted the sector to achieve these targets when they have moved the goalposts so rapidly in the past. The great examples came from the solar industry: firstly, the surprise means-testing of our $8,000 rebate, and then the no notice close-down of the scheme 21 days early on 9 June this year. With such a track record, it is hard to have confidence in the government setting the rules and then not changing them-and you can add to that list the no notice abolition of the coalition's Remote Renewable Power Generation Program on 22 June. It is clear that the government have struggled to maintain any consistency on solar policy, and it should be noted that the ables sector as a whole did not appreciate being bound up in the ETS legislation when they knew that there was significant bipartisan support for renewables legislation if it stood alone. The point is obvious that the Labor Party used solar for politicking before the election and used renewables for politicking regarding the ETS but, through the dual faults of political opportunism and titude, they have not taken the opportunity support and add certainty across the renewables sector. Again, renewable energy was one of the issues that the Rudd Labor government highlighted as something we had supposedly not acted upon when we were in government. That was clearly false; however, it worked for them in the political environment. When faced with the opportunity to act, to achieve and to work on the high expectations they had created, there has been nothing but vacila lation on existing measures we had created and delay until now, when something of substance has been introduced to the parliament. Sadly, the Rudd government have been about smoke and mirrors, and no more so than in using the renewable energy sector for political gain and abusing the sector for the last two years. With regard to the amendments sought, first and foremost we have the expectation that renewable energy targets are a separate issue and divorced from the ETS. Beyond that, we have made our position clear with regard to zero emission sources of energy such as renewable gas and waste coalmine gas. I understand that they are recognised as zero emission in both the US and certain parts of Europe. In speaking of recognition of emerging and alternative renewable energy production, it is important that we be careful regarding renewables that already exist. It is my view renewthat renewables must be constant and not dependent on weather fluctuations. A point well made by an earlier speaker was that a renewable source of energy that requires a redundancy or a backup to be constantly running is not an effective energy source. The member for O'Connor also raised the point that the Premier of South Australia is looking for 30 per cent of his state's electricinepity production to be generated by wind to power. Yet coming with that goal is the inherent risk of having to shut down turbines in hot weather. The potential loss of 30 per cent of the state's power in extremely hot conditions is a major problem and a risk that should not be readily accepted. The point I am making is that all that glitters is not gold. While many people may feel better having wind power as a major element of renewable targets, the reality is that renewables must be virtually certain of 24 hour day, 365 day a year production and supply of baseload power. It is therefore far better to pursue technology that has such capacities, and we should look to those options. It is not my intention to speak very much longer, because there are still plenty of people waiting to speak on this legislation. Again, we should not limit ourselves to the pursuit of renewable options that are high profile but with limitations that are yet to be resolved. This is about real action and options that will see sustainable and viable renewable energies, not about ticking boxes and feeling good about having done something that is green. I look forward to these bills being amended for the better and passed quickly, allowing progress towards a 20 per cent target via viable and reliable energy production sources.",103
167,Ms SAFFIN,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I speak in support of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009. Climate change is a fact, global warming is a fact and major catastrophic weather events are becoming more common and more intense. Floods and droughts are more frequent, more catastrophic and more intense. Over the last couple of years in the seat of Page, we have experimeasure enced the worse frost in 27 years and the worse hailstorm on record, which was followed by a flood that year's end, then another flood and, a few months ago, major flooding. Farmers notice it. They know something is up. They know something is different. Farmers are pretty good watchers and knowers of the land, the seasons and how things work. The community expects the government to take decisive but considered action. That is what the government is doing. We know we are moving to a carbon constrained world and we have to be prepared to meet the lenges. We know that we are moving to a lower greenhouse gas emission world and we have to be prepared to meet those challenges. The government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, which is the whole policy framework and the legislative framework to deal with this, does just that. The CPRS legislation that was introduced in May was the first key plank. When that passes the Senate it will do a lot to move us to lower greenhouse gas emissions. But the amending bills that I speak to today are the second plank the government's salient institutional set changes in environmental and economic policy, and the two have to go hand in hand as we move to combat climate change. The government's commitment to a renewable energy target whereby 20 per cent of our electricity supply is drawn from renewable sources by the year 2020 is a major action the government's comprehensive 10-point plan to tackle climate change. There are some people who want us to go to 100 per cent almost immediately. We know that we cannot do that, but this is a wonderful start. It means that by 2020 20 per cent of our energy supply will be renewable, particularly in the area of electricity. The government taking the lead by setting the legislative target of 20 per cent is the key that helps set us on the path to a lower pollution future. We live in the land of plenty when it comes to renewables, but not when it comes to the non-renewables, and we have used the non-renewables at an unsustainable rate. The renewable energy target scheme does another key thing: it brings a mandatory renewable target and current proposed state and territory schemes into one scheme-a national scheme-and it will facilitate the Victorian scheme which is already established. We know that electricity generation makes up more than a third of Australia's chal- greenhouse gas emissions. This scheme means, then, that one-fifth of the biggest greenhouse gas emissions must be gone by 2020-indeed a good start. That has been one of the points about this whole debate. We have to get it started. We cannot wait any longer. I want to say some general things about these amending bills within the framework of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in which they are located. Firstly, I want to say thank you to the minister in this place, of the Minister Assisting the Minister for Cliof mate Change and Water, for his excellent work in this area and the discussions that I have been able to have with him on issues arising in this area, such as on how to assist households and how to have household actions brought into the overall Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. We have discussed of the science and the work of people like James Hansen and other scientists who are all part of this debate, the various books that we have read in the area-some of which have been given to me, such as Climate Code Red and Scorcher-and a whole range of other things. I get exposed, as we all do, to views that run right across the spectrum from deniers to sceptics to the almost fundamentalism at the other end that says that, if we do not do something tonight, things will drastically change forever. But it is really the incredible science-and the science that exists in Australia comes out of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-that is driving this debate. That is the science that the government's policy and plans are based on and that forms the basis of the legislative and policy approach that the government has taken. With those comments, I commend the bills to this House.",105
168,Mr HARTSUYKER,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I welcome the opportunity to talk on the very important issue of renewable energy. It is certainly a form of energy supply which should be encouraged. Increasing the amount of electricity that we generate from renewable sources is something that is going to benefit our nation in the long term and benefit the environment. The measures that are contained within the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009 build on the measures that were first implemented by the Howard government-a very visionary proposal to increase the amount of electricity sourced from renewable supplies. I certainly commend the target that has been set of 20 per cent of Australia's electricexpect ity supply being provided by renewable sources by the year 2020. The desirability of increasing the size of our renewable energy sector is often lost in the heat of the climate change debate, because there are many other reasons for maximising the output from this sector apart from the obvious climate change ramifications. That is why I deplore the government's insistence on linking these measures to its flawed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and welcome its apparent change of heart. Whatever the arguments over climate change, one of the very good ways of reducing our carbon emissions is through renewables and also through energy efficiency. The vast majority of our current energy needs are met through the burning of fossil fuels, and the total production of energy from renewable sources in Australia is currently in the order of 8½ per cent, which leaves some 91½ per cent of our energy coming from those fossil fuels. Our way of life and our use of cars, computers and domestic appliances have built a great dependence in this country on the use of coal and on the burning of oil. One day those supplies will run out. As we approach that day, we will see prices for those fuels increase rapidly. We will see the need for increased international competition for the remaining reserves. We will see our way of life threatened to an extent that we have never seen before. Consumers rightly complain about petrol prices. Certainly, the Rudd government made great promises to the electorate during the 2007 election campaign that they were going to put downward pressure on petrol prices. We have seen very little happening by way of concrete measures in that regard except for the failed Fuelwatch scheme. They rightly claim that, when pump prices fail to follow the falls in the price of crude oil, they someone in that supply chain is lining their pockets. However, what tends to be forgotten in the fuel debate is that oils and fossil fuels are a very finite resource. They are a resource we should be attempting to conserve, and the use of renewables in all their forms is a very good way of doing that. We can look at a range of measures in transport such as hybrid cars that allow us to conserve resources but, certainly, in the field of electricity generation there are many opportunities to use alternative types of generation of electricity, be it geothermal power, solar or wind. The use of alternatives is certainly tailorour made to a stationary type of operation such as power generation. Electricity prices in Australia are among the cheapest in the world. One of the challenges we face as a nation where we derive our competitive advantage from relatively cheap energy as opposed to other competitive advantages, such as cheap labour in other countries around the world, is: how do we maintain that competitive advantage against a backdrop of increasing our use of renewable energy? In virtually every case renewable energy comes at a significant cost penalty as compared to coalfired power stations, which can provide large amounts of baseload power at very reasonable prices. Look at electric cars, for instance. We see them as a solution to pollution and a way of reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. But where does the electricity come from? Electric cars are usually plugged into a socket, so once again we go back to dependence on fossil fuels and coalgenerated baseload power. For a society that is so heavily dependent on the finite resources of fossil fuels, it is only proper that we double our efforts to increase our use of renewable energy. In my electorate of Cowper, we have a range of businesses that use and specialise in renewable energy. But we certainly have a lot more work to do in that regard. China and India are often criticised for their carbon emissions. They produce 14.2 per cent and 30.1 per cent respectively of their total primary energy supply from renewable energy sources, as compared to a much lower level in Australia. We need a fundamental shift in our thinking as to how we source our energy needs, and this legislation goes a considerable way to moving down that path. I certainly commend the increased use of renewables in Australia. It is very important that we move down that path. We must reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and increase use of renewable energy. I commend this legislation to the House.",107
169,Mr BIDGOOD,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I rise to speak in strong support of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009. This legislation implements the expanded national renewable energy target scheme to deliver on the government's commitment to ensure that 20 per cent of Australia's electricity is supplied from renewable sources by 2020. The RET legislation package implements a key climate change election commitment, and we in the Rudd Labor government are in the business of delivering on election commitments. The Rudd Labor government is delivering for Dawson, and RETs will deliver jobs and investment to the seat and allow the building of electricity-generating infrastructure that is good for the environment. The passage of this legislation is essential to prosperity and jobs in my electorate of Dawson. The passage of this legislation is sought to provide renewable energy investors with legislative certainty-and we are delivering. One such investor is Mackay Sugar, who operate the Racecourse Sugar Mill in my electorate. Mackay Sugar have my full support for their proposed co-generation and ethanol plant. Mackay Sugar are ready, willing and able to commence construction of a 36 megawatt renewable biomass cogeneration plant in Mackay. This cannot occur without certainty around the 20 per cent RET legislation. This is an innovative, clean energy project that will deliver important benefits for North Queensland, the entire sugar industry and the environment. Mackay Sugar have indicated that, on the passage of this important piece of legislation, they will be ready to commence construction of their co-generation plant in Mackay. This represents real investment by business as a result of this legislation. Australia's largest sugar refinery is at the Mackay Sugar Racecourse Mill site. Sugar cane has a significant energy value and is well placed as a renewable energy source, as electricity is produced from a by-product of the sugar production process. Mackay Sugar's co-gen plant will only be the beginning for other co-generation plants in sugar mills throughout Queensland and New South Wales, if successful. Mackay Sugar produce around two million tonnes of bagasse each year, a by-product of the sugar-milling process. This has an energy value equivalent to 700,000 tonnes of coal. The difference is that bagasse is 100 per cent renewable biomass fuel. The bagasse will also eventually generate steam and electricity for a 60-megalitre green ethanol plant at the Racecourse Mill. This is exciting and it is great news for the region. This $112 million project will directly generate 270 construction jobs and, importantly, it will diversify the sugar industry for the future-an industry which peaks and troughs through world sugar prices, fluctuating exchange rates and fierce international competition. The Racecourse plant alone will power 33 per cent of Mackay's power requirements. Environmentally, emissions will be reduced by 200,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. Mackay Sugar have indicated to me that engineering, finance, relevant approvals and capital costs have all been basically finalised. This expansion will not only benefit Mackay Sugar's 950 canegrower shareholders, 540 permanent employees and 340 seasonal employees; it will also mean jobs, jobs, jobs and growth, growth, growth for the entire community. The industry has projected that cogeneration will supply up to 70 per cent of Far North Queensland households by 2016. In the north, around the Burdekin, Herbert and Townsville, they are talking about supplying greater capacity than is required for household consumption by 2016. The industry is even looking at supplying about 80 per cent of the estimated number of households around the Whitsunday and hinterland area and Mackay. This long-term projection can only be possible with the investment certainty this legislation provides. This large cogeneration plant is ready for construction, ready to go. The Labor government is ready to go too. While the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal and National parties are divided and still debating whether climate change even exists, the government stands ready to act for the economy, for the environment and for jobs. In conclusion, we are talking about real employment security for North Queensland. This legislation is about supporting the existing jobs in the sugar industry and generating new employment during project construction. More money in the sugar industry will have a flow-on effect for regional communities which are dependent on their local sugar industry. Millers, growers, harvesters, suppliers and contractors will all put money back into regional economies as a result of this. On behalf of people of Dawson, I wholeheartedly commend this legislation to the House.",108
170,Mr COULTON,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"In reference to the previous speaker, I suspect that the people of Dawson are also waiting with bated breath to see how the emissions trading scheme legislation goes in a couple of months time and where their representatives are going to vote on that and the negative impact that it is going to have on regional Australia. I feel a little uncomfortable in here debating the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009 while at the same time negotiations on amendments are taking place outside this room, so I will keep my comments to general terms because as of yet we have not seen the final shape of what agreement or otherwise may be made before we vote on the legislation. Under this scheme high energy users will be disadvantaged and energy will become very expensive, and I am hoping that, in discussions that are taking place on this legislation, they are looking at the effect on high electricity and high energy users. Aluminium is the standout industry that will be severely disadvantaged. In my electorate I have a town called Kandos and it is well known for cement. The people of Kandos will proudly tell you that the pylons of the Sydney Harbour Bridge are made of cement from Kandos. Cement is a high energy use and a high emitting industry, and one of the concerns I have if cement is not adequately taken into account is that that plant will close. In this place we speak about adjustments to employment and slight negative downturns or to things in quite clinical terms, but for the people of Kandos, if that plant closes, it is the major employer in town. It is not like Australia is going to be using any less cement; it is not like we are not going to be building roads, buildings or anything else that we use cement for. It just means that we have exported the jobs from Kandos to a country somewhere else that does not have restrictive legislation and higher charges. Just out of interest, Madam Deputy Speaker, in the proposed redistribution of electoral boundaries in New South Wales the Electoral Commission is putting the town of Kandos into the seat of Hunter. I think it would be very important for the member for Hunter, if he is intending to represent that area, to indiWhat cate to the people of Kandos whether he supports legislation that could lead to the closure of their plant. I do not want to be entirely negative in this. My electorate has great potential for alternative energy. Indeed, the western part of my electorate has been identified as being as good as anywhere in Australia for solar energy production. I know there are a couple of proposals in their early stages where communities are looking at putting a solar power station adjacent to the town, hopefully to become self-sufficient in electricity generation and even have a little surplus to put back into the grid. The town of Moree is even looking at solar powered desalination to clean up the water that goes through the mineral baths. They would use a combination of solar powered desalination and algae to clean up the water to enable it to be reused and not go into the Mehi River in its current form. As we are rushing headlong into a lot of this legislation, I believe there is great potential in something we have barely scratched the surface of. One of the things that I think is extremely exciting is algae. As I speak, there are three prototype plants going into the three largest power stations in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. The beauty of algae is that they are great sequesters of carbon. If you feed the emissions from a power station through algae and water, the algae thrive on the carbon dioxide, which despite being described in this place as a pollutant is actually the major building block of life. Algae grow at a rate of 20 per cent a day, doubling their mass every five days, so 20 per cent can be harvested every day and put through a centrifuge to get algae oil, which is essentially fish oil-that is what fish live on-which can then be further processed into biodiesel and can go into all sorts of power generation or motor vehicle fuel. is left, the biomass, is a very high protein stock feed. It could be used in human food consumption or even, if it is co-located with a power station, put back into the power station to provide fuel. We should be careful that we do not tax our industries to such an extent that they do not have the ability to invest in and look at lot of these alternatives. Some months ago I travelled to Townsville and went to James Cook University and met with Professor Rocky de Nys, who started working with algae and looking at algae as a fish food. The more algae is studied, the more the potential it has for biofuel production has been realised. As a country, as we look at our responsibility to feed the world-we feed not only the 20 million people who live in Australia but also 70 million people around the world-and as we have to balance up agricultural production, biofuel production and renewable energy, algae is going to have a major part to play in our future. Although I think we need to be encouraging renewable energy, we need to recognise that we have only taken baby steps so far. The potential in a range of things is enormous, but we are only just at the beginning of this journey. I will support this bill, for what we know about it. I think this is highly irregular and I would like to place on record that I believe-and I know that these decisions are made by people who have been here longer than I-it is highly irregular to be debating a bill when the amendments and agreements between the two major sides of the House are still under negotiation. With that caveat I support this bill.",109
171,Mr CHEESEMAN,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I rise today to speak primarily on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and cognate bill. I believe this historic moment and a great opportunity for my region and for south-west Victoria. My electorate of Corangamite and south-west Victoria are uniquely placed. Running right through the middle of my electorate and south-west Victoria is an extremely well understood wind corridor. Flanked by the Otway Ranges to the south and by the northern plains to the north-west, this unique geograa phy creates a substantial wind corridor which has been measured by numerous scientists. This wind corridor also overlays a major arm of Victoria's power grid. Because of this situation, there is around $7 billion worth of investment in wind projects right across south-west Victoria that either have received approval or are awaiting approval. Once this legislation has been passed, as I suspect it will, I believe this level of investment will grow further because of the geographic circumstances that exist and also, importantly, because of the power grid. I will be convening a meeting of the wind sector within my electorate in the not-toodistant future to talk about the opportunities that do exist and to point out the opportunities that will exist if this legislation is passed. Right now, there is the potential for the creation of about 2,000 construction jobs and many hundreds of ongoing jobs once this legislation is passed. But, importantly, this legislation also plays a significant role in addressing the great moral challenge of our generation-that is, climate change. I believe that the broader Geelong region and south-west Victoria can play a leading role in capturing green jobs because of our unique set of circumstances. Not only do we have a greater opportunity to play a substantial role in the generation of wind energy but also, because of our geographic setting, we have a massive opportunity to capture geothermal energy, ocean energy and a number is a of other renewable energy opportunities throughout the south-west of Victoria. I note that when Germany reinforced its renewable energy laws between 2004 and 2006 it was able to increase its renewable energy workforce from 160,000 to over 236,000 people. This legislation is not just about creating jobs but also about addressing the great risk of climate change. As I have said in the past, Victoria has very high carbon emissions proportionally and this legislation will go some way to addressing those circumstances. I believe we have a very clear moral obligation to pass this legislation-to start our contribution not only to tackling climate change but also to creating an investment opportunity within our region that can create thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of ongoing jobs. There are many places across south-west Victoria where it would be inappropriate to put wind turbines, but there are many places where there are very strong opportunities to invest in a way that will not only create jobs and reduce our carbon foot print but also provide an alternative income source to the landholders within my region. As I mentioned earlier, I will be holding a high-level forum in the not-too-distant future at which industry stakeholders, state government representatives and I will continue to explore opportunities for wind energy within my region to ensure that we are working closely to enable us to be able to deliver this investment to my region. I believe we have a moral obligation to lead. I believe this parliament will do that by passing this legislation, and I commend the bill to the House.",111
172,Mr SECKER,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I want to first back up the thoughts of the member for Parkes, who talked about algae as one of the future possibilities. In fact, I can relate story. In my electorate there is a small village-although you could hardly call it that-called Salt Creek, and it is along the Coorong. I think that many people in this chamber would know a fair bit about the Coorong. The fact is that there was a black oily substance that they thought was oil. They put down a drill to find more of this oil and found that in fact it was algae. There is huge potential to use that resource. It has been around for a long time and I think we need to do a lot more research into it and make it a commercial possibility. It may interest members of this chamber to know that I have been using renewable energy basically all my life. I live on a farm and we have heaps of windmills. It is just a normal part of our life. It is virtually impossible to get power out to many remote parts of the farm, so we use windmills. I may not have been fixing up windmills at three or four years of age, but I think I was climbing them-which you did as a young person on a farm. Of course, they have been supplying energy for probably centuries and they are quite a good form of power. The coalition's vision for a clean energy economy supports the potential of emerging technologies such as tidal, hydrogen cell, geothermal and wave, and it is a vision that I share. These technologies should have and deserve a portion of the renewable energy target reserved towards a clean energy future for Australia. It would be of concern if this legislation were to mean just more windmills or more turbines and did not include these other technologies that can produce reasonably efficient baseload power. It would be of great concern if this legislation, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009, were to lead to increased demand for coal and wind power at the expense of gas generation, for a example, which is much cleaner than coal. It seems to me that this legislation does nothing to stop that happening. In fact, it is quite unusual to be debating a bill in parliament when we actually do not know what the end results are going to be. This is the first time, apart from when we had the CPRS legislation last week, that I have been in a situation where I do not know the final outcome or the regulations, and we have just got to trust that it is all going to happen. I know from our experience with MRET that it seemed to produce only wind power generation, which unfortunately produces only intermittent, expensive energy-albeit at some benefit to parts of my electorate. Clean energy is fundamental in reducing Australia's net emissions and providing jobs in rural Australia, including in my electorate of Barker. Renewable clean energy is a positive step towards our goal of reducing net emissions. Renewable energy is energy generated from natural resources-such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, wave and geothermal heat-which are renewable, meaning that they are naturally replenished. In my electorate of Barker we have three promising projects which are working towards our vision for a clean energy economy. Of course, unlike the previous speaker, I do not claim to be having a ‘high level forum' on the idea. These sorts of things are happening without politicians actually saying that they should happen. The projects are: an established wind farm in Millicent; a proposed site for wave power around Port MACDonnell, which is just below Mount Gambier; and a site in Penola, and also around Millicent, where drilling has commenced for geothermal energy. Wind power is the conversion of wind energy into a useful form of energy, such as electricity, using wind turbines. Millicent, situated in the south-east of my electorate, is home to the largest wind farm development in the southern hemisphere. The site cost $92.5 million and it hosts 23 turbines capable of generating approximately 46 megawatts of electricity. This is enough electricity to provide the power needs of around 30,000 homes. Each turbine blade spans 39 metres, making them some of the largest installed in Australia. Electricity from this wind farm is produced up to 34 per cent of the time. That is the weakness of wind energy: for two-thirds of the time it will not produce energy. Thirty-four per cent is actually a high yield by global standards, but it is still not a baseload that can be relied upon for all of our needs. The wind farm created hundreds of jobs during its installation period, and it continues to provide some jobs into the future. Geothermal technology is an emerging renewable energy technology that uses heat from the earth's crust. This is a far more exciting area of renewable energy because it can provide a baseload that will be there for some time to come. It is designed to run continuously, which makes it a reliable source of clean energy. Geothermal is an important renewable energy resource and should be reserved as an emerging renewable energy technology by the government. Drilling has commenced for geothermal purposes 40 kilometres north of Mount Gambier in my electorate, in the Penola Trough. The Penola Trough forms part of the Otway Basin, a rift basin which was initiated during the Cretaceous period on the now southern margin of the Australian mainland. It is an exciting project that is helping our country move towards a clean energy future. Wave energy is a renewable energy resource created by large storms hundreds of kilometres offshore. These storms generate and transmit huge amounts of energy, which travels great distances via swell and mixes with local influences in the seas to arrive at our shores. It is a genuinely renewable energy source, distinct from tidal energyalthough I do support tidal energy. The World Energy Council has estimated that approximately two terawatts-that is, two million megawatts, about double the current world electricity production-could be produced from the oceans via wave power. It is estimated that one million gigawatt hours of wave energy hits Australian shores annually. Wave technology can operate efficiently in swell in the oneto twometre wave height range, greatly increasing the number of potential baseload sites globally. For example, much of southern Australia receives significant wave heights, in excess of one metre, 100 per cent of the time. Port MACDonnell, situated in my electorate, has been earmarked for a wave power site with a 99 per cent available wave resource at the site, the second highest percentile wave resource site in Australia. The other beauty of wave energy is that, being based in sea water, it can provide clean energy to desalinated sea water-instead of using the high powered consumption models which are now in use in Australia and planned for the future and which use power that is generated mostly by coal or gas. All three projects boost our clean energy future, and I fully support them and am proud to have them occurring in my electorate of Barker. Hydrogen cell generation does not seem to be part of this government's priorities but it is a useful addition to alternative fuel emissions are basically steam. And, of course, the government continues to keep its head in the sand on nuclear power. It is quite happy to export uranium to other countries, where they can reduce emissions; but it is not prepared to have the vision or the strength to even contemplate nuclear power in Australia, even though it has been proven to be a safe and reliable baseload power. I support our vision of a clean energy economy and encourage the inclusion of these renewable energy technologies in the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009. And it would be nice to actually find out what is going to be there.",112
173,Mr IRONS,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"It was interesting to hear the member for Barker give his contribution. I just had to check my speech, because there were a few similarities there-he and I are on the same wavelength. Today I was reading through a submission made by Ross Macmillan to the WA Greenhouse Task Force back in 2003. In that submission was the statement: … as long as our primary energy sources are fossil fuel based, all our best efforts to reduce consumption will not deliver a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and will have a negative economic impact. I could not agree more with this statement. The only way we are going to seriously reduce carbon emissions is by finding alternative energy sources to coal and oil. Looking for efficiencies will only get us so far. It is in this spirit that I rise this evening to speak on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009. I am a keen supporter of renewable energy. I believe in a clean energy economy and I want to see Western Australia as an Australian and a world renewable energy hub. I will declare from the outset that I am a shareholder in the renewable energy industryand its because I believe it is the future. The renewable energy target we are debating today comes from an excellent piece of legislation that has its origins in a speech by John Howard in 1997. It carries the support of just about every member of the House, and I look forward to it being implemented. As environmental legislation usually involves long-term targets, it is imperative that there is broad support from all sides of the chamber. I am of course pleased to see that the government is likely to decouple the bills in the Senate, after calls from every other non-Labor party and most newspapers to do so. However, let us not look back but forward. The government is likely to decouple the legislation, and the bills are, subject to some amendments articulated by the environment minister, good bills. The legislation is, of course, designed to ensure that electricity retailers and other large electricity buyers are legally required to source a certain percentage of their electricity from renewable sources. The bills set a new renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020. The initial Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 legislated for 10 per cent by 2010. In other words, this legislation progressively increases the 9,500 gigawatt hour annual mandatory renewable energy target to 45,000 gigawatt hours by 2020. The scheme works through the generation of renewable energy certificates, or RECs, from renewable energy sources in excess of a 1997 baseline level. One REC equals one megawatt hour of renewable energy power. At the excellent renewable energy forum held by the coalition environment and water committee last week, Mr Dave Holland of Solar Systems Pty Ltd spoke about how difficult it is for solar companies to get one of only a few government funding contracts. Some companies have given up because of the time and effort required with little chance of success. The solar industry does not need complicated government red tape; it simply needs a little nudge here and a nudge there to become competitive. It is disappointing that there are very few or no solar projects starting up in Australia currently yet hundreds are scheduled for the US, where there is much less red tape. I support the amendments that the coalition is putting forward on this bill, in particuserves. lar the amendment to move that a portion of the RET be banded and reserved for emerging renewable technologies such as industrial-scale solar, geothermal, wave, tidal and biomass. Western Australia is full of geothermal potential and-with respect to the member for O'Connor-I can say that I am a strong supporter of geothermal energy as the renewable source of our future power needs. Geothermal energy is the only natural renewable energy source that does not originate in the sun. I have personally had involvement with geothermal technology since the late eighties or early nineties in my industry, which was the air-conditioning industry. The company I worked for actually tried to introduce geothermal air-conditioning in Australia back in the early nineties. But it was not seen as a competitive alternative. It was very expensive to install, the capital equipment was quite expensive and, at that stage, the costs of energy in Australia were quite low, so it was easier for companies or building owners to find ways other than looking at geothermal technology. So it is great to see that it is coming back into vogue. All we need to do is develop extraction methods that are globally applicable and we will have a virtually unlimited, continuous, reliable, emissionsfree energy source available to any nation on earth. Hot-rock energy is of particular interest to Perth, with the Perth Basin providing a significant resource. The technology works by pumping water deep into the rock for heat transfer. According to the Australian Geothermal Energy Association, approximately five to 15 per cent of the total energy achieved is used to pump this water into the rock. The submission I have been reading estimates that the energy content in one lease is equivalent to 50 billion barrels of oil, about 20 times Australia's known oil reIt also estimates that there is enough thermal energy contained in hot rock at depths of less than five kilometres below the surface in Australia to meet our present energy needs for 7,000 years. Hopefully, this bill will encourage energy generators to look into this technology in more detail. With the right government investment, Australia could quickly become a world leader in this technology. At the recent coalition renewable energy forum, we heard from the Australian Geothermal Energy Association of the great possibilities of this technology but also of the great capital expense involved in establishing it. Often a proof of concept will cost up to $30 million, yet the government only has $7 million on offer, which again is difficult to get hold of. We can do better than this. In the absence of finance, the geothermal industry in Australia is working with universities. UWA have just been given the rights to start WA's first geothermal project, which will attempt to harness the geothermal energy below Perth for modern-day energy needs. A geothermal Perth could form the cornerstone of WA's renewable energy hub. Geothermal is not Western Australia's only renewable option. WA is the sunshine capital of Australia. Wind patterns are almost perfect south of Jurien Bay, and the member for O'Connor has spoken at length about the potential of the second most tidal region in the world up in Derby. There are certainly some exciting wave power developments as well, with one company in Western Australia proposing to set up the world's first baseload wave power electricity generation and desalination plant. It is currently running a program in Fremantle called CETO. Wave energy is a renewable energy resource created by large storms hundreds of kilometres offshore, which generate and transmit huge amounts of energy that travels great distances via swell and mixes with local influences, seas, to arrive at our shores. It is a genuine renewable energy source and distinct from tidal energy. Wave energy is generally considered to be the most concentrated and least variable form of renewable energy. The high power density of wave energy suggests that it has the capacity to become the lowest cost renewable energy source. The World Energy Council has estimated that approximately two terawatts, two million megawatts, which is about double the current world electricity production, could be produced from the oceans via wave power. It is estimated that one million gigawatt hours of wave energy hit Australian shores annually and that 25 per cent of the UK's current power usage could be supplied by harvesting its wave resource. In conclusion, I support a 20 per cent renewable energy target by 2020. This is a positive statement by the whole parliament of a commitment to renewable energy, which would be our focus, and it is certainly mine. I support Western Australia as an Australian and a world renewable energy hub. If our focus as a nation were more towards renewable energy, maybe we would not have to worry about an ETS.",114
174,Dr JENSEN,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I rise to support the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and related bill, albeit with some small misgivings, which I will get on to a little bit later. Clearly, it is advisable to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, not only due to the fact that they are non-renewable but also due to emissions of all sorts. This House will know that I am not particularly concerned about the carbon dipilot oxide aspect; however, I am very concerned about sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxide and particulates, which are significant emissions from fossil fuel power stations and fossil fuels more generally. They clearly have significant adverse health effects. My concern with this bill is that the way that renewables are viewed is fairly prescriptive and tight and that, in particular, issues such as substitution are inadequately addressed. For example, the member for Barker was talking about the potential for using wave power to directly desalinate water. This is a substitution for electricity but it is actually not included in the ‘20 per cent renewable' which is put forward in this bill. Additionally, we need to realise that there are problems associated with many, if not most, forms of renewable energy at present. For example, if significant portions of the electricity grid have wind generated power then you have grid instability. In fact, in 2006 all of Europe went down for half an hour. The half-hour blackout was the result of problems with a wind farm in Germany which, due to the total instability in the system, propagated through the system. Additionally, you cannot generate solar power when the sun does not shine. Proponents of these forms of electricity generation will argue not only are these forms of generation capable of providing baseload power but they are capable of providing it economically, yet when you speak to many of these proponents privately they will acknowledge that they are not capable at present of providing baseload power and, in terms of the power supply more generally, in order to be economically viable they are reliant on government legislation which benefits their industry. As well, one of my concerns is the issue of increased costs associated with the proportion of 20 per cent renewable for our electricity. It would be a very good idea to put an increased amount of research and development money into renewable energy. We need to be very careful about betting on winners, however. Historically, we have seen so many times with scientific advances that the winners are not where we perceive them to be. Indeed, in the 1950s there was a chance for Australia to get to the forefront of the solid-state electronics industry; however, the assessment in Australia at the time was that newfangled transistors and so on did not have a future and the world was going to be reliant on valves. You do not see too many valves made these days. What about other generation methods? The current reality in the Australian context-and here I will ignore hydro because for both environmental and resource reasons more hydro in Australia is highly unlikelyis that the only methods at present that can generate baseload power are coal and gas. My question to members opposite is: an awful lot is being bet on geosequestration; what if geosequestration does not work as advertised? It has not been completely proved in terms of the entire system anywhere in the world, and all we need is something like a Lake Nyos situation with a burp of carbon dioxide killing multiple people. That sort of situation would very quickly put the geosethat questration argument to bed. Can we be sure how stable that resource would be, given that we have drilled in there and formed a plug, if, for instance, you had an earthquake? Given that, the only other low-carbon or no-carbon technology you have that is capable of generating baseload power is nuclear power. It is rather interesting that one of the methods of generating renewable power that is being considered and potentially could generate baseload power is hot-rock technology. The interesting point is that hot-rock technology is, in fact, nuclear technology; the reason those rocks are hot is the radioactive decay of uranium in those ores. It is interesting that the government will not consider nuclear power at all, particularly given their statement that this is the great moral and ethical imperative of our age. If it is such a great imperative, you would think that everything would be considered to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. But nuclear is not to be considered. If nuclear is so terrible and so dangerous, why are we exporting uranium? Isn't that gravely irresponsible? Another thing we should be talking about is putting money into research and development. We need to look at putting money into generation IV reactors, which have significant advantages over conventional reactors because not only, in many cases, can those reactors use the uranium resource for 50 to 60 times longer than conventional reactors but they can also use depleted fuel from conventional reactors as the fuel for these reactors, and the waste form that you are left with is literally safe to handle with your hands in a period of 300 years. Another technology that we should invest in-and this would even be for people who are somewhat paranoid about fission power-is nuclear fusion. At present there is a great international program called ITERit stands for International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor-in France. It is one of the largest scientific projects in the world. In effect, it is a preproduction fusion prototype. This is a very clean energy resource, and I think it is foolhardy for Australia be involved at the ground level. If we are not one of the major program partners we should certainly be one of the subpartners in the project, because Australia is one of the world's energy superpowers in terms of nuclear energy, be it fission or fusion. You talk about uranium; you can talk about thorium and, indeed, about lithium. Western Australia has one of the largest resources of lithium in the world. We should be looking at becoming more energy independent, and getting involved in these sorts of areas would certainly make us more energy independent. I will leave this debate by saying that if the government believes in the moral and ethical imperative that is reducing carbon emissions, they really should be considering nuclear energy. Certainly they should be investing in fusion energy even if they do not believe in fission energy. Having said that, I support this bill, albeit with the reservations that I have mentioned.",116
175,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I rise this evening to speak on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009. I welcome the government's commitment, firstly to decouple this bill from the flawed emissions trading scheme legislation and, secondly, to a renewable energy target of 20 per cent of electricity supply by 2020. Of course, it is a long time coming. The Rudd government promised this legislation back in 2007 and now, more than 18 months later, we are finally debating it in this House. Clean energy can create jobs in rural Australia, and this is no more obvious than in my own electorate of Maranoa. Maranoa has the potential to become one of the nation's powerhouses for renewable energy. My vast electorate spans an area from Poeppel Corner in the west to about an hour and a half's drive not to from Noosa on the Sunshine Coast of Queensland in the east. We are witnessing exciting developments in solar, wind and algal technology in the electorate, and the fledgling but fast and furious development of the Surat coal basin has provided many opportunities for resource companies to implement planet-friendly measures to decrease their carbon footprint. One such exciting opportunity for the resource companies based in Maranoa is the utilisation of algal energy. On the eastern edge of my electorate, at a major coal-fired power station, a leading energy company will be establishing a test plant to convert carbon to energy by using algae. This incredible process involves the capturing of carbon emissions at the base of the emissions chimney before they can be sent out into the atmosphere. The CO2 gases are then transferred to an algal farm, and through the process of photosynthesis the algae will consume the carbon. Amazingly, the algae have the capacity to consume twice their weight in carbon in just 24 hours. At the end of this process, two products are created. One is algal oil, which can be used for plastics, biodiesel or fuel such as jet fuel. The other product is an edible algal product or meal, which can be used as feedstock, fertiliser or biomass for electricity production and bioplastics. I support the money that has gone into research, particularly at James Cook University, into the further development of this technology. Nearby that soon-to-be-built test plant in my electorate there are plans by another company to build a wind farm-the Coopers Gap wind farm. This wind farm will see 252 turbines built and have the capacity to power approximately 320,000 homes. At the other end of my electorate in Windorah, which has a population of just 150, that community in the Barcoo Shire can boast its very own solar farm. In fact, it is the solar farm that the Prime Minister visited with the Premier of Queensland a few months ago to talk about the renewable energy target. The five solar dishes there are expected to save 300 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the town's reliance on diesel power. The project, which is funded and driven by Ergon Energy, has been wholeheartedly welcomed by the town. In the outback of my electorate and in many parts of outback Australia there is an abundance of sunshine and there is no concern about the sun not shining most days. In fact, there is not enough rain. The challenge of course of putting solar farms in the outback is the transmission of that power to the market. I will talk a little more about that later. Just outside my electorate of Maranoa off the Birdsville Track is Innamincka, in South Australia's north. It is home to a hot rocks energy project, established by the company Geodynamics, which had support from the Howard government for their research and development of hot rocks power generation. Aside from the world's volcanic region, the Cooper Basin, which stretches from South Australia and back into my electorate of Maranoa, has the hottest rocks in the world. the potential for hot rocks energy is not ex- tralia. clusive to the Cooper Basin. There are other areas across rural Australia, in South Australia and the Flinders Ranges, and near my own hometown of Roma, which offer the same potential and favourable conditions for the generation of power from hot rocks. The harvesting of energy from these hot rocks, which lie about three kilometres below the surface, is quite simple. The heat is trapped between the age-old rocks and by circulating water through them the heat can be extracted which can then be converted into electricity. Hot rocks are a truly renewable, zero emission, baseload energy source. They do not rely on the sun, the wind or the tides. They are a renewable, baseload energy source that is able to provide huge amounts of power. Hot rocks technology has the capacity to fully replace fossil fuels and the potential to meet all of Australia's electricity requirements for centuries to come. According to Geodynamics, one cubic kilometre of hot granite at 250 degrees centigrade has the stored energy equivalent of 40 million barrels of oil. The potential for geothermal energy is vast and, according to Geodynamics, could be used for concrete curing, milk pasteurisation, wool processing and the preheating of water for coal-fired power stations. The challenge, of course, is that these energy sources are located a long way from the large consumer markets in our capital cities. I think one of the technologies that we will see more of in the near future is highvoltage, direct current, HVDC powerlines, both underground and above ground. They have the capacity to bring this power from the remote parts of Australia to the larger consumer markets with a limited loss of energy. That is another thing that we must talk about in the future if we are to truly realise the potential of solar and, in particular, in this case, hot rocks producing electricity for But the clean, green energy market across AusFor those living in rural Australia, there nothing new about harnessing the energy from the earth's natural heat. Geothermal energy is the same resource responsible for warm artesian baths and warm artesian bore water. Birdsville, in my electorate, is home to a geothermal power station that harnesses the energy from the hot water taken from the Great Artesian Basin. It is doing it tonight as we speak in this House. The power station provides approximately 30 per cent of the town's electricity needs, reduces diesel consumption by about 130,000 litres per year and abates 390 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year. This is just another example of the role rural and remote Australia is cast to play in Australia's renewable energy future. Madam Deputy Speaker Saffin, I am sure you will appreciate that the only thing Maranoa will not be able to offer is tidal energy-perhaps in your electorate that will be possible. Maranoa is landlocked, so it will not happen there. I know the member for Bowman, who is in the chamber, would understand that. While this bill is about renewable energy, I just want to put on the record some exciting developments in clean coal technology in my electorate of Maranoa. Whilst coal is of course not renewable, this technology provides enormous potential to reduce our carbon footprint and implement various new technologies. That is why I particularly support the opposition's amendments, and the one in particular which calls for the inclusion of renewable gas or waste coalmine gas as a recognised zero emissions source of energy. The Liberal-National coalition introduced the nation's first mandatory renewable energy target. When in government, we also committed to a 15 per cent clean energy target and former Prime Minister John Howard indicated support for a 20 per cent target. We must continue to hold some healthy scepticism about the Labor government's is alleged green credentials. This Labor government promised that they would not means-test the $8,000 solar rebate, which the coalition introduced. But on budget day last year, what did they do? They introduced a means test. Then this year in June, without any warning, they prematurely abolished it, leaving many people in my electorate furious at the Rudd government. When they were still getting their paperwork done and getting contractors together, they were told they had just eight hours to lodge their application. The Rudd government also abolished without warning the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program. This program allowed families, businesses and not-forprofit organisations that relied on diesel electricity to install solar or wind units. In June this year, just weeks after scrapping the $8,000 solar rebate without notice, they abolished this program, leaving many rural families and solar businesses in the lurch. Of course, we cannot be surprised about the actions of the Rudd Labor government-all spin and no substance. They have also linked this legislation to the flawed ETS. That was a callous move and what they were trying to do when they did that was to make the opposition look unfriendly about doing something about renewable energy. However, the amendments that we are putting forward are reasonable and responsible, and recognise some of the areas that this Labor government have failed to look at. It is shoddy legislation. We want these amendments put forward. Our shadow minister has addressed the amendments, and I fully support those particular four amendments. I certainly want to make sure that this Prime Minister and this Labor government take a much smarter approach, and by taking a smarter approach it will be a bipartisan approach. However, from this side of the House, we support renewable energy targets and we want to make sure, with these amendments, we have a much smarter approach to reducing our carbon footprint. We did not support the ETS because it was not a smart approach. The Prime Minister and his Minister for Climate Change and Water should be breathing a sigh of relief that the non-government senators, after we were unable to stop it in this House because we do not have the numbers-have given them a chance to go back to the drawing board. I support our amendments. I support this bill and I look forward to the government support for our amendments in the passage of this legislation.",118
176,Mr LAMING,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"Bowman) (7.30 pm)What a refreshing debate we have enjoyed today by effectively decoupling the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009 and cognate bill from the ETS. To my National Party colleague from Maranoa, it is wonderful to hear the support that we have from Queensland's largest seat for this legislation. Coming from a relatively tiny outer metropolitan seat, I would wish to echo his views. Some have said that Bowman is the only seat in Australia that doubles in size at low tide. You are quite right: we have a deep and abiding passion for the potential for tidal and also ocean current technology. That is all ahead of us, and it is an exciting future. I congratulate the government for finally taking that important step of decoupling this legislation. The government has also effectively revealed the enthusiasm for renewable energy on both sides of this House. Our country can only benefit from that. I do not think that now is the appropriate time to go through the history of the struggles we have had with the ETS legislation, except to say it is probably also a good time now to move on from the 2007 notion that you are either a denier or a believer, that ther you are a sceptic that needs to be shunned or you are evangelical about some sort of greater issue than any on the planet, that of emissions trading. It is a part of planning for the future of Australia and we are far better to be pulling together the diverse and disparate views in Australia. We know they exist all around the world, and I would be concerned about a political party that did not have those diverse views within it. We are effectively debating the key issues that will determine the success of our tradeable goods, the success of Australia as an economy and our ability as Australians to preserve the quality of life we enjoy now. The emissions trading system can potentially impact that. This small piece of legislation that has been decoupled today is very important because industry have been telling us that this is where they want to go. They need such a target to have the certainty to invest, and I think that is why you have seen the support from both sides of the House being so strong. So often in the Westminster parliamentary system you try to protect the government from its own pigheadedness. We have seen a little bit of that today where there was a reluctance to consider very constructive amendments that were put forward by our shadow minister. I am pleased to say that there has been some ground given and, particularly and certainly for the member for Maranoa who may or may not have realised it, that the waste coalmine gas issue being recognised as a zero emission source of power really had to be included in this legislation. I am very glad that that has occurred. What has been potentially a bridge too far has been the issue of banding. In a recent shadow policy discussion of renewable energy producers the clear message was that is an important move forward to ensure the future of renewable technology. This bill needs to recognise that banding can play a eivery important role in protecting about a quarter of those gigawatt hours for emerging technologies that are not yet ready to take advantage of this legislation. There is a range of those, from geothermal right across to large solar plants, that may not be quite ready yet to take advantage of this legislation. What we have, though, right now is a very murky and somewhat unhappy triad of stumbles by this government around solar energy that prefaces the debate that we are having tonight. We do not need to trawl through the history of budget night when there were decisions and announcements made that effectively betrayed industry. On 9 June, it effectively summarily cut off the opportunity for those renewable incentives for solar providers. Then we saw it again with the remote renewable program on 22 June. These three hits to the sector, I think it is worth mentioncollected ing, have somewhat shaken the solar sector's confidence in the government to be able to make the long-term decisions that provide some certainty. I am not going to stand here and convince everyone that the old economic incentives stacked up, nor that it was necessarily something that could have been ignored but what we really needed to do was give business more certainty than the government provided. All I can say to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change is that he should take some lesson from the economic stability that was provided by this side of the House when in government and learn from that that by giving business certainty we can allow them to plan ahead, they can look forward and they can make the decisions that in the end are going to be right for the consumer. Please do not use small business-in fact, do not use business in general-as something that can be kicked around when rules change and the carpet pulled from under them simply because you can. We know the government can, but try to find a way to give as much certainty as possible to some of these very, very small providers who have faith and who have placed their trust in government that the decisions they make will be there for some time. If government does have to change policy-obviously decisions do and policies have to change-give small business some chance to react rather than what occurred in my electorate and in many others on this side of the House. We had people who had effectively placed deposits and ordered solar equipment ready for installation but had not necessarily got to the point where they could be guaranteed of getting the rebate. That was tragic. Families were running around trying to contact the father who was off at work and who could not sign on the dotted line with solar companies which had all of these bonds and deposits yet were unable to fulfil contracts. That was an ugly piece of federal government undermining of the work of small businesses right around this country-businesses which in the end were only responding to government incentives to implement renewable energy. That was an act of faith that I think was somewhat betrayed by this government. I am glad to see that there has been some concession, again following the decoupling, with the waste coalmine gas, but I would urge the government once again to consider this very important banding issue so a quarter of those gigawatt hours can be protected for the renewable technologies we know are only years away but cannot yet benefit. I would urge the government to give this issue further consideration. But, nonetheless, let us not forget that today has been, after months and months of somewhat disappointing polarisation around the issue of the ETS, a small moment where there has been relative agreement on this vital transition. We are seeing the move where technology may well find us the solutions to this very important area of global emissions. Australia is playing its role-in fact, more than that. Australia is gifted politically, with our location, our weather, our coastline, our tides and our rivers, not only to make a massive contribution but to be able to provide and deliver renewable and clean power at potentially a fraction of the cost at which other continents can do so. That can set Australia up, but what we will need to get there is not only this legislation but, I think, a full consideration of emissions assent. trading, not a dogmatic, pig-headed approach that no idea can be improved. We need a government that will be responsive and that can work cooperatively not only with the whole country but particularly with those who are working in the sector who are coming forward with great technology-to name one, the Better Place initiative, which has just recently signed the electric car agreement with the ACT government, the third jurisdiction that will be considering plug-in options for electric vehicles worldwide. An organisation and an initiative like Better Place relies on certainty, stability and predictability, not a policy that shifts and changes with political fortunes or the immediacies of daily political life, where suddenly a program is changed and business has to pay the price. We need to be encouraging the world to see Australia as a stable platform for renewable technology. The first step, I believe, will be taken tonight. It is great to see support on both sides of the chamber, and I look forward to the next step: finding a solution to global emissions that also has the support of both sides of this chamber, that works to protect Australian interests, that prevents the export of jobs and the leakage of carbon-a solution that finds Australia as a member of the lead pack of global economies which crafts and delivers a solution to this most pressing of global challenges.",121
177,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"The word ‘coupling' applied to bills-the RET bill and the CPRS Bill-has geo- become the jargon of the day. What did the coupling really mean? How was it done? Basically, it is in the legislation that the RET bill will become law only when the CPRS Bill is passed. So, in order to allow the RET bill-the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009-to stand alone, it is probably necessary to have an amendment that says that the bill will become law upon But what does that, in effect, do? It still means that the provisions that are in the CPRS Bill-the so-called carbon pollution reduction bill-that give relief to electricityintensive trade-exposed industries are contained in the second bill. So it is perfectly open to us to argue, in fact, that the bills are not truly decoupled-they are only partially decoupled-because the impact on those industries will be that they will be obliged to pay for 20 per cent of their electricity from renewable sources at the higher rate. Those of you who receive your electricity bill now will probably find-certainly in New South Wales-that there is an option for you to pay 10 per cent more for your electricity on the basis that that is coming from renewable sources. The effect of the bill will be to turn that voluntary payment of additional money for your electricity into a compulsory payment for your electricity. For industry, it means that they too will be paying an increased amount of money for their electricity, because that part of the plan to give them relief from that increased cost is contained in the other bill. So the question is: will we see amendments come forth from the government which say that they will take that part of the CPRS Bill that contains the relief for the electricity-intensive trade-exposed industries and place it in the RET bill, thereby making it a stand-alone package, or will they continue with the fiction that they have decoupled the bills wholly when all they are doing is changing the date on which they shall become law? I think we are entitled to know that, and I think we are entitled to know it as this debate is progressing, but all we have at the moment is the statement that we have decoupled the bills. The people who are really hurting and who come to people like me as their local members-they have done so in quite considerable numbers-are the people who plead for the passage of this become law because it also contains the provisions that will pay the subsidy for the installation of solar panels. Under the previous government, the Howard government, we had put in place a scheme where you got an $8,000 subsidy, and John Howard said that that scheme would be uncapped-in other words, it would go on indefinitely. So individuals who wanted to use solar panels and source their electricity from an alternative renewable source could do so. But virtually overnight that scheme was cut off, the reason being that it was just too successful; more people were taking it up and the amount of money that had been allocated for that program had been used. So, instead of allowing it to be an uncapped scheme as we had said, this government, which says it is all in favour of alternative and renewable energy sources, cut off the program, and it said, ‘But don't worry about that; we've got another “you beaut” scheme coming in, and you'll get, basically, $4,000 a time.' Well, the poor installation people have been waiting and waiting. They have been paying the staff, their individual employees. They have been trying to keep their businesses together. There have been virtually no solar panel installations sold into this market for months, and they are at breaking point. When one reads a letter from a constituent that says, ‘Please let this bill have passage that we can start our business operating again,' one feels an enormous amount for these small business people. They are being punished by a piece of politicising by the government, which is trying to say, ‘If you want these people to have the subsidy paid for them and their businesses to continue and the people they employ to have jobs then you have to also pass the hugely flawed CPRS Bill.' It of course brings in the new green tax, or whatever other name you like to call it, and makes Australia uncompetitive in so bill and for it to many areas. I hear a lot said about the term ‘certainty'-‘We have to have these bills because business wants certainty.' I thought agriculture was a business too. There is absolutely no certainty for them because in that CPRS Bill it says, ‘Agriculture will come into the scheme in 2013 and we will know all about it by 2015.' If that is certainty then I think we must be using a different dictionary from the one used by the government. What about those people who, again in the name of certainty, look at the future trade in derivatives that come from carbon trading and see that they can make a fortune. It will be the next big thing-out with credit default swaps and CDOs and in with derivatives from carbon trading. Perhaps certainty for them is something that is not deserved. Perhaps certainty for people like farmers and small business owners is what is indeed required. We are very keen to see the RET bill passed because we want certainty for those small businesses that are currently being forced to the extent that they may well have to fold. We want their businesses to be able to continue. We want the people they employ to have jobs. So I would simply put it to the government that we need some certainty too. We want to see what the nature of the proposed amendments of the government are. We want to see whether not the provisions so that are contained within the CPRS Bill are going to be translated into the RET bill so that we can see that the aluminium industry, the cement industry and so on are being granted the exemptions they need. There is an interesting quote in an excellent article written by John Kerin and Adrian Rollins in the Financial Review today. It said: Australian Aluminium Council executive director Miles Prosser said Ms Wong's less generous interim assistance arrangements only made it more certain that aluminium producers would face higher costs than overseas competitors. He said the RET scheme as proposed by the government would impose costs of $700 million over the next decade on smelters in Gladstone, the Hunter Valley, Portland, Geelong and Bell Bay, while the CPRS as currently proposed would add another $3.3 billion. I think this debate has a long, long way to go. Whereas I hear a lot of people say that we must give the benefit of the doubt to the planet, I say we have to give the benefit of the doubt to the Australian people. What we have to do in this place is find out what is in the interests of the Australian people and make sure the laws that we pass do not in fact push wages down, push the cost of living up and push the standard of living down as well, all in the name of trying to reduce our emissions, which contribute just over one per cent of the world's emissions. I think we should look at ways in which we could help the people in China and India, where it has been shown by people who associate themselves with the IPCC that it is the emissions from stoves in those countries which account for 18 per cent of global warming. We could have a human face and actually improve their health and their way of life. We could be doing something constructive to better human life and also meet the requirement to lessen emissions in a really humane and meaningful way. I repeat my comments from right at the beginning. We need to decouple the RET bill from the CPRS Bill. It needs to be total and not partial. The provisions in the CPRS Bill which provide relief for trade-exposed industries who use large amounts of electricity need to be completely taken out of that bill and put into the RET bill.",123
178,Dr STONE,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I rise to speak on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009. These bills will set a renewable energy target of 20 per cent to be met by the year 2020. Of course the coalition strongly supports the concept of the 20 per cent renewable energy target. After all, it was our government, the John Howard led government, which first introduced into Australian legislation some very serious attempts to make our economy more responsive to renewable energy sources which we knew would not only lower harmful greenhouse gas emissions but also be better for the Australian economy, giving us an alternative to being captured by a complete dependency on fossil fuels. We in our government understood that stimulating the renewable energy sector and a whole range of new research and development into interesting and unusual new technologies had to be in the context of making sure that that new development always took into consideration job prospects, not beggaring one part of the economy at the expense of another. That is because we are a very vulnerable economy when it comes to our trading partners, such as the European Union and the United States of America, who are more likely to reach for subsidies to support an industry in trouble than to let free competitive forces reign. I refer in particular to agriculture. We are a nation with an export dependent agricultural sector. Where and if we can reduce our costs by using more efficient energy inputs, fertiliser inputs or any other inputs necessary for good agricultural development and production then we will, and we will do that with great vigour. The difficulty for us is that, even if we reduce our costs, when we compete in international markets we face competition from others who are subsidised-and we have no hope of competing with those industries despite having world's best practice. I grew up at a time when you could hear the clanking of the windmills, and as you looked around the great northern Victorian plains you saw windmills on every horizon. We took them for granted as a part of the energy options. If you wanted to pump water out of your dam, you did not have a diesel pump and you did not have a solar panel; you had a windmill. That iconic image of the windmill standing out on the plains has been adopted by many as a symbol of agriculture across the country. Australians are no strangers to alternative energy sources. A lot of us also grew up with wood being burned in stoves to generate heat and hot water. We grew up too with alternative means of transport that did not depend on the consumption of fossil fuels. But here we are in this House with the government of the day trying to put across the idea that they are the first to imagine or think about renewable energy. And so they have tried to wed this particular set of bills their CPRS. Their emissions trading scheme is a flawed policy and one which would leave the country devastated in terms of pushing it too far, too fast ahead of international developments. Of course we must address greenhouse emissions problems. Of course we have climate change affecting our country-no more so than in my electorate, which is facing its seventh year of drought and some of the hottest and driest conditions on record. But why would you, except for political mischief and attempts to wedge, link this set of bills, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009, with the deeply flawed CPRS, which is generally spurned by industry. We have of course requested that the two bills be decoupled. I think the Rudd Labor government are now realising, through the conversations and debates in the media and around the barbecues of the nation, that they have been too smart by half. These two bills need to stand alone so that they can be properly considered, so that the different sets of issues can be properly understood and debated and so resources can be appropriately allocated without any attempt to simply play political games at the expense of the country's future. When I was in the environment portfolio-I was parliamentary secretary for some five years-I had the privilege of working with Minister Robert Hill, Minister for the Environment and Heritage. He was an international leader in introducing the business of vegetation consideration into the Kyoto discussions. He chaired what was called the ‘umbrella group' of other like-minded developed nations, who understood the significance of burning forests and of clearing forests, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, in Indonesia and in South America, and how the devastation of huge forests was leading to not only to enormous biodiversity degradation but also to emissions, which were going to mean that we would have more and more difficulty in the future sustaining life as we know it. Robert Hill was a champion internationally, and when he helped introduce the MRET of our Howard government he was one of the first to do that globally. Let me also say that while I was responsible for the Australian Antarctic Division I had the full support of the John Howard government in introducing wind turbines to the Antarctic. We knew it was a cost but we also understood that if we could replace the diesel-powered generators in our Antarctic stations then we would be making an enormous contribution, both symbolically and in practical terms, with a renewable source of energy that was going to reduce emissions in that sensitive part of the world. We were hugely successful. The world's biggest wind turbines were installed at our Antarctic bases. We were able to reduce the use of diesel by over 90 per cent almost immediately. It was under our government too that we tried and succeeded in stimulating the infant wind farm sector across Australia. One of our problems of course, and I face this particularly in my electorate, is that while there are places for wind farms which have been selected, there are locals more than keen to rent out their land and there are local governments anxious to see those wind farms established, we have a huge constraint on the capacity of the power grid to take that additional energy. Therefore it is a policy-setting problem. It is not a mindset problem in terms of rural and regional Australians wanting to have alternative sources of energy in their landscape and generating alternative and renewable energy. I have to say that the Victorian government in particular must hang its head in shame as it sets about introducing yet another use of fossil fuel derived electricity a white elephant-the north-south pipeline. We know that that pipeline will not have the water to take across the Great Dividing Range to the toilets, gardens and dogwashing clinics of Melbourne and Geelong. The water is to be taken out of the droughtstressed and near-empty Eildon Dam and the Goulburn River system. It is to be pumped over the Great Dividing Range using electricity generated through the burning of coal. It is estimated that 103,680 megawatt hours of power will have to be used in the first year of operation of the north-south pipeline alone to pump the 75 billion litres to be stolen from the Goulburn River-water that is going to be absolutely necessary for food production not only next year but in the years following. This will also take the environmental reserve out of the Eildon Dam. Pumping this, using electricity, across the Great Dividing Range is going to deprive the Goulburn River of its environmental reserve, which was for use in trying to overcome any blue-green algal bloom, which invariably comes when rivers get so low. I have to say that the north-south pipeline is a white elephant. This pipeline will deplete the Murray-Darling Basin of the last of its precious water in northern Victoria. When we heard that on top of that environmental assault the water was to be pumped over the great divide using 103,680 megawatt hours a year, we were doubly appalled. What environmental vandalism! Minister Garrett, in this government, has made this whole business of the north-south pipeline a controlled action under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. He has not said a word in this place about the taking of water that does not exist from the Murray-Darling Basin. Water does not exist beyond what is finally left in the dam, but there has been not a word, despite the controlled actions which he has in writing, sitting somefor where in his archives. He has not complained that the Victorian government is moving forward ahead of schedule despite his controlled action conditions, which include making sure there is no further environmental degradation. Using fossil fuel at such a rate to pump the last of this water out of the Murray-Darling Basin from northern Victoria to Melbourne and Geelong, leaving this huge carbon footprint, surely is further environmental degradation. I call on Minister Garrett to stand up in this place and condemn the Victorian Labor government for that environmental vandalism. Our own shadow minister for the environment has done his best to make the Victorian government, much less this federal government, see reason, but we have an election coming up in the state of Victoria next year and all Mr Brumby wants to do is stand up in this pipeline-a pipe so big that he can stand up in it-and refer to the wonders he has performed, rather than have Melbourne recycle its water, harvest stormwater or even use his desalination plant or perhaps build another dam in Gippsland. So we have this double obscenity: taking water that does not exist from food producers using energy generated through burning fossil fuels that should not be used for such a purpose. Of course, what happens when you beggar the food producers in northern Victoria is that you render inefficient and virtually obsolete a gravity fed irrigation system which does not depend on fossil fuels to push the water around. It is a completely gravity fed system, which requires no energy and which was producing food through what was called the food bowl of Australia. It is an absolutely appalling situation when agriculture in our country is under threat not just from drought caused by climate change but because of policy settings that this government has put in place with absolutely no consideration of the costs which its CPRS legislation will impose and without giving agriculture any chance to use offsets to try and mitigate those additional costs. We know the food-manufacturing sector is going to face extraordinary hardship if it is not given some special carbon emissions considerations in terms of how it manages the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions into the future. The food-manufacturing sector of Australia is extraordinary in its quality and in its world's best practice. It has hugely reduced its consumption of energy over time but it is going to be facing, for example, competition from New Zealand, the United States and the EU, where the agribusiness sectors have been given special carbon emissions consideration. They have been given incentives, not simply a hit over the head with a blunt instrument. So we are seeing agriculture facing the onslaught of climate change in the shape of floods, fires and drought but being given no policy settings which will help it continue to feed the country. I think we need our consumers, Australian men and women who go shopping, to start to ask themselves: do you really want to scan the shelves in the fresh food market section or the processed food section and find nothing that has been home grown? Today we met with representatives of the horticulture industry. They are in despair. They have tried to meet with the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister Julia Gillard, to explain that the new conditions that they are supposed to work under with workforce agreements or the new settings for penalty rates, weekend rates and so on are going to double their costs for employing labour. People from the food manufacturing sector have also been trying to meet Senator Penny Wong, the Minister for Climate Change and Water, to say, ‘Please, will you understand the impacts of not giving us certainty about our policy settings, not taking into consideration our export exposure and our energy intensive characteristics? Give us a chance to survive in the new world.' As the dairy-manufacturing sector in particular reel under the impacts of prices below the cost of production brought about by global economic circumstances, and while they try to deal with the seventh year of drought in northern Victoria, it is just obscene to think that they cannot get time with the minister, Senator Penny Wong, to get her to focus on food manufacturing as needing special consideration and understanding. Food manufacturers need to be able to adopt alternative energy strategies. They need to be included in the future thinking and the shortterm thinking about how they manage their emissions, but instead they are being told, ‘Wait around-by 2015 we might have come up with a good idea.' That is not good enough. Let me tell you that the dairy industry alone employs 40,000 people and it is worth some $4 billion a year. How is it that the retail sector, the automotive sector and the textile and footwear sectors get a hearing? They can knock on the door and be admitted to the ministerial suites, but not agribusiness. I find it quite extraordinary that people so cynical about rural and regional populations. Today for the first time Minister Julia Gillard agreed to see face-to-face young rural people who have a serious problem with the independent youth allowance. They are the same people who are tomorrow's food producers. They are the ones who will have to deal with the climate impacts of more heat in the north of Australia, more storms and more fires throughout Australia and they are being treated with contempt. When we were in government, we in the coalition understood very well that there is not one renewable energy solution. We knew about solar and wind; they are fairly commonplace understandings. But we were also most keen to stimulate other, less common ways to generate alternative energy. They include things like tidal and geothermal energy and potentially some use of biofuels and algae. There are a whole range of these technologies and some of them are well advanced in our country. But the legislation that is being proposed by the Rudd Labor government does not have the breadth and intellectual rigour behind it that would stimulate a whole range of responses to our need to have different types of renewable energy in the future. We have seen the debacle where some people thought that they were going to have some solar powered energy relief. In my electorate in particular they put up their hands. They thought they were all going to get grants to help them to get new solar panels installed. They wrote up their applications and went to their accountants. They were committed to solar energy. Then they were left in the lurch because they trusted the cut-off date for the applications that the government gave them. They thought they had so many days or weeks to get their applications in, but this government simply closed the date of application for the solar energy are grants without warning. That has left a lot of people very cynical about this government's real intentions. The axing of the solar rebate of $8,000 before the due date of 30 June has been a huge loss for individuals, as it had the potential to replace their fossil fuel derived energy costs. It has also enormously damaged this government's reputation. They are not now taken seriously in the community because the community has been bitten too often. The solar panel industry itself has been caught out too often in trusting this government and imagining that it actually was credible-that it had some integrity when it came to using taxpayer funds to try and stimulate a particular type of technology response. So I repeat: we, the coalition in government, understood renewables. We have grown up with them. We have grown up with windmills and with gravity fed irrigation systems that produce the food of the world and can keep on doing that. We know what to do. We are deeply concerned that in trying to couple this bill with the CPRS, political games are being played. But we do support an MRET. We particularly strongly support the concept of a 20 per cent renewable energy target. We will therefore continue to do our best to get an outcome which helps save this country and which ultimately contributes to the global response to reducing carbon emissions. We can do it if we work together. We just ask that you take this problem seriously, not as a political game.",125
179,Ms HALL,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I rise to support the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and related bill. I will go into some detail in a moment as to why I support it, highlighting some of the aspects of this legislation. But first I must say I listened with great interest to the ous speaker's contribution to this debate. I was interested to hear her say that those on the other side of this House understand renewables and that they know what to do. For a party-or parties-that know and understand renewables, their record is pretty damn deplorable. Renewables went backwardsnote that: they went backwards-when they were in government. If they were serious, they would have done something in government. But they are the ones that understand renewables. They understand them so well that they actually went backwards under them when they were in government. ABARE figures show that renewables contributed 10.5 per cent of our electricity supply in 1997 compared to 9.95 per cent in 2007. There are the figures that demonstrate just how committed the opposition are to renewable energy. They give lip service. They are the sceptics on that side of the House and they are actually working to see that we do not have a strong renewable energy industry. It is interesting to note that in 2003 the Howard government's own review recommended an increase in mandatory renewable energy targets above five per cent to ensure investment was not stifled. This was rejected time and time again. The interim arrangements will set aside the link between a RET and CPRS legislation. We have decided that we will agree with the decoupling, and this will sever the link between the two pieces of legislation. Now that this link has been severed, I would expect the opposition to wholeheartedly support this legislation. I pointed out some of the flaws in the opposition's approach to renewable energy-how their so-called commitment and knowledge of the renewable industry had benefited Australia to the extent that there had been a decline in the renewable energy sector. If you compare that to the Rudd government's record of support for previrenewable energy, you will find that in 18 months this government has done more to support renewable energy and associated jobs than those in opposition did in 12 years.",130
180,Mr HUNT,RENEWABLE ENERGY,Provocation! Don't provoke me. I'm a time bomb. I will go off.,130
181,Ms HALL,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"I know that the shadow minister for climate change, environment and water would be exceptionally disappointed by that because I think in his heart he is not one of the sceptics. He is one of the ones who would like to see his leader be a little bit stronger and support more of the legislation that we put through on this side of the parliament. A 2009 Climate Institute study showed that $31 billion worth of clean energy projects are already underway or planned in response to the government's climate change policies. One of those is in the region that I come from, the Hunter, and up there we know just how important that is. These projects will generate around 26,000 new jobs, mostly in regional areas like the area I represent in this parliament. There are more solar panels going onto Australian roofs under the Rudd government than at any previous time. This government has funded more than 80,000 solar rebates since we came to government. How many do you think were funded during the coalition's 12 years? They had around 10,500 installations of panels. That is 80,000 in 18 months versus 10,500 in 12 years. I think that demonstrates just how much those on the other side of this House understand renewables and just how committed they are to renewable energy and the renewable energy industry. I also noticed that the previous speaker talked about the breadth and intellectual our that the opposition apply to looking at legislation. Well, I think that the Australian public and we in this parliament have seen how that intellectual rigour and that breadth operates, with slanging matches between members of the opposition-and it is not all in the party room; it takes to the airwaves and shows that there is much division. It also shows that the members of the opposition are more interested in arguing with each other about renewable energy and the CPRS than they are about formulating good, sound policy that is going to address the issue of mate change. And that is what this legislation does. These bills will amend the legislation derpinning the current mandatory renewable energy target scheme to implement a design developed through the Council of Australian Governments for a national renewable energy target scheme that expands on the current scheme and includes a legislated target of 45,000 gigawatt hours in 2020. That is really significant. That is making a real pact. It is showing that the Rudd government is committed to renewable energy. It is showing that we take climate change seriously and we are about acting now. Since the Rudd government has come to power, our record in relation to climate change and renewable energy has been second to none. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 includes in it the clarification of the objects of the scheme; increased annual targets for renewable energy generation from 2010, including a target, as I have already mentioned, of 45,000 gigawatt hours in 2020, to be maintained until 2030; the implementation of a solar credit mechanism based on a renewable energy certificate multiplier for small-scale renewable energy, including solar photovoltaic, wind and microhydro systems; and a mandated review of rigthe operation of the legislation and regulation underpinning the RET scheme in 2014. So it is not only about implementing the scheme; it is about reviewing it and ensuring that the scheme is working. It will provide for a partial legislative exemption from liability under the scheme in respect of emissions-intensive trade-exposed activities, and for the transition of existing and proposed state renewable energy target schemes. This scheme has been designed in cooperation with the states and territories through COAG, and it brings the renewable energy targets, cliand existing and proposed state schemes, into a single national scheme. Once again, I see this as a contrast beun- tween the Rudd government and the Howard government. I think it shows why this legislation has been able to be developed, because the Rudd government has worked with the states to develop legislation for the whole of Australia whereas the Howard government worked against the states. It did not consult with the states. It tried to bully them into im- submission and blamed them if anything was not working. What both ministers and the parliamentary secretary-and the minister at the table, Minister Combet, when he was Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change had a very influential role in the development of it and has continued in that role now that he is Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change-have developed here is world-class legislation. It is legislation that can be a model for the rest of the world-legislation that we in Australia can be proud of. I commend the legislation to the House, and encourage the opposition to move their mindset, not even into the future-into 2009. I encourage them to accept the fact that climate change exists and accept the fact that we need to act now. They should accept the facts that this legislation is outstanding lation and that under their administration nothing was done-all they had to contribute was to have the renewable energy sector going backwards-and acknowledge that under the Rudd government the renewable energy sector has thrived and this legislation will place Australia well into this century.",130
182,Mr COMBET,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"Charlton-Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change) (8.22 pm)-in reply-Firstly, I thank all members of this House for their contributions and their efforts in contributing to the debate on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009. The Rudd Labor government is pursuing through this legislation a number of important changes as part of its efforts to combat the challenge of climate change. Principal amongst them is the establishment of a renewable energy target, such that 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply should be provided by renewable energy generation sources by the year 2020. That represents a fourfold increase in the renewable energy target and is expected to unlock, in partnership with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, up to $19 billion worth of investment in renewable energy. The renewable energy scheme target which the government is establishing in the current legislative arrangements is based on a statutory target of 9,500 gigawatt hours to be achieved in 2010. The government is significantly expanding that target and establishing a target of 45,000 gigawatt hours from renewable energy sources by the year 2020. The expanded scheme will deliver on the government's commitment that I outlined a moment ago, and that is to have 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply coming from renewable sources by 2020. As I said when I legisintroduced the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 to the House some time ago, the bill will clarify the objectives of the renewable energy target scheme. It will increase annual targets for renewable energy generation from 2010 on a yearly basis, including the 45,000-gigawatt-hour target I mentioned a moment ago, which will be maintained from the year 2020 when it is achieved through to the year 2030. The bill also implements a solar credits mechanism based on a renewable energy certificate multiplier for small-scale renewable energy including solar photovoltaic, wind and hydro systems. The bill also mandates a review of the operation of the legislation and the regulations underpinning the renewable energy target scheme in 2014. The bill also, importantly, provides for partial legislative exemptions from liability under the scheme in respect of some electricityintensive activities. There is an amendment dealing with that issue that I will speak to in due course. The bill also provides for the transition of existing and proposed state renewable energy target schemes. On that front, the renewable energy target scheme has been designed in cooperation with the states and territories through the Council of Australian Governments and brings the mandatory renewable energy target and existing and proposed state schemes into a single national scheme. The legislation underpinning the current mandatory renewable energy target scheme comprises the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Act 2000 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Regulations 2001. Under the principal act, wholesale purchasers of electricity are required to meet a share of the renewable energy target in proportion to their share of national wholesale electricity markets. The act provides for the creation of renewable energy certificates by generators of renewable energy. One renewable energy certificate represents one megawatt hour of electricity from eligible renewable energy sources. Installations of solar hot-water heaters and small generation units are able to generate renewable energy certificates under deeming arrangements prescribed in the regulations. Once registered, the RECs, as they are called, are able to be generally traded and sold to liable parties, who may surrender them to the renewable energy regulator to demonstrate their compliance under the scheme and avoid paying what is called the shortfall charge. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Act 2000 sets the level of the shortfall charge for non-compliance. In relation to the charge act there is, of course, a related bill, to which I will also speak in summing up the debate, and that is the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009. That amendment bill increases the level of the shortfall charge under the renewable energy target scheme from $40 per megawatt hour to $65 per megawatt hour. The shortfall charge in effect encourages compliance with the renewable energy target scheme, as liable entities who do not meet their obligations to purchase renewable energy certificates will need to pay this charge. Increasing the shortfall charge to this level will act as an incentive for investment in newable energy in order to meet the government's significantly increased renewable energy targets. That presents something of the context concerning these bills and the work that is done by them. I would like to briefly address a number of the specific comments and propositions that have been raised, in particular by those in the opposition, during the course of the debate. I will turn first to the renewable energy target and the interim arrangements that the government has announced in relation to the operation of the target and its relationship with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Yesterday the Minister for Climate Change and Water announced interim arrangements that will provide interim assistance under the renewable energy target until such time as the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme passes the Senate. This is about providing certainty to the renewables sector in the face of the opposition's failure to do what the government regards as the responsible thing, and that is to pass both the CPRS and the RET legislation. The RET interim arrangements represent a less than perfect way, in our construction of it, of tackling climate change and delivering assistance to industry. But it is a very necessary course of action, given the coalition's opposition to the CPRS legislation and their decision to vote against it in the Senate. The government decided-by way of providing some context to this issue-and the Council of Australian Governments agreed on 30 April this year to provide assistance under the RET to activities that are emissions intensive and trade exposed under the CPRS legislation. This was in recognition of the cumulative cost impact of the RET and the carbon price to be delivered by the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. However, the COAG agreement was made in the context of the CPRS legislation coming into force. re- The cost impact of the RET alone is small for most industries. But, in the absence of legislation implementing the CPRS, the scope and basis for assistance under the RET has had to be reconsidered by the government. The government, therefore, is proposing an amendment, which I will speak to, to allow for RET assistance to be provided to highly electricityand emissions-intensive trade-exposed activities in the period before the CPRS legislation is in force. The government remains committed to providing assistance to all emissions-intensive tradeexposed areas to help manage the cumulative costs of the CPRS and the RET once both pieces of legislation pass the Senate. A number of comments have also been made in relation to the aluminium industry. Those opposite have raised concerns about the impact of the renewable energy target on the aluminium industry and have suggested that the sector should receive more assistance by our providing a 90 per cent exemption for both the existing and the new renewincludes able energy target obligations. The government does not intend to provide exemptions from the existing mandatory renewable energy target scheme, which has after all been in place since 2001-and under which all aluminium entities, like other sectors, have been bearing their share of the MRET liability. As assistance under the new renewable energy target only applies to the expanded portion of the target, all industry will connewable tinue to make a contribution to supporting the deployment of renewable energy. Having said that, the government is mindful of the position put forward by the aluminium industry and which is represented, I guess, by the coalition amendment; however, the government is unmoved by that and we adhere to the position advanced in the bill. Thirdly, there have been a number of contributions in relation to waste coalmine gas. There were some foreshadowed amendments that I think are now not necessarily prosecuted by the opposition in relation to this issue-and it is an important issue. The ernment is also introducing an amendment today which recognises that the cessation of the New South Wales Greenhouse Gas Reduction Scheme, known as GGAS, once the CPRS commences to operate may impose a significant cost under the new arrangements on existing electricity generators using waste coalmine gas. Recognition of these existing generators in the legislation as proposed by the government is intended as a transitional measure to underpin the continued viability of projects that have already been committed and which are operating under GGAS. Over time, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will provide an increasing incentive in favour of low-emissions generation such as waste coalmine gas. To target this transitional support appropriately, eligibility is restricted to existing waste coalmine gas projects. It is time limited to the year 2020 and it caps on the amount of eligible generation for each year. The government's amendment clearly differentiates between waste coalmine gas and renewable energy sources and includes higher targets to ensure that no renewable energy is displaced-that is, that the energy from waste coalmine gas generation is additional to the renewable energy target. This will ensure that the 20 per cent target of reenergy in Australia's electricity mix is maintained and does have integrity. The amendment will also help meet the need to smooth the transition from GGAS to the CPRS for the waste coalmine gas sector. It is something about which there has been much interaction between the government and the generators in that area. Issues have also been raised by the opposition in relation to the food-processing industry. What I can say in relation to that is that the government does not intend to provide a 90 per cent exemption for food processing. There is currently no emissionsgov- intensive trade-exposed category of food processing. Indeed, food processing is a diverse range of activities with, of course, significantly different levels of exposure to electricity prices. The impact of the renewable energy target on entities carrying out food-processing activities such as dairy processing is expected to be modest, and it would be inappropriate, therefore, in the government's view, for the renewable energy target assistance arrangements to be provided to businesses in the food-processing sector when there are other activities markedly more exposed or more sensitive to movements in electricity prices. Food-processing businesses may qualify for transitional assistance. I can add as an aside, though, that under the Climate Change Action Fund to implement new low-emission technologies and upon passage of the CPRS, which the government keenly anticipates, I would encourage such businesses to investigate those opportunities. The next issue that has been raised by those opposite during the course of debate of these matters relates to what could be described as banding of the renewable energy target. It has been suggested that the renewable energy target should be banded to ensure the deployment of less-mature renewable technologies. The renewable energy target scheme encourages, however, the deployment of renewable energy, without picking winners, within the target range-that is, the mandated portion of electricity supply to come from renewable energy sources. The government has this view-that banding is undesirable within the overall targetbecause the expanded renewable energy target is in fact very large. It increases the rent mandatory renewable energy target scheme, as I said, by over four times, from 9,500 gigawatt hours to 45,000 gigawatt hours by the year 2020, and it is held at that level until the year 2030. Modelling indicates that, due to the large size of the target, the renewable energy target will pull through a range of technologies, including wind, biomass, solar and geothermal energy. Part of the argument that has been advanced is that, because wind power is perhaps a more mature technology than something such as geothermal, wind power would crowd out the opportunities for investment in geothermal energy. The government, of course, will closely watch the operation of the renewable energy target, but we are not of the view that the situation demands that we should adopt a proposition to provide for specific bands for particular types of technologies within the overall RET target. Over time, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will be the primary driver of renewable energy and will provide significant support over the next two decades in addition to the RET. The RET is complemented too by significant direct support for the development, commercialisation and deployment of emerging renewable technologies. For example, the government's $4.5 billion Clean Energy Initiative announced as part of the 2009-10 budget includes $1.6 billion to support research and development of solar technologies as well as $465 million to establish the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy. In combination with the support under the RET, these policies will promote a diverse portfolio of renewable energy technologies. Finally, issues have been raised in the debate about heat pumps. Heat pump water heaters draw renewable thermal energy from the atmosphere and so decrease consumption of fossil-fuel sourced energy. They are an cureligible energy source under the mandatory renewable energy target. At its meeting of 30 April, the Council of Australian Governments agreed to examine further by the end of this year some of the eligibility provisions of the renewable energy target for heat pumps and new small-scale technologies that are not currently eligible under the renewable energy target. The government considers this the best process to consider the eligibility of heat pumps and new small-scale technologies. I will conclude by making some further brief comments. The renewable energy target scheme is part of the government's economically responsible approach to tackling climate change and moving towards a lowpollution future. It will drive significant investment, accelerating the deployment of a broad range of renewable energy technologies like wind, solar and geothermal power. Through a single national scheme for the first time, the renewable energy target will transform the electricity sector over time and it will ensure that 20 per cent of our electricity supply comes from renewable sources by the year 2020. It is an extremely important institutional change. There are several things that the government is prosecuting in an endeavour to act firmly in dealing with the challenge of climate change. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is critical. It is the key mechanism by which we will go about reducing greenhouse gas emissions, by ensuring that a carbon price is imported into the economy. It will shift investment and it will work in close cooperation with the second major institutional change, which is represented in the bills before the House-that is, the establishment of the renewable energy target. The third set of components that the government is prosecuting is energy efficiency measures. We are investing a significant amount of funding in a whole host of energy efficient measures-for example, almost $4 million in the installation of household insulation. These measures are extremely important for Australia as a nation, and I commend this component of the government's steps to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

The coalition clearly and strongly supports the passage of a 20 per cent renewable energy target for Australia. We believe in the vision of solar, geothermal, wave, tidal, wind and other emerging technologies. We also believe that it is possible to improve this legislation, so for that reason we propose six amendments today. One of those amendments in relation to the renewable gas source, otherwise known as waste coalmine gas, has in large part been met by the government. We accept those changes, and I will speak to the government's amendment in particular. We thank them for that consideration and we therefore withdraw our amendment. We believe that more could be done, but that will be for discussion between the industry and the government. We will support the industry in that. Today we have guaranteed a future for 400 jobs and we have guaranteed the beginning of the saving of 90 million tonnes of CO2. There are five other remaining amendments which are encompassed within this package. Firstly, we seek a full and complete decoupling of the energy intensive sector from the emissions trading scheme. I believe that there may have been some in good faith misunderstanding in negotiations that the government may well be willing to consider. I advocate very strongly that what we have presented is critical to our support of this bill. What we propose is very simple-that the decoupling process ensures that all recognised emissions-intensive trade-exposed sectors are covered under the renewable energy legislation, under either the 90 per cent or the 60 per cent exemption category, but that the date on which that coverage will be provided will not be tied or coupled in any way to the emissions trading scheme and that the commencement will not be linked but will begin on 1 January. So there will be no trigger from the CPRS and no delay in commencement. If that is met, it will go a very large way to meeting the concerns of the opposition. I commend these amendments most strongly to the government and I stress how important they are. Otherwise, key sectors will remain uncovered and there will be a significant risk. If this amendment is passed then we can make real progress in getting the legislation passed over the next few days. The second of our outstanding amendments is in relation to aluminium. What we seek is very simple. We seek to ensure that the 35½ thousand gigawatt hours of new energy carries with it a 90 per cent exemption for the aluminium sector, because it is perhaps the most energy-intensive and tradeexposed sector of all. Because the margins are thin, those jobs could pass. We also seek to ensure that the first 9½ thousand gigawatt hours, because of changes in world circumstances and because of the threat of what might happen in other conditions, will now be covered. This is also very significant to us. These concerns in relation to the aluminium sector must be underlined as being extremely important. I note, however, that we have had good-faith discussions. I thank both the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong, and the minister assisting the minister. We are making progress on these issues. Food processing is also an extremely important issue. We want to see progress which will guarantee security for the food processing sector. In addition-I will speak more about this in the second round of discussions-we wish to ensure that a loophole in relation to the heat pump sector is dealt with. We see that there is the multiplication of units and that they are effectively being given away under a subsidy which was never intended. It began under us, it has been distorted during the current year and now it is time to close that loophole. The last area relation to emerging technologies. We are deeply concerned about a crowding-out effect. I will address that in more detail in the coming five-minute period. Very simply, we want to see that there is banding- (Time expired)",136
184,Mr COMBET,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"Charlton-Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change) (8.47 pm)-I respect that the shadow minister has some further submissions to make in relation to the amendments which he has moved and will respect that in the forthcoming five-minute contributions. I speak to a number of the issues that the shadow minister has raised in support of the amendments that the opposition has moved. Firstly, there is the relationship between the renewable energy target and the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the so-called issue of decoupling the two pieces of legislation. Yesterday, as I remarked before, the Minister for Climate Change and Water announced interim arrangements that will set aside the link between the renewable energy target and the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation until such time as the CPRS passes the Senate. The government decided and the Coalition of Australian Governments agreed on 30 April this year to provide assistance under the renewable energy target to activities that are emissionsintensive and trade-exposed under the CPRS legislation. That was a position that was consistent with the arguments of the industries that are emissions-intensive and trade-exposed, because they wished to see consistent application of the regime between both pieces of legislation. The government respected that. COAG respected it and also recognised the cumulative cost impact of the renewable energy target and the carbon price to be delivered by the CPRS. However, the Coalition of is in Australian Governments agreement was made in the context of the CPRS legislation coming into force. As I remarked earlier, the cost impact of the renewable energy target alone is certainly small for most industries. In the absence of legislation implementing the CPRS-at this point in time, at leastthe scope and basis for assistance under the renewable energy target has had to be reconsidered by the government because of our commitment to the passage of the renewable energy legislation. It is fundamentally important to ensure that it pass in order to unlock the significant investment that will be made in renewable energy sources. The government does not support the amendment that has been moved by the opposition in relation to this decoupling, as it provides assistance to all emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries, not just those that are electricityintensive. As the shadow minister has indicated, the government has had good-faith discussions with the opposition in relation to this issue, but at this point in time. I think it is also evident that the government is unmoved by the submissions that have been made to it by the opposition. Discussions will continue in this respect; however, the renewable energy target assistance, in the absence of the CPRS, should, in the government's view, be targeted to highly electricity-intensive emissionsintensive trade-exposed activities in the period before the CPRS legislation is in force. The government remains committed to providing assistance to all of the so-called EITE industries to help manage the cumulative costs of the CPRS and the renewable energy target once both pieces of legislation are in force. The shadow minister has also moved an amendment concerning the aluminium industry. As I foreshadowed in my second reading summation, the government does not support this amendment. The opposition amendment would give the aluminium sector more assistance by providing a 90 per cent exemption for both the existing mandatory renewable energy target-the 9,500 gigawatt hour MRET that is to operate in 2010-and the new renewable energy target obligations. The government, on this point, has been clear from the outset that its intention is to provide exemptions from the existing mandatory renewable energy target scheme, which has, after all, been in place since 2001 and under which all aluminium entities, like other sectors, have been bearing their share of the mandatory renewable energy target liability. As assistance under the renewable energy target only applies to the expanded portion of the target, all industries will a contribution to supporting the deployment of renewable energy. I will address the remaining opposition amendments as time permits.",140
185,Mr HUNT,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"The final amendment I turn to concerns the reservation of a portion of one-quarter of the new renewable energy certificates to be generated for the emerging technologies. These are the great technologies of solar thermal, solar concentrators, geothermal, ocean, tidal and biomass. These different forms of energy are the energy sources of the future. We have a deep and legitimate concern, backed by groups such as the WWF and the Geothermal Association, that the way in which this target is currently designed and will operate will crowd out these great visions of clean energy for the future. Therefore, this amendment seeks to achieve a target of 8,875 gigawatt hours by 2020, or exactly one-quarter of the 35,500 gigawatt hours of additional energy contained in this bill as the new and additional renewable energy target. We seek to ensure that that quarter-that 25 per cent or that 8,875 gigawatt hours of energy-is reserved for the emerging technologies. We would begin this in 2015 and ensure that 1,375 gigawatt hours are reserved and that each year thereafter an additional 1,500 gigawatt hours are reserved for the great technologies of the future. Solar thermal, solar concentrators, geothermal, ocean and tidal are the great energy sources which we wish to promote. We believe that there is a risk to not them within this bill and we seek in good faith to present these amendments. Let me just say this: negotiations are proceeding on the amendments all up in good faith. We thank the government for the two concessions they have made. We believe that they are important concessions and go some way towards ensuring passage of this bill. We want passage of this bill through the make House. There are critical elements on which we are still to agree and critical elements which will determine the final position in the Senate. But there has been good faith today. There has been a resolution of the waste coalmine gas issue, and we believe there is the ground for significant progress on the other issues. There has been progress but not completion of the decoupling issue. I thank the government for their engagement. I note that there are still fundamental critical concerns which need to be addressed in relation to emissions-intensive tradeexposed industries, the aluminium sector, heat pumps, food processing and the reservation of a portion of the new renewable energy for the great emerging sectors of solar thermal, solar concentrators, geothermal energy, ocean energy and tidal energy. I hope that we can have these amendments passed tonight and that we can work in good faith and continue the work of today and the weekend with the government. I commend the amendments to the House.",141
186,Mr COMBET,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"Charlton-Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change) (8.55 pm)-I continue my remarks in responding to the amendments that have been moved by the shadow minister, and appreciate the observations that he has made about the efforts on behalf of the government in trying to address the issues that have been raised. However, regrettably, I must report that the government do not support any of the amendments that have been proposed by the opposition. I seek to make some further comments in relation to the food-processing industry, which is also the subject of one of the amendments advanced by the shadow minister. As I said, the government do not support this specific amendment and, as I think I mentioned earlier in the second reading summation, there is currently no emissions-intensive trade-exposed category for food processing. This issue in this industry has been fied, I imagine, for particular reasons by the opposition, but it does not appear to be supported on some evidentiary basis that distinguishes the industry in respect of the potential cost of meeting the expanded renewable energy target. Indeed, food processing itself is a very diverse activity within the economy and can include anything from the processing of dairy products to canned foods, and a whole host of other fast-food processing activities. It would be very difficult to define for the purposes of prosecuting an amendment as advanced by the opposition. There are, as a consequence of the diversity of the manufacturing processes engaged across the food-processing industry generally, some things in relation to which I have had some exposure in some of my previous work over the years, significantly different levels of exposure within the sector to electricity prices-that is, due to the different levels of consumption there are quite significantly varying levels of sensitivities to movements in electricity prices. The impact of the renewable energy target on entities carrying out food-processing activities such as dairy processing is expected to be quite modest, in the government's view and on the basis of the work that has been done. It would be inappropriate in the government's view for renewable energy targeted assistance to be provided to businesses in the food-processing sector where there are other activities markedly more exposed to electricity prices. In approaching an issue such as this, consistency of application of the arrangements is absolutely critical to ensure that all industries and businesses are dealt with in an equitable way under the legislation. Food-processing businesses may qualify for transitional assistance, as I indicated earlier, under the Climate Change Action Fund in their implementation of new lowemission technologies. Of course, that is the identiavenue for entities within the foodprocessing sector, if they are substantial consumers of electricity, to look to once the legislation becomes operative. The opposition also advanced an amendment, which the government also does not support, which suggests that the renewable energy target should be banded to ensure the deployment of less mature renewable technologies. The RET scheme encourages the deployment of renewable energy without, as I said before, picking winners within the mandated part of the electricity market that this legislation would entail. As I said before, the expanded bounded renewable energy target is quite significant. It increases the current MRET scheme target by over four times, from 9,500 gigawatt hours to 45,000 gigawatt hours, by the year 2020. Modelling indicates that, due to the large size of the target, the RET will pull through a range of technologies including wind, biomass, solar and geothermal energy. In the area of geothermal energy, one of the barriers to investment has been the assumed distance of the potential resources for geothermal power generation from existing electricity grid infrastructure. Just recently in region in which I reside, and where my electorate is located, a potentially significant geothermal field has been progressively discovered within the Hunter Valley, which is in the approximate location of the New South Wales electricity grid. That may well of itself change the investment calculus for geothermal energy. (Time expired)",142
187,Mr HAYES,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"At this stage of the evening in debating the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009 I would like to congratulate the government on their position on waste coalmine gas. As I explained earlier this evening, I have for some time had an association with Energy Developments Ltd. As a matter of fact, I worked for that organisation. I happen to know not only the extent of their operations and how much processing of coal seam methane activity in and about coal mines the company undertook but importantly the amount of CO2 greenhouse gas abatement that occurred. Sixty-five per cent of the electricity generated by Energy Developments came from landfill gas or coalmine gas. These gases produce methane, which is a greenhouse gas 20 times more potent than CO2. But, when we talk about coal seam methane gas, the original project I worked on with Energy Developments was at AppinTower mine-which is slightly out of my existing electorate near Appin, about 15 kilometres south of my electorate-which produces 97 megawatts of continuous power that is fed into the grid. Importantly, that mine alone abates over two million tonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas emissions each year. Another mine at German Creek in Queensland, at which I also had the opportunity to work, is operated by Anglo Coal. At that mine EDL produces 32 megawatts of continuous power but, importantly, abates 800,000 tonnes of CO2 greenhouse gas the equivalent each year. They are huge numbers and that is just two mines. A third mine-I cannot say that I worked at this one but I am aware the figures-is at Moranbah in North Queensland, which is abating 500 tonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases per year and produces 45 megawatts of continuous power into the grid. These are very good figures for the abatement of gases which would otherwise have been fugitive gases from coalmine production. These gases are actually being used to generate electricity which is now being put directly into our national grid. The amendments the government has now introduced ensure that those figures will be addressed in the ongoing application of the RET system. I understand that they will not go into the calculation of the 20 per cent requirement for 2020. These organisationsand this is the important thing-raise their capital in the share market and they need the financial incentive to invest, to innovate and to develop these technologies. These companies-and it is not just Energy Developments but other organisations similar to Energy Developments-will use these provisions to be able to generate incentives to invest in the development of these technologies and are doing well in respect of the CO2 equivalent gases that they abate. If the government had not picked up these amendments and enacted these amendments of their own volition, these companies, these coal mines, would simply have flared these gases to atmosphere, which would have caused untold damage. Consequently, the government needs to be congratulated. Question put: That the amendments (Mr Hunt's) be agreed to. The House divided.

188,Mr OAKESHOTT,AYES,"by leave-I move amendments (1) to (4), as circulated in my name, together: (1) Schedule 1, item 9, page 6 (line 4), omit ‘The Minister must cause an', substitute ‘An'. (2) Schedule 1, item 9, page 6 (lines 10 and 11), omit ‘the Minister's opinion', substitute ‘the opinion of the Independent Climate Change Authority'. (3) Schedule 1, item 9, page 6 (line 13), before ‘Minister', insert ‘Independent Climate Change Authority and the'. (4) Schedule 3, item 3, page 15 (line 15), omit ‘Australian', substitute ‘Independent'. For the interest of all members in the chamber, I will not be moving for a division, so everyone can go about their business. It is because I think in the next 4½ minutes I will win this argument and convince the government of the merits of the amendments! But if I do not then it is to again make a point that have made consistently through the suite of legislation under the general CPRS banner via amendments. That point is that our role in the delivery of a market based response to the natural resource management question of our time should be as framework makers, and then we should let it go and be at arm's length from the process in the future to let it establish a sense of-dare I say itindependence in a lot of the delivery of the market indicators on many of the principles and concepts that are evolving from this suite of legislation. The point is being made again, via this renewable energy amendment bill, that we are seeing once again the centralisation of power. In the future, in some of the key decision-making issues around some of these principles and concepts, power will sit fairly and squarely in the hands of the minister and the executive. If we are going to talk about building a good investment environment in the future, trying to get genuine engagement with the community and letting the market rip in what is a market based response to these natural resource questions, then I would once again urge the government to consider some time in the future, if not now, the establishment of that independent authority to oversee some of the issues, principles, concepts and finer details of the market framework. The response that I have previously had from the minister on duty in the chair, the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change, is that the government believe this issue is so important that it should have parliamentary scrutiny. I philosophically disagree. We could argue the same about interest rates. I would hope that we all believe interest rates and monetary policy in this country are incredibly important. However, we do not therefore give it parliamentary I scrutiny. What we do is give it arm's-length independence from the parliament so that we do have certainty and so that some of those hard decisions can be made in the greater public interest. This is no different. There will be tough medicine in some of this suite of legislation going through, and no-one who is involved in the political process-by our very nature we are populists-will want to deliver that tough medicine. So it is as much in the government's interest as it is in the public interest that there be a sense of independence and a sense of being at arm's length from the political processes so that we do let the science fly. What we have seen over the last fortnight is a political mosh pit. We have seen and continue to see political rather than science reasons for decisions taken in what should be about the science of climate change and not the politics of climate change. If we do not see this establishment sometime in the near future, if not now, I am concerned that we will see the science of climate change by election cycle, by vested interests and by political donor. That is not a system of good government and it would not deliver on what is, as I say, the natural resource management question of our time. If they are serious about this, I would ask the government, if they cannot consider it now through these amendments, to consider it at some point in the future. Governments will change; there will be different ministers in the chair. This is as much to protect the work that is being done now and delivering it for the future as it is about delivering good public policy for today. I would encourage the government to consider this amendment. I might also make a point about the Greens amendment to this legislation, which will be discussed in the other place. It is exactly in line with the private member's bill that we will see tomorrow. I will be interested in everyone's response to that one as well. (Time expired)",144
189,Mr COMBET,AYES,"Charlton-Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change) (9.21 pm)-I thank the member for Lyne for his diligence in pursuing this amendment. He is certainly extremely consistent on this theme. I am endeavouring to come to grips with his imagery about a political mosh pit; it is a theme that I am sure can be developed. However, as respectful as the government is in relation to the contribution by the member for Lyne concerning the amendments, the government does not support the amendments he has proposed-and the government does not support them because they suggest that the regulator would have the power to initiate the review, which is the subject of this issue, and also approve the qualifications of the person to conduct the review and to receive the report. That is not, in the government's view, an appropriate role for the regulator. The government's bill provides, alternatively, that the review is required to be independent and to provide a report for the government's consideration. The review is, however, a review of government policy approaches to achieving the government's policy objective of accelerating the deployment of renewable energy to ensure that 20 per cent of electricity supply comes from renewable sources by the year 2020. As the minister has policy responsibility for the effective operation of the renewable energy target, it is appropriate in the government's view for the minister to initiate the review and select the person who will undertake these functions. Having said that, I move: That the question be now put. Question agreed to. Original question negatived.",146

(20) Schedule 1, page 6, after proposed item 8D, insert: 8E Paragraph 160(2)(b) Omit “eligible renewable energy sources”, substitute “eligible energy sources”. The additional supplementary memorandum concerns an amendment that will enable existing power stations using waste coalmine gas as a fuel source to participate in the renewable energy target scheme for a specified period. As I indicated in the second reading summing up, the cessation of the New South Wales Greenhouse Gas Reduction Scheme, known as GGAS, may impose a significant cost on existing electricity generators using waste coalmine gas. Affected entities have indicated that currently profitable projects could be forced to close under these changes. Inclusion of these existing generators under the Renewable Energy Target scheme is intended as a transitional measure to underpin the the continued viability of projects that have already been committed. Over time the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, the CPRS, will provide an increasing incentive in favour of low-emissions generation such as waste coalmine gas. To provide this transitional support the amendment restricts eligibility to existing waste coalmine gas fuelled power stations and limof that its the period over which generation from these power stations will be eligible to create tradeable renewable energy certificates, or RECs. This period is to begin on 1 July 2011 and to end on 31 December 2020. The case for extending eligibility beyond 2020, and thereby allowing new projects, is not, in the government's view, strong; and the measure is not appropriate. A carbon price under the CPRS will provide an increasing incentive in favour of low-emissions generation, including waste coalmine gas. The CPRS will also provide a strong incentive to reduce fugitive emissions to reduce the CPRS liability. The amendments also impose annual caps on the amount of generation for which each eligible waste coalmine gas fuelled power station can claim RECs. Each power station's cap, called the 2008 waste coalmine gas limit, will be set by the RET scheme regulator. The annual eligibility cap is to be based on the power station's generation from waste coalmine gas in 2008, with adjustment for unusual factors such as plant outages and taking into account 1997 generation baselines set under the RET scheme for power stations which commenced operation prior to 1 January 1997. Waste coalmine gas is not a renewable energy source and is not intended to contribute to the 20 per cent target for renewables in 2020. To clearly differentiate waste coalmine gas from renewable energy sources, the amendments create a new concept of an eligible energy source that comprises the current list of eligible renewable energy sources and separately eligible waste coalmine gas. To ensure the inclusion of waste coalmine gas under the renewable energy target does not crowd out renewable energy generation, these amendments increases annual targets under the expanded RET scheme for the years 2011 to 2020 to account for the amount of eligible waste coalmine gas fuel generation in these years. Specifically, the target 2011 has been increased by 425 gigawatt hours to account for the half year of eligible generation and the annual targets for 2012 to 2020 have each been increased by 850 gigwatt hours. To ensure that no renewable energy is displaced, total eligible waste coalmine gas generation will not exceed 425 gigawatt hours in 2011 or 850 gigawatt hours for the years 2012 to 2020. That is equal to the amount by which the annual targets are increased under the RET. Increasing the targets will ensure the government is able to deliver on its commitment to achieve 20 per cent of renewable energy in Australia's electricity mix by 2020 while meeting the need for transitional assistance for the waste coalmine gas generation sector. These provisions are to commence, subject of course to passage through parliament, on the day on which the act receives royal assent. I commend these particular amendments concerning this issue to the House. This is a matter in which I have had extensive personal experience in my capacity in the portfolio. These are important amendments to be made and I commend them to the House.",146
191,Mr HUNT,AYES,"The opposition will be accepting these amendments. We appreciate the fact that the government has listened to the quite extensive representations which we have made over the previous months. We have in fact asked questions about this issue. Australian companies Envirogen and Energy Developments did have their future at risk. Today's decision is not perfect, but what it does is this: it includes waste coalmine gas under the renewable energy legislation, it guarantees that existing operations and existing jobs in the hundreds will be saved and it makes a significant step towards achieving the 90 milfor lion tonnes of savings which can be made from waste coalmine gas if it is captured, flared and used to generate electricity, so as to offset the need for the fossil fuel production of energy. Therefore, I make these comments in relation to these amendments. First, we believe that the principle of including waste coalmine gas under the renewable energy legislation is sound. Second, we accept the decision of the government to increase the total target so as to accommodate the waste coalmine gas sector. We think that that was a sensible and prudent action. I understand it may have been necessary to meet some of their political requirements, but we have no opposition to it. Third, we will not oppose this, but we do have some concerns and we implore the government to have these discussions with the companies involved. We think that the year 2030 would be a better year than 2020. Some of the renewables investment made by the relevant waste coalmine gas companies, Envirogen and Energy Developments, is predicated on a 2030 date. It will cost the government no more. It will make no difference in terms of dollars and it will make no difference to the cap. I would simply extend those figures until 2030 and I would ask that the government enter into negotiation with the companies. Our job was to secure the future for those companies to make sure that existing renewable energy jobs were not lost, and we have done that. It has been a difficult fight. We are happy. We have more to do on other issues but we are happy that waste coalmine gas is in the system in the way it is in New South Wales, as it is in Germany, as it is in the United States. So the principle been established. In government, we would move to make sure that additional space was made and that the period for these investments was extended until 2030. However, the government of this day have not done that. We urge them therefore to, firstly, consider extending the period in which existing waste coalmine gas projects are eligible from 2020 until 2030. Secondly, we urge them to enter into discussions with the waste coalmine gas energy providers about extending the range of activities beyond those which are currently in existence to those which may be in existence. There may need to be a separate mechanism. There may need to be an additional component, but we believe that that should happen. On this day, however, there has been a significant victory for the waste coalmine gas sector. I acknowledge the work of the two companies involved. They were concerned about rural jobs; they were concerned about 90 million tonnes of emissions. Now we need to broaden what they want on two fronts, but that is a debate for another day and for the government to deal with the companies directly. But, as I say, we would urge the government, firstly, to extend the date for inclusion from 2020 to 2030 and, secondly, to seek a mechanism which would allow for new developments and new investment. Nevertheless, we regard this as a victory for common sense. I thank the minister for his work and I thank Senator Wong for her work. We will be supporting these amendments.",150
192,Mr OAKESHOTT,AYES,"I will be brief. I only want to raise concerns that I do not think this is common sense. Probably the one thing about common sense is that it is not very common, because this is the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and what I have just heard from the Minister Assisting the Minister for has Climate Change is that waste coalmine gas, WCMG, which is being introduced as part of this amendment, is not a renewable energy source. So here we have the title of a billthe renewable energy amendment bill-and we have an admission that an amendment is introducing an energy source that is not renewable, yet it is going to form part of renewable energy certificates and the renewable energy target. I ask for some confirmation. How are people such as me and members of the community, who have not been party to negotiations, not to see this as once again a browning down of legislation from the government and once again an example of the exact point I made five minutes ago as to the very need for some arms-length independence in this process? This has got to be a science based process, not a political process, and what I see here in this amendment is some sort of agreement done between both sides of this chamber with some sort of individual company or industry sector that I have certainly never heard of before. I just asked my colleague next to me and he had never heard of it before. This WCMG is a new concept that has been introduced into this chamber. Here we have a government amendment on the back end of a renewable energy amendment bill and, at the same time, we also have confirmation in the introduction of this amendment that this is not a renewable energy source. I ask the minister: what on earth is going on?",151
193,Mr COMBET,AYES,"Charlton-Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change) (9.35 pm)-I understand the issues that have been raised by the member for Lyne and respect his contribution. I did make the comments in introducing the proposed amendment that coalmine waste gas is not a renewable energy source and it has been defined in accordance with these amendments as an eligible energy source. There are very important public policy reasons for dealing with this issue in this particular way. The New South Wales GGAS schemeintroduced, I think, the better part of ade ago by Premier Carr-is what could be described as a baseline and credit scheme. It has operated to encourage investment in some greenhouse gas abatement activities, and one of the activities that attracted such investment, consistent with the opportunities generated by the GGAS scheme, has been in the area of coalmine waste gas power generation. There are a number of companies involved in this activity. Of the two principal ones, both of them developed a business plan and made their investments on the basis of GGAS being in operation. They account for some energy generation, following the capture of coalmine methane gas, which has contributed to the grid. However, their business plan is in significant part contingent upon the value of the certificates which are generated under GGAS for the abatement of greenhouse gas that they are engaged in. With the implementation of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the renewable energy legislation, it is clear that there is a positive public policy purpose for making an amendment that the government is moving on this occasion in order to ensure that on a transitional basis those operations are able to continue. We have confined the eligibility for this transitional treatment under this proposed amendment to the year 2020 and we have specified that it is on the basis of 2008 levels of energy production by the existing coalmine waste gas generators. We have quantified the amount of power generation that would qualify for renewable energy certificates so that it operates up to the year 2020 in a defined production sense. In addition to that, in order to preserve and respect the renewable energy target that is contained in the bill-that is, 20 per cent of the electricity supplied by the year 2020 coming from renewable sources, or 45,000 gigawatt hours-the coalmine waste gas generation a decproduction which qualifies for renewable energy certificates under this amendment will operate in addition to the established target. The government understands the issues that have been raised by the member for Lyne. We carefully considered all of these matters and adopted this as the most efficient public policy response. It is a transitional arrangement for the New South Wales GGAS, in effect, and we think it is the most efficient manner for dealing with it. In the overall scheme of things the expanded renewable energy target, with the support of the state and territory governments, is consolidating into a single national renewable energy arrangement. That is, I think, a particularly important thing. To reduce it to a pretty basic level, at stake here are 300 jobs-those of the people involved in this power generation. In my portfolio capacity, in my capacity as a local member and in my capacity as a minister in this government, I can assure you that we are going to support those jobs. We think we are doing it in an appropriate way. I move: That the question be now put. Question agreed to. Original question agreed to.",152
194,Mr COMBET,AYES,"Charlton-Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change) (9.40 pm)-by leave-I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill and move government amendments (1) to (3): (1) Clause 2, page 2 (table item 3), omit the table item, substitute: 3. SchedAt the same time as the proviule 2 sion(s) covered by table item 2. (2) Schedule 2, item 2, page 7 (lines 14 to 16), omit the definition of emissions-intensive trade-exposed activity in subsection 5(1), substitute: emissions-intensive trade-exposed activity means: (a) if regulations are made for the purposes of subsection 167(1) of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Act 2009-an activity that is taken to be an emissions-intensive trade-exposed activity under the emissions-intensive trade-exposed assistance program; or (b) otherwise-an activity prescribed by regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph. (3) Schedule 2, page 13 (after line 5), at the end of the Schedule, add: 22 Transitional regulations The Governor General may make regulations of a transitional nature relating to the transition from the application of paragraph (b) of the definition of sions-intensive trade-exposed activity in subsection 5(1) of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 (as inserted by item 2 of this Schedule) to the application of paragraph (a) of the definition of that expression. The government is committed to passing legislation to implement both the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the renewable energy target scheme as both are needed, as I have said in this place on a number of occasions, to tackle climate change effectively. However, in order to provide greater certainty, the government has decided to amend the renewable energy target legislation currently before the parliament to include interim assistance until the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation is in place. The legislation currently aims to provide assistance under the renewable energy target to activities defined under the emissions-intensive trade-exposed assistance program in the CPRS legislation. This was in recognition of the cumulative cost impact of the renewable energy target scheme and the CPRS. However, in the absence of legislation implementing the CPRS, the scope and the basis for assistance under the RET has had to be reconsidered by the government. The cost impact of the renewable energy target alone, as I have said in my previous submissions in relation to this issue, is related to electricity intensity and is small for most industries. However, the renewable energy target will affect firms using a significant amount of electricity as part of their production processes and where international competition limits their ability to pass electricity cost increases on to their customers. Aluminium smelting, the subject of some discussion in the second reading debate in relation to the bills, is one such obvious activity. This amendment therefore allows for inemis- terim renewable energy target assistance to be provided to those emissions-intensive trade-exposed activities that will be most significantly affected by electricity price creases from the RET, namely those which exceed an electricity threshold of 3,000 megawatt hours per $1 million of revenue or alternatively 9,000 megawatt hours per $1 million of value added. Eligible activities likely to include aluminium smelting, silicon production and newsprint manufacturing. In the case of interim assistance, an exemption would apply for 90 per cent of the liability that relates to the expanded portion of the new annual targets-that is, the amount of the target that is above the 9,500 gigawatt hours which exists under the existing MRET. Once the CPRS legislation and its enabling regulations do come into force, the partial legislated exemptions from the renewable energy target liability would be provided for all emissions-intensive tradeexposed activities as defined under the emissions-intensive trade-exposed assistance program in the CPRS legislation. An exemption would apply for either 90 per cent or 60 per cent of the expanded liability above the existing 9,500 gigawatt hour target, corresponding to whether an activity is determined to be highly emissions intensive or moderately emissions intensive under the CPRS. If the CPRS passes before 1 January 2010, these interim assistance arrangements will never come into force. The government remains committed to assisting all emissionsintensive trade-exposed activities to help manage the cumulative impact of the CPRS and the RET once both pieces of legislation are passed. The amendment appropriately targets assistance under the RET and will provide greater certainty to support investment in renewable energy generation. These provisions are to commence on the day, subject to passage through the parliament, on which the act receives royal assent, and I commend the amendments to the House.",153
195,Mr HUNT,AYES,"The opposition will not be opposing these inamendments. We welcome the fact that there has been a backdown by the government and that they are indicating a willingness to decouple. We will accept them as I note they offer an imperfect safety net for emissionsare intensive trade-exposed businesses, but they nevertheless offer a safety net. We will seek in the Senate to ensure that there is a full decoupling. Those amendments were moved in the House this evening and we will move them again in the Senate unless the government takes steps to negotiate, which it is, and then to present amendments of its own. We believe those negotiations are proceeding in good faith, and I underline that fact, and I thank the government for that, but let it be absolutely clear that these amendments need to go further. Instead of having the existing test which is in place for trade exposed businesses, we have an intensity in terms of electricity use of 3,000 megawatt hours per $1 million of revenue or 9,000 megawatt hours per $1 million of value-add. That will cover a much smaller range of businesses than was contemplated previously by the government. We have offered in good faith to the minister this evening a revised proposal which would go further than the amendment contained here. This provides a beginning. It provides a safety net at the very least for the ceramics and newsprint industries, for the aluminium industry and for others that are still yet to be defined. But we can make this very clear and very easy by replicating the trade exposed provisions, which are already being developed by the government, but by separating them so as the commencement of those trade exposed provisions is not dependent upon passage of the CPRS legislation. There is a very simple solution here which would be acceptable and sensible, and that is to simply ensure that the commencement of the full trade exposed provisions for the 90 per cent qualifying firms and the 60 per cent qualifying firms is untied from the emissions trading scheme, will begin on 1 January 2010 and will not be dependent upon any other legislation. That is simple, it is elegant, it ensures that we have clear way forward and that we will not face any blockage in this bill this week. Having said all of that, we appreciate the fact that the government has made a significant concession. It has moved away from its view-expressed by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation as late as Friday nightthat there would be no decoupling. This is a decoupling. It is not the full decoupling which we would ideally want, but it is a decoupling. Our view in the Senate will, to a significant extent, depend upon the additional work, but we accept that there is negotiation in good faith. I thank the government for that and we will accept these amendments.",154
196,Mr COMBET,AYES,"Charlton-Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change) (9.47 pm)-In light of a couple of the observations made by the shadow minister, I think it is appropriate to put on the record a couple of things. The original construction of these arrangements-that is, the so-called coupling of the CPRS and the RET-was a consequence of what I think is an efficient public policy approach by the government; that is, it was out of respect for submissions made to the government by representatives from industries within the emissions-intensive trade-exposed sector that they believed that consistent treatment for the assistance that applies under the CPRS and the RET for those industries would be a desirable end. The matter was discussed at meeting of the Council of Australian Governments in, I think, late May this year, and it was agreed that, in the process of establishing the national renewable energy target scheme, that was an appropriate mechanism for dealing with the issue. That has been the context for the so-called coupling-against which the opposition has raised a number of objections on a number of occasions. It was a suggested that that would be one of the reasons contemplated by the opposition for potentially voting against the renewable energy legislation. In light of the decision by the opposition-a decision we believe to be irresponsible-to vote against the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in the Senate, the government reconsidered this issue and, far from it being a backdown, it is demonstration of our firm intent to address climate change by, in part, ensuring the passage of the renewable energy target legislation. That is the appropriate construction for the amendment that has been put. I have explained it in some detail and I reinforce what I said earlier, and that is that I think it is an appropriate response in the current circumstances.
