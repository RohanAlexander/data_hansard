1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA First Reading Bill presented by Mr Williams, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
2,Mr WILLIAMS,SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to be able to move the introduction of a piece of legislation that will make the law fairer by removing or limiting protection for unjustified discrimination. The bill if enacted will remove or limit exemptions in subsections 40(2) and 40(3) of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. When the Sex Discrimination Act was enacted, exemptions for specified legislation were included to ensure that a person would not be in breach of the act by complying with the requirements of another law. Over the years, the scope of these exemptions has been reduced and the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1996 takes that process one step further. The bill implements the outcomes of the review required under section 40A of the Sex Discrimination Act. In accordance with that section, on 31 May 1996 I completed a review of the operation of exemptions in subsections 40(2) and 40(3). Although the form of the bill does not exactly follow the drafting style proposed in the recommendations of the review document regarding repeal, the outcomes are the same. These differences have arisen simply as a result of advice from parliamentary counsel. I stress that the outcomes are the same. The review document, which was tabled in both houses of parliament on 26 June 1996, contains a useful summary of the history of section 40 exemptions. As indicated in that document, the review was carried out in consultation with relevant federal government departments, ministers with responsibility for the legislation currently specified in the exemption provisions and with the government of Norfolk Island. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner assisted with that part of BILL 1996 the review dealing with the federal social security legislation and was also consulted in relation to exemptions by reference to taxation legislation. I will return to the social security aspect of the review later. Mr Speaker, subsection 40(2) of the Sex Discrimination Act currently ..... ijfovides an exemption for anything done by a person in direct compliance with specified legislation in force as at 1 August 1984. These exemptions will be described in the context of the changes to be implemented. Taxation legislation Paragraphs (a), (c), (d), (f) and (i) of subsection 40(2) of the Sex Discrimination Act provide for exemption by reference to the Gift Duty Assessment Act 1941, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the International Tax Agreements Act 1953, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935 and the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Act 1982 respectively. The exemption currently applies to all grounds of discrimination covered by the Sex Discrimination Act-that is, sex, marital status, pregnancy and potential pregnancy. After consulting with the Treasurer (Mr Costello), it has been agreed that the exemption by reference to the taxation legislation referred to will be amended so that it is limited to an exemption for marital status discrimination only. The reasons for retaining an exemption for marital status discrimination are set out in the review document tabled in June 1996. They include factors such as the unfairness of exposing people to the retrospective operation of legislation and the need to adhere to provisions which give effect to international agreements. In other circumstances, it has been agreed that it would be inappropriate for taxation policy designed to protect the public interest to be overridden by the objectives of the Sex Discrimination Act. Thus, certain anti-avoidance provisions designed to protect the revenue will continue to be protected by the exemption. Subsection 40(3) currently provides an exemption by reference to section 6 of the Sex Discrimination Act-which deals with marital status discrimination-for anything done by a person in direct compliance with any regulations, rules, by-laws, determinations or directions made under the Gift Duty Assessment Act 1941, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 or the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935. Again, after consultation with the Treasurer, it has been agreed that the exemption by reference to the Gift Duty Assessment Act 1941 is no longer required. The reference to that act will therefore be deleted from the subsection. Social Services Act 1980 of Norfolk Island Paragraph (j) of subsection 40(2) of the Sex Discrimination Act currently provides an exemption for the Norfolk Island social security legislation. This exemption covers all grounds of discrimination covered by the Sex Discrimination Act 1984-sex, marital status, pregnancy and potential pregnancy. After consultations with the Norfolk Island government, it has been agreed that there is no need for such a wide exemption. The Norfolk Island legislation discriminates on the ground of sex in that it provides for differential access to age pensions for men and women. The government of Norfolk Island has sought a continuation of an exemption for this discrimination but will give consideration to phasing in a common age for eligibility. Additionally, the Norfolk Island government has sought to narrow the existing exemption so that it covers marital status discrimination only, arising in the context of the rate of benefit payable. The government of Norfolk Island has identified potential discrimination on this ground in the application of different income thresholds and the fact that a person's marital status will affect the amount of benefit paid. National Health Act 1953 Paragraph (b) of subsection 40(2) provides an exemption by reference to the operation of the definition of 'pensioner' in subsection (4)(1) of the National Health Act and by reference to the operation of the definition of 'concessional beneficiary' in subsection 84(1) of that act. The definitions affect the administration of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Because they mirror the provisions that apply different pension ages for pension eligibility for women and men under the social security regime, it is ensured that women and men who are eligible for pensions are also eligible to receive pharmaceutical benefits at concessional rates. However, because differential access to age pensions based on sex is being phased out, the bill amends the existing exemption by providing for it to expire concurrently with implementation of the phasing out of differential access to age pensions-that is, the exemption will have no effect on or after I January 2014. Papua New Guinea (Members of the Forces Benefits) Act 1957 The bill proposes repeal of the existing exemption by reference to the Papua New Guinea (Members of the Forces Benefits) Act 1957 as the exemption is no longer considered necessary. I tum now to consideration of paragraph (h) of subsection 40(2), which provides an exemption by reference to the Social Security Act 1947. As indicated in the review document, this aspect of the review raised complex and difficult legal issues concerning the validity or operation of this paragraph. On one view, the paragraph is redundant because the 1947 act was repealed and replaced by the Social Security Act 1991 prior to the coming into force of paragraph (h) of subsection 40(2). On this view, repeal of the paragraph would have no substantive effect. However, there is an alternative view, which is that the paragraph operates to provide an exemption, albeit of a limited nature. Because of the ambiguity surrounding the operation and effect of paragraph (h) of subsection 40(2), the steering committee, established by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to assist with the social security aspect of the review, examined the provision of social security against the benchmark of legislation and practices which may constitute 'in principle discrimination'. The bill proposes no action in relation to paragraph (h). However, as indicated in the review document, I will, in conjunction with the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), make recommendations for appropriate action regarding this paragraph when we report back to parliament in June 1997. I note that the matters identified by the steering committee as potentially problematic were referred to the Minister for Social Security for consideration. I reiterate that it was clearly stated in the review document that we will jointly report back to parliament in relation to both the 'in principle discrimination' identified by the steering committee and in relation to paragraph (h) of subsection 40(2) of the Sex Discrimination Act. That joint report will be made no later than 26 June 1997. The financial impact of the bill is negligible. This bill reflects the government's commitment to equal opportunity and the prevention of discrimination. It is also consistent with and an indication of our policy that exemptions in the Sex Discrimination Act should be limited and that where possible all federal legislation should be consistent with the objectives of the Sex Discrimination Act. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. NA BILL (No.2) 1996 Consideration in Detail Clause 1. Consideration resumed from 4 November. Reference to Committee",13
3,Mr LEE,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,by leave-I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Dobell from moving a motion to refer the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No.2) 1996 to the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs for consideration and an advisory report to the House as soon as possible. We are not too confident that we will be successful in moving this particular motion.,15
4,Mr FILING,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Why is that, Michael?",15
5,Mr LEE,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,We certainly hope to have the support of the Independent members. ,15
6,Mr LEE,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"And the support of the honourable member for Chifley . We are seeking, in this particular motion, to allow all members of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs and all members of the House of Representatives an opportunity to consider this matter in detail. No doubt the Minister fop :6ealth and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) will tell us that a Senate committee is also going to look at this particular matter tomorrow for a few hours-if it is lucky, if it has time, to consider this bill and a couple of others. It is quite clear that the matters and the issues raised in this bill are very complex. The difficulty that we in this House face is that the few hours at the most that the Senate committee will spend considering the bill tomorrow is woefully inadequate. I learnt yesterday that, for whatever reason, Senator Knowles, the chair of the committee, convened a meeting of that committee last Monday morning with very little notice being given to some of the opposition members of that committee. A decision was taken at that meeting not to allow people such as Tony Lawler, the interns' representative on the AMA Federal Council, to appear and give evidence at that committee. That does not place a great deal of credit on the government. If they were seeking to claim that they have won this debate on the force of their argument-and given that the minister, in some cases, has been quite generous with his time in speaking and listening to the views of the medical students and interns-I find it hard to understand why the minister has personally not been prepared to speak to Senator Knowles. If he has, maybe he could tell us what he has said to Senator Knowles. I would certainly be interested to know whether the minister is now prepared to give the House an assurance that he will seek to ensure that all those who are stakeholders in this issue-in particular, all those who have worked hard to try to ensure that the interests of medical students and interns are protected-have the chance to be heard on Thursday before the Senate committee. I certainly think it is an interesting development to listen to the concerns that have been raised by people-the medical students and the interns. These are the people whom the minister at the table used to represent not too many years ago before his entry into the Australian parliament.",15
7,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,It was a long time. Mr MCMullan-it just feels that long.,16
8,Mr LEE,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"It probably feels even longer. I can assure the minister that, having represented those people in days gone by, they feel especially hurt, if not betrayed, that the person who used to represent them is now not prepared to take some action to try to persuade his Liberal colleagues to at least give them a chance to be heard before the Senate committee. I would ask the minister to give some consideration to that. In speaking earlier in the second reading debate on this bill, I outlined the opposition's grave concerns about the bill. In particular, we believe that the retrospective nature of the bill makes it very difficult to support. In the second reading debate I referred to comments that had previously been made by the current Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), who has made it clear that he considers that retrospective legislation that tries to enact the intentions of government decisions that are announced in ministerial press releases are a contempt of the parliament. In fact, the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) referred to retrospective legislation as a fairly dangerous animal. It is therefore quite interesting that within six months of this government being elected, we have this minister introducing legislation which is clearly retrospective. If passed by the Senate later this year or early next year, this legislation will take away the opportunities for people to obtain a Medicare provider number. It takes effect as of last Friday, so it is clearly retrospective. That is the first point-it is retrospective legislation. The second point is that we believe that it has quite an unfair impact on the students and the interns who in some cases have dedicated up to seven years to study and training. It will also to some extent neuter the investment of more than $100,000 of taxpayers' money in training those students and interns. We also continue to have concerns about the impact it will have on the career options for medical graduates, particularly women medical graduates, who may not wish to proceed immediately to full-time postgraduate training. Current patterns of practice indicate that there is a high percentage of women who do not choose to undertake full-time postgraduate training immediately. Finally, we are very concerned about the impact that this legislation will have on the provision of medical services in rural and regional Australia. The minister for health has continued to assure us that there will be more than enough places for all Australian graduates. I will say a bit more about this later in the consideration in detail stage-that is, if this particular motion is unsuccessful. The minister has repeatedly said that it is his belief that there will be enough places for all of the Australian graduates. When the interns and the medical students meet the minister and he tells them that that is his belief, they go one step further and ask the minister to give them a guarantee that his belief will actually be a fact. They ask the minister to give them a guarantee that every Australian trained graduate who is up to the right standard and passes all the exams will be able to obtain a Medicare provider number. If the minister is unable to give that guarantee, because he does not have enough faith in the figures that he quotes in the House, on radio and on television-he clearly does not have enough faith in his own figures-why should the medical students and the interns, whose careers will be decided by this legislation, have sufficient faith in him? The minister has also claimed that these reforms will encourage more doctors to practise in rural areas. I hope that the minister is right in these claims because, despite our efforts, it seems unlikely that he will be able to prevent the passage of this unfair and retrospective bill. But the opposition remains unconvinced of Dr Wooldridge's assurances. This motion that we are considering at the moment seeks to suspend standing orders so that we can refer this bill to a House of Representatives committee, which clearly the Labor Party does not have a majority on. This is the way that I think this House, and not Senate, can give proper consideration to this committee. When the committees of this House were reformed and given an expanded role in 1987 many of us thought that more legislation would be referred to House of Representatives committees. To give some credit to the Senate, certainly in opposition I have been attracted to this enhanced role for House of Representatives committees. In New Zealand, for example-of course, they only have the one house-it is pretty standard that all of their legislation goes before a committee before it goes to the whole house. This issue has been a matter of great controversy. It will only affect a small number Australians. It will not change the lives of millions of Australians. But for this small number of Australians who have dedicated many years of their lives to studying medicine, this will have a very dramatic effect on their futures. We at least owe it to those people and to the people whom Dr Wooldridge used to represent before he was a member of parliament to allow the House of Representatives Family and Community Affairs Committee a chance to consider this. When asking in my motion to suspend standing orders to allow me to refer this legislation to the House of Representatives committee for consideration and advice as soon as possible, I do not mean a quick and nasty Senate legislative committee report where they give people a couple of hours to present their evidence and there is a report back within a few days. If we wanted to do justice to the legitimate issues that the minister is wanting to debate and if he has enough faith in the arguments that he put to the House two days ago, he would be prepared to allow perhaps several weeks for people to give evidence and be able to put their opinions before members of this House and to allow the members of that committee, even though it clearly has a majority of government members on it, to present a report to this chamber to allow us to consider the mechanisms in detail. For those reasons, we are seeking to suspend standing orders to allow this reference the to the House of Representatives committee. We would hope to have the support of not only the Independent members of the chamber but perhaps even one or two members of the government who think that this is an issue that is worthy of deeper consideration.",16
9,Mr SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Is the motio» seconded?  the motion. I will not take up much of the time of the House. In seconding the motion moved by the shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), my understanding is that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) claims that the moves he is taking seek to preserve the long-term future of Medicare. I have to of say that, whilst we might debate the mechanism, we do not disagree with that aim and objective. So this is a case where both sides of the parliament are committed to such a course of action. The shadow minister has moved that the legislation be referred to the family and community affairs committee of the parliament. Of course committees, as the shadow minister has mentioned, are only a relatively recent institution in this House. They have always had a legislative responsibility. I have to say that I believe we have not made best use of the role of the committees of the parliament. Indeed, when I recall some of the speeches by now government members in the last parliament, they were very critical of the way in which legislation was rushed through the parliament. I think all parliamentarians ought to stand and support the idea that such an important bit of legislation as the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No.2) 1996 should be referred to a committee of the parliament for consideration and report back. It is something that the Senate committees do quite regularly. I would like to see the House committees utilised in this way. The bill retrospectively restricts provider numbers for new doctors. If this measure is the appropriate mechanism, I guess I would be arguing with the minister that it should not be taken retrospectively, but that it should be takenMr Fitzgibbon- Mr Speaker, I am very reluctant to take a point of order on my colleague the member for Chifley while he is speaking. The Chief Government Whip has just entered the chamber. We are having a very serious debate here on a very important issue. I am trying to hear what the member for Chifley is saying. I am being somewhat distracted by the Chief Government Whip. He bursts into this place, all guns blazing. He summonses the shadow minister at the table to the back of the chamber and proceeds to berate him. He then proceeds to the front benchMr MCGauran- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: this is a frivolous action by the member. It is not a point of order. to cite the standing order under which he rises.",17
10,Mr SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"The minister will resume his seat. I was aware of the cross-chamber debate. I always find that quite irritating. If the shadow minister at the table and the Chief Government Whip wish to pursue some vigorous debate, then I would invite them to do so outside the chamber.  point I was trying to make is that if these changes are necessary-and I am not convinced they are-I very much deplore the fact that they are being made retrospectively and without adequate notice to those currently studying medicine. I have spoken in this House before about opportunities for people to enter professions and to undertake university courses. I say to the minister that one of the pleasing features I note in the western suburbs of Sydney is the increasing number of students enrolling for medicine; probably one of the most difficult faculties to enter. I would ask the minister whether he can advise the House if he thinks it worthwhile for the committee to examine whether or not people from ordinary working class backgrounds will be precluded from seeking a career in the medical profession. We have had many speeches in this parliament about the viciousness of retrospective taxation. With this measure somehow retrospectivity is given a noble cause. Again, we agree with the aims of the minister. We are not convinced of his methodology. If we refer it to the committee, we can see whether or not the bipartisan approach normally adopted by committees can be adopted in this case. The arguments and the reservations can be thoroughly examined and reported back to the House. I certainly support the motion moved by the shadow minister at the table.",18
11,Mr FILING,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,I would like to make a couple of comments in relation to this matter. I want to look at it from the perspective of Western Australia. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) is only too well aware that there are some unique characteristics relating I would ask him to Western Australia.,18
12,Mr CADMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Oh, come on!",18
13,Mr FILING,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I am also getting irritated by the Chief Government Whip using the area at the front as a stamping ground for his views.

14,Mr FILING,NOES,"I wish to speak on clause I-and with a bit of luck I will not get gagged by the Chief Government Whip, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), who is just departing from the chamber. This government promised to raise parliamentary standards. I am holding my breath waiting for that because all I was trying to do this morning was represent the interests of my state. I know the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) would be only too happy to answer my concerns and only too happy to expand on them because I know he has strong views. I wanted to represent the interests of medical students and the interests of the state. I remind the member for Swan (Mr Randall), the member for Canning (Mrs Johnston), the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) and the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who are not members of the ministry and do not have to follow the edicts of the ministerial line, the cabinet solidarity, on this matter that the Western Australian government has indicated very strong concerns about this particular move because it NOES impacts in an unfair way on Western Australian interests. Western Australia has some unique characteristics in relation to medical practitioners, as the minister well knows. All I was endeavouring to do by supporting the motion of the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) was to allow there to be a greater examination of those particular interests. Before the members of the Labor Party take PAIRS any comfort from what I have done this morning, I point out that this is a response to the Labor Party's administration of our health care system for 13 years. In essence, the coalition went to the election very strongly committed to preserving Medicare and preserving bulk-billing. Clearly they had become popular because people like to go to the doctor and like to not have to pay, and that is understandable. But the difficulty is that, at the end of the day, there is a reckoning and part of the reckoning is this process. Unfortunately, in endeavouring to genuinely solve this particular problem-that is, the oversupply of GPs, particularly in Sydney and Melbournewe see a uniform standard being applied to the entire continent. That is the problem. This is where Western Australia's interests, unfortunately, in this particular case are not being properly looked after. That is why I believe that the shadow minister's motion to have the matter referred to a parliamentary committee was a positive move. I can recollect only too well from my experience as a member of the Liberal Party that in the party room the coalition parties when they were in opposition were very keen to have bills referred to House of Representatives committees for review. In some instances decisions are made in not so much a hasty way but in a way that is not necessarily in the best interest of all concerned and not necessarily in the best interests of the administration of policy. In my view, unfortunately, there are some aspects of the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No.2) 1996 that would unfairly impact on Western Australia. As the minister well  already indicated, Australia's oversupply of metropolitan doctors is a Sydney and Melbourne problem and WA has got the numbers about right. He said: You have introduced changes meant to fix a problem that does not exist in this statethat is the state of Western AustraliaWA relies on its city-based junior doctors to man a highly successful locum support program for country doctors, which has led to doctor vacancies in all rural towns, except Laverton, Even in the metropolitan area we have problems; in my electorate. My job as the member for Moore is to represent the interests of my constituents first. I am still trying to get a locum service for the areas of Merriwa, Clarkson and Butler, which are metropolitan suburban areas. We cannot get locum services there and I am told by the Western Australian minister, 'Go to the doctors and ask them to do it.' I have been to them and I have tried. Unfortunately, the private market for services is not able to fill that particular need and so we have a situation where the problem is going to be compounded by legislation introduced by the coalition. It is going to unfairly impact on the families in my electorate. As their member I am going to represent their interests first ahead of any philosophical view that somehow this is going to solve the problems created by 13 years of incompetent administration of our health care system by the previous Labor government. I know that the minister is sincere; I have seen him at work. I know that he has the best interests at heart but Western Australia's interests in this matter are being overlooked. (Time expired)",20
15,Mr LEE,NOES,I wish to take up the point raised by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing).  previously.,21
16,Mr LEE,NOES,"It was a pity he was gagged by the government whip--it is a very disturbing event to take place in the House at such an early hour-but I can say to the honourable member that he has obviously raised a very serious issue and that is the concern he has that his constituents do not have access to after-hours medical care and hence his support for the locum service. Perhaps both of us could ask the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) if he could tell us how this particular piece of legislation will affect the people who provide these services; not just in Western Australia or Perth but right around the country. If there is already a shortage of doctors in some of the outer metropolitan areas, and we all know there is a shortage of doctors in rural areasparticularly at hospitals-how will this bill being filled. address that? I would like to pick up one issue that was raised by the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Cadman) in the second reading debate in which he claimed that his local hospitals were mainly staffed by temporary re--ent doctors. Minister, certainly in the last lew weeks you have been claiming that all Australian-trained graduates will now be able to obtain a provider number because there will be sufficient training places for someone to either go onto the general practice training program or onto one of the specialist training programs. I hope that assurance that you have given the doctors and the figures you have outlined to them-it is not a guarantee; it is a beliefare accurate. Let us assume for the moment that your figures are correct. How does that put one extra Australian-trained doctor into the hospitals in the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee? That is a very important point because we get people such as the honourable member claiming that because Australian-trained doctors will not get Medicare provider numbers there will be few options open to them other than to become a salaried doctor in one of Australia's rural hospitals. I think that is certainly the argument that the honourable member was making and there does seem to be a bit of a contradiction between the claim by the Minister for Health and Family Services that every Australian-trained doctor will get a Medicare provider number-if they are up to the appropriate standard-and the honourable member's apparent belief that in some way his measure is going to deliver more doctors into rural public hospitals. So I would be very grateful if the Minister could expand on those two issues. Surely this legislation is going to mean it will be even harder to staff the locum services, not just in Perth but in other metropolitan areas, and will it not also mean that, if the figures produced by the honourable member for Mallee are correct, there will be no extra Australiantrained doctors in rural hospitals.",21
17,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,NOES,"I must express my disappointment in one sense with the comments of the member for Moore (Mr Filing) about 13 years of mismanagement. We have this constant diatribe running that somehow Labor mismanaged health for 13 years and there is a massive disaster, then they massively endorse Medicare. They want it both ways all the time; there is this constant attempt at rhetoric and reality. They are all staunch Medicare supporters but they also say it has been a dreadful 13 years of mismanagement. For God's sake, what an insult to people's intelligence. This whole issue is a fabrication and a distortion. It is a government trying to find ways to project savings when it does not actually do so. This is a Clayton's savings in a sense: the minister says to students, 'It will not really affect as many as you think, it is nowhere nearly as bad as you think it is.' On the other hand he tells the financial markets, 'This is going to be a massive saving on government expenditure.' He does not say it is going to be a massive cut in the health budget; it will not change, there will be more than enough doctors, the students will all be okay. They are running five different lines for five different audiences. What is really difficult is working out how the savings will occur. How many people are there like the minister with Medicare numbers who do not use them; how many Medicare numbers are out there being used once a week; how many doctors are retired but still have their Medicare numbers? The range of Medicare provider number usage should be available. Medical students and young doctors are entitled to know a lot more than they have been told so far. If the statistics are not available, well, okay, tell them that; tell you do not know. But to come out with categorical savings and fixed numbers and somehow then extrapolate from that that this is going to protect Medicare is patently absurd-patently absurd. I chaired a parliamentary inquiry last year into access and equity for people from nonEnglish speaking backgrounds. A large part of that inquiry became caught up in the question of recognition of overseas skills, particularly medical skills. Around Australia overseas trained doctors and communities made submissions to us about the complications that existed-and they were quite difficult. We had one witness who told us that he was here as a temporary resident practising medicine and that he came back regularly. In other words, he repeatedly came over on a short-term visa, went away and returned on another short-term visa. If he stayed here permanently, he could not practise because he would have to go through the whole accreditation process. These TRDs-temporary registered doctors-were a fact of life in much of Australia. At the same time, there were a lot of people here with overseas skills and training who could not practise. Those things evolved over decades. They were not caused by Medicare; they were not caused by the last government. They have been a feature of our system for a very long time. In that inquiry last year, it become obvious that these things needed to be addressed. So dispersed throughout this issue is a whole range of questions. We have the distribution of doctors; adequate career paths; retraining and maintenance of skills for doctors who have been trained and are practising now. We have the question of overseas trained doctors. We have the question of rural and remote areas. There is a whole range of issues, all of which are affected by this legislation. On budget night the government announced this massive change-massive in the sense that it appears to do something, but it only affects a certain group of people. It does not them address anything else at all which hangs off it. It impacts on a whole range of areas but affects very few-it just affects a group of people. In that context the logical thing for the government to do is to have some discussion, to canvass all the issues involved in an attempt to reconcile the contradictions inherent in this legislation with its associated competing attitudes and interests. But most importantly of all, it should be done generally to try to improve the health system. This legislation will not improve the health system. If anything, it will create sufficient angst, discontent and distrust amongst the medical fraternity to undermine the health system. It will not help Medicare. It will not help the hospitals. It will just create greater numbers of angry people in the health system. We know there is enough frustration in there now, with the uncertainty that they are facing. All this legislation does is undermine the health system. This government came in with a mandate to support Medicare and improve it. This legislation does not even attempt that. The minister should start to answer some of these questions. (Time expired)",22
18,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NOES,"This has been a wide-ranging debate on clause 1. If you might allow me, I will try to answer some of the questions but it will take a little time. 'If you do not reform Medicare, it dies' 'unrestricted access into general practice is time bomb waiting to destroy Medicare'. They are not my words; they are the words of the former Labor Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe in April this year. Brian Howe of course was health minister and someone who was very committed to Medicare. Brian Howe is right: if you do not reform Medicare, it dies. And Brian Howe is also right: unrestrictunless ed access into general practice is a time bomb waiting to destroy Medicare. In the end, if you have an open-ended fee-for-service system, as we do-and we are one of the few countries in the world now that looks like maintaining this system-and if you have a very large supply of doctors, you have costs that are completely out of control. That is basis behind this piece of legislation. Of course, it is not just Brian Howe. As stated in the Bulletin of 1 October 1996, 'Too many doctors squandering the Medicare dollar': It's tough on the current crop of medical students, very tough, but it's the only way forward ... The AMA was told in 1993 that restrictions on Medicare provider numbers were inevitable. I told the AMA this would happen regardless of who govemed Australia . . . That was Graham Richardson, a former Labor Party health minister as well. You do not have to believe my words; believe the words of two former Labor Party health ministers. Yes, this is a tough piece of legislation. It is one I have given very serious thought to. But if we wish to see our health sys-m survive, it has to be done. ."", I did not speak on the suspension of standing orders. I did not have a prepared speech either, because we did not know it was coming on. But I was happy to accommodate the shadow minister. Let me just refer to some of those points. The government does not support a reference to the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, although we did give it serious consideration and I thank the shadow minister for giving me plenty of notice that that was his intention. In the end it would only exacerbate the problem of the start-up date. The start-up date was last Friday. That and does not really disadvantage any existing a medical students because they do not graduate anyway until 1 January. November 1 is important as a start-up date because of the large number of overseas trained doctors going through the AMC process at the moment. It was announced on budget night and, like much budget legislation, it does take some while to get the legislation through. But, we want to find ourselves with another 300 or so overseas trained doctors whom we were not intending to have unrestricted access to Medicare get through, 1 November has to be the start-up date. As for the Senate committee, I can tell the minister quite honestly that I found out about that at about 9 o'clock this morning. Although the I believe that my staff knew about it, I was only told this morning. I personally have had no input into what Senator Knowles has done whatsoever. I cannot speak for my staff; I really just do not know. I certainly have not asked Senator Knowles to do or not to do anything. I think that would be, quite frankly, improper. I let the other place carry out its affairs as it sees best, although I will try to find out what has happened and who has been asked and who has not been asked. But, as I have said, I was only made aware of that first thing this morning. As to the interests of the medical students being protected, I was not elected to federal parliament to protect the interests of medical students; I was elected to the federal parliament to protect the interests of the Australian public-and I will do that first. I am concerned about the genuine anxiety that medical students seem to feel because of this piece of legislation. However, much of that is illfounded and based on the fact that many of the claims being made by their leaders are simply factually incorrect. Yes, I understand they feel hurt and they feel betrayed. They would feel more hurt and betrayed if we allowed the ridiculous system we have at the moment to continue, whereby 50 per cent of Australia's medical school graduates are coming in again each year as overseas trained doctors. If we let that happen not only would Medicare collapse but also we would have the real prospect of doctors(Extension of time granted) The shadow minister mentioned this would unfairly disadvantage women. Again, that is something I have taken very seriously. It was something that was part of the original announcement on budget night. I don't think this will be the case. These were claims made by me in the vocational registration debate in 1989. It was a concern of mine then. My concerns of 1989 have not been borne out. When I look back at the concerns that I had at the time, seven years experience has shown us that they did not come to pass. If you look at the group of other medical practitioners, non-vocationally recognised general practitioners, women are underrepresented in that group, not overrepresented. If anything, we could perhaps run the argument that men have been disadvantaged but certainly women. Before the shadow minister gets too excited about my speech in 1989, I have reread it and I am prepared to admit that time has shown my concerns to be unfounded. The member for Moore (Mr Filing) talked about the shortage of doctors in his electorate and in Western Australia. Western Australia does not have a shortage of doctors by any objective measure. This is a misconception that most people in Western Australia have. The honourable member for Moore is certainly not alone. It is a misconception that a good number of my Liberal Party colleagues over there have. The facts are that in terms of doctor-population ratio Western Australia is just about right. Its rate of graduation of medical students is just about right. Certainly, it is not low. Western Australia, like many other rural parts of Australia and countries that have vast rural regions to cover around the world, has trouble getting doctors into country areas. I was in Indonesia a couple of weeks ago. One of their major problems is getting doctors into rural areas. They actually force every young doctor to go to the country for two years if they go to a remote area and three years if they go to a rural area, without exception. It is not a problem alone for Australia. I have taken this very seriously. I do not wish to do anything that disadvantages rural areas. Western Australia has a particularly good set-up with respect to local services. The Western Australia College of Rural Medicine, W ACRM, is a model that other places in Australia could follow. We have been able to meet their concerns by allowing W ACRM to issue temporary provider numbers. So what is happening currently in Western Australia will continue to exist. The shadow minister asked me about extra doctors in Mallee. It will do a couple of things. First of all, the temporary registered doctors will still be able to come to Australia and this will not harm those areas that rely on the temporary registered doctors in any way. What it will do beyond that is make rural hospitals attractive to young doctors in a way they are not attractive at the moment. It will mean that if you are a young doctor wanting to go into general practice you can go into Mallee and get a guarantee of a place in the general practice training program after a period of time. So the honourable member hopefully will find it easier to get the staffing positions in his hospitals. As part of this, there is an amount of money to improve training in country hospitals. We will be looking at ways we can do that so that these young doctors are not left alone and can substantially benefit from the experience they have. The member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) raised a couple of points. To address them will take more than the minute I have left. He questioned substantially how you make savings. The budget process is such that you have to make your best estimate. As we found out with many Labor government budgets, that did not prove to be precisely correct. But you make your best estimate. That is done by the Department of Finance, not by any individual department. The principal savings will come from overseas trained doctors. They will come from turning off the tap that Brian Howe himself said was threatening to destroy Medicare. I have not made any categorical statement of savings. What I have said is that we have put some numbers in the budget and that is what the Department of Finance determined. That this is going to protect Medicare is patently absurd' was the claim of the member for Newcastle-(Time expired)",23
19,Mr LEE,NOES,"I think the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has let the cat out of the bag. In response to my questions about how the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) can claim that additional Australian trained doctors will be employed in his hospitals, the minister said words to the effect that if Australian trained doctors work in the hospitals in Mallee there is a guarantee that after a period of time they will get a place on the training program. I think that is what the minister said. I hope I have not misquoted him. Surely, Minister, that means there is a pool of people who are not going to get access to a training place. Therefore, they have to make a choice. They can go to the hospital in the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee, which will please the honourable member for Mallee, and then the students have to wait a period of time before they get a training place. Can the minister please explain the contradiction between his often stated belief, certainly in the last few weeks, that every Australian trained medical student and intern will get a training place and his statement a few minutes ago that there will be more doctors in the hospitals in the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee because students will have to wait some period of time and be given accelerated status if they do go to these rural hospitals? That is the first question. The second point to make is that the minister claims this is the only w- to address concerns that he has about the number of doctors affecting the total cost of Medicare. If this parliament is willing to consider draconian, retrospective legislation that limits access to provider numbers, why aren't we prepared to introduce tough legislation that might have upset the deans of the medical schools and the vice-chancellors but would have allowed this parliament very clearly to assert that the government should have the right to set the number of students who start medical training in each of the schools at universities right round the country? I can tell you, Minister, that that would have been a measure that we would have been prepared to consider because that would have allowed us to try to address the problem at the start of the training system, not after these students had put seven years of their lives into training and studying and not after the taxpayer had spent $100,000. That is the first point I would make. There are alternatives to this, and alternatives that do not involve affecting people who are halfway through their careers. If the minister goes back to the argument that everyone will get a training place, can he please explain the contradiction with that statement that the honourable member for Mallee will be a happy man because he is going to get extra doctors sent to the Mallee, or forced to go to the Mallee-even though I am sure they will be attracted by the beautifullifestyle and everything else in the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee. As I made clear, he has claimed that more doctors will go to Mallee because they will be keen to get the accelerated status and the guarantee that they end up with a training place, to quote him, after a period of time. Minister, doesn't that prove that your guarantee that every Australian trained doctor will get a training place is in fact incorrect? Haven't you now let the cat out of the bag by saying that every Australian trained doctor will not get a training place when, in fact, they will have to go to rural hospitals to get a chance to get a training place in future years?",25
20,Mr FILING,NOES,"I thank the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) for his responses, although I am still not quite sure about the position. I must say that I am sorry I did not avail myself of the briefing that was offered yesterday. Unfortunately, we were unable to get a commitment this morning. I think there was a bit of a celebration going on last night for the minister's birthday, and I wish to retrospectively wish you a happy birthday for yesterday. I am interested in the policy mix because, quite clearly, one of the aspects of restricting a number of Medicare service providers is going to be that that puts the existing GPs into a superior market position in terms of their ability and, obviously, in terms of pressure on service costs. I wanted to dwell on the response the minister made in relation to Western Australia again. I am sorry to appear ignorant, but how is the change going to beneficially affect Western Australia, given that Western Australia's mix is now about right and that the number of graduates is pretty well a reasonable trend in relation to the demand for GP services? I am interested in that because, as the minister acknowledged, the Western Australian country locum service program has been particularly successful. So I think there is some validity in the comments made by the Western Australian government that, in essence, this is going to unfairly impact on Western Australian GP service provision. In particular, I would like the minister to expand on what other alternatives were suggested in the budget talks in relation to the problem that has been created after 13 years of Labor administration of our health care system. For instance, you have mentioned Brian Howe on a couple of occasions. Of course, one of Brian Howe's great failures in the previous government was his inability to get a co-payment around the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating. I would be interested to know exactly what is likely to be in store for us next year. Given that this is only a temporary measure-in other words, this has a one-off effect of adjusting the ratio of general practice services available to the community-what is the next element in the move to create the right mix of GP services to the population? Will it be, for instance, a co-payment for GP visits? If not, what is the government going to do in the future? That is why I was interested in having the matter referred to a House of Representatives committee, because I think there would have been an opportunity for the community to see perhaps a little more clearly exactly what is at stake. I know that the coalition made its commitments to the electorate and is endeavouring to be sincere in keeping those commitments-in other words, the retention of bulk-billing and that Medicare will be retained, more or less, in its present format-but this is a really significant change and it is a change that impacts in different ways in different areas. The other aspect I would like to touch on is the fact that one of the coalition's much vaunted moves to reform our economy is to introduce more competition, and in particular to reduce the restrictive practices that are presently going on in a number of professional areas. I would be interested to know exactly how this particular move is consistent with overall coalition policy given that, in essence, you are restricting the number of people who can practice in a particular professional area. So, on that note, I will conclude and ask the minister if he would care to respond.",26
21,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,NOES,"I have just a couple more questions. I would like the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to tell us if, in the government's consideration of these savings, and they are attacking the newly graduated doctors, the government also considered the other end of spectrum? Did it look at doctors who perhaps should be retiring? If you going to pick on one group in the medical field, why not pick on the other end of the spectrum? Are there doctors who are very who should not be practising? We put tests on people's driving licences. I am not saying this is what we should d-it would be just as discriminatory-but at least see there was some attempt to be fair across the spectrum. It is similar with his provider number, and I think we will start calling him Mr Moonlight. How many doctors are there like him and the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) with provider numbers who distort all the figures? Seriously, if the only way to do it was put a cap, if you like, on the number of Medicare provider numbers, which is what raised it. they are effectively doing, then why not say so and why not look at all the implications as to where that cap could apply and who could in fact affect, or why not offer incenthis tives for doctors to retire? There is a whole range of choices available in this. If that was the conclusion that drawn-and I think it is potentially a flawed conclusion anyhow-what other option did they consider to maintain that cap and, if you like, to remove any surplus supply? The a shadow minister referred to the previous government's attempt with the medical lem. schools, for which we got no support from the now minister and hence our citizens, I pose. The other one is the possible early retirement of some people in the field who perhaps would do us all a favour by moving out.",26
22,Mr FORREST,NOES,"I said am absolutely fascinated to see the interest the shadow minister, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), who is at my electorate. I have been in this place for three years and the problem my electorate has and has had is not new-in fact, it has been there for 13 years. I hope he will forgive for being a little cynical about his interests being somewhat disingenuous. In all the representations I made to the previous government on this issue, I got very little response. The shadow minister has made reference to an attempt to adjust the level of are graduates but, sadly, it did not work. The vice-chancellors said that there were only 20 possible positions that could be declared. That old approach did not work and certainly did not deliver in terms of the needs of my electorate, that my 24 hospitals and the number of private clinics that all seek support in some way from people could Australian doctors. I am 100 per cent convinced that the reown sponse the now Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has made will deliver the needs of my electorate in terms of the issue we are discu§-ng. It may take some time-we wait on that-but it is a jolly sight more positive response than what to I have seen in the three years I have been here, and this is not the first time. I have I think the shadow minister ought to be a bit more supportive of the total suite of policy it the new government is announcing, support legislation and let us get on with it. If it does not work, by all means make your judgment. I am very pleased with the rewas sponse the new minister is making to the needs of my electorate. He and the government have responded in policy terms, to which I have had input. It is time you gave us bit of support. Let us get on with the job. I am delighted with your interest in my prob",27
23,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NOES,"This will be my last contribution on this clause, otherwise it will go on forever. If other people wish to keep talking, they can. The member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) that this legislation would not protect of Medicare and is patently absurd. Tell that to Brian Howe because Brian Howe seems to the table, in think that it will. A couple of questions have been raised. Is it inconsistent to say that a guaranteed place in the country means, therefore, that not me everyone will get places? I have never said everyone will get places in general practice, but it will mean that maybe, as a country, we can fill some of the places in psychiatry, occupational medicine, rehabilitation medicine or emergency medicine-training places that are currently going unfilled. You can walk into a training place in any of those areas tomorrow. I would have thought that would have been incredibly in the national interest. I thought that would have been the sort of thing the opposition would have supported because these are areas that are required in the national interest. These are areas that are not popular or fashionable, yet they are areas with very great community need. I feel no obligation to guarantee everyone who wants to go into general practice should be able to do so, just as I feel no obligation to guarantee everyone who wants to do brain surgery should be able to do so. If you look at the number of training positions, and if you look at the number of doctors graduating, there should be a training spot for everyone. It will not necessarily be in what is their first choice, not necessarily where it is their first choice to go, but that has always been the way in medicine. I was interested to note the comments about medical schools. The member for Newcastle said they tried to do it and got no support from me. For your information, I actually went to the previous minister, the member for FremantIe (Dr Lawrence)-and she will confirm this. I said to her, 'I think you're making the right decision. I will give you 100 per cent support. I will not criticise you for anything you do with trying to reduce medical school numbers.' That is a free kick in politics that is not often given. I felt so deeply about it 12 months ago I was prepared to do that for the then Labor government. So before you say, 'We got no support,' perhaps you might inform yourself that I gave support in a way that very few shadow ministers ever give to a government minister. I would like to do something with medical school numbers. I am having some discussions with deans. My feeling is that deans understand there is an issue of national interest here and they are being helpful. While the deans are prepared to talk, I do not wish to foreshadow legislation. The trouble is, though, we cannot wait six years for this. We cannot graduate another 7,200 doctors and have another 3,600 overseas trained doctors come into the country before we implement it, otherwise the system would collapse. The member for Moore (Mr Filing) raised some points. I will answer them together. Health is different, and it is different for two reasons. First of all, the demand curve is very inelastic. People tend to demand as much health as they can at whatever cost. This stands to reason because if you are ill you say, 'Get the best person.' You do not say, 'Where can I save $1O?' Secondly, there is a dramatic mismatch between the information of the consumer and the information of the provider. In those two circumstances, a normal market does not work well. This is a fairly simple point which economic parrots and commentators around the place seem to have failed to grasp. The OECD, for example, would say that 40 per cent to 75 per cent of the health costs are generated on the supply side, but I think it is closer to 75 per cent. Most countries which are trying to control their health costs are looking at supply side issues. This would have been quite proper under economic fashion 20 years ago. The current economic fashion happens to be different, but that does not mean this is incorrect. In the end, health is largely supply driven. We are looking at the supply side just as we do with pharmacy, just as we do with new technology. In those areas, we lead the world. So there is no contradiction between competition and restrictive practices. It is sensible economics, if you can think of 30 years of economics, not just what has been fashionable in recent times. I make no reference to the member for Moore in that; I make reference to the wonderful thing about health portfolios, which is that there are so many people in the press and other areas who seem to think that they understand it and are willing to give you advice. But it would be lovely if two of them could occasionally agree.",27
24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Mr Jenkins)Order! Before calling the honourable member for Dobell, I would remind the House that we are in the consideration in detail stage. On this occasion, the chair has been very generous, because it acknowledges the spirit of goodwill that has been displayed by both sides of the chamber. But I would caution that if that spirit of goodwill starts to be strained, members should address their remarks more directly to the questions before the chair.",28
25,Mr LEE,NOES," Mr Deputy Speaker, in taking on board your counsel, I will try to make this my last contribution on this clause, but I still would be grateful if the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) would respond to some of the points that I would like to make. I am happy to give him the undertaking that, if he does respond to these remarks, I will not take up this clause again. He will not get a better offer than that today. The minister, who is at the table, claims that he offered the former Minister for Human Services and Health bipartisan support for action reducing intakes into medical schools. That is something which I acknowledge. But I would like to inform all honourable members that I also made the minister an offer which he did refuse. It offered the Labor Party's support for tough action to tighten access for overseas trained doctors to practising medicine in Australia. I do acknowledge that eight days ago the minister made an announcement in the House that he was intending to tighten access for overseas trained doctors who arrive after 1 January 1997. But, unfortunately, he was not prepared to take up the second part of my offer, that is, to take action against overseas trained doctors who are already here or who arrive before 1 January. So, just as the current minister for health made the former minister for health an offer, which he mentioned, we in opposition also made him an offer which he has not seen fit to take up. That is unfortunate, but I am sure he has his reasons for it. I thought it very important, quite revealing, that the minister in his last response did not take up the issue that I raised about how this legislation is going to send extra doctors into the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest). I would be grateful if he would address this. There is a basic contradiction. The honourable member for MaBee has obviously been told by the minister that the legislation will send more Australian trained doctors to rural areas such as Mallee. That is what the honourable member for Mallee said in the second reading debate. The minister confirmed it in one of his earlier comments today when he said that if Australian trained doctors go to Mallee they will get a guarantee that they will get into the general practice training program after a period of time. Minister, does that not mean that some Australian trained doctors are going to be missing out on training places and that they will have to wait, they will have to go to Mallee for a period of time-to use your words-before they get a training place? When you say that every Aust!J-an graduate will get access to a training place, are you saying that it is not necessarily immediate, that you might have to spend some time in the bush? How long? What is the average period of time these people are expected to go to the bush? There certainly might be a wait of a year or two in the next couple of years, but, if you look at the projections in the number of doctors coming through the schools, it is quite clear that any waiting period will grow dramatically in future years. Finally, I would like to pick up the point made by the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) about what happens to doctors who currently are registered and have provider numbers. The minister has explained to the interns, the medical students, that they have many other career options. They can work for his department, they can work for the private sector, and they can even become the federal minister for health or even a member of parliament, like the honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson). I would simply like to put to the minister the question that I know the medical students, the interns, have put to him: if he has now taken on a new career in politics and government administration, has he considered whether or not he should surrender his provider number and whether he and other people who have retired from medicine or taken on other careers should hand back their provider number so that there is an extra spot for one of the Australian medical students or interns?",29
26,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NOES,"This is definitely my last contribution. I have tried to be as open and frank as I can be, and, in that spirit, I will answer the shadow minister's questions. There are three issues: the overseas trained doctors who are already here, extra doctors in Mallee and doctors currently registered, like me, with provider numbers. I seriously looked at all the options, and what we are doing with overseas trained doctors is very tough. I had to decide what we would do with overseas trained doctors who are already here. These are people with whom I have had discussions over several years. I came to the view that most of these people are Australian citizens now. They may be trained overseas, but many of them, like Dr Siddiqui, came here at a time when we were actively trying to recruit doctors. It struck me as unfair to say to them, 'You are now Australian citizens; we are not going to give you the opportunity to see whether your skills can be assessed and whether you are up to the standard.' We have toughened it by not having it open-ended. All overseas trained doctors currently registered with the AMC will have only five years now, and they will have two attempts at the exam. It is patently absurd to give someone IO attempts to have a go at passing the AMC exam and give them 20 years to do it. The system is, quite frankly, a mess. This will enable us to sort it out and at least, at end of five years, be able to tell all overseas trained doctors registered with the AMC whether their skills are up to standard or not. If they are, they can go into practice. If they are not, they can get on with the rest of their lives and try to do something else. We have an awful mess here. I thought it would have been unfair-that is why I made the decision that I made. Limiting it to two attempts within five years will have a similar effect, in away, to a quota, but it will not be an arbitrary quota; it will be a quota on the basis of ability, which, in the end, is the fairest way to do it.",29
27,Mr FILING,NOES,Is it still an arbitrary score?,30
28,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NOES,"Not that I should respond to interjections, but no, we will try to make the standard as close as possible to that of final year medicine. With regard to the extra doctors in the electorate of Mallee, I thought I had answered that. The guaranteed places you do not have to take up, but that will make it more attractive for people to go to the electorate of Mallee. I said 'a period of time' not because I thought there was some queue or that people would have to wait, but because the discussions we have had so far with the RACGP have been on the basis that if someone did three or four years in a country hospital they would then have shortened training in the GP training program. At the moment, people do one or two years in a hospital and then three years in the GP training program. We would expect they would do three or four years in a hospital and then 18 months in the GP training program. So the whole process may take them only an extra six months over what they would normally do, but they would be providing a service to rural areas and we would be rewarding that with a guarantee. The second thing that will help the honourable member for Mallee is that, because we are still allowing overseas trained doctors who come to Australia to have their skills assessed but not get a provider number, those who have had their skills assessed as appropriate and who pass the AMC exam will be able to go for salaried positions, but not into private the practice. I think that will make the salary of those positions in the honourable member's electorate, which may not be appropriate for a young doctor, much more attractive. Over time, it will help country areas. I am not promising that it will fix it overnight, but it will help. The third thing the shadow minister suggested was that I take up the students' offer to hand in my provider number. I have two comments on that. First, I have agreed to do so if Dr Woollard would care to do so. Second, if he looks at the legislation to see how it is framed, it would be a fairly pointless activity, although that would not be the first time that has happened in politics. If I did hand it in, the legislation would allow me to go tomorrow and reapply for it because I am already registered. Any doctor already registered can get as many provider numbers as they like and change them. So it would be a largely symbolic, hollow gesture. I am not big on those. Clause agreed to. Clause 2.",30
29,Mr LEE,NOES,"I move: That consideration of clause 2 be postponed. I seek to have the consideration of clause 2 postponed until after the consideration of schedule 2 because it deals with some timely issues. Question resolved in the negative. Amendments (by Dr Wooldridge)-by leave-proposed: (1) Clause 2, page 1 (line 10), after ""subsections"", insert ""(2A),"". (2) Clause 2, page 1 (after line 12), after subclause (2), insert: (2A) Items 14A and 15A of Schedule I commence: (a) on I January 1997; or (b) immediately after the commencement of the remainder of Schedule I; whichever is later.",31
30,Mr LEE,NOES,"I understand that these amendments implement part of the government's new 10-year moratorium on overseas trained doctors. We have spent some time during the consideration of clause I on the opposition's offers. I will not repeat that in the consideration of this clause. We welcome these amendments. We will not be opposing them; we will be supporting them. But we think they are only half measures. We think the government should have gone the extra step. The minister should have accepted the Labor Party's offer of bipartisan support on revisiting the issue of a quota on the number of people who are able to sit for the AMC's clinical exam. Under the former government, that quota was 200. As many members would know, there was a decision of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that struck down that quota of 200. That has been overturned by the Federal Court. While I am not a lawyer, it is my understanding that it would be open to the AMC to reimpose that quota of 200. Other Western countries, including Canada and the United States, are very tough on the number of Australian and other overseas trained doctors allowed into the country. It is very difficult for Australians to practise in those countries. I personally do not see why the government is not prepared to revisit the question of a quota on the number of overseas trained doctors who are already here. Dare I remind the minister of a comment he made in the House on Tuesday last week when he said: "",,I ... we have been mugs to allow ourselves to be one of the last Western countries to allow unrestrained medical migration. We are accepting the proposal that you have in this legislation. However, we think that we are less of a mug because of your proposed amendments, but we are still partial mugs and that, if we really wanted to make sure that we were taking all possible action to close off medical migration, you would have accepted the opposition's suggestion that we also reimpose a quota. It is something other countries do and something the government should have given greater consideration to. Because of this legislation, every time one of the overseas trained doctors gets a place in the training program, the danger is that one of the Australian trained interns or medical students may miss out.",31
31,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NOES,"To come back to this issue of a quotas, I say to the shadow minister that the clinical exams started in October and it really would be grossly unfair to implement a quota, even if you could do it after the clinical exams started. That was the difficulty with this year. Any quota would have had to have been imposed for next year. Because we are limiting provider numbers and because we are allowing two attempts over five years, if we implemented a quota, in a sense it would only be symbolic because we are expecting perhaps 275 doctors to get through this year and a bit more than 100 in subsequent years. But it will not be on an arbitrary basis; it will be on a basis of skill. I perhaps hold myself partly to blame for this because I may not have explained it sufficiently adequately to the shadow minister. I think the effect of what we are doing is to do that. The only difference is that we are doing it in a way that is fair and non-discriminatory.",31
32,Mr LEE,NOES,"I have two brief points to make. Firstly, I would be grateful if the minister might explain to the House what impact he believes the latest changes will make to the savings that the government expects to make from this legislation. I know that the explanatory memorandum for the original bill had quite detailed figures, but if there are figures available for the latest changes, I would be interested in them. The second point is that, as I understand the minister's proposal, even overseas trained doctors who arrive after 1 January 1997 can go to the electorate of our friend the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest)-if they pass the AMC exam-and can practise in the hospitals of the honourable member for Mallee. Given that the honourable member for Mallee was arguing very persuasively a few days ago that he was keen to see Australian trained doctors, where possible, practising in his hospitals, would the minister give consideration to some form of work test or priority being given to Australian trained graduates if there is competition between the Australians and the overseas trained doctors, especially to the overseas trained doctors who are arriving after 1 January?",32
33,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NOES,"The first point that the shadow minister raised related to savings. This will increase savings. However, we have not sought to quantify that. Quite frankly, I was not planning to seek to quantify that. While it may increase savings, I think the net effect of that will be that maybe for a change the Medicare benefits schedule component of my budget might come in on line rather than dramatically over. The previous government had real trouble over many years trying to control the rate of increase of growth coming in over budget. It is a moot point. Some of the effect will be way beyond the forward estimates. For that reason, the cost will be negative, but I have not sought to quantify it. Secondly, all we can do is make best estimates, but we believe that this will substantially reduce the desirability of Australia as a destination for overseas trained doctors. So we would expect the number seeking to migrate to drop fairly dramatically. Those who stiIl come here for a variety of reasonsmany legitimate, some not-will be able to have their skills assessed. I did consider not allowing new arrivals to even sit the AMC exam. I looked at that very seriously. In the end, it is pretty tough to say to someone, 'You can't even have your skills assessed.' That is the reason doctors who arrive after 1 January 1997 will be able to sit the AMC exam. I do not envisage a situation arising where there will be a practical difficulty. I think the simple fact of life is that an Australian trained doctor fluent in medical English will have a very substantial advantage over an overseas trained doctor, given that many of the doctors arriving in Australia are from countries where English is not the first language. I do not see the situation arising whereby you have a whole stack of overseas trained doctors forced out of positions because of overseas trained doctors. I think the overseas trained doctors will help this country by taking up positions that Australians are not prepared to fill. If in the future-it will be quite some years before we see any effect here-the shadow minister was correct, I would be prepared to look at it, but I do not envisage that happening.",32
34,Mr LEE,NOES,"I accept the assurances that the minister has given on the second issue relating to training places in the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest). It will be interesting to watch what happens over the next couple of years as to whether or not Australian graduates do get a fair go in trying to get those places. Returning very briefly to the first question I asked about savings, the reason why the opposition is asking questions about savings is that the figures that are in the explanatory memorandum are the budget savings figures that were announced on budget night, if my memory serves me correct. There have been a few changes since budget night. In particular, the minister has had a number of different figures about how many training places there will be. For example, as recently as Monday morning, when the minister very generously provided my office with another briefing on the issue, we were given a document that spoke about around 1,200 training places in a year. On Monday evening in his summing up he spoke about 1,300 training places. Hansard almost always gets what we say right. Yesterday in question time he referred to an exact figure of 1,102, but he did not quantify the number of training places which may be available in some other areas that he mentioned again in the debate here this morning. We are just a bit confused about whether or not there is an exact estimate of how many training places there will be this year and to what extent that will vary in future years, given that I understand there is no guarantee that if there are a certain number of training places offered next year, that will be the same in the following years. I would be grateful if the government--even if the minister takes this on notice---could do another assessment of what the savings will be as a result of this legislation if, as amended by the government, it ends up passing the Senate. We would be very interested to know whether the savings are greater or less than that claimed in the budget papers.",32
35,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NOES,"The difficulty in the calculation is that not all training places are taken up. At the moment we have training places that are unfilled. It is quite possible that there will still be training places unfilled after all of this. That is the big variable. The second difficulty is that we are talking about new first-year training positions in 1996. In many cases they are only eligible to doctors three and four years out. Certainly with some of the very advanced ones such as neurosurgery or cardiothoracic surgery, in effect, doctors may be seven or eight years out before they take them up. So that actually makes it very difficult to predict what is going to happen. The third thing is that not all doctors seek training positions. I have not tried to make this point too much. But it is absolutely guaranteed that not all the 1,200 graduates will seek training. It has never happened before and it should not happen now. Some people choose other careers. I chose a career in politics. There are many other careers that doctors are now looking to take up outside clinical practice. All those things make it very difficult to put a precise figure on it, particularly when we have got four-year for.w-rd estimates and when some ot 'he trammg positions-as in the case of neurosurgerymight come into play seven or eight years after graduation. It would be a fairly pointless exercise. Again, it is hard to say what these amendments will do in limiting overseas trained doctors. It may be they have no effect. It may be they just bolster the savings that were in the budget. It may be that they have a negative effect in that they provide greater savings. We have said in the explanatory memorandum that the financial impact is actually zero. It may be that it turns out to be negative. But, as it is, the figures announced on budget night stand. Amendments agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 3 agreed to. Schedule I, items I to 13.",33
36,Mr LEE,NOES,"For the information of the government, we are trying to minimise the number of divisions in the way we are dealing with this.",33
37,Mr CADMAN,NOES,It's okay. It just seemed a bit unfocused to this point.,33
38,Mr LEE,NOES,"We are very focused. I can tell you that the Australian medical students are very focused, too. For the information of the Chief Government Whip, the opposition will not be seeking to divide on every one of the issues where we disagree with the government. But there will be some issues on which we will divide. Obviously this is a very important issue. It is worthy of the debate and the consideration which I appreciate the minister is giving it this morning. The opposition will be opposing all the items in schedule 1, as the schedule will put in place measures which retrospectively threaten the careers of Australian medical students. Despite the minister's statements, we believe the government has continued to refuse to allow adequate consideration and consultation on the issue. We will not be dividing on these items. Perhaps I could use this occasion as an opportunity to ask the minister for an assurance that, after he has made some inquiries about what has taken place in determining who will appear before the Senate committee, he would be prepared to make representations to Senator Knowles or write to the Senate committee asking that Dr Tony Lawler and the other stakeholders have a chance to have their views heard and considered by the committee. I understood that his office was advised yesterday that might not have been correct. I accept his statement that he does not control the decisions of the Senate committee. But, given the influence that this powerful minister has over his Senate colleagues, I am sure a letter from him or even a telephone call could play some part in encouraging his colleagues to reconsider their decision. I certainly understand it is the view of the Labor members of the committee-Senators Neale and Kay Denman-that these particular people should be given a chance to have their say. Given that the alternative to this was quite a lengthy House of Representatives committee, I think the government has still done pretty well. The least they could do is give these people a fair hearing.",33
39,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NOES,"Very briefly, with respect to the Senate committee-given that I only found out about this just before coming into the House-I am afraid the Senate is a bit of a mystery to me. I try to concentrate on the things I can understand and influence. I am still trying to work out how I can either understand or influence the Senate. I am not sure I am going to be successful. To be honest, I do not know what the propriety is. I would be very concerned to act within the propriety. I am not sure of the propriety of a minister attempting to influence a Senate committee. Within what is proper, I will see what I can do. But I do put that caveat on it. I would say, though, that, as I understand how the Senate committee is working, anyone will have the chance to make a submission. The AMA will have a chance to put any views that it wishes in writing to the Senate committee. I understand that because of time the Senate committee has chosen a limited number of people to formally appear before it. I must say it is good that the opposition's relationship with the AMA has improved in the last seven months. Long may it continue.",34
40,Mr LEE,NOES,"I place on record my appreciation of the help from the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) in that regard. I will leave, until further clauses, detailed consideration on these matters. Items 1 to 13 agreed to. Item 14.",34
41,Mr LEE,NOES,"We thought this was the most appropriate item for a division to express the opposition's concerns about the government's legislation. This is the item that really does determine whether or not provider numbers are available to those Australian m.edical students and interns. Our concerns remain that you keep saying that no Australian trained medical student or intern will miss out on a training place because of the other changes that you have made in taking those halfway measures to tighten up access for overseas trained doctors. Our concern is that the figures have been very rubbery. Whether on the John Laws program, statements you made on television or different claims that you have made in this House, the claims that you have made about the total number of training places available has varied significantly. I quoted them earlier today. You have also made many different claims about how many overseas trained doctors would be affected by different measures that you were going to introduce or that you were thinking of introducing. As a result, medical students and interns out there have asked you to give them that guarantee. You say that every one of them will get a training place and, therefore, a provider number, but you refuse to give that guarantee. If you will not give that guarantee, it is obviously because you do not have full confidence in the figures that you are quoting to us. That is no surprise, given that they have varied so much. Why should the medical students have faith in you and in your figures, given that they have changed so dramatically? We also believe that the government should have allowed proper consideration in detail of the measure. Two hours to consider this very important bill and, I understand, one or two others is an insult not only to the people whose careers are at risk from this legislation but also to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and his department, and all the other people who have no doubt put in a lot of hours to get this package together. When I saw the minister in a private meeting several weeks ago, I suggested to him that, if we could have a thorough parliamentary committee, even if it did take two months, that would have been a much better way for the parliament to reach a conclusion about whether this draconian legislation is appropriate. As the government has not been prepared to countenance that thorough parliamentary committee, we are simply getting a quick and nasty inquiry over in the Senate in a couple of hours. As a result of that, the opposition is left with no alternative but to oppose the legislation by seeking a division on this particular item. For all of these reasons, the opposition continues to remain concerned about the impact of the legislation-the impact on Australians who live in the bush, who are already suffering a shortage of doctors and the impact on women doctors who often, after graduation, get married, want to have a couple of children and are the ones who often have to postpone their postgraduate training and need options for part-time training. While it is true, as the minister claims, that many of the colleges, even though they are dominated by males, do allow, in theory, for women to take a couple of years off or to do their training part time, in practice those women who exercise that choice-I am told, by people who should know-seem to be the ones who are less likely to get training positions. There seems to be a theoretical acceptance that you are allowed to do this, but in practice it is the women doctors who will be hardest hit by these changes. For all those reasons, we think that this legislation should have been sent to a committee for proper consideration. Because the government has not been prepared to allow that proper and thorough consideration, we are given no alternative but to oppose it.",34
42,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NOES,"To answer the shadow minister's statement that the figures are rubbery, there are several reasons why it has been difficult to get figures on this, although I certainly deny they are rubbery. The first is that the Commonwealth does not control training positions, except in general practice. We know exactly what happens in general practice because we pay for it, but we do not know in other specialities because they are wholly state based. In a lot of cases the states do not know either. To try to get an exact number we got to the point of having to ring individual hospitals, and that caused some fun. Hospitals are not used to getting calls from the Commonwealth to ask how many training positions they have. Over the last three months, we have found substantially more training positions than we realised. We found a lot of training positions unfilled. So the numbers of training positions have increased over time, I guess because there has been no good national data on training. This is an issue in itself and something that we are hoping to remedy over time through AMW AC, the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee. The figures have changed over time, too, because it has been very hard to get precise numbers on overseas trained doctors. This is a system I have inherited. The number keeps changing all the time and, as a country, we are not set up to give any precise details on this. This will be remedied by what we are doing now. Even on something as simple as trying to understand how many New Zealand trained doctors come to Australia, Australia is not able to tell me and New Zealand is not able to tell me. I have had several discussions with New Zealand and, in the end, we have thrown our hands up in the air and said that it clearly shows a major deficiency in the system. That is why it is an imprecise science. Add to that the imprecise things, such as we do not know how many people pass final-year medicine, we do not know how many people take a year off and we do not know how many people will seek to go into other areas that do not require clinical practice. But each of these makes it easier for medical students, not harder. Each of these puts lie to the fact that there will be 400 doctors who will miss out. This is complete rubbish and scaremongering. While there is imprecision in the figures, the best I can say is, as far as I can see, are more training positions than there are young doctors and there is no reason people should miss out. It will require a bit of flexibility. It might mean we actually have enough psychiatrists, enough rehabilitation medicine physicians or enough occupational medicine physicians, and that will be a great thing for Australia. The shadow minister asked me to give a guarantee. I will not give a guarantee. No-one else gets a guarantee and I do not know why young doctors should be any different. I will seek to do everything that I can to make it fair as I have done for overseas trained doctors. We should not be giving guarantees to doctors. We do not give guarantees to lawyers, architects, dentists or anybody else. With regard to the parliamentary committee, as I said, we do have difficulties with a startup date. I cannot delay this until next year. Potentially, we would have real problems next year and that is why it has not been possible, although I seriously considered a committee. The bush will be no worse off and I believe that they will be marginally better off in the ways that we have discussed. There is nothing in this that will hurt the bush. It is patently absurd to suggest that you fix an undersupply in the bush by flooding the city with doctors. We already have an oversupply of 4,500 doctors in the city and a relative undersupply of 500 in the bush Australia wide. You could probably have an oversupply of 9,000 in the city and you would still have an undersupply in the bush: you would just have a Medicare system that was about to collapse. As for women, I am not sure that what the shadow minister says is correct, that they are less likely to get training positions if they want part-time work. Were that to be the case, I would act decisively and aggressively and no-one would be in any doubt as to my view on that. I intend to announce in the next couple of weeks something that I am not prepared to talk about here but that will actually look at those issues. I would take it very seriously if there was any evidence that women are being discriminated against because they wanted part-time training or interrupted training, particularly in general there practice. But I do not believe that is the situation. Of course, all this is predicated on the fact that there is an option at the moment for doctors who are not properly trained. If you look at what is going to happen in the next 10 years, I think that anyone who is not properly trained would not have a future anyway.",35
43,Mr ALBANESE,NOES,"I also wish to support the shadow minister, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), in opposing this item in the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No.2) 1996. I have had representations from medical students and also, interestingly enough, their parents, both in my electorate and in my capacity as Secretary of our Caucus Social Policy Committee. These students have come to see us because they are concerned, firstly, about the retrospective nature of this legislation. Whilst the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) is correct in arguing that no group, be they doctors or anyone else, should be singled out for special treatment, I think that there is a general principle. This parliament should accept that these students have embarked on their training effectively on one basis and midway through that basis will be changed. Some of these people could have already been six years into their education; they could have given up substantial income during that time in order to be trained. At this late stage to retrospectively say to them that they cannot be guaranteed a provider number is a retrograde step which should be opposed. Secondly, I think there is no doubt that the anecdotal evidence that I have received from both students and their parents is that this will have a particularly savage effect on women. Women do provide a high percentage of the people who choose to defer full-time postgraduate training, particularly those who wish to have families. Certainly, women doctors in my electorate have indicated that that is the case. I accept that the minister has responded by saying today that he would be prepared to do something about it, but I believe that it would be better for the minister to fix problems before they arise rather than wait for them to occur. Thirdly, the rural and regional impact of this will be regressive as well. There is no doubt that it will have a bad effect in terms of providing medical services in rural and regional Australia. They are areas which can least afford this sort of change. The minister in his response to the shadow minister's remarks today has said that the figures have changed over time. They certainly have; they change very quickly. On Monday morning the figure was 1,200. By Monday night the figure had changed to 1,300 and by yesterday in question time the minister came up with a very precise figure of 1,102. The minister certainly has got it right that the figures change over time but he has got it wrong in both the policy and the politics of this issue. Those sorts of dramatic changes and jumps show why the opposition's proposal of a committee and the opposition's proposal to consider the impact of this in detail should have been supported by the minister. If he does not know, and can jump around from 1,200 to 1,300 back to 1,102 in the space of 24 hours, what hope is there of medical students and their families agreeing to these sorts of changes? I think the opposition has been very reasonable on this. That is why it is not surprising that he says that they will not get a guarantee. It is not surprising at all, because it is clear that the minister just does not know. To dismiss the opposition to this with 'It is hard to give precise figures' and 'No, we can't give a guarantee' really is not good enough. The minister will be forced to reconsider this-there is no doubt about this-when the impact of its retrospective nature on women and on rural and regional Australia comes through. I am no great fan of the AMA but the fact is that the AMA are the representative body and to exclude them from the process is also a negative step. The minister should give this reconsideration. The opposition have already indicated through the shadow minister that we intend to divide on this - We believe this item in the legislation is indefensible and should be opposed.",36
44,Mr LATHAM,NOES,"I join with colleagues in opposing item 14 of the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No.2) 1996. I do so on behalf of medical students in and around my electorate who have made representations to me. The first representation I received was from 17 fourth-year medical students at the University of New South Wales based at Liverpool Hospital in the south-west of Sydney. Under the heading 'Demolition of the future for medical students and interns' they made a series of very telling points about the folly of the proposal of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). There is one point in particular I wish to draw to his attention and also to the attention of the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), quite appropriately, seeing as he is in the House. The 17 medical students write: At a cost of around $126,000 per medical student for six years of undergraduate training without incorporating significant education costs of interns, it is economically unsound to refuse graduates the opportunity to repay community investment. In addition to $50 million spent on wasted training, the government has allocated $20 million per annum to assist in medical work force adjustment to this budgetary measure. This cost of $70 million to the community in 1997 should be compared to the government's projected saving of $26 million. That is a very telling point. I hope it is a point that the Minister for Finance has absorbed. This is a false economy. The government claims to be saving $26 million when it is washing $70 million of public resources down the drain. I saw the other day, 12 months after the drought, that the Minister for Finance to some extent is asleep at the wheel on drought assistance for farmers. I suggest that he takes note of that false economy, to note the $70 million of public resources that are being wasted because of the government's decision on medical students and the provider numbers. There is no doubt that this is a false economy and the government should recognise that. It is not a savings measure; it is a measure in net terms which will cost the taxpayers of Australia $44 million in 1997 through the wasted investment in medical training, because the measure is retrospective, plus the $20 million adjustment package. The next representation I received was from a young medical student living in Prestons in my electorate. She made a whole series of telling points against the government's proposal. I wish to read to the House the final point she made which was at a personal level: I intend to become a rural GP and have made choices as a student which reflect this. To follow this career path which has been strongly promoted by both government and opposition it appears under the coalition's proposal that I may have no choice but to enter the training program early to ensure position and maintain an income and to, therefore, postpone having children until at least part way through my postgraduate training. This will be at significant personal cost to my husband and me and I would not have dreamed that this would become a problem when I started my medical training way back in 1990. That is the sad retrospective nature of this provision. That medical student in 1990 could not have dreamed that six years later her future would be jeopardised in this fashion. There is something very authoritarian about a government that relies on retrospective provisions and legislation. I detect in many areas of this Howard administration an authoritarian streak-be it on the family tax initiative, telling women that their place is in the home and no other place in Australian society and economy; its sponsorship of euthanasia laws to tell terminally ill people how to spend the last days of their life; or this measure telling young medical students how they must now tum upside down all their family planning and aspirations because of a false economy this government is applying in its health budget. First and foremost I believe in liberty in the relationship between government and citizens-not authority, not the strong arm right wing authority of this Howard administration. I stand for the liberty and rights of these medical students in and around my electorate. I would have thought that, if the so-called Liberal Party had any grain of belief or commitment to small 'I' liberalism in the 1990s, it would not be pursuing this measure. It is a party of authority, a party which is trying to tell people how to live their lives. On this particular aspect of its legislation program, it is putting forward a retrospective measure which is unfair, inequitable, unjust and, most of all, a false economy. There is no saving out of this measure and the Minister for Finance more than anyone else should wake up at the wheel and recognise that the government is committing an act of folly on its own finances by pursuing the recommendation of the Minister for Health and Family Services. (Extension of time granted) I wanted to make a further point not so a much connected to constituents in and around my electorate but on the basis of competition policy, for which I have a shadow responsibility. For a long time. I have been interested in the principles of competition as they apply to the medical profession. I know the Minister for Finance did half a thing in New South Wales with regard to the legal profession, but his mates there at the big end of town held him up a bit. But at least on the medical profession we should be applyingMr Lee-Did Peter Collins support it?",37
45,Mr LATHAM,NOES,"Against the opposition of the now Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, as my colleague the member for Dobell points out. So they are not too holy on these things. It is only against resistance in their own ranks that any of these measures come through. But, seeing that the Minister for Finance has given a lead and seems to be smiling with satisfaction about that measure with regard the legal profession, maybe he can do somedown thing with regard to medical professionals. Why is it that the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in Australia is still engaged anti-competitive practices? Why is it that, when the government is supposedly save money on its health budget, it is not addressing the anti-competitive practices identified in the Baume report relating to the college of surgeons? So we are talking about the medical profession, the number of GPs and the number of surgeons in Australia. The big saving, the big inequity, the big anti-competitive practice government needs to tackle first and foremost is with the surgeons. Report after report after report-everyone from John Patterson in Victoria to former coalition colleague Peter Baume-has identified that the lack of supply of surgeons in Australia is a critical factor driving up costs on the national health budget. Again the government has its priorities wrong. If you were given a choice between tackling the question of limiting the supply of GPs where costs are capped on the medical budget and increasing the supply of surgeons where costs are uncapped and excessive current charging practices, you would start with the latter. You would start with the competitive practices of the college of surcame geons. Not only is this government engaging false economy and in retrospective legislation damaging the aspirations of young medical students around Australia but also it has a of surgeons. false sense of priorities. The real saving, the real return to the Commonwealth budget to the medical system around Australia, would be to crash through the anti-competitive practices of the college of surgeons. Why has the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) not done that? Why is he picking on interns and medical students? Why is he not going to the Bruce Shepherds and the other rorters in the medical practices of Australia who are deliberately practices. keeping down the number of surgeons in this country? Mr Fahey interjecting",38
46,Mr LATHAM,NOES,"He does rort the system. to As long as he and his surgeon mates keep the number of surgeon students going through the college of surgeons-and they do that knowing that the prices are uncapped and in go through the roof; they are definitely excessive-then they are rorting the medical trying to budget in Australia. This government is failing to act on the Baume report or the other research that has identified that particular anti-competitive practice. Mr Fahey-What about the Baume report? ""/ ""a",39
47,Mr LA THAM,NOES,"We were moving on that. the We were the government that exposed the surgeons to the Trade Practices Act. We introduced the Hilmer reforms for the first time. You talk about firsts. What about the first government to expose surgeons to the Trade Practices Act? What about the first in government which took the measure through the Baume report to identify anti-competitive practices and do something about it? We started the ball rolling and this government has let the ball roll off the side of the agenda. That is the truth of it for the Minister for Finance. They may not have shown him this in at the ERC when he came in as the new boy from Macarthur. He was thrown down from antiMacquarie Street to Canberra. When they in and put all those papers in front of him, they probably did not show him the in a paper which had the Baume report and the savings that could be made by increasing the number of doctors going through the college The minister should go back to his papers and and to the ERC agenda and find the big savings and benefits to the medical budget in Australia that should be the first priority of this government. It should not start with GPs or by trying to limit the supply of doctors where their costs are capped. It should start with the basic proposition of increasing the supply of surgeons where the costs are uncapped and excessive by current charging That is the truth of it for the Minister for Finance. He has a lot of learning to do. He is on a learning curve from Macquarie Street to Canberra. He should go back and revise the decision and do the fair thing in terms of the false economy that the minister for health is projecting. He should do the fair thing by abandoning retrospective legislation and do the fair and equitable thing by starting with the college of surgeons first and foremost.

48,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"This item places an obligation on doctors who do not have a Medicare provider number to inform their patients. While the opposition totally supports the principle of informed financial consent, it obviously rejects this particular item as part of a schedule which we have major philosophical differences with. Given that the government has not agreed to the reference to the committee, therefore, we will be opposing this item, but we will not be dividing on it. Item IS agreed to. Proposed new item 15A. Amendment (by Dr Wooldridge) agreed to: (4) Schedule 1, page 11 (after line 22), after item 15, insert: 15A Paragraph 19CC(a) After ""19AA"", insert ""or 19AB"". Item 16.",42
49,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"I move: (5) Schedule 1, page 11 (line 23) to page 12 (line 9), omit item 16. Whilst fully supporting the maintenance of appropriate standards, the opposition again opposes item 16 as part of a schedule which implements changes that we have objections to. Amendment negatived. Schedule 1, as amended, agreed to. Schedule 2.",42
50,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"I move: (6) Schedule 2, page 13 (line 16) to page 14 (line 31), omit items 2 to 9. The opposition has sought to do this in such a way that it is not opposing the introduction of the multiple services rule for diagnostic imaging. That is something which the opposition is supporting. We believe that, just as the former government took action in the area of pathology through negotiations with the profession, the government has come up with some changes that will seek to reduce the cost of diagnostic imaging over the long term, and that is something we will be supporting. Our concerns are with two other changes that are included in items 2 to 9. They are, first of all, the increase in the maximum permissible gap. I think all honourable members would be aware that when Medicare was first introduced Medicare provided you with an 85 per cent rebate. If your doctor charged you a fee for service, a fee up-front, then the Medicare rebate covered 85 per cent of the cost and out of your own pocket, if your doctor does not bulkbill, you were expected to pay 15 per cent. If that 15 per cent exceeded the maximum permissible gap, then Medicare would top up the Medicare rebate increase to keep that maximum permissible gap at a reasonable level. This is not to be confused with the gap people often talk about, which is the gap between what the doctor actually charges and the Medicare schedule fee. That is a different gap. Basically, this amendment by the government in this legislation, which in effect increases that maximum permissible gap from $30 to $50, is simply going to result in an increase in the cost of essential medical care for patients. Before the last election, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised that Medicare would be retained in its entirety. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) promised in his many letters to his constituents that rebates would not be changed. He could claim that he has kept that promise as far as rebates for GP consultations are concerned because they have been frozen. That might have the unintended effect of making it less likely that doctors will bulkbill, but he has broken that pledge to his constituents by increasing that maximum permissible gap from $30.60 to $50. It is not small beans. It raises nearly $60 million over four years. This money will be raised from people who are seriously ill and require medical services where the schedule fee is in excess of $200. So it is quite substantial. It is hard to imagine how anyone could consider this to be a fair and reasonable measure. The second element we have objections to is the change in the provisions in the legislation that deal with the NBAC's power to award higher fees for unusually long or complex services. Perhaps that is another example of the government's arbitrary cutbacks and arbitrary changes in Medicare rebates and in health generally. The government expects this change will save around $5 million a year by removing doctors' rights to claim for unusual items. It simply means that doctors will be forced to look for an item amongst that long list of items under the MBS. Perhaps I could repeat for the minister's benefit an example that was drawn to my attention, which he might like to respond to. For example, if someone is badly injured in a country area, we could imagine that a rural general practitioner might be called to an emergency on a remote property. She might drive for more than an hour to reach the property and then find that the patient has had an accident with a piece of farm machinery and has sustained a serious injury. The GP would treat the injuries as well as possible, treat the patient for shock, assist the family and then accompany the patient to hospital. That whole episode could take four hours, yet there is no item which would properly cover that afternoon's work by that GP. Under the current arrangements, that GP could write to NBAC and explain the circumstances of the case and the committee would then determine a fair fee. If the same GP had instead done 16 15-minute consultations in their surgery, Medicare would have paid them around $300. (Extension of time granted) Under the amendment to the legislation, that GP could now only claim $70 for those four hours of work. That is the rebate for a long home visit consultation. We do not think that is a reasonable fee in those circumstances. My concern is that the patients will be the ones who ultimately end up out of pocket. For these reasons, we oppose these changes in the maximum permissible gap and the changes in the rebates which are awarded for unusually long or complex services.",42
51,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAIRS,"Briefly, on the issue of the maximum permissible gap, we are increaSfn\ it, but it in no way diminishes Medicare. It keeps Medicare in its entirety. I would point out that the safety net is not changing. So those people who are chronically ill or those people who use medical services a lot will not pay anything more over a whole year, because the safety net will be reached a bit sooner. This is in fact far less onerous than what the previous government did in the 1995 budget when it increased the safety net for pharmacy from $400 to $600, which did hit people who had a chronic illness. It hit anyone who had a chronic illness an extra $200 a year. Because the safety net has been kept in place, this will provide significant protection for anyone, as I said, who has a chronic illness. The second part is the ability of the MBAC to award higher fees. We have done this on a swings and roundabouts basis, and I can speak with quite some personal experience here. The point is that, while people are happy to write in and ask for a higher fee for something of unusual complexity, I am not aware of a single case in 13 years where someone has written in and offered to give some money back because they were overpaid for something that was relatively simple. In the end, there are very substantial swings and roundabouts in medicine and they do average out over time. Sure, some things are more complex and take longer, but I can tell you that a lot of things are relatively simple and take a very short time. It is fair over a period of time to average these out. At the moment they are not being averaged out, they are skewed, and that is the reason that the government is making this change.",43
52,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"This schedule seeks to implement a number of changes to Medicare rebates. The government also gazetted some regulations that made a number of other changes to Medicare rebates. The government obviously is in the fortunate position where it can change some Medicare rebates by regulation, but others require legislation, thereby giving the parliament a chance to debate them. My great concern is that, while the government has said that Medicare will be retained and Medicare rebates will not be reducedthey were the promises before the electionits actions after the election have been very different. I have made the analogy before that it is like Medicare has been turned into a salami down at the local delicatessen. Medicare is up there on the salami slicer and with every budget we are going to get a few more slices of Medicare taken off by the slicer at the deli. In addition to these changes which increase the maximum permissible gap and the rebates for unusual and complex operations, there is an increase in costs for women who are on the IVF program. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald a few days ago mentioned that many families who do go on the IVF program have to go through several cycles before they are, in many cases, fortunate enough to have a successful conception. As a result, it is important for some of families on tight budgets that an increase of a couple of hundred of dollars can make all the difference between whether or not they can afford the full number of cycles or whether they have to stop after a lower number. Certainly, one slice of that Medicare salami has come off as a result of this government's cuts or reductions in rebates for women on the IVF program. Secondly, there have been some reductions in rebates to cover surgeons offering assistance for operations. We have had reductions in rebates for a number of operations, including knee surgery and eye surgery. In many cases I do not expect the surgeons to be reducing their fees. I think that those changes will certainly result ultimately in patients having to pay more. We have had a change in the rebate which is payable after 50 visits to a psychiatrist in the one year. I would draw to the minister's attention an article in the Newcastle Herald last Saturday which mentioned a particularly tragic case of a woman who had been sexually abused when she was a child and how she is quite distraught because of the changes that have been made by the government. The minister does appear to have strong views on this. He has spoken in the House a couple of times on this in question time, but I would draw to his attention that there are a large number of not just psychiatrists who are obviously concerned about the decision but patients who have written to me directly-no doubt they have also written to the ministerand I would ask him whether it is in fact true, as was admitted in the Senate, that there was no clinical basis for picking the number 50. It is very difficult to know which types of patients will be the most likely to be affected by this decision. People who write to me are often the victims of abuse, people suffering from drug abuse and people suffering from anorexia. Isn't there a concern, Minister, that as a result of these changes we are simply going to cost shift from the federal government to the states by having people treated as in-patients? Finally, there is the decision to freeze the these rebates for GPs. That decision of course increases the pressure on GPs to cease bulkbilling which, in the long term, also increases the cost of health care for Australian families on tight budgets.",44
53,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAIRS,"I did not bring the list into the House with me, but I may get the opportunity later to remind the shadow minister of the changes that the previous government, of which he was a part, made to Medicare. I keep a list like this handy. I just did not bring it into the House at this moment. Again, I would say to him: if you don't reform Medicare, it dies. They are the words of Brian Howe, the former Labor Deputy Prime Minister and former health minister. Some of the specific decisions the shadow minister raised were very difficult to make. I agonised over and gave quite close scrutiny to them. If we had not been facing an $8 billion deficit, perhaps we might have been able to be more generous. But some of the decisions, quite frankly, needed to be made. IVF has undergone very substantial technological change and economies of scale. When that happens it is quite reasonable for the rebates to go down. In the end, if you do not do that, all you do is artificially prop up very high incomes. IVF physicians are at one of the highest levels of remuneration, if you have a look at billing. Admittedly, they have some costs probably higher than some other areas but, off the top of my head, I think the average IVF physicians are billing about $1 million a year-that is gross of course, not net. Even net, it is a very substantial income to a very limited number of doctors, and they may choose to charge their patients more. Certainly, a small number of them, in the most outrageous way, have tried to work up their patients into a frenzy, but the government has a right where there is technological change to expect that it should not just go into the pockets of doctors and that the taxpayer should be able to benefit from that too. We are changing assistance in operations for a number of procedures, but for no procedure where there was an assistant already helping at more than 70 per cent of the cases. So the complex operations--cardiac, neurosurgery, most orthopaedics and eye surgerywill be unaffected. We are doing what is being done overseas. Again, technological changes make many of these quite properly able to be done without an assistant. I was hoping to have more cooperation from the medical profession than I have had on this. I did say I was prepared to review it and look at specific cases. There was one specific case, for example, with varicose veins that I was prepared to reverse, but I am not going to reverse the whole thing. In terms of psychiatry, again, this is illustrasomething tive as to how some members of the medical profession choose to behave. It is a problem that all health ministers face. I have had lots of calls in my office. I had someone who said, 'I am seeing a psychiatrist once a day and I am only halfway through my therapy.' I said, 'How long do you have to go?' and they said, 'Five years.' The fact is the majority of people affected by this decision are undergoing psychoanalysis for which there is no proven cost effectiveness. We had one case where there was a psychiatrist seeing a patient 747 times in a 12-month period for 75-minute consultations. That is, three times a day, Monday to Friday excluding public holidays and weekends. Honestly, the majority of this is a rort that should hIW. been fixed ages ago. There may be a small number of cases, a very small number of cases, and then the rebate is not being cut out altogether. The rebate is going back to that for a general practitioner long consultation rate. If psychiatrists were prepared to accept swings and roundabouts, it would mean the average psychiatrist, given there are about 1,600 practising in Australia, could expect to have their income reduced by $1,500 over a year. So a net income drop from $200,000-odd a year to $198,500 for an average 48-hour week is probably pretty fair remuneration. As for freezing the rebates for GPs and its effect on bulk-billing, the previous government froze rebates for a four-month period on three occasions, which is the same as a 12month freeze. That did not cause bulk-billing to go down. Also, they froze rebates for other medical practitioners for the past four years at $17.85 and bulk-billing has gone up and is in fact the highest percentage of any group of doctors amongst that group who have had their rebates frozen for four years. So I do not think there is any evidence at all to back up the shadow minister's claim.",44
54,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"I have to shock the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) by saying that it would be pretty hard to find anyone in this chamber who does not support the continuing scrutiny and reform of Medicare. That is which I am happy to sign up for, and that is why the opposition is quite happy to support you in the changes you are making in pathology. This builds on the savings that were introduced by the former Labor government in this area. Because of our support for continuing refinement and reform of Medicare, we are supporting you on the changes to diagnostic imaging. We are not going to support you when you break your promises which you made before the election to maintain rebates. You did not tell people before the election you would cut back rebates for women on the IVF program. I think there are almost a quarter of a million operations a year that currently have surgical assistance, but you did not tell them before the election that the rebates for that would be cut back. You certainly did not advise people of many other changes that have been madefor example, increases in pharmaceuticals. Perhaps I can finish on one point and one question, which goes to the heart of many of these changes. Can the minister please explain why he thinks the Medicare system is in a state of crisis and why he thinks it is necessary to implement all of these changes, given the fact that, in the 10 years Medicare has been in action, since Medicare has been introduced, the cost of total health care in Australia has risen by one per cent of gross national product? I think it is now about 8Y2 per cent. It has gone up by one per cent. We are certainly in a much better position than the United States, which is a totally private health care system. I think they are up around 14 per cent or a higher percentage of their gross national product. Minister, if Medicare is not in such a crisis, and if you are having to apply all this shock therapy to Medicare, how do you explain the fact that, as a percentage of gross national product, health delivery in Australia has not been growing dramatically? Health care in Australia has only increased by one per cent in the last decade. I think most Australians would admit that there are problems in our health care system. Medicare is not perfect. There are problems, particularly in our public hospitals. That is why we have expressed such strong opposition to this government's cutbacks in federal funding for public hospitals-$800 million over the next four years. That is why, when I go around to the various states, I criticise state health ministers when they cut back state funding for public hospitals. It is important that we try to get these changes in perspective and we do not allow the minister to create the impression that in some way the Medicare salami has to be sliced at the delicatessen because he argues it is unsustainable. The Medicare system we have does have problems, but when you look at the percentage of our gross national product we are putting into health care you cannot argue that the costs have exploded over the last decade.",45
55,Mr FILING,PAIRS,It's been rorted.,46
56,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"The member for Moore says it has been rorted. I do not know whether the honourable member for Moore wants to give a few examples or substantiate those sorts of claims, but I can certainly tell the honourable member for Moore that, even if he can produce evidence that some people might misuse the system, it is not an argument to deny his constituents their entitlement to fair access to health care at a reasonable price. If the honourable member for Moore comes into this House and votes for these changes to charge women more if they are on the IVF program and to charge people more if they have to have an eye operation or knee reconstruction surgery-I can inform the minister that this will be the last division on these matters, as I understand it-his constituents, because of all these changes, will end up paying more for their health care. Families in his electorate on tight budgets will pay more because of changes that have been made by regulation and by legislation by this minister. It is in complete breach of all the undertakings made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and Michael Wooldridge before the last election.",46
57,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAIRS,I seem to remember someone saying that the budget would be in surplus before the last election. Mr Miles-Who was that?,46
58,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAIRS,"I do not know. I think he is away this week. If, in fact, the budget had been in surplus, I would have had a far easier five months, and we could have been concentrating on some of the things that I am determined to do, such as help people who want to take up private health insurance, try to find a way of sustainably getting medical practitioners into rural areas-because country people have a right to have access to doctors-and do something to try to prevent illness rather than just treat it once it happens. The shadow minister asks why we have a crisis. A crisis can be a turning point, if you look at a dictionary definition, as well as a point at which everything is about to collapse. The problem that Australia has compared to overseas countries is that the age distribution of its population is quite different from that of Europe or most of our OECD partners. We have a young population structure. In fact, the 8.6 per cent of GDP that we spend on health is not as good as it seems if you look at the age structure of our population. Most European countries are 20 years further advanced in that their age structure is what we will have in about the year 2015. When you factor in that age structure, and the fact that we are dealing with a younger population compared with most OECD countries, you see that we do have a substantial problem. What is making it worse? It is cost shifting. It is absolutely rife. Previous ministers have talked about it but have done nothing about it. I have done something about it. Rorts are making it a time of crisis. Previous health ministers have talked about it. I have fixed it. Supply is causing a crisis in health care. Previous ministers have talked about it. I have delivered on it. I cannot fix the ageing population, but I can try to give us a health care system that is sustainable into the long term. Because, if we do not make these changes now, people will not have any access to a health care system, let alone a fair one, at a reasonable price. As to the notion that this is a salami change and that Medicare is some solid icon that has not changed since 1984, I would remind the honourable shadow minister that he deferred fee increases at least three times for Medicare. In the last three years, GP fees were indexed at only half the rate of specialists. In 1995, the annual fee increases were not applied to pathology, and coning was introduced. In 1986, there was a 25 per cent cut to the most commonly used pathology items. In 1987, there was a 30 per cent cut to cataract surgery. In 1991, there was a 17 per cent cut to ophthalmology consultations at which glasses were prescribed. In 1993, there was a 20 per cent cut to computerised perimetry. In 1995, there was a 25 per cent cut to percutaneous endoscopy. In 1995, there was a 50 per cent cut to faecal occult blood. Included in that, in 1987 t- after-hours loading for GP consultations was removed, and GPs were expected to absorb it. In 1987, venipuncture items were removed so that procedures became part of the attendance item. In 1993, cryotherapy and serial curettage for skin lesions were expected to be part of the normal attendance items. So Medicare has been changing. It does evolve. We have to take account of new technology . We have to take account of areas where costs are rising dramatically and rapidly. If we do not do this, Medicare dies. I have worked overseas and have worked in a country that does not have universal access to health care. I do not ever want to see that happen in Australia. I want to see our system sustainable. Unless we make some of these decisions which the government has delivered in this budget, we will find ourselves as a country that will have to have solutions imposed on it.",47
59,Mr FILING,PAIRS,"I refer to the comments of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). In essence, I agree entirely with the principles on which he is conducting policy. The difficulty of this particular aspect, amongst the things we have been dealing with today, is the application of them and their likely effects. I know that the minister referred to a fairly wide ranging number of issues in his most recent response. I ask him how I can overcome a particular problem in the electorate I referred to earlier. I have just been advised that we cannot get doctors in my area to run a locum service in what are ordinary suburban, developed areas within a metropolitan region. I have just been advised of a case this morning where a cancer patient living in a suburb that is within relatively close motoring distance-<:ompared with most other citiesof the CBD of Perth was unable to get a locum service and was told that he was too far out for that service to be provided. More urgently, I also have an aged care hostel opening in the area of Merriwa, and the administration there are unable to get a locum service provision for the obvious needs of residents. I can understand that, in some instances, GPs are not prepared to provide that service, but I am interested in hearing from the minister exactly how I, as the member, can overcome this particular problem. I can assure him that it is a genuine and sincere concern about the effect likely to occur as a result of the changes today.",47
60,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAIRS,"I take it that the final comment relates to the fact that, because there will be fewer doctors, there will not be the people to work in locum services. I am disturbed to hear what the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) tells me. I would be happy to try to follow it up. I do not know the particulars of this case, nor the locum service involved. There is at least one locum service in WA that I hold in high regard, and I would be surprised if it was that one. It would be a worry if a locum service was saying, 'We will treat you if you are profitable; we will not treat you otherwise.' How I approached my time as a medical practitioner, I would have thought that was unethical, and I think many doctors would feel the same. We do have a real problem with trying to provide access to after-hours services. It is patchy around the country. Locum services have brought in temporary resident doctors because they have not had Australian doctors who have been able to fill those positions. It is something we do not have a solution to now-I do not mean as a government; I mean as a country-let alone in the future. General practice strategy is looking at this, amongst other things. We do give general practitioners, in a blended payment sense, a reward through the better practice program for providing a comprehensive service. I guess I would want to know, in the honourable member's case, what happened to this person's normal GP. Many general practitioners would cover the after-hours calls of their regular patients, although I have sympathy for GPs. No-one can be expected to work seven days a week 365 days a year. It is a bit rich when you get calls from people you have never known expecting you to have your home or family life disrupted. Many GPs would provide that sort of service for their long standing patients. That is clearly the best sort of service you can get. The lady in question should be taking it up with her own general practitioner and perhaps should be looking for a new general practitioner if she is not satisfied. In the medium term, we will solve this by further changes to a blended payment system that rewards those general practices that provide a comprehensive service. General practice is going through a time of big change. It is one of my highest priorities. To me, it is the key to the whole basic primary health care system in Australia. If you are going to fix general practice, you have to fix the problems of it being progressively deskilled and you have to fix the morale problem. A third of GPs in Australia would leave tomorrow if they had anything else they could do. That should be a major worry to every honourable member in this House. I heard Peter Baume's name mentioned. In the same report, Peter Baume said that general practice has been progressively deskilled over 20 years. What these changes will collectively do is dramatically increase the status of general practice. I make no apology for that. General practice has been the dumping ground for the medical profession for too long. General practice has been of low status for too long. General practice has been, by and large, poorly remunerated, particularly for those people trying to provide a comprehensive family GP service. They have found their easy patients are skimmed off because people go to the 24-hour bulk-billing clinic and say, 'We didn't want to bother you. It was easy.' They go to their GP only for the harder stuff. So their case loads change. Even though before the election we said that we were going to take $400 million out of the better practice program, it is for that reason that we reversed that change-because the better practice program is providing a blended payment that gives us the capacity to reward GPs who are doing things that may not be properly remunerated, such as providing afterhours care. I can provide no immediate answer to the honourable member except to say that I do not believe these things will make it any worse. I do hope that these strategies that we are employing over the medium term offer some prospect. If he would care to take up with me or my office the particulars of his case, I would be happy to look into it.",48
61,Mr FILING,PAIRS,"I am sorry to dwell on this. Could I ask the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), given that the coalition is not keen to have this matter looked at by a committee in the House of Representativesand we understand that the Senate committee is now examining this matter, and that may be of some help to usMr Lee-For two hours.",49
62,Mr FILING,PAIRS,"-I was not aware of the exact time. Is the minister prepared to look at some means of having a review in relation to the actual specific effects of the changes in particular areas of the country so that members and others who have an interest are able to look at how this has impacted locally, with a view, given that there are cases with specific problems-and, as he has already acknowledged, it is not possible to come to a conclusion about the likely effects of the mediumterm problems-to entertaining that as part of the process?",49
63,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"I cannot help but respond to two points the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) raised in his last contribution. The first thing he raised was the issue of cost shifting. He has once again repeated his claims that state governments are cost shifting onto the federal government. When the minister makes these claims, he does not concede that there are certain changes the federal government has made which, in effect, cost shift from the federal government back onto the states. Whether it is a shortage of nursing home beds, which requires people to stay in state funded public hospitals a bit longer, or whether it is changes for psychiatric patients' access to their psychiatrists, which requires more people to be treated as in-patients, these things end up shifting some obligations back onto areas which are funded by state governments. So it is not a one-way street. The minister, in this budget-not in this particular piece of legislation, ];ltV the minister raised it in his speech on this particular clause-has implemented a cutback of $75 million this financial year in federal funding for public hospitals. I am sure the minister will concede that that is the case. It is in the budget papers-$75 million this year. The information I have received is that at the moment the state departments of health have only indicative indications as to how that $75 million will be split between the different states. Given that we are now in the first week of November, almost halfway through the financial year, I would find it a bit disturbing if the federal Department of Health and Family Services or if the federal Minister for Health and Family Services has not advised his state colleagues of how much of those cutbacks they will have to carry in their state public hospital systems. I would be grateful if the minister could either advise me, now or on notice, of whether state ministers have been advised of how the cuts will be distributed. I am sure he would think it is rather difficult for state health ministers and the administrators of public hospitals right around Australia to be able to implement federal reductions in funding for public hospitals if they do not yet know how much New South Wales will have to carry or what proportion Tasmania or Western Australia will have to carry. That is the first issue. The second issue is that on that last occasion the minister got back to the number of general practitioners. I would like to finish with a very brief question to the minister. Does he expect that there will be a reduction in the number of intakes in the medical schools this coming year? I think there was a reduction of 30 last year. I am not sure of the exact figure, but I thought there was some negotiated reduction last year. Has there been any progress made in the last six months? Is the minister prepared to give the House an undertaking that if his discussions with the deans prove not to be successful, he will be willing to bring back legislation to this House that does give the Australian people the ability to influence the intakes of the medical schools around Australia?",49
64,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAIRS,"Firstly, in response to the shadow minister, cost shifting does go both ways. I have always conceded that, although we do not do things anywhere nearly as blatantly or to the volumes that the states do. We have not had the gall to have a public hospital with 62 so-called privatised outpatient clinics. We have not had the gall to have a hospital casualty with a Medicare bulk-billing clinic in it specialising in plaster removal. Mr Lee-Which state was that?",50
65,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAIRS,"It might have slipped my mind for the moment. In the end, the issue of cost shifting is one that is putting immense strain on the Commonwealth Medicare budget. The $75 million in the budget will be a serious disincentive for states to cost shift. When I rang up one state health minister to tell him about it-again, not trying to dob him in-I got him on his mobile phone and he said, 'Actually, that's okay, mate. We don't cost shift; we were waiting to see what you did in the budget and if you didn't do anything, we were going to go for it.' In the end, the Commonwealth cannot sustain that sort of shift in cost. It is quite irrational the states will have to shift $10 of cost on to the Commonwealth to save $1. We are looking at a cooperative approach as part of the COAG process that will be discussed by chief ministers, premiers and the Prime Minister next week. Even if that does not come to a resolution, I hope we can make progress on a measure and share basis whereby we look at efficient ways of doing things at the margins of Commonwealth-State programs and jointly share in the savings. It is correct that I have yet to advise the states of the amount, although I will be doing this in the very near future-probably within the next week. I understand that the states have already figured this into their budgets. I have had some indication from state ministers what they think they have cost shifted or what they will be up for. All of them feel quite guilty because if you add them up, it is far more than what we think they are doing. Whether that will lead to a cut in public hospital funding, I actually doubt it. It depends how the states respond. In the end, all we are doing is taking back money that is rightfully ours that they promised not to cost shift in July 1995 at the health ministers meeting in Alice Springs. There was a health ministers meeting in Melbourne on Friday. No health minister raised it with me then. They all had the opportunity to do so. That is not to say that they might not have written to me about it. When they saw me in person last week all of them had the capacity to raise it and no-one did. The second question that the shadow minister raised related to medical student intakes. Yes, there has been some progress, but I am not in a position to make an announcement at the moment. I would be prepared to take him into my confidence on that another time if he wishes to be briefed. I do not wish to threaten legislation at the moment, because the deans are, by and large, being cooperative. While they recognise that there is an issue of national interest, I do not think I should wave sticks around. The member for Moore (Mr Filing) asked if we could be a little flexible in how this is that implemented. The answer is yes and no. I have to make substantial savings in health because we have a big budget deficit and it is dramatically in the country's interest that that is addressed. So I am not prepared to back down on the savings we have to make. But in terms of implementation, in terms of trying to be reasonable and in terms of unintended consequences-there are always unintended consequences; perhaps more so in health than any other area-I am prepared to look at those things, particularly when people come to me and quietly and calmly point out that there is a problem here that we have to sort through. Often it can be done. I am more than willing to look at that. I am a little bit less willing when people feel that the first course of action is television cameras because if I blink, everyone will think I am a soft touch, and in health that would be a disaster. In the end, I want to see a health system that works. I want to try to be fair about what we are doing. At the margins there is some flexibility. There is this particular concern with locum services. I have a very big one in my own electorate. It is not my desire to close them down. If you look back at the original press release on budget night, you will see that we understood that there was potential difficulty with locum services. Given that this will take several years to implement and have an effect, we have a bit of time to do that and I am more than willing to do so.

66,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"-The opposition will not be opposing this particular schedule, but we note the explicit assurance of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to the honourable member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly). In an answer in the House a couple of days ago, the minister gave an assurance to the House that these changes would not make it more difficult to get temporary resident doctors. As long as the minister keeps that pledge and maintains that commitment, we will not be opposing this schedule.",52
67,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAIRS,"Firstly, we are saying that temporary resident doctors have to have appropriate qualifications, but we have left the definition of 'appropriate' necessarily broad. Secondly, we will try to ensure that these positions are filled by Australians in the first instance. There will be appropriately qualified Australians, particularly amongst the new pool of overseas trained doctors. The net effect of that will be that places that rely on temporary resident doctors, if they cannot get an Australian to fill the position, will still be able to fill the position. Originally, there was a phase-out on 1 July 2000 in the bill. I had that removed. I think we are still going to be relying on TRDs in the year 2000. I am aware how important this is, particularly in Queensland, and I do not want to do anything that makes it harder for them. Amendment agreed to. Schedule, as amended, agreed to. Title agreed to.",52
68,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"For the record, the opposition still has major reservations about the Health Insurance Amendment Bill. We will be opposing on the voices but, given the number of divisions we have had this morning, we will not be forcing the House to another division. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Motion (by Dr Wooldridge)-by leaveproposed: That the bilI be now read a third time.",52
69,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"For the record, we do have grave reservations about the bill because of the impact that it will have on Australian interns and medical students and because of the changes it makes to Medicare rebates. We have expressed that in the debate this morning. We will oppose it on the voices, but we will not force the House to another division. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. NA 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 November, on motion by Dr Wooldridge: That the bilI be now read a second time. upon which Mr Melham moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the BilI a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the construction of the Hindmarsh Island bridge can now proceed without further delay and without prejudicing the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975"".",52
70,Mr SLIPPER,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"Before I was interrupted by the adjournment debate last night, I was speaking in support of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996 and against the amendment moved by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham). I think it would be instructive for those opposite to consider the history of the Hindmarsh Island saga. It has been around now for about 16 years. The Chapmans were looking at putting in a marina development and various approvals were received. There was a change in government in South Australia. There was an investigation by Justice Jacobs and a recommendation that a bridge proceed. About 1993, the Aboriginal legal rights movement, aided and abetted by the Labor Party, asked the South Australian minister for aboriginal affairs and the then federal minister, Robert Tickner, to halt construction of the bridge. The relevant act which gave the federal minister power is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. Under that particular act, under section 9 and section 10, the minister has power to make declarations which can effectively stop a development. The minister issued an emergency declaration and then referred the matter to Professor Saunders for a report. That report was handed down and found that 'women's business' did in fact exist. The Chapmans took the report, on appeal, and in the Federal Court the Chapmans were successful. The Saunders decision was overturned on a number of grounds. One of those grounds included the fact that the then minister failed to look at of the evidence. A little after that there was a suggestion that the so-called 'secret women's business' was entirely fabricated. And one could imagine the concern in the community generally, and indeed the concern among the Aboriginal community in the area, over the fact that 'women's business' allegedly had been fabricated for the purposes of stopping construction of the bridge. The South Australian government established a royal commission, and that was the appropriate course of action. The royal commissioner was Iris Stevens, a former judge. Her decision was mentioned by me last night. She found that the whole of the women's business was a fabrication, and in particular the claim that there was spiritual and cultural significance of Hindmarsh within the Aboriginal tradition of Ngarrindjeri women which was crucial for the reproduction of the Ngarrindjeri people and of the cosmos which supported their existence was fabricated; and also the claim that the women's business required the prohibition of the construction of the bridge was fabricated; so, in effect, the claims of those people who sought to stop the construction of the bridge were rejected in the decision by the royal commissioner. The federal mInIster, however, was not happy with that. He referred the matter off to Justice Mathews for a further report. Justice Mathews brought down a report which did not say that the construction of the bridge would amount to desecration of Aboriginal heritage. However, the Full Court ruled that the Mathews appointment was invalid and so in effect the Mathews report was not worth the paper it was written on. Consequently, when we came to government with the tremendous landslide and mandate we received from the Australian people on 2 March this year, the new minister was faced with a predicament. This saga had been around lor some 16 years. The legal advice given'''to the government was that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs would have either to commission a further report under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984-and already some $6 million in costs had been incurred all and a new report would have taken the costs to more than $7 million--or he could bring in legislation. What the minister has decided to do is to restore certainty. He has decided to bring in legislation to make sure that this bridge can go ahead. Last night I paid tribute to the women of the Ngarrindjeri tribe who exploded this myth for what it was. They were the women who had the intestinal fortitude to stand up and say that they did not want their heritage trampled on and that they were not prepared to allow people to claim that the 'women's business' existed when it did not. The Labor Party has behaved disgracefully. The shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs and the Labor Party should have their tails between their legs. They should be ashamed of the way they handled this. They have been prepared to use false evidence of alleged Aboriginal traditions with a view to stopping development of the bridge at all costs.",52
71,Mr MELHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,There is no basis for saying that at all.,53
72,Mr SLIPPER,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"The shadow minister really ought to support this legislation. However, the government and the opposition both now seem to think that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge should be constructed-and I see the shadow minister nodding-but the fact is that if we followed the suggestions of the shadow minister then we would end up in court. If the minister overturned the legal advice which he has received from a range of advisers to the government then we would end up in court and delay would continue. The minister ought to be congratulated for having the decency, for the promptness, for bringing in this legislation. What he is saying and what the people of Australia are saying and what the Ngarrindjeri women are saying, those who oppose the fabrication of their history, is that this matter should be allowed to proceed, and it should be allowed to proceed expeditiously. Also, I have been appalled by the vilificapeople tion of the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan). The Minister for Defence would be one of the most honourable people I have met since I was elected to this place. The Minister for Defence has spoken very strongly in favour of this bill. I think that it is sad when those opposite are prepared to condemn an individual who has made such a tremendous contribution to this country both in his former life, before his election to parliament, and now as Minister for Defence. I must say that when people endeavour to rort and to fabricate secret women's business, what they are doing is destroying the natural sympathy in the Australian community for the plight of Aboriginal people. Mr Melham interjecting",53
73,Mr SLIPPER,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"The Labor Party had an appalling record in the area of Aboriginal affairs over the last 13 years. We will, in first four years in government, spend $428 million more in 1996-97 dollars on indigenous specific programs than did Labor in its last four years. In every one of our first years in government the coalition will spend more on indigenous specific programs than Labor did in any year other than 1995-96. Our priority areas will be Aboriginal health, $97 million more in our first four years than Labor spent in its last four years; ATSIC' s community housing and infrastructure program, CHIP, $26 million more in our first four years than Labor in its last four years; the community development employment program, CDEP, $337 million more in our first four years than Labor in its last four years; the DEETYA run indigenous education and training programs, $147 million more in our first four years than Labor in its last four years; and native title related assistance of $172 million more in our first four years than Labor in its last four years. If one looks at the plight of the Aborigines in the area of health, housing, infant mortality and educational standards after 13 years of Labor government, they will realise that Labor Party members have a hide to come in here and accuse us, and in particular to accuse the Minister for Defence, of not being sympathetic to the plight of Aborigines. Those have ignored Aboriginal problems over the last 13 years. They have thrown money at the problem but they have been more process driven than outcomes driven. This government is determined to improve the outcomes for Aboriginal people. We are determined to ensure that construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge is able to proceed expeditiously. (Time expired)",54
74,Mr FILING,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"The secret women's business involved in the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair will probably go down in the annals of political history along with the Zinoviev letter in British political history, because, quite clearly, we have witnessed in recent years one of the greatest political forgeries of our times. The fact of the matter is that this House was conned into treating the secret women's business-which was a forgery-with the our seriousness that ordinarily members would give to important traditional materials, by the then minister who was not only prepared to use a forgery to vilify his political opponents four but actually unprepared to make the proper, necessary, investigation to ascertain the veracity of the documents in the first place. I make no reflection on the shadow minister although, of course, he was part of the Labor Party that stood by the minister in this particular matter. I might add also that there were some coalition members who wilted under the pressure at the time. Unfortunately, the then shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs did not do herself proud by the fact that she refused to take the disallowance motion through this House after it had been passed by the shadow cabinet which, at the end of the day, was an obligation required of the then shadow minister, the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), who, of course, was the subject of this vilification campaign undertaken both within and without the House. The member for Barker, as the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) has said, treated his role in this matter with an honourable-I thinkdegree of conduct. At the end of the day, he was hanged-I suppose in politics you can be hanged more than once-but he was certainly hanged at the time for an offence he could not possibly have committed, because he was hanged for",54
75,Mr MELHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,He's done a remarkable resurrection.,55
76,Mr FILING,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"Under normal circumstances a number of us welcome sometimes the witty interjections from the 'member for blanks', as we like to call him, but under these circumstances",55
77,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,Refer to the member by his correct title. He is the member for Banks.,55
78,Mr FILING,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"The member for Banks; I am sorry. He would be better to remain silent and perhaps use this silence as an act of contrition on his part for being part of what was a very sorry campaign of vilification against the member for Barker. I have my differences from time to time with the member for Barker, but I must say that in his conduct in this place and his conduct as a member of parliament and as a shadow minister he acted with the utmost honour. But the irony was he was hanged for an offence he could not possibly have committed. That was, of course, this so-called offence of handling documents that, at the end of the day, were quite clearly utter forgeries. Not only forgeries; they were forgeries used in a way that demeaned this place because they were used to try to vilify someone who had acted only to represent his constituents. The irony is that at the end of the day the member for Barker, in whose electorate the Hindmarsh Island Bridge was to be constructed, in fact opposed the construction of the bridge personally. So, in other words, he was not, in fact, exercising or grinding his own personal political axe. He opposed it. But he thought that in this case the principles were worth fighting for and in essence all he did was to represent his constituents properly. I can recollect this particular debate only too well because it was in November 1994. The reason I recollect it is because at the time we had only recently in Western Australia witnessed that in response to calls to make a similar order in relation to the old Swan Brewery, both he and his predecessor had refused to act. ""< .. It is interesting that in that particular instance the person who stood to benefit the most from the refusal to take out an order was, of course, a substantial donor to the Western Australian Labor Party, the party that became so thoroughly and utterly discredited as a result of the WA Inc. saga. As a consequence, quite clearly one could have taken not only the inference being drawn from it, but one could also have taken it that the reticence to act, on the part of the minister, in this particular instance was because they did not want to upset somebody who had donated many hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Western Australian Labor Party. I mention that because in more recent times we have seen some attacks, based on potential conflict of interest, on members of the front-bench in relation to their personal affairs. I would have thought that in that particular instance there quite clearly was the most substantial conflict of interest on the part of the minister. It was interesting in relation to that particular criticism that I raised with him that he had very little to say other than to try to vilify me as being some sort of racist because I had the audacity to stand up and ask him quite simple questions about the way in which he conducted his business as a minister of the Crown. The situation here revolves around the desire and intention of the Chapmans to build and develop a tourist resort on the island that would have been serviced by the building of the bridge. The development also included a marina and zoning for private dwellings. At the time the Chapmans went through all the processes of obtaining relevant approvals, including those required under the state's Aboriginal heritage act. Thorough archaeological and anthropological studies were undertaken and approval was granted. Interestingly enough, these were done under the previous Bannon state labor government which is of interest and significance. Despite these approvals, a group which had been unhappy with the clearance to progress took their case to the federal minister of the override the decision. At issue at the time were three sacred sites and a belief linking the island to the mainland would have been an act of sacrilege. This view was sustained by the minister, though the island was already connected to the mainland by barrage, which had been there for 50 years, separating fresh water from salt water. It something that obviously was overlooked in the case of those who felt it was going to provide a very dangerous threat to the health of local Aborigines. The then minister for Aboriginal affairs placed a temporary ban on the construction 1994, exercising his rights under the Aborigishake nal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protectime; tion Act, and another inquiry was established under the act. So at this stage Commonwealth taking action to overrule one of the states in the belief that it was not acting in the best interests of a group of own indigenous citizens. That inquiry that was commissioned by the then minister was undertaken by Professor Cheryl Saunders, who met with 35 of the Ngarrindjeri women, only four of whom claimed to have heard the so-called secret women's business. On properly. receipt of her report the minister then placed a 25-year protection order on the island. At this point I wish to make some observaminister tions on the manner of the defence of this position taken by the minister in particular, and the Labor Party in general. A public debate on indigenous heritage was generated and I think most of it was negative. As a member who spoke on this matter in 1994, I can remember the unsavoury style and the innuendo that was being attached to this debate by the then government. The shadow minister, and I must say to his credit, has not indulged in the same sort of rhetoric and attacks that the previous minister used to undertake. In fact, he had this stock phrase, 'Never in all of my career have 1-.' Thrtt would usually be the opening comment of some personal attack on anybody who had the temerity to actually challenge his actions as the minister. Any attempt to question the procedures adopted by the government was responded to day to with condemnation for being somebody incapable of understanding the situation of the that Aboriginal people of Australia. In the debate here at the time, I recollect the then minister claiming that a great many of the then opposition members, of which, at a that time, I was one, had disparaged the spiritual beliefs of Aboriginal people in a way was that they would never do in respect of nonAboriginal beliefs, be they Christian, Jewish, Islamic or other religious beliefs. He then claimed that we had exhibited attitudes implicitly based on racial superiority. This was the tone in which this debate was being in conducted. The shadow minister ought not to his head because he was there at the he would know about this because no doubt it was discussed ad nauseam in the we saw the caucus room, as well. At the time, I rejected and protested about this unfair and untrue allegation. With the its benefit of time, we have been presented with the proof. We were dealing with a government that was too arrogant and too interested in political attacks not only to examine properly the details of this particular secret of women's business, but also to do its job The minister was being paid. He had the responsibility to perform his duties as the in a way that was conducive to fairness and proper due process. The patronising attitude of the minister was such that he knew what he wanted to find and he knew what action he wanted to take before the inquiries were called. The rest is history. The true story of the secret women's business did come out but, even then, the then minister, Mr Tickner, still refused to accept it. The effect of this decision in South Australia was significant in terms of polarising public opinion and stimulating debate. Government co-funding of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge project complicated the issue in the minds of taxpayers. The protection afforded by the act prevented construction on the island by prohibiting bulldozing, grading, drilling, excavating or any act done for the purpose of constructing a bridge in any part of the area. The effect this action had on the construction was clearly dramatic. It had a dramatic effect on the Chapmans. Obviously, their project, which had already progressed to an extent that it had absorbed significant funding, was halted without prospect of renewal for at least 25 years. The financial effect of this was devastating. The psychological effect of it must have been pretty great too. However, the Chapmans continued to fight the Commonwealth, and they made successful appeals to the Federal Court. I add for the benefit of the shadow minister that it is interesting, as I mentioned earlier, that none of this opposition to the project occurred while the Bannon government or the state Labor governments were in office. Apparently, while they were in office, it was not something that substantially stimulated opposition to the extent of asking the minister to undertake an order. As a result of commitments made by the predecessor of Bannon or the state Labor governments, the state government of South Australia had inherited some substantial financial liabilities. In May 1995, media reports in South Australia claimed that the secret women's business was a fabrication. The controversy, fuelled by the delays and costs involved in this issue, caused the state government to appoint a royal commission to look into the secret women's business, its veracity and origins. The commission found that the business was a total fabrication. That view was supported by a group of courageous Ngarrindjeri women, known as the 'dissident women'. Further, it found that the business had emerged in response to a need for the antibridge lobby to provide something of sufficient cultural significance to warrant the making of a declaration by the federal minister. The purpose of the fabrication was to prohibit construction of the bridge. Even so, notwithstanding the commission's findings, the then minister continued to fight all of the evidence and facts staring him in the face. He took an appeal to the full court of the Federal Court. That appeal was also dismissed in December 1995. As I have already said, the real scandal is that Mr Tickner was able to be conned into blocking the building of a bridge by information which was false. Then, having done so, he defended himself and his position, at enormous financial cost to t-e taxpayer, until the Labor government '·was removed from office. The handling of the matter has done significant damage to and has had a serious effect on the Aboriginal heritage debate. I have no doubt that public cynicism and resistance to claims for protection of legitimate heritage sites has been fuelled by the previous government's actions in this matter. No doubt it will contribute significantly to the native title debate in that state and others, because here we have seen a flagrant case of the use of a forgery in order to try not only to move public opinion and attack and damage the reputation of an honourable member of this House, but also as the basis of a decision of the minister to place a 25-year prohibition on the construction of the bridge. The Australian Labor Party claimed to have a monopoly on looking after the interests of indigenous Australians, and yet it was prepared to seriously undermine public faith in the operation of the act designed to protect the heritage of the very same people. This occurred through poor judgment at senior levels in the government and an inability to accept that an error had been made. The former government defended the indefensible, at great cost to the taxpayer, until it finally lost office. The cost to the Commonwealth, apart from the financial expenditure on inquiries and court processes so far and the loss of confidence in the electorate at a time when native title claims are growing, will increase. There will be further costs and compensation resulting from other litigation by those involved in the matter and I do not expect that this will be an inconsequential amount. The damage to the minister in the former government is obvious and self-explanatory. I am confident that the handling of this issue, in conjunction with the Labor Party's other faults-the insensitive and irresponsible approach taken by the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, especially in the lead-up to this year's election-had a profound effect on Labor's election result in South Australia. Not only did the then minister, Mr Tickner, lose his seat, but also in South Australia the Labor Party took a particularly savage beating and lost seats to the extent that now, from memory, the Labor Party has two seats and the Liberal Party has 10, which is an historical high-water mark as far as the Liberal Party's election fortunes in South Australia are concerned. The members of this parliament are now in a situation where we must act. There is no other option which can lead to any sort of satisfactory result. For those who are in any doubt I will list the main reasons in the time. I have available to me. Unless we act in the way the government has decided there is not just the likelihood but the requirement for conducting yet another inquiry. After years of waiting, court cases and inquiries and expenditure of almost $6 million of taxpayers' money, I, and the great majority of Australians, are appalled at the prospect of another inquiry that could cost up to $1 Y2 million more. The time to act is now. After the flawed procedural treatment received by the people involved in this matter there is a need for the government to stand back and deliver a just outcome. It would not be appropriate for the Commonwealth government to be driven to such a position through litigation. Justice should not be restricted to the people involved in developing the Hindmarsh Island projects but also to the Ngarrindjeri women, both those who fabricated the central issue in this debate and those who had the courage to stand up and expose the fabrication. The government needs to regain the confidence of the community in its dealings with indigenous heritage. To fail to do so will not serve the interests of any Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders in this country, and I believe that it should be a precursor to a review of the way in which we handle indigenous heritage and native title. The question of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge will go down as a sorry affair in Australian government. We must act now to adopt this bill if we are to avoid an even more sorry situation. I commend the government for taking the action to remedy this situation. I will tum briefly, if I may, to the amendments proposed by the member for Banks. Unfortunately, I could not catch all of his speech last night because I was interrupted whilst listening to it. I try very hard to listen to his speeches because I believe he does make a sincere effort to present the views of his particular philosophical grouping in this place. I think that of all the members in the Labor Party, he is one of the most sincere. However, I must say that in the circumstances he is mistaken. The way in which he has conducted his party's interests in relation to the debate since the Labor Party lost government and has been in opposition has been suspect. Quite clearly, the Labor Party has a substantial problem in relation to the wash-up of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair. Obviously, there are those who would like to stand and defend the indefensible, as I mentioned, but there are others who are much more ready to concede that they were dragged into this sorry affair. I find both his second reading amendment and his amendment relating to the Racial Discrimination Act prevailing redundant. He might be able to advise us at some stage as to how any particular act, given the decision by the High Court in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act in the Mabo decision, that just infringed the Racial Discrimination Act could be considered to be constitutional. May I conclude by reminding members of what I said at the beginning. This whole affair ranks with the Zinoviev letter-I think it came to light in the 1927 general election in the United Kingdom-as one of the great political forgeries in the English-speaking world, if not all of the world. The silly thing is that many of the members of the Labor Party who are now here were, as a consequence of the actions of Mr Tickner, made into accomplices to one of the most sorry and sordid affairs that this particular parliament has ever seen. All I can do is urge Labor Party members not only to acknowledge their sins in relation to this matter but also to ensure that the matter is speedily resolved. (Time expired)",55
79,Mr HAWKER,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"In joining this debate on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996, I must admit I do not know whether I can be quite as charitable as the member for Moore (Mr Filing) in looking at the way the Labor Party has played politics and done some very sorry and sordid things over this whole Hindmarsh Island affair. Listening to what the member for Banks (Mr Melham) had to say, it reminded me a bit of the Bourbons. I think Labor has learnt nothing and forgotten nothing when it comes to approaching this whole issue. Still, according to what the member for Banks has said, Labor has not even made up its mind how it is going to deal with this bill, which I find quite extraordinary. Does that mean that they are still confused? Does it mean they are embarrassed-probably not. Does it mean that it is another example of the sheer arrogance that brought them so undone on 2 March? Whatever it is, I think it really is a disgrace that the Labor Party has not been big enough to come in here and at least admit where it went so terribly wrong and the damage that it has done to so many people because of that. What has happened in the Hindmarsh Island affair is that we have seen a victory for truth. We saw how, when a minister started to interfere in state matters, he well and truly got his fingers burnt for that meddling. One of the things that really does come to mind is the appalling approach of the Labor Party towards this whole thing, and particularly towards anyone who raised any questions about what was being done. When anyone questioned the validity of some of the things that the minister was saying, the general response was to go straight into personal abuse. I really think the whole issue is a very appalling thing. What amazes me about it all, though, is that, now that the truth has come out, now that those who had the courage to stand by the truth have come through, we still do not see the Labor Party being big enough to actually apologise, and not only to those Aboriginal women who had the courage to speak the truth. Instead, all we get is mealymouthed insults and so on. Not only should the Labor Party be apologising to those very courageous women, they should be apologising to all Aboriginal people for what they have done. It really was a very tawdry affair. Not only did it bring the theif ttlinister into total disrepute but also it caused quite a lot of damage in relations with the wider community. There ought to be some accountability on the amount of money, over $6 million already, that has been spent on behalf of taxpayers over this whole tawdry affair for the minister to try again and again to suppress the truth. I think that this was utterly irresponsible. If the Labor Party had any courage, if there were some real men or women amongst the Labor Party, they would have the decency to apologise to the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan). There were some outrageous things said about the member for Barker when he had the courage to stand up for the truth and see it through, and he has been vindicated totally. I guess this piece of legislation is the final chapter, but nonetheless I would have thought that the Labor Party would have had the decency to apologise on all those counts, if they were quite serious about their standing in the community and about the way they have approached this whole affair and the dreadful mess they have caused. As has been pointed out by other speakers, this bill should bring to an end a very shameful saga that occurred over recent years. There has been nothing but damage done by the whole approach of the Labor Party on this matter. Not only have there been great social costs but also, as I mentioned, there have been significant economic costs. If the opposition were to have its way, presumably we would be having yet another inquiry, and that could cost anything up to another $1 Y2 million, which was the cost of the Mathews inquiry as part of this whole saga. The purpose of this bill is to prevent a declaration being made under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Protection Act 1984 in relation to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. This should have occurred with a common sense decision but when this affair is long behind us it will show that this government, and this minister, have acted properly. What it will show is that the previous government were totally inept, incompetent and were prepared to try and push for a travesty of justice. It has been increasingly clear out of all just how little understanding the Labor Party has of Aboriginal issues. We only have to look back to September. On 17 September the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) tabled the Mathews report. Soon we had the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs on radio saying: I am not going to take a recommendation to shadow cabinet to support this. It hasn't got a chance at passing in the Senate. Then he went on 4BC saying that this legislation would breach the Racial Discrimination Act but he forgot to check with his leader and at the same time Mr Beazley said in a doorstop when asked whether he supported it: As I said we will take a look at it. When he was questioned again he said: I want to take a close look at it. In other words, he was not prepared to back his own shadow minister. What it also shows is that after two and half years when all the facts and the truth have come out, Labor still does not know how to respond. What an appalling indictment on the whole of the former government. I suppose that is not altogether surprising when we look at the track record of Labor when it comes to Aboriginal affairs. After 13 years we look at some areas like, for example, health. We find that still the infant mortality rate is two to three times higher than for non-Aboriginals in that area. The male life expectancy of Aboriginals is 16 to 18 years less than for non-Aboriginal males. Diabetes is four times higher in adults and the rate of smoking is double the national average. Looking at housing, after 13 years of Labor we still have problems such as 40 per cent of Aboriginal houses in rural areas needing repair or replacement. In October 1995, 120 remote Aboriginal communities lacked adequate water supply, 134 communities lacked appropriate sewage disposal and 250 communities had no electricity. Looking at education, from 1985 to 1992 the rise in retention rate to year 12 of indigenous students was 11 per cent below that of non-Aboriginal students. In 1991 the proportion of 20to 24-year-old this indigenous students at university was one-third of that of non-Aboriginals. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Hindmarsh saga comes on top on a number of other sagas that we saw under the Labor administration. We had the Ros Kelly sports rorts saga; we had the great duel that went on between the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and his successor, Mr Keating, but I really think this saga topped them all. In February 1994 we had a report that was delivered to the South Australian government by Justice Jacobs which said, amongst other things: Women's business never arose. On 23 May that year Professor Cheryl Saunders was appointed by the then Minister Tickner to report on the section 10 declaration. On 10 July the then Minister Tickner made the famous declaration banning construction of the bridge for 25 years. On 15 February 1995 there was a judicial review by the Federal Court that quashed the Tickner order but he was not going to give up. On 24 February he appealed the court ruling. On 19 July 1995 the South Australian royal commission into the Hindmarsh Island issue was set up, headed by Justice Stephens. On 13 November 1995, 'the royal commission concluded its hearings. There were 6,000 pages of evidence under oath and, extraordinarily, the proponents of the women's business did not even tum up. On 7 December there was a quashing of Tickner's section 10 declaration by the Federal Court and on 19 December 1995 Justice Stephens delivered the report. I quote parts of the major findings: The women's business emerged in response to a need of the anti-bridge lobby to provide something of sufficient cultural significance to warrant the making of a declaration by the federal minister and the women's business was unknown to the 12 dissident Ngarrindjeri women who gave evidence to the commission and who were described by the royal commissioner as credible witnesses. Looking at the whole of the evidence, including the history of events-the anthropological evidence and the evidence of the dissident women-the whole claim of the women's business from its inception was a fabrication: it was a fabrication. Clearly, the purpose of the fabrication was to obtain a declaration prohibiting the construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge under the Commonwealth's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. I will just come back to that point: the whole claim of the women's business from its inception was a fabrication. It seems extraordinary that the minister was prepared to continue when it was so obvious to everyone but him. Yet, on 16 January 1996, Senator Crowley, who was a deputy for the then Minister Tickner, appointed Justice Mathews to report to her under section 10. On 11 April this year, Piper Alderman, solicitors in Adelaide, lodged a notice in the High Court on behalf of the dissident women questioning the validity of Justice Mathews's appointment. On 30 June this year, the Mathews report was handed to Senator the Hon. John Herron, Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. On 24 July this year, Justice O'Loughlin lifted the stay order on the section lO--on the bridge. On 6 September this year, the High Court-nothing less than the High Court-determined six to one that Justice Mathews's appointment by Tickner was invalid. It is just quite incredible when you look at that whole saga: it just went on and on and on. The minister getting it wrong and wrong and wrong, and always leaving the bill for someone else to pick up. So we have this extraordinary saga, this extraordinary bungle, and look at the damage it has done to so many people and look at all the other negative results from it. If we look at the results of this dreadful bungle by the Labor Party, it was costly both economically and socially. In the social sense, it created distrust and animosity in the community. It was a despicable addition to an already appalling record in the administration of Aboriginal affairs and, of course, it did nothing for the cause of Aboriginal heritage. Economically, it cost the taxpayers $2 million alone for the royal commission, including legal aid. It cost $1 Y2 million for the Mathews inquiry, and add another $Y2 million in legal aid granted by the €otnmonwealth through legal aid or through ATSIC. There was $1 million for the Federal Court case; $800,000 for the internal Commonwealth costs and the minister's costs on this matter; and $200,000 for the internal South Australian government costs-the two Draper reports, the state Aboriginal affairs internal costs and the minister's internal office costs. One can only speculate as to what the possible implications would have been if this women's business decision had gone ahead. There are implications for mining, for development, for agriculture and, of course, there are the other costs. Look at the further increase in animosity that would have come through this. We are supposed to be working for the opposite; we are supposed to be working for reconciliation and here the Labor Party was doing everything it could to do the exact opposite. The voters in Australia realised what a dreadful thing it was and not only did they throw out the government, of course, they also threw out the minister himself. Just look at his court record on this. There were four court rulings: Tickner v. Bropho-all four judges against Tickner; Tickner v. Chapman-all four federal judges against; Tickner v. Douglas-all four judges against; and the High Court ruling on Judge Mathews's appointment-six from seven judges against. If you include the royal commissioner, 19 out of 20 of our senior judges ruled against the Labor government and against the then Minister Tickner. Even Tickner's attempt to get a favourable ruling from Justice Mathews was ruled invalid and her report stated that there was 'insufficient material' to justify the argument that the area would be desecrated by building the bridge. Of course, the final arbiter for the people of Australia, Tickner versus the people of Hughes-I 1.4 per cent swing against. Now the seat of Hughes, of course, is represented by my colleague, the very effective Danna Vale. I think we ought to look at the aims of this bill itself. The bill is part of the overall coalition government plan of action for Aboriginal affairs. It is part of addressing some of those areas that I mentioned earlier. Over the next four years, this government will be spending an extra $97 million on Aboriginal health. We will be spending $23 million to open 35 additional Aboriginal medical clinics. There will be a 28 per cent increase in indigenous specific health programs. In the area of housing, over the next four years the Commonwealth government is going to spend $1,323 million on indigenous housing and infrastructure.",59
80,Mr MELHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,So you should.,62
81,Mr HAWKER,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"He says, 'So you should'. You had 13 years; what were you doing about it? When we look at educationMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-I ask the shadow minister, the member for Banks, to address his remarks through the chair. The member for Wannon will not take interjections on the floor.",62
82,Mr HAWKER,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"Madam Deputy Speaker, he did tempt me, but I thank you for your ruling. Then we look at the area of education. Over the next 12 months, the government is going to spend $344 million on indigenous education and training. But this bill itself is going to give support to the truth, to the real situation. It shows that Labor supported people who invented the women's business and refused to listen to anyone who disagreed with this. As Judge Stephens said after the South Australian royal commission: I conclude that the whole claim of the women's business from its inception was a fabrication. What a damning indictment on the Labor Party. As I said earlier, I really think Labor ought to be doing a lot more in this. First of all, they ought to be apologising to those 14 Ngarrindjeri women who questioned the claims, who had the courage to come out and speak up for the truth. It should not be forgotten that, when they showed that courage, they faced threats and abuse from their opponents and they suffered the insult that the government of the day would not even listen to them. I would have thought that, if the Labor Party wanted to start to make amends, it ought to be supporting this bill. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) clearly knows that it would be wrong to suggest that the minister should have been allowed to use his discretionary powers over this whole question of the bridge. I would have thought it was important that the Labor Party start to recognise its mistakes before it faces yet another bout of claims from militant groups. This bill ends the wasted time and money and it seeks, most importantly, to heal some of the divisions that were created by this whole sorry saga the Labor Party put together. But I do think that, as I say, Labor members ought to be coming clean on this. They ought to be man or woman enough to actually stand up and say, 'Yes, we did get it wrong. Yes, we caused a lot of heartburn amongst many Australians, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal.' Because we are in this chamber, I would have thought that the other thing the Labor Party ought to have the decency to do is to unreservedly apologise to the member for Barker for what they tried to put him through. He has been totally vindicated in his stand on the whole matter. He has shown great courage against a lot of adversity in seeing this whole matter through and in helping to make sure that the truth did come out. I would have thought that he deserves full commendation for doing that· and a full apology from the Labor Party. I have great pleasure in supporting this bill. I would hope that by the time this debate finishes the Labor Party can actually make up its mind and show that it is big enough to come out and support what it should have supported long ago and in fact admit that it got it totally wrong when Minister Tickner was in charge of this sorry saga.",62
83,Mr CAMPBELL,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"I rise to support the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996 and to oppose the amendment put forward by the opposition. I do so because I think the amendment simply muddies the waters and serves no useful purpose. It also requires an act of trust by both politicians and the legal profession, both of which I find very difficult to accept. I have listened with interest to some of this debate. What was said by the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) was reminiscent of what was said by many other speakers. The truth is that many people in the Liberal Party were as confused as and as hooked on this nonsense as the members of the Labor Party, and those people are still a problem for the Liberal Party. I do not have to identify them because the Liberal Party knows very well who they are. They are an impediment to Aboriginal advancement. I also listened with interest to the member for Wannon talking about the intention of the government to increase their funding in the area of Aboriginal affairs. In many of the areas in which they intend to increase the funding they will simply compound the problem, not solve it. I have said before in this place that Aboriginal medical services are an expensive way of delivering inferior services. If we are genuinely interested in the delivery of services to Aboriginal people, we should be looking at the best form of delivery. It is certainly not through the feuding family fiefdoms that we have set up with the Aboriginal medical services. In terms of Aboriginal housing, until an effort is made to involve Aboriginal people in the construction and ownership of their own houses, we are never going to be able to build enough houses to overcome the acute housing shortage. Until we do that, we cannot address the problems of Aboriginal affairs, which I believe are related to housing, hygiene, health, education, training and employment. If we miss out even one of them, the wheels will fall off the cart and we will not make any progress. That does not seem to be comprehended. People on both sides of the House are still talking about land as though land were some key objective in Aboriginal advancement, when quite clearly that is white nonsense. In speaking on this bill, I must say that I believe that Dorothy Wilson and the people who stood with her are great Australians and should be recognised as heroes. What they did was extremely difficult. I know how difficult it is in this House to buck party discipline. I have voted for things I did not agree with simply because it was much easier than bucking the party system-althtugh I think I have probably bucked it more than most. It is terribly difficult. The effort and intellectual courage that was required by those women was enormous. I believe that Australia owes a great deal of respect to those women. I hope that those women are honoured in the annals of Australian history. It has been suggested that Mr Tickner did not know what he was doing. The truth is that Tickner knew exactly what he was doing. That is where the damnation of the then minister lies. On several occasions as a minister he said to me, 'I am a minister without portfolio. Keating and ATSIC have all the power.' I told my Aboriginal people that and, frankly, they did not believe me. Tickner went to Fitzroy Crossing and told them the same thing. I think Dickey Cox hit the nail on the head when he said, 'Why are you taking the money?' It was quite clear that Tickner was prepared to go along with these things, pandering to a constituency which he thought was important, a constituency made up of a very small elite who had these views. As it is almost question time, I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later date. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA",63
84,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRIVILEGE,I wish to raise a matter of privilege. Mr Downer-Is this about branch stacking?,63
85,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRIVILEGE,You are such a silly boy. Why don't you grow up.,64
86,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Order! The honourable member for Calwell is raising a matter of privilege. You are speaking with the indulgence of the chair. Address the matter.,64
87,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Speaker, as you know, I raise matters of privilege only in serious circumstances. I want to raise a matter of privilege under section 4 of the Privileges Act, which refers to conduct that amounts to, or is intended to amount to, an improper interference with the free performance by a member of the member's duties and privileges. This matter stems from an address that I gave in Brisbane last Saturday at a rally of 3,000 people against racism. I have received the following letter: Mr Theophanous, Contrary to your socialist ideas, Mrs Hanson made a simple statement that there were too many Asians being accepted into Australia and also that money paid by the taxpayer for the Aboriginal people was not reaching them. These are the facts. The dirty, stinking fabian society, dreamers who have polluted our society, with their behind the have reduced the finest white race of Christian people remaining in the world into a multi-coloured society, nothing to do with culture but very similar to a pack of f'ing mongrel dogs. I believe you yourself have had a hand in this treachery and sabotage as I recall you on television advocating the migration into Australia of black Africans. Australia needs them like it needs a hole in the head, or it needs migrant wogs from Cyprus or any othera dirty wordwho has no respect",64
88,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,I think the House understands the thrust of your complaint. Is the letter signed?,64
89,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Speaker, it is only another sentence and I will conclude the letter.",64
90,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,No. The honourable member for Calwell will cease reading from the commentary. I asked: is the letter signed?,64
91,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRIVILEGE,"The letter contains a threat at the end, Mr Speaker. Do you want me to read it or not? Anyway, I wish to raise three issues in relation to this letter. Mr SP:r!AKER-If you feel intimidated or threatened in any way, I am happy to hear that.",64
92,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Speaker, it says here: . .. or any otherand a dirty word referring to mewho has no respect for people who made this country for people like yourself to come to parasite on. Then it says: Any more of thisanother dirty wordfrom you and you will be regretful. It is signed 'AIF Commando, Kempsey'. This letter and similar comments made to me in telephone conversations by a number of people raise three issues which I believe should be referred to the Standing Committee of Privileges. Firstly, do we now have a situation in this country where there is or will be interference with members of parliament expressing views against racism or serving scenes activities, their constituents?",64
93,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"The honourable member for Calwell will resume his seat. I certainly am aware of the major thrust of your complaint. It is a very serious one. Unfortunately, it appears to be anonymous. However, I will reflect on the matter and report back to the House in due course.",64
94,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRIVILEGE,I was going to raise some questions which I think should be looked at in the context of this matter.,64
95,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,I will reflect upon the matter and advise the House.,64
96,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRIVILEGE,"I will raise it with you privately, Mr Speaker.",64
97,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I am happy for that to occur. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Moore-Wilton, Mr Max",64
98,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, could I both correct and add to an answer I gave yesterday to a question asked by the Acting Leader of the Opposition concerning the secretary of my department. In that answer, I incorrectly said that Mr MooreWilton could not, for health reasons, participate in the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. The correct position is that he cannot, for health reasons, be accepted into full membership of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. He is, I am advised, accepted as a limited benefits member. Mr Gareth Evans-A full member after three years. There is a qualifying period.",64
99,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Okay. The point simply is that that was an inadvertent error and, in accordance with proper procedure, I am bringing it to the attention of the House. Can I take the opportunity of adding to the answer by informing the House that, in relation to the Victorian transport position, the situation is, as I indicated to the House yesterday, that when he became the secretary to my department he sought my permission, for transitional purposes, to retain the chairmanship of that body and also the chairmanship of Southern Hydro Pty Ltd, a Victorian government body, fully owned by the Victorian government, which owned some of the small hydro facilities in that state. He put it to me that it was for transitional purposes. He anticipated his obligations would have ceased about the end of this year. He cleared that arrangement directly with the Victorian Premier and with me. Mr Moore-Wilton has informed me that he will be resigning both of those positions with effect from 31 December this year, which is broadly in line with the understanding that I had. He advises me that, thus far, no conflicts of interest to his understanding have arisen. As I indicated to the House yesterday, his total remuneration package before taking up the position of Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet was considerably in excess of what he now receives. The only other thing I would add is that the remuneration in respect of the transport position was $50,000, as indicated yesterday by the Acting Leader of the Opposition, and $30,000 in relation to Southern Hydro. I did explicitly approve the arrangements. I accept responsibility in full for that decision. I do believe that there has been any material conflict of interest and, frankly, I think transitional arrangements of that kind, when you seek to get the best available people for the job, are entirely in order. Mr GARETH EV ANS- Mr Speaker, if on indulgence I may respond, on the basis of that explanation, which I welcome, could the Prime Minister please advise the HouseMr MCGauran-This is a question. Mr GARETH EV ANS-He does not have to do it now. Will the Prime Minister give consideration, as he has now articulated the position, and given that Mr Moore-Wilton is indeed eligible to join the public sector scheme, and since the basis ofJlle answer the Prime Minister gave yesterday tor allowing him to receive another income stream was so that he could make his own superannuation arrangements, to requiring Mr Moore-Wilton to pay back to the Commonwealth the excess of the remuneration he has received over and above that which is necessary for him to make a contribution to the public sector scheme?",65
100,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I say to the Acting Leader of the Opposition that the basis of my allowing him to continue was that it was a transitional arrangement that was going to terminate around the end of the year. The relevance of the health point is that that is the reason why the remuneration was paid into the fund rather than paid directly as salary. Submarine Acquisition Program",65
101,Mr MCLACHLAN,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"I wish to clarify an answer that I gave to a question without notice from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie on 31 October 1996. In answer to a question on the Collins class submarine, I said: In regard to the combat system, the navy is confident that the system will meet all the design requirements and will reach full functionality by early 1998. I wish to inform the House that this morning I was advised by the Chief of the Defence Force, General Baker, that the situation is as follows. The combat equipment system not hardware currently fitted in the Collins class is compliant with contract and meets the design criteria. The combat system software currently fitted in both Collins and Farncomb allows the submarines to operate safely for the conduct of platform and limited combat systems trials and associated operational tests and evaluations. The current software augmented by stand-alone equipment should provide sufficient functionality to commit submarines to some operations by mid-1998. While this interim system is expected to meet the navy's minimal operational requirement, full functionality of the software as required by the current contract will not be available in this time frame. The department is currently conducting negotiations to clarify the configuration of the final combat system. NA Interest Rates",65
102,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Did the Treasurer say this morning that today's interest rate cut was not necessary to give the economy a kick along and that three per cent-plus growth is good growth? Does he recall his leader, now the Prime Minister, saying after last year's budget that, if we are to make lasting inroads into unemployment, we have to achieve and sustain growth of four to five per cent over the rest of the decade and beyond? Isn't the truth of the matter that we do need four per cent-plus growth to reduce unemployment and that, by settling for three, this government has simply given up on unemployed Australians?",66
103,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Today's interest rate reduction is unqualified good news for Australian home buyers. The only people that are down in the mouth and upset about interest rate reductions today are the Australian Labor Party, and we can understand why. I must say that it ill-behoves the Australian Labor Party to doomsay around on the media of this country about how bad interest rate reductions are because the Australian public are working you out. They are working out what the Australian Labor Party stands for, and they are working out that the Australian Labor Party stands for high interest rates, high difficult circumstances for home buyers and pressure on families. I do want to come back to the question of growth, because to have a situation of three per cent-plus growth in the country puts us in the upper reaches of the OECD and indicates, with good growth prospects and low inflation prospects, how good the prospects of the Australian economy are. And how long your faces are that the prospects of the Australian economy are so good! I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition of one thing. He is apparently now throwing off the three per cent growth. Is that right? I recount to him that the last person on his side of politics who understood economics, Ralph Willis-before you took overgave a speech to the Economics Society of Australia on 28 June 1995. Listen carefully. The then Labor Treasurer, Ralph Willis, speaking of the 1995-96 budget, said this: The key feature of the budget forecasts is the continuation of strong growth in 1995-96 at 3%per cent, a welcome moderation from the very rapid 4%per cent expected in 1994-95. The Labor Party tried to moderate growth below four per cent and, if you had any understanding of monetary economics, which you do not, after your performance on deeming rates todayMr Gareth Evans-Are you saying the Prime Minister was wrong?",66
104,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I only do this because you interject. I wouldn't do this if you did not interject. Your performance was described by the press as a 'Kerin like performance' in relation to deeming this morning. I do not like to remind you of what you actually said. The reason why monetary policy was increased in late 1994,66
105,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Tell us.,66
106,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I can't! No, Prime Minister, we want to keep him there. That is the important thing. Monetary policy was tightened in late 1994 to reduce growth below four per cent. That was the position of the Labor Party. That is why official rates were costs, increased 2% per cent at the end of 1994. That is why the Labor Party put up interest rates and that gave us the challenge to bring them down. And, Mr Speaker, today is a great day in meeting that challenge. Privatisation",66
107,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Finance. Is the minister aware of policy objectives for the privatisation of publicly owned assets that differ from the objectives announced by the government? What role will privatisation play in assisting Telstra to succeed in the global market for telecommunications? Mr FAHEYI thank the honourable member for his question. It has long been the view of the coalition that the primary role of government is to foster and promote a climate of equitable opportunity, to provide for those in our community who cannot provide for themselves and to regulate where necessary the activities of the private sector. They were the policies that the coalition took to the community prior to 2 March and for which we received overwhelming support. The reasons for our privatisation policies and the reasons they received overwhelming endorsement from the electorate include a number of things. They include a recognition of the fact that it brings about a significant reduction of government debt and the interest obligation that is attached to it, it brings about improved efficiency and quality of service, it brings an incentive and provides for the maximising of corporate performance, and it gives a chance to the ordinary people of Australia to invest in shares. For years the Labor Party platform demanded resolute defiance of the idea of government selling assets. It was a sop for those in the Labor Party, the rank and file, and the executive wing of the ALP never took any notice of that. This government has made it clear that there is no Labor Party-styled dash for cash involved in our privatisation objectives because the proceeds of asset sales will not be used by this government to artificially inflate the budget bottom line. I was encouraged when I read the speech delivered by the Leader of the Opposition to the National Press Club in August 1994. Noone on this side of the House would object to anything stated in that speech. He said: The primary objective driving the privatisation program is to make Australia an efficient, internain tionally competitive economyof course we agree with thatand that means introducing competition into our enterprises and into our market sectors. He went on in that speech to say that privatisation creates jobs-we hear a great deal about jobs from that side of the House. The Leader of the Opposition indicated that privatisation supports that. He also said: The ""net gain"" can take many forms: potentially better services and lower prices for consumers; stronger enterprises and greater competition for our economy; and in the broader sense, making government funds available for new policy. They are fine words and there are no arguments from government memb<Jt-s about any of those objectives. Unfortunately, we sawand history will show this; history already shows this-that the sale of government assets by Labor was simply a ruse to hide the need to take the cash to cover its deficit addiction. I was a little disturbed to see last week that there has been a change clearly in policy on the part of the opposition. In the debate in another place in respect of the CFM bill, the now spokesperson on privatisation made a number of statements. He indicated that there were six tests which must apply for privatisation. He indicated that the principles that allowed the Labor Party to support the sale of CFM was that CFM operates in a competitive market. The reason they were not prepared to support the partial sale of Telstra, according to the spokesperson, was the market for Telstra was not competitive. Where has the Labor Party been? Does it not recognise the fact that, as from 1 July next year, Telstra moves into a deregulated market. There is no regulation. It has to operate very much in full-blooded, unhindered competition. That is exactly the reason why the government argues the need for the partial sale of Telstra. It is so that Telstra can survive in a deregulated market. It will give Telstra greater opportunity to emulate the sort of deal that the former government owned British Telecom has just done in merging with the US phone company MCl. Glenda Korporaal yesterday'S Sydney Morning Herald said-I think this is a very valid point: A domestically-focused, government-owned BT could never have dreamed of pulling off the megadeal British Telecom has put its name to over the weekend. It's not just the financial ability for a merger provided by a stockmarket listing; it is the whole gamut of operational efficiencies made possible by being freed of political masters and the more entrepreneurial, competitive leading-edge managerial culture which is allowed to develop in a corporation that reports to shareholders rather than politicians. The other five tests given by the spokesman in respect of privatisation are just as confusing. But they come down to a simple little policy, which clearly the Labor Party supports, that there ought to be funds put into providing for the services that can be best done by the private sector. It is clear that jobs can be created through the sale of government assets in the appropriate circumstances. In respect of Telstra, the competitive edge that will be there from 1 July next year demands-not simply puts the question-that Telstra gets out there and gives a service to the community, at the same time allowing government to retire debt and allowing for the best environmental program in this nation's history to be implemented.",67
108,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. I refer the minister to the government's massive-500 per centincrease in the environmental management charge or reef tax. Does the minister recall giving the follow written commitment to the Independent Boat Owners Association in May last year: 'I would like to assure you that the Liberal Party is opposed to the introduction of an environmental management charge'? Why has the government broken that promise to that association? How will that decision meet the Prime Minister's jobs test that he would 'ask of every policy initiative and every change the question: would it contribute to a generation of jobs?'",68
109,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question addresses the reef charge which has had attention brought to it by a large number of members. The question about the environment is better addressed to Senator Hill, who is the minister responsible, but, in relation to that, Senator Hill announced last night that he will hold an independent review of the conduct of GBRMPA by Mr Brown, a former senior public servant. The purpose of the review would be to examine the efficiency and effectiveness of the authority, to assist the authority's management of the reef, to examine the services provided by the Queensland government to GBRMPA, to look at the licensing systems operated by GBRMPA within the park and, finally, to look at the economic contribution made by the aquarium to the authority. He will report back to Senator Hill-and Senator Hill is responsible for the environmental charge. Mr Martin-I seek leave to table a letter from the minister, just to refresh his memory on what commitment he gave last year on behalf of the opposition. Leave not granted. Interest Rates",68
110,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answering a question from the Acting Leader of the Opposition, the Treasurer referred to benefits that will flow from the interest rate cut. My question is Reef Tax addressed to him. Will he advise the House what benefits will flow through to Australian families and businesses as a result of the decision today by the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates by one-half of one percent?",68
111,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. As most members would be aware, this morning the Reserve Bank of Australia announced that it would cut the official cash rate by 50 basis points, to 6.5 per cent. Already I am aware of three of the major banks that have announced a reduction in the standard variable mortgage interest rate by 50 basis points. When this government was elected, the standard variable rate was 10.5 per cent. As a result of the reductions that have taken place today, the standard variable mortgage rate is 8.75 per cent. For an Australian on an average mortgage that represents a saving in interest of $145 a month. There is nothing that makes this government prouder than being able to deliver to the families of Australia benefits of that kind in a reduction in home mortgage rates. This is a government that said it would stand by the battlers and the families of Australia; and today this government delivers again. This government has now delivered a 1% per cent reduction, $145 a month-after tax-on the average mortgage to the average Australian family. Nobody in Australia could greet this as other than unqualified good news. It is a disappointment to us to see the Labor Party so churlish in the face of such a great achievement. 'Good news,' the Acting Leader of the Opposition says sotto voce across the table but he cannot go out to the media and say 'good news'. He does not have it in him to congratulate the government on its performance. All he can do is go out and talk in Kerinesque-speak about deeming rates. I do want to make another point in relation to this: when one takes into account not only the standard variable mortgage rate but the average rate, including fixed term rates, basic rates and honeymoon rates-which means the average mortgage rate paid by the average Australian, taking into account mortgage originators-one sees that the average rate paid by the Australian home buyer today is now at its lowest level since 1974. We are now back at pre-Whitlam levels. I guess that when we think of all the damage that was done to the Australian economy by the Whitlam government, one of the proudest boasts of this government will be that in this area, at least, it can undo the damage of the Whitlam government and return Australians to the opportunities they had before the prices-wages spiral of the failed Whitlam government in 1974. We concede that it will take a long time to undo the damage that was done in relation to the current account, to undo the damage that was done in relation to foreign debt and to undo the damage that was done in relation to Commonwealth debt. It will take us years to turn those things around; but today we can stand and say to the Australian public that these are the best opportunities since 1974. We can point out to Australian families not only the benefits in relation to home loans but that the family tax initiative on 1 January give families the opportunity for tax relief in relation to their children and the opportunity for a good Christmas and a better New Year, opportunities which could only have been dreamt about under the failed Labor administrations. Nothing will give Australians more opportunity, nothing will give them more hope for their families, than the changes we have seen over recent months. This government is proud to stand here representing those Australian families. Salmon",68
112,Mr QUICK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I refer the minister to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection SeI}'ice's May 1996 draft risk analysis of salmon imports which concluded that the risk of exposure to 20 overseas diseases 'cannot be quantified'. In light of that analysis, why is the government putting at risk the viability of the Tasmanian salmon industry? Will the minister give a clear and unequivocal guarantee that producers in my electorate will be fully compensated if any of their salmon stock becomes infected as a result of the government's decision to allow salmon imports?",69
113,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and simply make the observation that the process is by no means complete. It is out for peer review at the current stage. I do not know what the final conclusion will be. I simply make the general points that we maintain a very conservative approach to quarantine, that it will not be finalised ahead of the receipt and implementation of any recommendations out of the Nairn review and that the matter will be considered by cabinet. Foreign Aid",69
114,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is the government committed to maintaining an overseas aid program; is this commitment widely shared; and is the level of Australian overseas development assistance appropriate as a proportion of the budget, given will Australia's current economic circumstances?",69
115,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,69
116,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are some very weak interjections, Mr Speaker. I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. It is a very important question. Let me just make it perfectly clear that this government does stand committed to a substantial aid program which does assist with the reduction of poverty through sustainable development. Our aid program addresses, in particular, humanitarian concerns for those people who live in great poverty and obviously, to some extent, it does promote our national interests. The fact is that there are varying degrees of public opinion on the issue of overseas development assistance. But I think many Australians feel very strongly about making a contribution, including making one directly themselves, to those who are disadvantaged around the world. Many Australians, for example, have been able to express their genuine concern for the plight of others by giving to the work of Australian nongovernment organisations. These nongovernment organisations are, at the moment, looking at responding to the emergency that is taking place in Zaire. I have already announced to the House that I have called upon NGOs to put proposals to me for rapid response to that emergency. I think it is important that the debate be properly understood and that it is perfectly clear that many Australians wish to provide humanitarian assistance. They wish to give to people who are very substantially disadvantaged. The scenes we see on television night after night in Zaire are the sorts of scenes that, I think, do generate a great deal of compassion amongst the Australian people. I must say though that there has been since the election, and indeed well before, a considerable debate in Australia about the issue of development assistance. One of the contributors to that debate who has gone unheard of is none other than the member for Canberra, who very recently addressed a forum I think here in Canberra. The speech he made regrettably did not get the publicity that, in my view, it deserved. So I brought it along with me to question time today because it is important that we know what the Labor Party thinks about development assistance and what the Labor Party thinks about government spending and taxes-not just talking behind closed doors, but making sure that what they say behind closed doors becomes publicly known. Let us take just one of the remarks made by the member for Canberra-and he is a member of the shadow cabinet. He said to this aid seminar: Like most of you here, I've been making speeches about 0.7meaning the target of aid to GDP of 0.7 per centI've been making these speeches for as long as I can remember. But we are being blunt amongst friends todaythat is code for 'at least no-one will report on this'I think we've wasted our time. So now we know that, despite all your advocacy-and, in particular, the advocacy of the member for Holt, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-of 0.7 per cent, you always believed that you were just completely wasting your time. But what I think is particularly revealing about the speech of the member for Canberra was when he said",70
117,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,70
118,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think you will all be interested to hear this, because I do not think many of you were there. Gordon Bilney, the former memper for Kingston, was there. He was there-he who was the minister for development assistance whom you were all defending furiously up until 2 March. He was arguing that aid to Papua New Guinea should be reduced from over $300 million to $50 million. Is this the position of the Labor Party? Is this an entirely credible position? You will not even deny the argument of the former minister. The Labor Party's position, we conclude, is that aid to Papua New Guinea be reduced from around $320 million to $50 million. I am sure Sir Julius Chan will be interested to hear that. The member for Canberra, of course, is a member of the shadow cabinet. He went on in his speech to say: If the tax revenue stays as low as it is, if the commitment to public expenditure in Australia stays as low as it is ... if those two things happen, we will not get a significant increase in the aid debate. It is not possible. It does not add up. You cannot go on and say, 'We are going to take it off all other levels of expenditure.' It has to be part of the broader debate. That is one reason why we are losing. In other words, the member for Canberra is saying: the Labor Party is about increased outlays and increased tax. If he denies that, you will have to ask yourself one question: why in that speech in relation to those remarks did the member for Canberra say: ... and if anybody reports this, I'll be on the front pages, like Gareth Evans was. , Oh dear! I table the speech of the member for Canberra so that members can have the opportunity to read it to see what the Labor Party says behind closed doors, which varies so dramatically from what it says publicly.  directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. I refer to the minister's preposterous claim made on Lateline last night that public schools will be $2.3 billion better off as a result of his government's decisions. How much of this increase represents the effect over four years of standard adjustments to grants for price movements, enrolment increases and other changes? How does he justify quadruple counting of this nominal growth and presenting it as a real increase by his governmentparticularly since his own department puts the real impact of schools program budget measures at $128 million in total over four years?",70
119,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I see that the member for Sydney has been stung by my comments yesterday, or perhaps the tactics committee said, 'We'd better get this bloke up today. He hasn't been up for a long time. We say that we are making a big deal of this in the Senate, so we'd better have something said about it in the House.' This figure of $128 million, which is said to be the net effectMr Crean-The department said it.",71
120,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It has not been said by the department. That is totally wrong. It was a figure put in the Senate by Senator Childs. That amount is the net effect over the four years of the application of the enrolment benchmark adjustment, which is the process by which we will be sharing in the savings to the states of movements to non-government schools.",71
121,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,71
122,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Do you want to hear the answer or not? Over the next four years, the total Commonwealth spending on government schools will be an additional $2.3 billion over the amount that government schools would be receiving if the 1996 funding levels were maintained over that period. In other words, over this period, taking into account the supplementation and presenting t.bV; in outturn prices, there will be a very significant increase in funding levels for government schools. The misrepresentation and lies which the Labor Party has been spreading around Schools this country about cuts to government schooling are totally false. You say that you want to defend government schools, yet you go around this country telling parents that government school resources will be decreasing, that this will impact on the quality of government schools and that this will have adverse impacts on the quality of education their children will be receiving. Yet you expect them not to exercise their right of choice. With friends like you government schools don't need enemies. We are increasing expenditure on government schools because we believe in improving the quality of schooling for all young Australians. That is why we are concentrating on literacy. That is why we are concentrating on putting vocational education and training programs into schools so that young Australians can get jobs. It is no wonder whatever that the battlers of this country, the low income families who wanted to exercise a choice of schooling, chose the coalition on 2 March and chose it again in the Lindsay by-election. You have absolutely no idea of the impact of these policies and the contradictory impact of your own behaviour.  the answer given by DEETY A to the specific question as to the net impact on the budget over four years. Leave not granted. Employee Share Ownership",71
123,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of measures which will encourage employees to invest in the ownership of their places of work? What benefits does the government see as flowing from employee share ownership plans?,72
124,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Longman for his question. The Liberal-National government is committed to wide employee share ownership. Mr Martin Ferguson-Especially on the front bench.,72
125,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For the poor old member for Batman, employee share ownership. The reason why the Liberal-National government is committed to employee share ownership plans is that we believe blue-collar employees should be given a stake in the businesses of Australia. We think that blue-collar Australians who have a stake in the businesses of Australia will have not only incentives to see them profitable, not only incentives to see Australbuild Ian industry perform and improve, but also the opportunity to secure for themselves the kind of financial independence this government would like to see. As a result of this, this government is providing incentives to encourage employees to take out share ownership in the companies that employ them. The value of shares or rights that can be exempt under a qualifying employee share scheme will be doubled from $500 to $1,000. The employee participation requirement for a qualifying employee share scheme will be eased from three-quarters to two-thirds of permanent employees. These are measures to give $15 million worth of benefits to the blue-collar workers of Australia so they can invest in the companies that employ them. This will be good for the employees concerned. This will be good for industrial relations. This will be good for company profitability. This will be good for savings, which is also something that this government is committed to. This is a government which is committed to the blue-collar employees of Australia. As the Prime Minister said, one of the things that came out of the by-election in Lindsay is, as we saw on 2 March. that it is now the Liberal-National parties that represent bluecollar Australia in this country. Our commitment to blue-collar Australia is not only a commitment to give them a stake in the companies of Australia but also a commitment to give them a stake in their homes with high affordability, to give them a stake in low interest rates, to give them a family tax initiative, which gives them recognition of the costs of raising children, to give blue-collar Australia the kind of opportunity that the Labor Party could never ever develop. The Labor Party had aspirations only for high spending, high debt, high deficit, high tax, high interest rates-high government brought by the low life of the Labor Party. That was the only prospect that the Labor Party held out. It is no wonder that the Liberal-National parties now represent bluecollar Australia. We see delivering to families as part of that. We see delivering employee share ownership as part of that. We want to opportunities for that sector of Australia. That is what our economic program is directed towards. Civil Aviation Safety Authority",72
126,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Given the weekend crash of a Falcon Airlines plane in Queensland, the alleged ignoring of a warning about the airline's safety standards in April and further allegations that a Civil Aviation Safety Authority employee owned a large parcel of shares in Falcon Airlines, are you, Minister, concerned that the dangerous management culture that developed during the Seaview and Monarch era is still the order of the day at CAS A ? Would you reconsider supporting my amendment or a similar one in the Senate to adjust your own bill and give you the power to remove the existing board of CASA and appoint a new one that has the confidence of you, the air industry and the air travelling public?",72
127,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Calare for his question. He raises a very serious matter in regard to an air crash that took place off Cairns on the weekend. Fortunately, all five people on board survived without serious injury, which was more by luck than by design. The airline that was involved in this incident was Falcon Airlines. Falcon has been the subject of some considerable concern expressed by a number of people over the last few months. Falcon was owned by a person by the name of Kilin. At the end of January of this year, Mr Kilin, the then owner of Falcon Airlines, was employed by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority as a flying operations inspector. Concerns about a possible conflict of interest were raised. I understand that Mr Kilin disposed of his shareholding in Falcon Airlines to overcome the alleged conflict of interest. Interestingly enough though, the person to whom he disposed his shareholding was somebody who also shared the same address as he. Mr Crean-It sounds like John Moore.",73
128,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a very serious issue which you would do well to take note of. The new owner, as I mentioned, shares the same address as Mr Kilin. I received a letter back in July of this year-I stand corrected on that date-from Mrs Ingles, the mother of a pilot who formerly worked for Falcon Air. Mrs Ingles did not mention Falcon Air by name in her letter. She asked me to undertake an inquiry into all small airlines. So it was not a specific request to investigate a particular airline. That letter was passed on to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority via the department of transport. The honourable member for Cal are would be interested to know that yesterday I wrote to the chairman of the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority asking him to prepare and to return to me by 5 p.m. today all matters in relation to the surveillance of Falcon Airlines and also all matters in relation to how the Civil Aviation Safety Authority dealt with the issue of conflict of interest. I will take the opportunity shortly to report back in regard to the response that I get from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority chairman. Service Women and Service Nurses",73
129,Ms WORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I refer the minister to the government's election commitment to commemorate the service and sacrifices made by service women and nurses as a result of their involvement in conflicts in which Australia participated. Can the minister advise the House on progress made in meeting that commitment?,73
130,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Adelaide for her interest in this subject and also acknowledge that, in another life outside of this place, she worked as a nurse and a midwii,. So I acknowledge her great interest in this subject. The government has moved quickly to bring to fruition the commitment that we gave prior to the election to commemorate both servicewomen and service nurses. With regard to the question of the member for Adelaide on the service women's memorial, I am pleased to report to the House that negotiations have already commenced between the Office of Australian War Graves, the ex-service women's community and the Australian War Memorial with a view to defining and managing the project. The memorial, which is to be funded by the government to the tune of $150,000, will be located in the sculpture garden of the Australian War Memorial. With regard to the service nurses memorial, as honourable members will know, this year's budget included an amount of $100,000 as a commitment to a proposal put forward by the Royal College of Nurses Australia. That proposal was to commemorate the courage and sacrifice of the service nurses, and it was contingent on that memorial being located in ANZAC Parade. The government's financial commitment to the Royal College of Nurses has been $100,000. It was contingent on receiving endorsement from the Canberra national memorials committee. I am pleased to advise the House that the committee has now approved the service nurses memorial proposal, clearing the way for the site to be dedicated early next year and the design competition to commence. Mr Crean interjecting",73
131,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham!,74
132,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, we have received bipartisan support from the other side of the House, and I would have thought that they would be interested in this subject. The service nurses memorial will commemorate the sacrifice and the contributions of nurses who have given that service and that commitment to the soldiers and other people who have served this nation overseas over almost 100 years. I would also like to acknowledge the support and cooperation I have had from the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government. His cooperation in this matter has been vital in seeing that this commitment is brought forward at the earliest possible moment. It has received widespread support from the ex-service community. The RSL national conference this year also gave support to the service nurses memorial and the service women's memorial. Schools  question for the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Does the minister's figuring on schools funding take account of the $1.5 billion cut in general revenue assistance to the states imposed at this year's Premiers Conference? Given his department estimates that 24 per cent of such assistance ends up being spent on government schools, isn't this tantamount to close to a $400 million cut, swamping any increases made through specific purpose school payments? To assist the minister, it is answers questions Nos 9 and 10 to Senate estimates where the table described in my previous question is set out. Is he aware of evidence given last Friday by Treasury and education officials from both Labor and conservative state governments arguing emphatically, and in detail, that his government's policies will substantially reduce their capacity to support public education?",74
133,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Sydney for his question because it enables me to refute completely the other major misrepresentations that are coming from the Labor side.,74
134,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They have no shame.,74
135,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They have absolutely no shame, as the Prime Minister said. They are shamelessly misrepresenting the situation of government schools and, I must say, only to the damage of the government school sector. Why don't you check the facts? The shadow minister for education has twice-in a press release in August and in a press release dated 15 October-made similar claims to the claims he has made in his question. Unfortunately, the shadow minister has not actually found out what decisions the states took in their budgets because it is entirely at the discretion of the state governments to decide how they will respond to the decisions of the Premiers Conference. I have had my department look closely at the actual decisions, not the imputed decisions, of the state governments in relation to school spending. The actual decisions of the states have been to increase school funding in state budgets by 6.37 per cent since the Premiers Conference. So you can impute all you like cuts of hundreds of millions to public education. You can deem that, but the fact is they have actually increased spending through their state budgets by some 6.3 per cent. That is true for each of the states and each of the territories. So I would suggest that, instead of just sitting there doing nothing, the total inertia of your shadow portfolio, you actually get out, start examining the facts and stop giving currency to lies about the government school to systems, state decisions and Commonwealth decisions, which can only disadvantage the sector which you claim to be defending.  leave to table the comments of the state officials which completely refute the answer the minister just gave. Leave not granted. Dam and Irrigation Schemes",74
136,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Is the minister aware that all dam and irrigation schemes in Australia are now operating at a substantial profit to the Australian economy? Specifically, the most recently completed federally funded scheme, Emerald, produces $72 million a year and one-third of this, $24 million, goes in taxation. Present day building costs are $60 million. Therefore, this dam is being paid for every 2Y2 years. Similarly with the Snowy; similarly even now with the Ord. Is the minister further aware that the Queensland government is commencing a $1,000 million lO-year water program for Queensland for which it will receive no return whatsoever by way of tax, but will create a 30 per cent return for the federal government? In light of these recent developments, could the minister investigate and report to cabinet on how much extra annual revenue would be created if the federal government did as it has always done in the past and contributed dollar for dollar to all dam development schemes?",74
137,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his real interest in matters relating to water.,75
138,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I can feel a dam coming on.,75
139,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister is a little concerned; he can feel a dam coming. But, calm down, that does not mean there is an election coming on. Mr Costello-Oh, I don't know.",75
140,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no dam coming on, Prime Minister. Obviously, Australia's agricultural capacity and our opportunity to maximise trade opportunities in Asia and so forth are, to a very large extent, limited by water. This is a very dry continent, the driest on earth. We need to maximise the water that we have. We need to use it to the best possible effect. We need to make sure that we do so in a sustainable way in an age in which we are very conscious of the environmental implications of any decisions we might make in this regard. We have provided $32 million for a study of Australia's land and water resources as part of our Natural Heritage Trust Bill. At the end of that study, when we will be closely examining what is feasible, what the priorities ought to be, what the social and economic benefits of any expenditure might be, I will be prepared to consider making recommendations to cabinet. Moore-Wilton, Mr Max",75
141,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, is the Max Moore-Wilton for whom you yesterday confirmed a special two-job dealin fact, it is now three-the same Max Moore-Wilton who two weeks ago said that the Public Service had an entitlement mentality and said that a public servant working in Hobart should be paid less than a public servant carrying out a comparable job in Sydney? Is the government planning to slash the pay of public servants outsid- Sydneyfor example, in Hobart? Can the Prime Minister confirm that Max Moore-Wilton is receiving payment of more than $200,000 from his various public sector positions? In addition to the obvious conflict of interest concerns, what message does that double standard send to ordinary Australian workers to whom the government is preaching wage restraint, particularly today being the day on which the government is taking away from workers so many hard won award benefits and conditions?",75
142,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the second part of the question is no, we are not proposing to slash the wages you mentioned. In further answer to the question, I would have thought somebody who chose a salary package in the long term of something in the order of $200,000 to $215,000 as opposed to a salary package which, if he had now been in the position he formerly occupied, would have been worth about $450,000, would hardly be a man who qualified for a sneering reference to an entitlement mentality. Mr MCMullan-He said it.",75
143,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, you are making the sneering reference. You are. I think that what he has demonstrated is a willingness to make a sacrifice in the public interest. I defend what he did. Having defended that, and the member for Canberra having invited me to comment about the treatment of ordinary wage and salary earners in Australia, let me repeat something that I said this morning when I learned of the announcement of the Reserve Bank of Australia about the reduction in interest rates. That is, I would like to thank the working men and women of Australia for the salary restraint that has been exercised over quite a period of time. I recognise that. Contrary to what is sometimes said by members of the Labor Party, I think that ordinary wage and salary earners in Australia have exercised a lot of wage restraint. What I am very pleased about is that they are now reaping the rich reward of that wage restraint. They are reaping the reward of lower interest rates, lower levels of inflationMr Crean-Max got his reward.",75
144,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I repeat for the member for Hotham and the member for Canberra that what they are now getting is the reward for that restraint. I think that we have seen in the reductions in interest rates a perfect validation of the argument advanced by the Treasurer a couple of weeks ago-that, if you have wage restraint, and if you have a moderation in wage claims and get lower inflation, there is in tum less need to have high wage claims. There is the double bonus of getting a cut in interest rates. You could not get a better bonus than $145 a month off your mortgage bill. That is hard to beat in anybody's language. They are the most miserable bunch of Labor politicians I have seen in years. They are absolutely mortified today. They go around saying, 'Yes, it is very good that the interest rates have come down.' But in reality they are saying, 'Oh, isn't it terrible! Doesn't it make our task a bit harder?' I want to say to the working men and women of Australia that you have exercised a great deal of wage restraint. You have made a contribution. I recognise that. The government recognises that. As a consequence, you have now reaped a reward, and that reward is lower inflation, lower interest rates and $145 a month off your mortgage bill, and the only people who are unhappy about it are the members of the Australian Labor Party. Defence Force: Recruitment",76
145,Mrs BAILEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Is the minister aware that the overall trend for defence recruiting continues to fall? Are you concerned that the ADF did not meet its recruiting target for last year? What is being done to address this problem?",76
146,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. I know of her concern about the personnel of the ADF. Yes, I am indeed concerned about the failure to meet the recruitment targets. Indeed, we have met only 92 per cent of the targets that were set. I am sorry to say that navy is the worse in relation to this. There are several problems that lead to targets for recruitment not being met. One of the first is that separation rates remain far too high, which in tum leads to the establishment of higher enlistment rates. There is also the fact that we need to recruit technical and professional personnel at higher standards of recruitment because of the tasks that are now required to be undertaken. Mr Gareth Evans interjecting",76
147,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not need a test, but you do. It is lovely to see you in this place now, former Senator Evans, and it is lovely to see the eyes spin once again. And you can keep your kisses for others. Mr Costello-Oh, I thought they were for me, Gareth!",76
148,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There may be those who would welcome kisses from Gareth Evans, but I am not one of them. I go back to the question I was asked, which is an important one, and it relates to meeting the recruitment targets for the ADF in order that we may keep a self-reliant defence force. One of the other problems is that inquiry rates are down. Part of this problem is due entirely to the former government, in particular, the Price report. One of the difficulties in recruiting cadets for ADFA is the fact that the Price report said that undergraduates should be excluded from ADFA. We have entirely rejected that report and, of course, undergraduates will continue to be taken into ADFA. There is a further problem: the target population from whom we recruit, that is, 17to 24-year-olds, is in fact smaller than it was. Indeed, more of them are going on to higher education and, therefore, fewer of them are available for recruitment. They are some of the problems. So what are some of the remedies? The first thing is that we are putting a high priority on effective marketing, advertising and an increased public relations program. I might add that one of the first things we will be doing there is to counter what the previous government did, and that was to say that a career in the ADF is merely an introduction to what may be your final career. We say it is important to bring yourself into the Australian Defence Force as someone who is committed to a long-term career. We are further putting together packages which are in accordance with six initiatives, and they are software packages for ADF employment opportunities in secondary schools, new advisory kits for secondary schools, improving access to work experience in the ADF, increased focus on cadet units, the placement of recruiting information on the Internet and sponsorship of national youth sport championships. I think it is important to conclude with the words of Michael O'Connor from the Australian Defence Association. He said: Morale in the services was downthat is, during the previous governmentbut there is a new sense now that the new government is looking in the right direction in ing and restructuring. Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs",76
149,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Yesterday you agreed to check on allegations that another of your ministers had breached the code of conduct. Have you done that? What can you tell us? While you are at it, will you also check a further breach involving the same minister, who is a director of and controls a company involved in diesel fuel, has responsibility for the Diesel Fuel Tax Act and has taken decisions and been involved in consultations on amendments to that act?",77
150,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the member wants to amplify that last part, I will check. If you want to amplify it, please do. I am very happy to check. You asked me yesterday about the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Let me say this: he does not have ministerial responsibility for petrol pricing. The meeting that you referred to he attended as a representative of the Minister for Science and Technology. I am informed that the issue you referred to was never actually discussed at the meeting of consumer affairs ministers on 27 September. Mr Crean-Did he inform you of that?",77
151,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am informed that it was, I repeatMr Crean-By him? '""' ..",77
152,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. We have checked a little further than that. It was never actually discussed. Having not been at the meeting myself, I do not pretend to know every nuance of it, but I understand the resolution was passed without debate. So the minister in question never actually put a point of view in the discussion. In any event, he was there in an entirely representative capacity. So that is that one. If you have another one, please give it to me. I just say to the honourable member for Hotham that you are really out of steam on this one, chum. You are absolutely wasting your time. I think it is a matter of positive note that I have on the front-bench of my modernisgovernment a large number of people who understand how the business community of this country works. You seem to think it is a mark of shame. I regard it as a badge of honour. Migration Regulations",77
153,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs aware of opposition moves to disallow regulations for an increase in English language education charges for economic migrants? Could the minister inform the House of what this will do to the $10 billion Beazley bankcard bill?,77
154,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question is hypothetical and is therefore out of order.",77
155,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will have to hear the question again.,77
156,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs aware of opposition moves to disallow regulations for an increase in English language education charges for economic migrants? Could the minister inform the House of what this will do to the $10 billion Beazley bankcard bill.,78
157,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is in order.,78
158,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can inform the House that amongst the proposals the opposition has put forward in the Senate to disallow migration regulations is one to disallow proposals for English language education charges. In relation to those matters that are the subject of disallowance, the potential loss to the government is of the order of $25 million. Obviously, if it is not an addition to the overall deficit, the opposition would be arguing that some other areas of expenditure in my portfolio ought to be reduced. I do not know what they are suggesting if that is the case. I could imagine that one of the savings they might want to see made would be the extent to which my department is able to service those migrants who want to come to Australia. They may be suggesting that posts be closed. They may be suggesting that we should reduce some of the funding for settlement services. Is that what they are suggesting? You have to be prepared to make choices in these matters. Let us understand what the nature of the choice is that the opposition has in mind. What they are seeking to do now is to disallow charges for economic migrants and their dependants. They are saying that, in relation to the proposal for full cost recovery of teaching English to new arrivals who come through the business migration program, millionaires coming through the migration program should have their English language tuition subsidised by taxpayers. That is what they are suggesting. If you are not, you would want to reassess what you are doing in relation to this particular matter. Member for Capricornia",78
159,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development and also relates to the question of aviation safety regulation. Can the minister confirm that in the latter part of 1995 the member for Capricornia was found by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to have performed illegal maintenance on his aeroplane? Can he confirm that the regional CAS A office recommended that the matter be referred to the DPP for prosecution? Can he confirm that, contrary to the normal internal procedure in CASA, a decision to not prosecute the member for Capricornia was taken by the Deputy Director of CASA, Mr John Pike, after the March 1996 federal election? Can the minister confirm that this decision was upheld in the face of further protests from the CASA regional office, which pointed out that another pilot had been prosecuted recently for very similar offences? Can the minister advise whether any of these actions were taken with his knowledge, authorisation or instruction?",78
160,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am unaware of any of the details in relation to the question asked by the honourable member for Melbourne. I will seek to find out the accuracy of those propositions put in the question and will report to the honourable member for Melbourne, who has asked the question, at the earliest opportunity.",78
161,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I wish to ask a supplementary question, Mr Speaker. Mr CosteIlo--He said he can't answer it.",78
162,Mr T ANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That does not preclude a supplementary question. The supplementary question is: will the minister undertake to report back to the House today?,78
163,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think the essence of the minister's response has already indicated that he will report back to you and the House at the appropriate time. Literacy,78
164,Mr DONDAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. The minister recently announced the government's initiatives to raise literacy standards for all young Australians. Can the minister advise what the likely additional funding levels are for both government and non-government schools between 1997 and the year 2000, in particular, those schools in the Northern Territory?",78
165,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for the Northern Territory very much for his question. I was very pleased to accompany the member recently on a visit to Gillen Primary School, which was one of the schools participating in the first national English literacy survey for 16 years. A number of the students in that school were Aboriginal students, forming part of the sub-sample of indigenous students in relation to which we will be able to devise some very important policy initiatives. The government has introduced legislation, which is currently before the Senate, that provides some $14.7 billion for schools over the next four years. Included in this is some $635 million for literacy programs, approximately $460 million of which will be going to government schools and $160 million of which will be going to non-government schools. I am also pleased to inform the member for the Northern Territory that, so far as his own constituency is concerned, government schools in the Northern Territory will be receiving some $10 million over the period that he mentioned and non-government schools will be receiving some $2 million. His continued interest in this matter will, sure, contribute to effective outcomes from the expenditure of this money.",79
166,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Theft of Computer Equipment",79
167,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, members of the House are aware of the recent theft of computer hardware from one of the rooms in Parliament House. Is there an official inquiry being conducted and are charges likely to be brought? What is the risk that equipment in members' offices could be tampered with or stolen and valuable information lost?",79
168,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Mitchell for his inquiry. There has been a theft of very valuable Internet equipment from the parliament, as I understand it, last weekend. It looks very much like an 'inside job', in the sense that the theft was highly discriminatory. Very valuable components were taken and lesser valuable equipment was left very much within the reach of the thief. A formal inquiry is under way. We have strengthened the security of the department and at this moment we do not think that there is any prospect that there will be likely incursions into your personal computing resources. However, let this be a very general warning to members at large. This is a very serious offence. The investigation is not completed and it is a mater that should cause us a great deal of concern. Question Time ,,/ .  questions to you relating to question time yesterday. After the response of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training in answering a question, the Prime Minister rose in his place and asked that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. However, a further question was allowed by the member for Capri cornia. Can you look at the videotape of proceedings of question time and determine whether page 6311 of Hansard accurately reflects what I am actually occurred in question time. My second question relates to page 6305 of Hansard and the question asked by the honourable member for Hinkler regarding pensioner entitlements. According to House of Representatives Practice, page 524 of Browning, questions should not be asked without notice reflecting questions on the Notice Paper. I draw your attention to questions No. 905 to the Treasurer, No. 907 to the Minister for Social Security and No. 908 to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Whilst I appreciate that this was not brought to your attention at the time, would you consider writing to the ministers in view of t!te breach of standing orders and requesting an early response to those questions on notice?",79
169,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I thank the honourable member for Chifley for his questions. I will look at the video and examine standing orders and report back to either the House or you or both. Questions on Notice,79
170,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I refer to four questions understanding order 150. They are 473, 577, 578 and 593-each of them to the Treasurer, whose productivity seems to be waning. Could you find out the reasons for the delay in answering them and report back to the House.",80
171,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I will endeavour to remind the Treasurer of his obligations standing orders and take no further action. NA,80
172,Mr MCMULLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Canberra) (3.21 p.m.)I wish to make a personal explanation.,80
173,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the member claim 1995-96. to have been misrepresented?,80
174,Mr MCMULLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do.,80
175,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,80
176,Mr MCMULLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The Minister for Family Law Council-Report,Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), in his answer today, misrepresented me in four ways. the Firstly, he implied that the statement was 1996. made behind closed doors in some way that Involving is designed to be secret, whereas, in fact, it August 1996. was a public meeting. More than 100 people attended. It was tape recorded and the tranSnowy script was released and one of on the panel was the foreign affairs correspondent for the Canberra Times. Secondly, when I suggested that those people, including me, who had previously advocated 0.7 per cent GDP and the aDA to GDP ratio had wasted our time, he implied into: some way that I had therefore not been genuine in my advocacy of that cause. I am simply advising those people that I felt that they and I had been pursuing a goal that was no longer capable of being achieved realistibefore cally in Australia. That was the point I was making. Thirdly, he implied that I had advocated dramatic changes in tax and revenue. say to an interest group-perhaps they did not wish to receive the message-that you cannot advocate increased expenditure in one area without addressing the comprehensive issues of the rates of expenditure and tax in the community as a whole. That is a necessary matter to pursue. Fourthly, in trying to give the sense of my speech he failed to refer to the core point, which is that the 1996 budget was the worse budget for aid in Australian history. NA",80

178,Mr REITH,THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,"by leave-I move: That: (I) the resolution of the House of 17 October 1996 concerning the proposed address by the President of the United States of America on Wednesday, 20 November 1996 be amended by omitting paragraph (3)(b) and substituting the following paragraph: ""(b) the only proceedings shall be remarks of welcome to the President of the United States of America by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition followed by an address by the President of the United States of America, after which the Speaker shall forthwith adjourn the House and declare the meeting concluded; and""; (2) That a message be sent to the Senate acquainting it of this resolution and requesting that it concur and take action accordingly. I do not propose to speak to the motion other than to make the point that there have been discussions between the government and the opposition. It was felt that it was appropriate that, upon the entry of President Clinton to this chamber to address the chamber, it would be an appropriate opportunity for the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to make a few remarks of introduction and welcome. The general format for the afternoon of 20 November is that there will be a lunch approximately between the hours of I p.m. and 3 p.m. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition will welcome the President in this chamber at approximately 4 p.m. Consequent upon that introduction and welcoming remarks, there will be an address by the President to the joint meeting. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Public Education",80
179,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The adverse impact on public education of the Federal Government's funding decisions. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places p.m.)-I am actually developing a kind of admiration for the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp). You really have to be astounded by the sheer audacity of his misrepresentations where funding decisions are concerned. Last Friday, the minister put out a press release claiming that, as a result of his government's decisions, funding for schools in total for the four years of the forward estimates will go up $1.5 billion. Apparently something pretty significant happened over the weekend, because by last night the increase for government schools alone had gone up to $2.3 billion. There has been increase of $800 million in four days. By jeez, if things keep going at this rate, before long funding for education will consume half the gross domestic product-that is, if we are to take these sorts of propositions seriousfY,· which of course we do not. The reality is that it is simply preposterous and absurd for this minister to lump together incremental payments through grants to the states that are the result of standing arrangements to index for enrolment changes, price movements and other factors. These are standard arrangements which are in place and which produce the overwhelming bulk of the increases he has been talking about. All he has done to produce this $2.3 billion figure is take the total amount going to the states either through direct payments or through financial assistance grants, take every nominal increase over the past four years, add it all together, quadruple count the whole thing and then claim that it is the result of his benign carriage of the portfolio and the government's concern about education. This is ridiculous. The analogy would be if I, when I was Minister for Social Security, had taken all the increases in pensions over the next four years which will flow through as a result of normal indexation arrangements and had tried to present them as some sort of massive discretionary increase in funding that I was making available for age pensioners to improve their circumstances in real terms. It is just nonsense-and he knows full well that it is nonsense. He really ought not undermine the quality of public debate on education issues by going around making those claims. I have to say that there are some people in the media-for example, one of the writers for the Melbourne Age-who actually bought the story hook, line and sinker. But, fortunately, most members of the media are sufficiently sophisticated to see through that. The minister has made a whole range of claims. He seems to be relying on a lot of material which is contained in a submission that his department made to the Senate Employment, Education and Training Committee, which was presented last Friday. On that day, the minister issued his press release claiming a $1.5 billion increase. He has gone on to say, amongst other things, that when you put it all together, Commonwealth per capita assistance for government school students is going up 17.9 per cent and the per capita increase for non-government school students is going up 14.9 per cent. That sounds very attractive on the face of it, but what is the reality underlying that? There are four major things wrong with this piece of analysis that the minister has presented. Obviously, firstly, we are not talking about real increases. The fact is, as I said, these adjustments are indexed to the schools cost index and the figures represent a nominal, not real, increase. Secondly, if you look at the table from the department's submission, there is a little footnote on calculating the amount going through to the states via financial assistance grants, which says: Assumed state fiscal contributions, 1996 Premiers Conference do not affect FAGs funding for schools. How on earth you can attribute, on the one hand, 24 per cent of financial assistance grants to the states to schools and then say that if you lop that in effectively by $1.5 billion over three years it has no bearing on the capacity of states to fund their schools? It is just absolutely ludicrous.  literacy comprehension problem.  is just a ridiculous proposition and the states themselves have repudiated this in no uncertain terms, both conservative and Labor states. If I could quote a Queensland Treasury official who gave evidence to the Senate committee last Friday, Mr W. Ivessa, Assistant Under Secretary, Treasury Department, Queensland, says: We are under pressure from the fact that Commonwealth general purpose funding to Queensland and other states has been reduced in real terms as a result of that Premiers Conference. So those compounding impacts, plus the potential impact of this enrolment benchmark adjustmentthat is the reduction in funding for government schools which was announced as part of the budgetwill have a substantial impact and will force government to look at the level of service provision in education and other areas. The fact is that these decisions must constrain the capacity of states to do as much as they might otherwise have done in the education area. It is very good if states in a particular year raise their total education expenditures despite these cuts by the Commonwealth, but the fact is that their capacity to do more is obviously constrained by the cuts in effective funding that this government has imposed through this FAGs reduction. Apart from the FAGs reduction, there are four points I want to make on these claims about the rate of growth of funding for government and non-government school pupils. Firstly, it is not a real increase. Secondly, no account has been taken of the effect of the FAGs cut. Thirdly, I come to this so called enrolment benchmark adjustment. This is the reduction in recurrent funding for government schools which is said to be a consequence of the windfall saving to the states arising from the movement of each child from the government to the non-government sector. There is no argument that there is a certain amount of savings flowing from that. That point is not in dispute. What is in dispute is the amount of that saving and its relationship to the amount that has been taken off the states through the enrolment benchmark adjustment. The New South Wales government, for one, have argued cogently that the way this amount has been calculated is fundamentally flawed. They make the point-and it is an unarguable point-that you cannot simply equate the average cost difference to the states of a child in a government and a non-government school with the marginal saving arising from enrolment drift from one to the other. Government school systems have to sustain a very substantial amount of overheads, both at the system level and at the individual school level. That point has been made and the New South Wales officials have quantified their argument and have set out the savings which are, in practice, realisable and which, they argue-and their case has not been refutedare substantially less than is being presumed by the Commonwealth. The New South Wales government have argued that point in detail. Their position was explicitly supported by Queensland Treasury officials at the hearings on Friday. Other states such as Western Australia and a number of the others have stated quite clearly that they do not accept the Commonwealth's position on this. That is the third point-the spurious windfall saving that is being claimed. There is some saving, but it is not accurately reflected in the amount being taken off the states by the enrolment benchmarkDr Kemp-What is the saving?",81
180,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The minister might save his voice for a little later.  South Wales officials argue that they are out of pocket to the tune of $20 to $30 million as a result of this. That is the net upshot of the whole thing. The final point I make is that, even allowing for all of these things-we are talking about the capacity of states to support government and non-government schools-I think it is very important to look at what the states, in practice, have been doing. If you look at what happened over the years 1988-89 to 1993-94, a very interesting position emerges and one which I think supports the concerns about the impact of this government's decisions on the relative funding circumstances of government schools compared with non-government schools. I have asked the Parliamentary Library to analyse the relevant statistical documents relating to the funding of schools over this particular period and the picture that emerges is pretty disturbing, I would have to say, when you look at what has been going on over a period of years. I seek leave to incorporate a table which is based on the work by researchers in the Parliamentary Library. Leave not granted.  ness! The man who is concerned about the cult of secrecy does not want to incorporate this table! You've got a whole department of state to assist you in refuting any claims contained in this table. Why don't you want it incorporated in the Hansard? These figures are not absolutely right-I have a note from the researcher-because some of the adjustments are made not in terms of the schools cost index but he used the gross non-farm product price deflator which makes a slight difference, but the broad picture will no doubt be accurate. He makes the pQitV that from 1988-89 to 1993-94, total state spending per student in government schools has gone up one per cent a year on average. If you tum to the Commonwealth, the average annual increase in recurrent funding for students is 7.9 per cent. Overall for government schools as a whole, when you combine both Commonwealth and states, you are looking at 1.8 per cent as the average increase in funding per student each year. If you tum to non-government schools, by contrast, you find that Commonwealth funding per student on average over this period has gone up 4.3 per cent but state outlays have gone up 7.4 per cent. So you have 7.4 per cent average annual increase in recurrent grants by the states for students in nongovernment schools contrasting with one per cent for government schools. This is the pattern we are seeing. As I pointed out, the states capacity to fund increases is being reduced as a result of the cuts from the Premiers Conference but, even apart from that, in practice the states have tended to fund a growth rate in funding for non-government schools which exceeds that for government school students by quite a substantial margin. The minister at various times has tried to argue that the incentive for cost shifting will be reduced as a result of his measures and that therefore, if anything, the actions that this government is taking might retard the flow from the government to the non-government sector. That, of course, is belied by the basis on which his own budgetary calculations are done. His budget calculations assume that, as a result of his budget decisions, there will be a further shift to the non-government sector over and above that which would have otherwise occurred. That is the only way that the policy to abolish the new schools program can produce a cost of $150 million. That cost occurs if the average cost to the Commonwealth of a student in a non-government sector is greater than in the government sector. It is no good for him to argue or to seek to imply that, because of changed cost-shifting incentives, the flow from the government to the non-government system is in some way going to be stemmed. That is explicitly belied by the very basis on which the calculations and costings of his budget measures have been done. Returning to the overall picture, if you look at what the impact of this government's decisions has been, the reality is, as I pointed out in question time, that his own department estimates the impact in outturn terms of his budget decisions on the schools program over the next four years of the forward estimates is a total of $128 million extra. The impact of a $1.5 billion cut in FAGs is to diminish the capacity of the states to support government school students by close to $400 million. If you put those two elements together, the undeniable result is that the capacity of state governments to support their government school students has been diminished unambiguously and significantly as a result of the totality of decisions taken thus far by this government. That is the undeniable reality. It is no good the minister talking about what the states do. If the states had more financial capacity you would not be seeing the sorts of things that you are seeing in Victoria-continuing school closures and merges. The capacity of states to support government schools has been clearly diminished as a result of what this government has done. The minister tries to say that the abolition of new schools policy is all about ideology. Just about everybody-whether in the government or the non-government sector, whether they be Catholic or Anglican-with responsibility for operating major school systems acknowledges the importance of some element of planned educational provision. The minister would have us accept that he is transferring that responsibility to the states. It is manifestly obvious that the states do not have a framework in place that can substitute for the role played by the new schools policy. The registration requirements vary enormously from state to state. The DEETYA officials who gave evidence to Senate estimates after the budget made it clear that those requirements varied from the almost non-existent to requirements which at least have some degree of substance to them. To say that that can serve from the beginning of next year as the basis of the provision of planned education is absurd. (Time expired) Mr Robert Brown- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order at this stage so that I don't take any of the minister's time. My point of order is that it is the normal courtesy between government and opposition that if any tabular or graphical information is shown to either the minister at the table in the case of opposition members or to the shadow minister in the case of government ministers, approval or permission is granted for leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. It is then referred to those people who determine whether or not it is appropriate for inclusion in Hansard, in accordance with the guidelines. If it then satisfies all of those requirements, it is included. Could I suggest that the minister take the opportunity to have a look at the information. If he is satisfied that it is appropriate-and, in all normal circumstances, it is-he may then give approval for it to be incorporated in Hansard, if it satisfies the guidelines.",83
181,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I thank the honourable member for Charlton for his point of order. I must say that it is my very clear memory and understanding that the member for Sydney asked for permission to table it, not to incorporate it in Hansard. Mr Robert Brown-It was for incorporation in Hansard.",84
182,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I thank the honourable member. I certainly accept what he says. Mrs Sullivan- Mr Deputy Speaker, very briefly on the point of order: as a matter of fact, I acknowledge that the member for Charlton would have been totally wellintentioned in what he said, but I put on record that there were cases when membersnow in government, then in opposition-made the same request. The then government ministers refused even after they had been shown the tables simply because they had not been shown them in advance. The member shakes his head. I sat in the chair and saw it happen.",84
183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I also thank the honourable member for Moncrieff. Like the member for Moncrieff, I have sat in this chair on many occasions over many years. It is certainly my understanding that the request to have statements, tables or whatever incorporated in Hansard is not automatically agreed to. It is at the discretion of the minister at table. In this circumstance, the member for Sydney made a request to the minister and the minister denied the request. He was in order in doing so.",85
184,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Goldstein-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation) (3.44 p.m.)-This is a debate which really shows how the case that has been put by the Labor Party of constant disinformation and fear talk directed at parents in government schools is collapsing before our very eyes. When confronted by the true facts that the government has presented, there is nothing of substance which the Labor Party can put down to substantiate its claim that government schools will be worse off as a result of the funding decisions taken by the government in the budget. I regret very much the campaign of dis information that has been waged by the opposition, because it can only confuse parents, can only confuse people in the government school system and can only be to the detriment of those people wishing to make decisions about the future schooling of their children. I want to reassure parents today that the result of the government's budget decisions is that government schools will be better funded as a result of the budget and that there will be significant increases over the next four years in per capita funding on our best estimates for students in government schools. We estimate that Commonwealth funding for government schools, taking into account both the specific purpose grants to the states and the financial assistance grants to the states, will increase by some 17 per cent over the next four years. That contrasts with the increase for non-government students of 14 per cent. That funding includes the whole range of factors which will influence funding over the next four years. These figures are in outturn prices. They include a supplementation and, therefore, provide aJ-rly realistic picture of the funding position for government schools through Commonwealth funding. The shadow minister has constantly made the point since the budget that the reductions the to the financial assistance grants agreed to at the Premiers Conference will impact very severely on government school funding. There is absolutely no evidence to support this. It is a purely hypothetical argument that is being put forward here. When we look at the actual state budgets that have been brought down, it appears that the states have decided to absorb these reductions in other areas because the overall funding for schools through the state budgets has increased by some 6.37 per cent. That is the factual matter: funding for government schools has increased in state budgets. The Labor Party relies on the complaints that the states have made in submissions to the Senate against some of the budget decisions. The budget decision they are objecting to is the decision in relation to the enrolment benchmark adjustment, which will adjust Commonwealth funding to the states according to the flow of students between the government and non-government school sectors. We take the not very surprising attitude that we should fund students where they are. If students are in the non-government sector, we fund them there. If students are in the government sector, we fund them there. If the respective shares of the total number of students of those two sectors alters, that inevitably affects the funding that is provided. The movement of a student from the government sector to the non-government sector produces a saving of some $3,400 on average. Over the last 10 years or so, the states have obtained a windfall gain of something like $3 billion as a result of the movements which took place under the previous government's policies. Let us have none of this nonsense that these purported defenders of government schools have actually defended government schools in any effective way because, during the whole period of the new schools policy, the flow of students from government to non-government schools sped up. One of the reasons it sped up may well be a result of the very significant financial incentive that states had to encourage this flow. We propose to half that incentive. The Labor Party in its usual confused way wants to amend our legislation in the Senate to double that incentive for the states to encourage the movement of students from government to non-government schools. It is simply unable to think straight in this matter. It is at all surprising that the state governments have taken the attitude that they would prefer to retain the whole savings from this cost shifting exercise rather than half of the savings. It is no wonder at all that state treasuries are complaining to the Senate that they might be better off if the Commonwealth had not taken a decision to allocate this saving between the Commonwealth and the states instead of allowing the entire saving to accrue to the states. It is also worth maldng the point that this shift in enrolments has the effect of increasing the funds available for government school students per student. New South Wales has put in a particular complaint about this because its system is less flexible than those which exist in the other states. unable to recover the savings that other states have been able to recover. That is a matter for New, South Wales to look at very closely. It has admitted in its submission that there is a saving attached to this. So we have a series of decisions which will greatly improve the funding available for government schools over the next four years with a specific emphasis on improving the resources available for literacy and for vocational education and training. The poor shadow minister for education is complaining that we seem to use different figures on different occasions. He finds this confusing. If he just read the budget papers carefully, he would have no difficulty in following us through these papers. The $1.5 billion additional extra spending relates to the total spending on schools through the specific purpose grants program for schools. The $2.3 billion additional spending relates to the combined impact of the specific purpose grants program and the financial assistance grants, which have been allocated on the basis of a very standard distribution that has been identified by the Grants Commission over the last few years of some 24 per cent to education through those grants. The shadow minister got up today and said, 'Isn't the net effect of all these decisions $128 million?' That is not the case. I thought he was referring to the enrolment benchmark not adjustment, which is $128 million, but it turns out that he is confusing that with a figure related to a limited series of budget initiatives. ",85
185,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"it is not the entire schools program at all. It is a series of budget initiatives, the total effect of which, netting off the enrolment benchmark adjustment, is $128 million. That is the total impact of these measures. Some of these measures are negative and some are positive. It is quite clear that the shadow minister for education had absolutely no idea what figure he was referring to when he stated that figure in his question to me in the House. I hope that clarification of this figure It tells us it is it meant.",86
186,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a figure which seems to be based on both negative and positive figures and relates to a specific series of budget measures. It has nothing to do with the net impact of the government's total budget decisions as they affect schools. I would like to make some comments in this debate in a broader context about the future of government schools and their importance in Australian education-because this government is the true defender of government schools. It is the true defender of government schools because, unlike the previous government, not only has it put aside the funds that will improve the position of every student in government schools over the next four years but it has put in place a comprehensive strategy to rebuild the faith of Australian parents in government schools. We have no desire to see one sector or another sector grow. Our concern is that all Australian children have access to high quality schools. Parent choice is a particular concern of ours because the ability of parents to choose their school is one of the most powerful incentives within the school arrangements in this country for the improvement of quality and the monitoring of performance of schools. It is just as powerful an incentive and just as powerful a monitoring device within the government school sector between government schools as it is between government and non-government schools, and within the nongovernment school sector. The sad thing is that the attitude taken to government schools by the Labor Party over the previous 13 years was one which essentially was an ideological position which said that whether schools are performing or not we are going to try to stop parents determining that fact and then reduce their capacity to choose the best school for their child. The Labor Party put in place decisions which impacted particularly severely on low income families, on the battling families, because under their new schools policy they said that if a new low fee school was established to cater for low income families, they would not fund that school according to its real needs; they would fund that school only up to category six which, the experts would know, is only a moderate government funding category. They denied that school the level of funding to which it would normally have been entitled, given its level of resources and the children who went to it. The shadow minister at the table has no answer to that because he knows it is true. So the decision impacted",86
187,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He says they now favour dropping it but they maintained it for 10 years while they were in government and did not favour dropping it at the election. It is just that they are not prepared to stand up now and defend their totally inequitable policy in the public arena when we have challenged it and abolished it. That policy impacted very harshly on the battling families of this country. It is no wonder that those families turned against the Labor Party and have come to see the coalition as the party which effectively represents their interests in education, as in other areas of policy. I suppose that if we look at what these great defenders of government schools have achieved d-- the last 13 years crease.",87
188,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We hear from the other side there was a 58 per cent funding increase. These are the sorts of delusions with which they salve their consciences. After 13 years of Labor, 30 per cent of students in year 9 do not have adequate literacy skills, youth unemployment is at 27 per cent and 30 per cent of students are dropping out of school before year 12 because they do not have a relevant curriculum. Those opposite put in a policy in 1985 to restrict parents choosing their child's school and the outflow from government schools to non-government schools increased. They kept in place an incentive of $3,400 on average for states to cost shift by moving students into non-government schools. Every element of their policy undermined the confidence of the community in government schools. Who did they consult on their education policy? They consulted the Australian Education Union, their union mates. Did they consult the school principals? Australian primary school principals have welcomed with open arms the change in policy and change in emphasis because they want literacy addressed. Secondary school principals have welcomed with open arms the changes in policy because they want the whole problem of a relevant curriculum for those students, that 65 per cent of students-(Time expired)",87
189,Mr SA WFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What a fraud the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) is! The Commonwealth needs to have a national perspective in schools, yet the coalition has always run away from its responsibility. I ask the minister: what about the headland speech in June last year when your now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said: We will revert to the practice of former coalition governments of winding back section 96 for specific grants to the states. What about your now Treasurer (Mr Costello)? He said that federal involvement in school education results in waste and duplication. Tell the truth, Minister: you just simply want to walk away from education-and the community out there is beginning to know it. On 23 October in my electorate of Port Adelaide, the Mayor of Hindmarsh Woodville called together a public meeting-and this is quite unusual in my electorate-to oppose the South Australian government's intention to close the Findon Primary School. But the mayor had much more on his mind than just that. Currently, the Findon Primary School has about 175 students, is sited on five hectares and, with the continued trend of near city living, is more than a viable concern for the near future. However, the mayor, John Dyer, instinctively knew the closure of Findon could be the beginning of a campaign that would put existing government and nongovernment schools in his municipality at risk. His instincts are correct and his leadership is outstanding. At this public meeting, attended by well over 200 people in the Woodville Town Hall, the mayor, John Dyer, invited Rob Lucas, South Australian Minister of Education-he likes you, and we will get back to him in a minute-Carolyn Pickles, South Australian shadow minister for education, Mick Atkinson, the local MP, parent representatives and me to address the community concerns. Surprise, surprise, Minister! The state minister failed to stay. He left the meeting early, even before having giving us the courtesy of listening to the parent representatives, let alone the state and federal MPs. The reasons for his doing this were obvious-and I will come to them later. The state minister wanted in no way to be associated with this minister or this government and what they are doing to schools and have them compared with what the federal Labor government did in the past. He knows that his state government is getting into quicksand-and he mentioned this a little later which, again, I will come back to. Those things with which he did not want to be associated are the abolition of the new schools policy; the enrolment benchmark adjustment; the $1.5 billion cut in untied grants; and the very real, and irresponsible, risk that you are going to bring up again the very poisonous debate of state aid. That is your contribution, isn't it, Minister. You just stonewall. You think that by repeatedly stonewalling, untruths will become a reality for you. Well, you are in for a few shocks. Before focusing on those three matters, it is illuminating to briefly examine the record of the former Labor government and contrast that with what this government is doing, which amounts to the creation of a two-tiered system of education. Under Labor direct funding to schools, both government and nongovernment, increased by nearly 58 per cent in real terms. That growth, real growth, would have continued under Labor with commitments of an extra $395 million for schools, including $120 million on new capital funding for government schools. By contrast, this government went to the last election with a slogan for all of us which, as far as education went, essentially said, 'Steady as she goes, she'll be right.' You tell that story to universities and university students now; they do not have the same view. You tell that story to TAPEs in Australia, and you will get a very different response. You tell that story to teachers and parents in government schools, and you will get a very different response. Mr Deputy Speaker, government schools are in pretty rough and murky water at the moment",88
190,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I thank the member for Port Adelaide for referring his remarks through the chair. Please continue.,88
191,Mr SA WFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Government schools are in pretty rough and murky water as they begin to slowly realise that this government intends to dump on them. What about the claims from this government as explained by the minister? In your propaganda, you say that you have increased funding by five per cent. That is nothing but a pea and thimble trick and relies on what the government hopes is just people's ignorance of the forward estimate arrangements for expenditure and the automatic mechanisms for the adjustments of changes in prices, enrolments, numbers, and so on. Minister, you even continued to use that spurious exposition on Lateline last night. That percentage is more.",89
192,Mr SA WFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As the shadow minister has pointed out: $1.5 billion on Friday, $2.3 billion last night-what is it going to be today, Minister; what about next week? Are we just going to continue to keep going? The arguments put up by the government in support of the abolition of the new schools policy are very illuminating. If it is to create a two-tiered system of education, it is no more than malicious intent. If it is to create so-called choice, then it amounts to just simply blatant incompetence. Labor's new schools policy allowed for the orderly development of non-government schools, without the wastage of resources and duplication. Do you remember your Treasurer saying that last year? In areas of growth, funding was approved. In areas of non-growth or declining enrolments, of course funding was rejected. A review of this policy by Professor Ken MCKinnon used the term 'residualisation'. You used that term last night, didn't you, Minister? Well, I will tell you: the parents in my electorate know what residualisation means. It means 'disappear'. The people in Victoria, your home state, know what it means. It means 'disappear', you are not wanted. It means a government walking away from its responsibility in a free, democratic society to the democratic principle of universal access to a government school. All schools should be properly resourced. State governments, the principal source of funding for government schools, have not kept pace with the Commonwealth in recent years in financial support for schools. In regard to government schools in particular, the direct Commonwealth contribution amounts to only 12 per cent anyway. The Minister for Education in South Australia, Mr Lucas, in answer to a question yesterday from Carolyn Pickles, the shadow minister, said this about enrolment benchmark adjustment: We have indicated that the South Australian government does not support a completely free market for schools in South Attsfhlia-or in Australia for that matter. The notion of a laissezfaire environment for the establishment of new schools is not one that the South Australian government supports a position where the new schools policy is abolished and nothing replaces it. That is a bit of a wack in the solar plexus, Minister, from your Liberal colleague in South Australia. He goes on to comment on the consultative process-or lack of it. He continues: ... have expressed concern to the Senate committee about the lack of consultation prior to the announcement in the Commonwealth budget of the enrolment benchmark adjustment ... That says it all really, doesn't it, Minister, about the folly of this government's action. But what is probably more invidious for government schools, in addition to the abolition of the new schools policy, the enrolment benchmark adjustment, is that all of this operates in a scenario of the cuts to untied grants to the states made in June of $1.5 billion. That equates to about $300 million less for government schools in Australia. This government, which includes this minister, is walking away from its responsibilities to government schools. In doing so, the very likely event of encouraging again that very destructive debate-that poisonous state aid debate-we had in this country in the 1960s and 1970s is about to rise again. Cherrell Hirst-the member for Moncrieff knows her-the chancellor of the Queensland University of Technology said in the Courier Mail on 5 October that federal government changes could take higher education back 30 years. It appears that the government is intent on doing the same to schools. This minister should be very aware that universal access to local government schools is a highly valued principle of a free democratic society. The coalition seems to have great difficulty in accepting that access to a quality government school education is a fundamental right of every Australian child as well as being just a sensible economic investment. Under this government, a fair go for government schools is on the way out. Under this government, quality education for government schools is out. Under this government, universal access to government schools is out. In its place we will probably get the poisonous state aid debate. In its place we will get a diminished government school system and therefore a diminished democratic society. In its place we have a government totally unprepared for the necessary leadership in the future of education. I think it is quite true to say to this minister: you simply do not know what you are doing. Maybe you do not care, but I think this is untrue. Your stonewalling seems to prove this. You really do not know the consequences of your actions. The real consequences are a very real threat to schools, a threat to children and a threat to the things that we cherish in our democratic society. (Time expired)",89
193,Mrs SULLIVAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Moncrieft) (4.09 p.m.)It is almost a shame to puncture such resounding rhetoric as we have heard from the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) with a few facts. The member for Port Adelaide accuses the Howard government of raising the state aid bogey again. In fact, he mentioned the term three times and was the first person in this debate to mention it. It is a bogey that the member himself raises, and it is nonsense. Mr Sawford-You should have listened to Lateline last night.",90
194,Mrs SULLIVAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a funny thing-I did not listen to Lateline last night but I listened to the debate today. I listened to the opposition was saying and it was the opposition that raised the bogey of state aid. It is a strange thing that the opposition has to raise these bogies so that it can knock them down and claim the credit for it. I listened with some interest to question time and the questions from the member for  funding. I knew I was in this debate this afternoon and I thought maybe he was going to poke some hole in this, so I listened very carefully. I listened to what he said in his speech and I examined the table that he referred to. One of things in the table that he did not mention that the member for Port Adelaide ought to know about and that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) himself referred to, relates to per capita funding of students. I raise this because the member for Port Adelaide made the statement that there is not a real increase here, that the increased funds are because of things like inflation, numbers of students and so on. The fact is that table 3 from the document that the shadow minister quoted from shows that there will be a decline in the projected number of students enrolled in schools in the four years we are talking about-1997 to 2000. The numbers will decline from 2,211,173 this year to 2,205,194 next yearthe first of the four years in this funding proposal-to 2,187,649 in the year 2000. The per capita funding in government schools is going to therefore increase from $2,377 next year to $2,668 in the year 2000. That is a 17.9 per cent increase over four years.  increase. That is not real.",90
195,Mrs SULLIVAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It does not seem to matter what you say, the shadow minister babbles on with a new line, a new argument, a new rationalisation. What is the bottom line in this? We were overwhelmingly voted into government last March with a budget black hole of $8 billion. The government was acquainted with the true Treasury situation the day after it was elected and there was a quick announcement made that government spendwhat ing was going to have to be cut. We had to do something about the deficit, and we moved to do that. It was indicated that everybody would bear some pain in this. I think there are enough people in this country today who are aware that when governments have chronically overspent beyond what they should have, the cutting-back exercise involves some pain. However, in the area of education we have actually increased funding for schools. It is not just a matter of the shadow minister coming up with a new excuse for why he is not right every time it is pointed out that what he said is wrong. It is not a matter of him coming up with those excuses; it is a matter of him facing the fact that the Howard government has given a very high priority to school funding and to school programs.  much as others. I will give you that.",90
196,Mrs SULLIV AN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Now we are getting yet more babble from over there, another rationalisation for why he was not wrong when it has just been shown that he was wrong. The grants to the states and territories for school education through specific purpose payments are going to be not only maintained-certainly not cut-but increased by 18.3 per cent over the next four years. The total Commonwealth funding for schools, including specific purpose payments and financial assistance to states and territoriesthese are the figures from the table the shadow minister referred to-will rise $7.2 billion this year to $8.6 billion in the year 2000. That there. is an increase of 20 per cent. Between 1997 and the year 2000, total Commonwealth funding per government school student will increase by 17.9 per cent and for non-government students it will increase by 14.9 per cent. So the rate of increase is faster and higher for those in government schools than for those in nongovernment schools. By whatever yardstick one looks at the matter the member for Sydney has brought up- 'The adverse impact on public education of the federal government's funding decisions', to use his words-you just cannot find the substance in the facts. Time is very short for a second speaker on an MPI, but the member for Port Adelaide made reference to some schools and a situation in his electorate. I think my electorate is a very good example of what has been happening under the new schools program. I represent, and have represented for as long as I have been in the House of Representatives, an area which has a very high rate of population growth, with that growth occurring in two age groups-the retirees and the young families. Statistics for my part of the world shows that it has an average population well above the national norm in both those groups. just So it is not just a matter of my electorate having a lot of people who do not go to school. In fact, compared with the national average, I have more pressure on schools in my electorate than most mef\1t)ers of this House. There has been a number of government and non-government schools established in Moncrieff since the previous government's new schools policy was introduced. I have to say right up-front that I have excellent government schools in my electorate. They are outstanding. Not all of them are new; some of them are old. One had to be rebuilt it was so old. They are really outstanding. Despite that, there is a very high level of demand for education in independent schools. All but three of the oldest independent schools on the Gold Coast-which happen to be in my electorate-are new, and they have mushroomed because the demand has been They have not been funded at the same rate that the schools that have been there longer have been funded. That has led to a skewing and an unfair competition between schools. It has led to more difficulty for parents who happen to live in areas that have only developed in the last decade because they happen to be the schools to which they have access. There is no comparison, for example, with cities like Sydney, Adelaide or Melbourne, because my city is not yet big enough to have the sort of infrastructure of public transport that makes geographic location a choice between schools of no consequence. There is a very big difference indeed. In any event, whatever the member for Port Adelaide has to say about what is happening in his state, no new government school is funded by any Commonwealth governmentLiberal or Labor-unless that school has been approved by the state government. So, in the end, it is up to the states what they do and which new schools they approve. It is all up to them. They can set any rules they like. The federal government only comes in and subsidises in the cases of approved schools. We are not intruding on state governments' rights to do what they like in relation to schools. Neither do we approve of laissez faire. If a state government does not approve of laissez faire, and is not going to approve a school under laissez faire, then that school is not going to get anything out of us either. We have never supported laissez faire. What we have supported is equality and equity between parents and students according to their own free choice. Finally, from my experience of education in Australia-which goes back many years in both the government and the non-government sector-without a doubt a major pressure on governments to fund government schools, to keep up standards and to keep up resources has been competition with non-government schools. It has only happened since there has been real competition, and the real improvements have happened when there has been some support in fees. (Time expired)",91

204,Mr CAMPBELL,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"I was saying before question time that I support this government's bill on Hindmarsh Island. I think it is important that it puts beyond doubt the ability to go and construct the bridge at Hindmarsh Island. I must say that I have had some misgivings about the environmental impact of that bridge, and I did feel, at the beginning, that it might tum out to be a way whereby the South Australian government in fact subsidised private development of the land, which I would have found disagreeable. With respect to the performance surrounding this bogus women's business, I think it is important that this legislation proceeds and is strongly supported. It indicates the extraordinary lengths to which elements in our pseudoacademia, which affect our universities, particularly in the area of anthropology, are prepared to go in the promoting of mumbo jumbo. I think Professor Cheryl Saunders is an example of this, but it is endemic in the University of Western Australia, where Sandra Bowdler et aI, including, I might add, many Canadians who seem to fill positions over there, are foisting on the people some sort of latter day concept of the noble savage where they must, or feel compelled to, distort history to justify the position they make. The record of these institutions is appalling. If nothing else, this legislation enables lack of intellectual rigour to be highlighted. That is very important because, while it manifest in the area of Aboriginal anthropolmight ogy, it also affects other areas of university learning. If universities want the respect which they feel is due to them, it is about time we got a return to some academic rigour in these institutions. I did mention earlier that former Minister Tickner had no excuse. He knew exactly what he was doing with respect to this legislation: he was pandering to a constituency that has no bearing whatsoever on Aboriginal welfare. It is a constituency of pseudo academics, people associated very much with the Abowas riginal industry, of trendy, warm inner lefties which afflict both parties in this parliaand ment. It is not a matter of his simply getting it wrong. I suspect from the beginning he knew it was wrong but felt compelled to down this road. If you look at the use of the section 9 and section 10 declarations under the act, there have been some monstrous anomalies. In my own state of Western Australia, the brewery matter is a classic case. There was never substance to claims by Mr Bropho in respect of the brewery. I recall leading a march of Aboriginal people to that brewery site when we had far more Aboriginals than he had his support. His support came basically from everywhere else-I think we counted 20 is to be applauded. people who may have been Aboriginal out of the 120 both sides approximately had. The crocodile farm in Broome was another classic case. There was never a scintilla of evidence to warrant that decision on the section 9 or section 10 declarations. If you add to this the enormous anomalies under state legislation where freehold attacked, it is quite clear that we as a nation have to start taking this matter very seriously and look at these things in great detail. In conclusion, I just want to return to this women's business. I represent probably more Aboriginals than any other member in this parliament. I represent, undoubtedly, the most tribal of Aboriginal people where Aboriginal law is still very strong. I was told right at the start by senior Aboriginal law people in my that electorate that there was not a scintilla of truth in these claims. I said, 'How can you is possibly know? It's a long way away. It be different over there,' and they said, 'Yes, the law is different from place to place, but there are some things which are always constant.' They were adamant there was never a scintilla of evidence to support the enormous cost that was placed upon taxpayers by this abuse of process. I think the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) was appalIingly treated in this episode. I am pleased that hist5'I)' has vindicated the member for Barker bec-se I do not of like to see people treated as unjustly as he in this. I listened with intent to the glow member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) I can say this: the member for Melbourne Ports would have been among the first people to have taken the same steps as the member go for Barker did. For him to come into this House and talk about ethics and integrity in situations like that I think is laughable. I believe this bilI is useful. It does put it beyond doubt. It takes it out of the hands of fickle and capricious politicians and lawyers any who have been the main beneficiaries so far of alI the matters pertaining to this Aboriginal interest. Even in the land rights debate, there was no tangible benefit for Aboriginals; it has in been overwhelmingly a benefit for lawyers.

The member for Brisbane later repeated: That is absolutely right because I was there and I spoke to the people concerned. I was not at a school fete. At 2 p.m. on 14 September 1996, I was at my fourth function for that day, which was the 40-year celebration of the establishment of the Kedron Park State High School, to which I had received a written invitation and was part of the official party. The child-care centre to which the member for Brisbane refers had contacted my office during the week by telephone to see if I was available to attend a rally. My office was able to explain to the director, who is well known to the member for Brisbane, that I was heavily booked that day and that it would not be possible for me to attend at the time they had arranged. My office went to great lengths to explain that I was more than willing to meet with the personnel from the centre at any time mutually convenient to both parties.

220,Mr MILES,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) That the bill be now read a second time. This bill proposes amendments to overcome anomaly in the Corporations Law which came to light in a court decision last year. Part 5.3A of the Corporations Law, which commenced in June 1993, provides a regime for companies to enter a scheme known as voluntary administration. The scheme allows a company in financial difficulty to enter into deed of company arrangement with its creditors, which enables the company to continue trading for a period with a view to producing a better return for creditors than would be available if the company was wound up immediately. Using this method can ideally result in saving the business of the company and the jobs of employees. The mechanism may also serve to avoid costs and delays often associated with formal liquidations. The voluntary administration scheme is increasingly being used in substitution to other means of dealing with corporate insolvencies because of its streamlined procedures and minimal court involvement. In a significant proportion of cases, companies enter into deeds of company arrangement with their creditors in an effort to save the company or, at least, its business. However, there are cases where, after a period of trading under a deed of company arrangement, it becomes clear that the company cannot trade out of its difficulties. In such a case, the Corporations Law provides for an automatic transition to a liquidation. In June last year, His Honour Mr Justice Cohen of the New South Wales Supreme Court held in Re Crawford House Press Pty Ltd (1995) 13 ACLC 874; (1995) 17 ACSR 295 that where persons deal with a company under a deed of company arrangement-as opposed to dealing with the deed administrator-and that company moves into liquidation, those persons may not make a claim in the winding up for any outstanding liabilities of the company in relation to those dealings. His Honour stated that this was not a result that could have been intended by the legislature and therefore called for legislative amendment. Industry bodies, the legal and insolvency profession, and commentators have supported the call for amendment as a matter of priority. In October last year, the Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1995 was introduced by the previous government. The 1995 bill was designed to overcome the anomaly uncovered in the Crawford House decision. However, the 1995 bill failed to be passed before parliament rose prior to the March election and, accordingly, it has lapsed. At the time the 1995 bill was introduced, the coalition-then in opposition-had some reservations about the form of the bill. In particular, the coalition had concerns about whether debts incurred while a company is under a deed of company arrangement should not only be provable but also receive priority over other unsecured debts. This year the government consulted with key industry participants about the best means of overcoming the anomaly uncovered by the Crawford House decision. During the consultation process, the government was advised that a large number of insolvency practitioners have been acting on the assumption that the 1995 bill would become law. In those circumstances, thea government considers that, in the interests of certainty and stability, the most desirable course is to retain the bill in the form it was originally introduced last year. To modify the bill in order to give certain debts priority could potentially give rise to some very difficult situations if liquidators have conducted administrations relying on the form of the 1995 bill. The most important thing at this stage is to ensure the debts are provable so creditors are not left high and dry and to prevent the voluntary administration scheme being compromised. However, as the question of the priority which should be accorded to debts incurred by a company under a deed of company arrangement remains an important issue, the government will refer the question of priority for consideration by the Legal Committee of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, which is currently undertaking a wide-ranging review of the voluntary administration scheme. Both the Law Council of Australia and the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia have expressed their support for this course of action in light of the time that has passed since the lapsed 1995 bill. Content of the Bill This bill seeks to effect two substantive changes to the Corporations Law. The first change is intended to ensure that debts and claims arising while a company is under a deed of company arrangement are admissible to proof in a subsequent winding up. The second is intended to ensure the validity of acts of liquidators who admitted such debts and claims on the basis that they were provable, prior to commencement of the amendments in the bill. Financial Impact The bill is not expected to have any significant financial impact on government or business. The explanatory memorandum describes the potential impact on creditors. Ministerial Council for Corporations In accordance with the heads of agreement between the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation, I confirm that the Ministerial Corporations was consulted and gave approval to the provisions of the bill. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Melham) adjourned. NA Second Reading Debate resumed.",94
221,Mr MILES,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (4.39 p.m.)-I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill. I want to begin by referring to a book launch which occurred today here in Parliament House. The book goes over the history of this particular episode in Australia's history. The book that has been launched is very significant. The material which is contained in it will provide a lot of people with a tremendous amount of information and interest in this particular story. The name of this book is It would be nice if there was some women's business. I want to say to people who may be listening to this debate or who may actually read the Hansard that this is a crucial point in this whole debate. Lindy Warrell, an anthropologist, went to a meeting in South Australia down near the mouth of the River Murray where various people had come together to discuss the difficulty of being able to prevent the building of a bridge to Hindmarsh Island. A range of conversation went on at that meeting and then Lindy Warrell said, 'What a pity about the women's business. It would be nice if there was some women's business.' In other words, they had assessed all the evidence which had been discussed as to how they could prevent this bridge being built and made a judgment that it probably could not be stopped on environmental grounds, that it probably could not be stopped by industrial action by the trade union movement-the CFMEU at the time-and that it probably could not be stopped by genuine sacred site grounds for Aboriginal people. So she said, 'What we really need to bring into this is Council for some women's business.' Flowing on from that incident, we have this situation and this debate today. Ultimately, what happened was that the former Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in the Keating government, Minister Tickner, moved to prevent this bridge going ahead for 25 years. So we are now here 1996 debating this particular issue because, as it has transpired, we now know that the women's business that was developed at that meeting-which meeting interestingly actually included men-was a fabrication. So we are back here today. For those members who were here two years ago and spoke to a motion for disallowance, it is important for there to be debate in this House in support of this particular bill. There are two important issues which I would like to draw attention to in this debate on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill. The first is the decision to take consideration of evidence as part of the process of ministerial decision making. The Full Bench of the High Court found on 7 December 1995-and this was not all that long ago-that the former minister had failed to follow the due process of the act for which he was responsible by failing to cons.ider personally the evidence which was referred to as 'secret women's business' . We raised that in the debate on the motion for disallowance. We said then that the process which was being undertaken by the then government was inappropriate, that it was not valid. We warned the then government that the way in which the cabinet decision making process was being undertaken, the way in which the minister was undertaking assessment of this material, was not valid. A South Australian royal commission had previously found that the so-called business was a fabrication. This finding was supported by the views of another group Ngarrindjeri women who said that there was no such secret women's business associated with Hindmarsh Island. The 14 Ngarrindjeri women who disputed the claims of the proponents of the secret women's business faced the threats and personal abuse of the activists with great courage and fortitude. I would like to mention those women. One of the highlights of time in parliament so far, which is over years now, has actually been meeting Dorothy Wilson, Dulcie Wilson and Jenny Grace yesterday afternoon and this morning. It was a highlight to meet these Aboriginal women because they stand for a symbol in this country of tremendous courage and integrity. I do think anybody in this House could to be. overstate the difficulties that those women faced in their community when they realised nail. the way in which the circumstances were arising in their own community in discussion about the building of the bridge at Hindmarsh Island. They were senior women in the area. They also spoke to Nana Laura, another very elderly lady who they had very close contact with. They recognised that the discussions that were taking place in their community would help. were not wholesome. More than that, they knew them to be totally wrong and totally fabricated. In regard to this debate, there are probably four words that really summarise this whole set of circumstances. The first is manipulaas tion, the second is intimidation, the third fabrication and the last is courage. The nipulation occurred from a long way back. have observed the way in which the previous government undertook Aboriginal affairs-the management there. One of the fundamental things that was wrong during the 1980s in this great country of ours was the fact that previous government raised expectations with regard to many areas in Aboriginal affairs and failed to deliver. I will point to two particular areas. One was national land rights. They raised expectations. They went around in 1983, 1984, 1985 and up to about 1986",96
222,Mr MELHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,And you fought us every women's inch of the way.,97
223,Mr MILES,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"Yes. They raised expectations of out there amongst their own Aboriginal people that there was going to be national land rights, and you failed to deliver. You were the government. Secondly, they said, 'What we will do is bring about an agreement between our indigenous people and other Australians. We will have a treaty.' Again, they Jaised expectations beyond what could be delivered. It is my that sort of approach which has actually 11 frustrated many Aboriginal people in this country because those expectations were beyond what the government knew could be delivered, but of course for their own purposes, they tried to manipulate the Aboriginal people to believe that they would deliver on these outlandish claims, as they have proven",97
224,Mr MELHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,You fought us tooth and,97
225,Mr MILES,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,I note that the opposition spokesman for Aboriginal affairs is making some comments. I just want to suggest to him that it was us who actually first talked about reconciliation in political circles.,97
226,Mr MELHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,Talk's cheap. A bit of action,97
227,Mr MILES,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"That is exactly what this government will do in government. We were in opposition at that stage, but we did talk about it. After 1988-a year or so laterwhen the coalition talked about reconciliation a genuine need, the then government is picked up the concept of a reconciliation macouncil. There are many people who would I disagree on whether that was a good or a bad idea. I think it is a good idea because reconciliation is very important. The coalition is very keen to see reconciliation occur. Reconciliation will not occur through a the legal document called a treaty or a contract. It would never occur that way. It has to be a heartfelt thing. If we want reconciliation in this country, it has to be something which actually occurs in our school grounds. It has to occur on our streets and in our pubs. That is where it has to occur. Genuine reconciliation will occur when our indigenous people have the same health standards as other Australians, when they have the same housing conditions as other Australians, when they are able to have the same access to educational opportunities as other Australians, and all type of thing. That is where the hard action, practical outcomes and real results occur. That is when real reconciliation will occur in this country. The work which was done by the Aboriginal women who were called dissidents has certainly helped tremendously with regard to reconciliation in this country. I will just list these great women. They include Dorothy Wilson, whom I have already mentioned, Dulcie Wilson, Bertha Gollan, Jenny Grace, Audrey Dix, Betty Tatt, Rita Wilson, Vena Gollan, Beryl Kropinyeri, Margaret Sinclair, Rocky Koolmatrie, Shirley Knight and Phyllis Byrnes. Their stance was also supported by the Campbell family. These people did something which was absolutely marvellous for this country. They stood up against the pressures of the union movement. They stood up against the pressures from local people in the area who did not want the bridge to be built. They stood up against the pressures of anthropologists. They stood up against the pressures of a large number of lawyers and professors of law. Not only that, they stood up against the federal government of the day. They decided from a basis of honesty and decency that the Australian people should know the truth. As I said before, I do not think anybody in this parliament can imagine the pressure that existed on those women. I would like to pay tribute to them for the steadfast respect they had for truth and for the integrity of their own cultural heritage. The previous government, by the actions which it took, was doing everything to undermine the cultural heritage of the Ngarrindjeri people. Why? Because the previous government was standing behind and backing up a fabrication. Yet these women, concerned about their traditions, stood up and spoke the truth. This fundamental respect for the truth and respect for the integrity of Aboriginal heritage was wholly absent on the part of the minister and his strident political supporters, namely, the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), Michael Lavarch, the Attorney General at the time, the former Minister for that Justice, the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), together with a swarm of anthropological and legal advisers, including Professor Cheryl Saunders, who ought to have known, if not better, at least enough to protect their political clients from the inevitable debacle which followed. At no time-this is just amazing-did anyone from the former government do the dissident Ngarrindjeri women the courtesy of interviewing them in order to verify their stories. I find that absolutely amazing. Here we have genuine fair dinkum, decent, hard working Aboriginal women who were not even asked to express their opinion. Their information was not sought at all by so many people. It is amazing that a government could actually make a decision without talking to these people and seeking information. It is absolutely vital in these processes that all points of view are sought",97
228,Mr MELHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,Should be respected.,98
229,Mr MILES,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"Yes, respected. In this case it is very clear that the previous government did not do that. Former Minister Tickner erred by not considering the contents of the secret women's business. He claimed that he was prevented from doing so because the evidence was for women's eyes only. In his eagerness to support the views of the original plaintiffs under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, he committed a fundamental injustice by making a ministerial decision without considering the merits of the evidence before him. We now know that it was an absolute fabrication. Every Australian has the right to expect that ministers will make decisions based on the fullest consideration of the evidence relevant to the case in question, just as we expect evidence to be examined and weighed impartially in the legal process. This brings me to the second principle that I wish to consider in my argument: the role to be accorded to spiritual beliefs in the process of government. It was never going to be good enough for Mr Tickner to plead that his respect for what were claimed to be secrets should be sufficient to make them immune from consideration. The sacred beliefs of a particular section of the community deserve the respect of us all. But they do not require that everyone automatically adhere to them or that they be put forward as a substitute for empirical evidence. While we must have respect for all the different cultural and religious beliefs held by members of our diverse society, the fundamental point to be made is that none of these beliefs are able to inhibit the rules of evidence or interfere in the process of government or the law. There is no doubt that this government respects people. We are a government which understands and fully supports people's respect for conscience and belief in life. Mr Tickner sought to deliberately subvert this fundamental principle in the matter of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. In doing so, he acted with reckless disregard for the consequences for those clients who depended upon him to administer the provisions of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. He acted with disregard for impartiality and without respect for due process. As a consequence of this fiasco, we have been forced to legislate to limit the operation of the act in this case. This sorry episode will do nothing to enhance general community respect for those whose claims rest upon the thoughtful consideration of spiritual or religious beliefs. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act was designed to provide protection for the religious and cultural values of Aboriginal people whose beliefs were transmitted orally and through ritual processes. We stand behind it. The validity of those beliefs deserves to be verified by the most serious, detailed and objective anthropological examination. The act was designed to protect indigenous heritage. It was not designed as a vehicle for cynical manipulation by particular interest groups or to support a particular political agenda. In conclusion, the Hindmarsh Island Bridge saga is a graphic illustration of what was wrong with the politics of indigenous affairs in Australia at that time. Objectivity and impartiality are the first casualties in the adversarial approach taken by those who stake their professional integrity on blind support for the former government's agenda at the expense of justice or common sense. These women stood up for justice. They are an example to all Australians. When faced with a terrible dilemma as to whether to go along with the politically correct agenda of the day in their own community, bacI<e8 up by the federal government of the day, these women stood up and fought a cause for justice, honesty and integrity. They are marvellous people. They are a tremendous example to the rest of Australia. I congratulate them at the highest level for that which they have contributed to Australia. (Time expired)",98
230,Mr MARTYN EVANS,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"I support the second reading amendment moved by my colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham). In so doing, I would like to canvass some of the issues which come before the House in relation to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill as a whole and, in particular, to some of the comments which we have had in the debate so far from members of the government. This bridge has a very unfortunate history. Certainly, the debate surrounding it has taken on a magnitude which those who were part of the debate in the very beginning could never have contemplated. I think it is very sad that this debate has been magnified to the degree that it has and that it has taken on the political character that it has, not only in the previous government's term of office but particularly now in this government's term of office when we should be moving into a better phase of this debate. The unfortunate and sad history of this bridge and of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander reconciliation, with which it has become intertwined, is one which I hoped never to see in this parliament. It is one which I would have thought we could have avoided and one which I hoped the present government would have gone out of its way to avoid rather than going out of its way to encourage and promote, seeking to profit by that division, seeking to capitalise on problems which the previous government experienced in relation to this matter and seeking-I suspect-to capitalise on those difficulties in a way which does not advance the debate towards reconciliation in any way and, in fact, takes us backwards. We have had many opportunities as parliamentarians in the course of the last few years-and this bridge debate has provided us with those opportunities-to move towards reconciliation. There have been some on all sides of this debate who have, unfortunately, sought opportunities to capitalise on this debate in a cynical and political way. I know that that has not been confined to one side of the argument within the indigenous community; it has not necessarily always been confined to one side of the political argument. What I am particularly saddened by is the fact that, in the recurring debate which we have as a result of the bill, those who seek to speak in support of the bill have not always done so from what I would regard as the most appropriate position to promote reconciliation. Some have sought to use this debate in a way which I think promotes dissent, which seeks to promote a political view of this debate and which implies lack of good faith on the part of those in the previous government who administered this matter. While I can accept some criticism in relation to the previous minister's operation of some of the procedural aspects of this debate, I do not think one could question the good faith involved in attempting to give credence to another culture's heritage and beliefs. That is the most fundamental point: how do you give appropriate credence to another cultural set of beliefs, another set of cultural understandings, a tradition, a history, which is handed down and passed on from generation to generation in quite different ways from that which most members of this House would be familiar, indeed comfortable, with? That is the very difficult part to overcome in one's own thinking processes in relation to this matter. It is the thing which many members of the public have difficulty coming to terms with, but it is something which I would have hoped members of this House, and indeed senior members of the government, would have been able to deal with in a proper way. It is very unfortunate that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) has now sought, through the device of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996, to carryon the debate in a way which is far from conducive to reconciliation and promoting public understanding of cultural beliefs and traditions which are not those of most Australians, but which certainly deserve to be understood and respected by all Australians. That is the vital part of this debate to which I would like to contribute. The bill has a very straightforward and, on the face of it, a very simple proposition: in order to build the Hindmarsh Island Bridge it is essential to carry this single item of legislation which seeks to override the normal provisions of the heritage legislation in a way which is highly specific to this one project. But we have heard speakers from the other side of the chamber make comments about due process and natural justice, all of those kinds of issues which one would normally invoke but which I find an absurd response to a single piece of legislation which is solely designed to undermine due process, to undermine the normal legislative processes of this country and to set aside this project, away from the normal mechanisms which this parliament has established to deal with issues of Aboriginal heritage. Quite clearly, if we were committed to due process and to ensuring that this matter was dealt with in the normal and appropriate legal way for an issue of this kind, we would not need single items of legislation which exclusively deal with the particular application. That way does not lie due process. I think that is where members of the government have confused this with a political agenda which I suspect some are seeking to pursue as a result of this. Just what is the purpose of this legislation? Is it, in fact, to achieve the building of the bridge? That would be its ostensible purpose. That would be the purpose you would suspect from the face of the record and that would be the purpose from which you sometimes gain the rhetoric, particularly of the second reading speech, the introduction speech. That seemed to refer just to this. But the supplementary speeches which we have had from members of the government, in effect, give the lie to that straightforward proposition. The bill is not about what it is about on the face of the record. If it were, it would be a relatively simple proposition. But, of course, as my colleague the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, has clearly pointed out in his contribution, the bill is completely unnecessary. If our only objective here was to ensure the construction of the bridge, we would not need to proceed with the bill. Indeed, I would put the point of view that proceeding with the bill is the way of slowing down construction of the bridge-indeed, may be a way of subverting the construction of the bridge and probably puts more legal obstacles in the way of the bridge than any other process one could imagine. Had due process been followed then, I suspect, we could now have the bridge under construction as we speak in this place. That is not something which this side of the House would stand in the way of. We accept that the government won the election. We accept that the evidence which has come forward since this matter was first raised is such that the bridge could now proceed. We accept that. That is not something we are opposed to or something we stand in the way of; it is something which both sides of this House would agree on. The bridge can and should proceed forthwith. There is no legal obstacle to that. There is no determination by the minister in the way of that. The one determination which did exist was struck down by the court. There were appropriate and technical grounds for that proceeding. It was not struck down by the court on the basis of an analysis of the merits of the argument. It was struck down because of procedural issues which, of course, were fatal to the minister's determination. That is well understood. As a process of law, as due process being followed under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, that is appropriate. But we now have an entirely separate process. We now have a minister who advances the point of view that the only way to construct this bridge is by passing special legislation. That is simply not correct. That is simply not true. Because of the way this parliament operates, because of the government's inability to get legislation through this parliament on time, this bill will not be considered by the Senate until next year. The cut-off date has already passed. The government itself has nqt Q.ut this on its high priority list. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) has implicitly and explicitly conceded that this bill is not a high priority for the government and therefore, in effect, the government has deferred this legislation until next year. The government says that this is low priority legislation but that it is essential to getting the bridge built. That is a contradiction in terms and it is one which we must come to understand, if we are to understand why this legislation is before the House. Quite clearly, the present act, as it now stands, provides adequate mechanisms for ensuring that the bridge can be and is built forthwith. There is no determination under the act which is currently on foot. There is no prohibition under the act for the construction of the bridge. The reality is that if the minister wishes he can take full advantage of all the material which is now in the public domain. He can appoint someone of his own choosing who is quite able to be subject to direction and instruction, who is subject to the minister's guidelines and who can be required to report within a very narrow time framesay, 14 days after representations are received. In that way, the minister can act quite properly, in accordance with all of the court decisions which we have now seen on the record since this matter was first raised. I have to say that the matter has certainly had the effect of ensuring that the law in this area is very clear and well understood by all concerned. We certainly owe the former minister that. He has guaranteed that the federal court and others have had ample opportunities to comment on this matter and I think all members of parliament are now very conversant with the necessary legislation. Certainly, the minister ought to be more conversant with it than he apparently is because, quite clearly, if he were to follow the procedures in the act, he would be able to ensure the construction of the bridge forthwith. Certainly, he could have the matter legally resolved well before this parliament rises in the December recess. That would have been quite simple for him to do. By bringing on this bill, he has introduced endless and additional complications to the matter which we do not need, which the proponents of the bridge do not need and which I would suggest are very damaging to the process of reconciliation. This bill is nothing but a political device ensure that the kinds of comments which we have had on the record in the last couple of days can be made. It is a device which ensures that, once again, Aboriginal culture and heritage are called into question. Despite the ultimate and perhaps begrudging acceptance of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of the motion put forward by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on reconciliation, ensuring harmony and understanding between all Australians, whatever their ethnic or indigenous nature, the resolution was finally unanimously adopted by this parliament. I not know what would have been the case had the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) been in her place at the time-but she wasn't, so we will never know. The reality is that the motion was adopted by all members of this parliament. It was promoted by the Leader of the Opposition quite properly and he very generously allowed the Prime Minister to pick up that resolution because he was more Racial interested in the process of reconciliation, in the process of bringing Australians together, it is not. than he was in scoring political points. But this bill, unlike the Leader of the Opposition's motion, is about scoring political points. It is not about achieving a legal objective of ensuring the construction of bridge-that can be adequately contemplated by the present legislation. If the minister to devote the same degree of attention to the present legislation which he has devoted to amending it in this very special and unique way, then we would have the bridge under construction by now. The problem with this legislation, as my colleague has pointed out, is that it is discriminatory. It does breach the Racial Discrimination Act, contrary to the assurances of the minister in transmitting the bill to the Leader of the Opposition, contrary to coalition policy, stated in writing, that the coalition in government will respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, and contrary to the rhetoric of ministers and the Prime Minister of this government when they say that all of their actions will respect the Racial Discrimination Act. The bill, as my colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham) has said, is, to in effect, one of our bills of rights. It is something which empowers all Australians. It is something which brings Australians together rather than something which should divide them. Unfortunately, this government has sought to exploit previous political and administrative difficulties over this bridge in a way which will ensure that that act is again subject to on notional challenge. This bill certainly does challenge the RDA; it certainly puts that bipartisan respect for the RDA at some risk. Rather than the government accepting its do position of leadership as it quite properly should in promoting that reconciliation, in promoting harmony between all Australians, indigenous and non-indigenous, this bill is a mere device to bring about disharmony-a device which will not promote reconciliation, a device which will not even get the job done at the end of the day. I suspect the bill is flawed for those reasons. It is contrary to the Discrimination Act; it is retrospective. It is all of those things which its minister says The test of that will be the government's response. If the motion for the second reading is rejected by this House, the test will be what the government will do when confronted with the the second reading amendment of my colleague to this bill, which, for the avoidance of were doubt-which is entirely appropriate in this case--expressly declares that it is the intention of the parliament that the terms of the Racial Discrimination Act shall prevail over the provisions of this act and that nothing in this act shall be taken to authorise any conduct whether legislative, executive or judicial that is inconsistent with the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act. That amendment is critical to understanding the government's attitude to this bill. If the government is genuine about this bill, if its purpose is as it has stated-that it is simply to get the job done, simply to get the bridge built and not for any base political motivethen the government will accept that amendment and that will ensure the support of all concerned for this legislation, with the possible exception of some Independent members of this House. The reality is that I suspect the government will not support this amendment. I suspect that its motives are not as pure, as practical and as utilitarian as it would have us believe but are set to a lesser purpose than that. The coalition's respect for the Racial Discrimination Act will be sorely tested when this matter is put to the vote-and be sure that it will be put to a vote. We want to ensure it is on the record of this parliament because respect for the Racial Discrimination Act is a fundamental touchstone of the government's sincerity of policy consideration in this area. It is a fundamental touchstone of its commitment to reconciliation and of its commitment to unifying Australians rather than dividing them. That is the test to which you will be put when this matter comes before the House in a vote. Does the bill discriminate against one section of the Australian community or does it not? We want to ensure that you are as good as your word. Your word that you will respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act will be tested by this amendment. I know that I and my colleagues on this side of the House will be supporting this amendment. This amendment goes well beyond the consideration of just this bill because it the whole of your policy approach to this area of government. This is a very critical area of government not least because of the Hindmarsh Bridge issue itself-indeed, that is almost forming a lesser part of the debate in reality-and because of recent events in the Australian political landscape following the election on 2 March; not because of actions of the government but because of inaction by the government and actions by others in the Australian community who have sought to make race an issue in this community. The inaction of the government in the early stages of the debate allowed the debate to rage way further than it should ever have been allowed to do. It is always the obligation of the Prime Minister of this country to Wel- in heavily and early on these things to ensure that the public well understand the position of the government when individuals in society raise issues which go beyond the normal rights of free speech and start to impinge on the very harmony and coherence of the community itself. In those cases we are not just talking about political correctness or about the normal freedom of political debate in this country. We are talking about something far deeperthe very fabric of our society, the very understanding which the various sections of our community have of each other, of their sincerity and of their role. For the Prime Minister to remain silent and mute in the face of that kind of issue is a very serious dereliction of duty, one which, fortunately, he has recently started to correct at the behest of the Leader of the Opposition in this place and one which he has started to correct in the public arena because he has recognised the failing that has occurred.",99
231,Mr MELHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,Supporting this amendment wouldn't hurt.,103
232,Mr MARTYN EVANS,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"That is the very point I was going to make next, because the support of this amendment is the first very practical and real test which the Prime Minister, his government and his colleagues will have in this place of their rhetoric, if you like, in the community. I do not think you can tests ever say in response to the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan), at the table, too much about the need for harmony and reconciliation in our community. I do not think that it is unreasonable that the Prime Minister should be required to comment on these things as often as is necessary to ensure that the point is made and understood. When this amendment is put to the test we will know and we will understand just where this coalition government stands on issues of race, discrimination and the cultural respect which the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders' traditions deserve in this place.",103
233,Ms JEANES,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"The Hindmarsh Island Bridge must surely be the world's most famous non-existent bridge. Sadly, it is famous for all the wrong reasons, for never has there been in the history of this country a better example of how not to go about anything. The history of this non-existent bridge is as long as it is sordid. If proper planning procedures had been followed and the then state government had not been desperate to cover up the condition of its ailing state bank, thus relieving its own burden of debt by propping up failing developers, the bridge would not be famous for never having been built. The saga of the bridge has divided the people of Port Elliot, the people of Goolwa, the people of Hindmarsh Island, many people in the wider South Australian community and, tragically, the Ngarrindjeri people. In order to understand my government's decision to introduce this bill, it is necessary to know the background to the decision to build the bridge. The story began before Tom and Wendy Chapman, the proprietors of Binaiong Pty Ltd, approached the State Bank of South Australia to finance their marina development on Hindmarsh Island. The question of whether or not a bridge is needed to connect Hindmarsh Island to the mainland has been a matter of debate in the area for many years. Some island dwellers argue that the absence of a bridge contributes to the isolation and, therefore, the character of project. the island. The character and the isolation are the very reasons they choose to live there. Others argue that access to the island is poor and that a ferry is not able to cope with existing traffic demands, particular at peak periods, so a remedy is needed. Varying remedies have been suggested. A bridge is not the only answer, but it was an eagerly sought after option by those seeking to develop the land. Another option for the island is to commission a second ferry. This is considered by some people to be more appropriate on economic, environmental, aesthetic and heritage grounds. The bridge was initially raised in the draft environmental impact statement released by Binalong for public comment in November 1989 for an extension of its marina development on the western section of Hindmarsh Island to the tune of an extra 800 allotments. The bridge at this stage was to be financed and constructed by Binalong. Planning approval for the first stage of 160 allotments was issued in April 1990 and progress beyond this stage was contingent on the building of the bridge, but the state government at this time announced that it would contribute $3 million towards the cost of the bridge. The $3 million was to be recouped by levies on the ongoing marina development. However, Binalong had been experiencing for some time what eventually became very well known financial problems, as were one of its financiers, the Beneficial Finance Corporation-the well-known cowboy lending division of the State Bank of South Australia. Since that time, as we all know, Binalong has gone into liquidation and the old State Bank of South Australia has become folklore in Australian banking history. Westpac, Binalong's other financier, was also at the time threatening to withdraw its financial support for the project. Throughout this period, senior project officers from the then Premier's Department, that is, John Bannon's department, were negotiating with the Chapmans, BFC and Westpac. BFC withdrew from the development in September 1990 and Westpac became Binalong's financier for the Soon after, in March the following year, the state government announced that it would fund and build the bridge and Binalong would only have to repay costs less $3 million after they repaid their debt to Westpac. Many South Australians saw this as a shady deal motivated by the state government's desire to get money back onto BFC's books. In March 1993, a deed was finalised between the councils of Port Elliott and Goolwa, Binalong and the government which saw the state government taking over the responsibility for financing the bridge. The decision further angered many South Australians at the time for many reasons, so much so that in April 1993 the Environment, Resources and Development Committee of the South Australian parliament was given the terms of reference for an inquiry into the financial aspects of the decision to build the bridge. I would like to quote from some of the people who put submissions to the inquiry. A.1. Cattanach said: There have been a multitude of businesses in South Australia that have gone bankrupt over the last few years that would have given their eye teeth for a deal like this. There are hundreds of small businesses in my electorate which would be overjoyed if the state government offered them $3 million, or indeed any part thereof, to assist them with their infrastructure costs. The Adelaide Bushwalkers said: The Government seems determined to throw even more taxpayers' money into the mess that was the State Bank fiasco. It should cut its losses and development entirely to the private sector. Submissions from the district councils of Berri, Loxton and others pointed out that Riverland areas have been agitating for a bridge for over two decades, with much greater need. These views are widely held in the South Australian community because there is a lot more than just a grain of truth in them. On completion of the inquiry, the committee made five recommendations which were, in summary: one, that a reassessment of the bridge project be done with consideration as to whether a second ferry would meet the island's access requirements; two, that consideration be given to the introduction of a toll for non-resident ferry users; three, 'that the government seriously address the matters in this report relating to the competing interests of heritage, environment and development'; four, that government agencies should immediately involve the local community in the development of management plans for the whole of the Murray mouth, Coorong and surrounding waterways; and, five, 'that any further residential development on Hindmarsh Island beyond the Goolwa Marina development should be subject to the most critical analysis in regard to its environmental impact'. Mr Deputy Speaker, from the recommendations you can see that there were many problems relating to the approval process for the non-existent bridge pertaining to a proper needs assessment, proper environmental assessment and proper community consultation. A further reason for the rinosity felt by some in the South Australian community came from what was seen by many people as the most extraordinary abuse of the legal process. In March 1994, lawyers acting on behalf of Binalong's directors, Tom and Wendy Chapman, sought and gained interim injunctions in the Federal Court under section 450 of the Trade Practices Act to stop certain people, including well-known and respected South Australians such as Professor David Shearman, the then President of the Conservation Council of South Australia, from speaking out against the building of the bridge. I leave would have to say that I, too, regard this as a most unfair abuse of the legal process, to stop a group of citizens who were rightfully concerned that due process should be adhered to for the construction of a project that they had every right to object to. Hindmarsh Island sits just a few hundred metres from the coastline in the middle of the Murray mouth. The island is indeed a very special island, situated within a very beautiful region that is of tremendous significance to South Australians. Thousands of us over the years, along with interstate and overseas visitors, have enjoyed a weekend outing with our families, travelling over to the island on the ferry, and have spent Christmas holidays lazing on the beaches around the Murray's lakes and mouth. The natural assets of the region are a magnet for local and distant tourists who visit the area each year. The Fleurieu Tourism Association is actively working to ensure that many more people VISIt, an activity that I wholeheartedly support because then they will travel through my wine region, the MCLaren Vale wine region, and will stop to experience the very outstanding wines that are produced in my electorate. The major attraction in the entire region is its natural beauty. Already, human activity has altered the area dramatically and caused considerable degradation and environmental management problems that are now in the process of being better managed. In fact, the Murray mouth, Hindmarsh Island, the Murray Lakes and the Coorong are so significant ecologically that they have been listed under the Ramsar convention or the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, the Japan-Australia migratory bird agreement, the China-Australia migratory bird agreement and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, or the Bonn convention. Australia has obligations under these international treaties to protect habitats of birds and other animal species that live in them at various times of the year. The South Australian government, in conjunction with the Australia Nature Conservation Agency, is working to ensure that these obligations are met. Some $56,000 has been allocated to the development of a management plan for the entire Coorong Ramsar site and a process to develop a management plan for the entire site is now under way. The South Australian government has established a community reference group and a government agencies committee to oversee this process. Two project officers have been employed, one as a planner and one to undertake community consultation. This is a measure of great importance to ensure that future developments in the region, one of the fastest growing in the state, are in step with the expectations of the community. When you think about it, Mr Deputy Speaker, there are few things in the natural environment that are more amazing than the instinct in some species which impels them to travel thousands of miles each year from as far away as Japan and China to spend the summer months in the waters around Hindmarsh Island. Around 45 bird species have been recorded in the waters surrounding the island. Several species have been recorded as being of considerable conservation value because they are rare, locally endangered, vulnerable or listed on one of these treaties to which Australia is a signatory. Over half these species have declined in numbers by at least 10 per cent and in many cases the decline has exceeded 20 per cent. The definition of ecologically sustainable development says that development should not compromise biodiversity or contribute to a decline in local species. The evidence is clear: development in the region is already seriously impacting on the very precious local environment which plays host every year to migratory birds from thousands of miles away. This miraculous practice has been ongoing for more years than any of us in this place could understand and it has required a healthy environment to continue; and it will require a healthy environment to continue into the the future. A healthy environment requires healthy water, something the Aboriginal people seemed to have understood long before non-Aboriginal Australians. Part of the degradation of the area is due to the interruption of normal flows and the pollution of the waters in the region since European settlement. Blue-green algal blooms are no longer uncommon in the summer months in the waters in the Murray's lakes and mouth and restrictions on the use of water have to be put in place. Now, in the absence of an independent environmental impact statement, an extra 800 residential allotments and a bridge will be enticing more visitors and permanent residents to the area each year, placing more pressure on the region. It is unthinkable in 1996 that approval for development of this scope could have been given in a Ramsar site before a management plan was in place. The planning approval for these developments was granted on the strength of the EIS that Binalong itself produced. The Labor Party's approach to wetlands protection is in direct contrast to the approach taken by the present South Australian minister, the Hon. David Wotton, whom I am proud to say is a very decent man and a good political friend. Minister Wotton sought to protect that very precious area, the Coongie Lakes, in South Australia's section of the Lake Eyre Basin by working with the pastoralists to develop and implement a management plan for the lakes. The South Australian government has been able to achieve what the Labor Party could never achieve which has seen the lakes fenced off to cattle for the better protection of its precious assets. Now this government has seen the need to introduce the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill in order to prevent this parliament's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 from further stalling the construction of the as yet non-existent bridge. There can be no doubt that the previous Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the former member for Hughes, did not handle his responsibilities well in relation to the bridge proposal-because he was more interested in making political mileage out of the bridge debacle than he was in resolving the problem. I expect there is a lesson for us all in In fact, as we all know, the previous minister's shoddy handling of the issue was exposed by the Full Bench of the High Court in December 1995 as invalid under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, and his decision was overturned. The next complication arising from his shoddy handling of the issue arose when a further application under the act was received by the former government in December last year and Justice Mathews was commissioned to prepare a report under section 10 of the act. As we also know, Justice Mathews was found to be ineligible to perform the duties that the minister appointed her to perform. All the while the minister was championing the cause of Aboriginal heritage and admonishing the coalition, yet he was not prepared to address the very damage caused to Aboriginal people by the inadequacies of his very own act until forced to by its exposure in the courts. He has paid the price for his incompetence. The South Australian government held an inquiry to determine whether or not Aboriginal heritage issues pertammg to women's business existed in the area, and the inquiry found that such issues were fabricated. The problem, of course, was that the women who claimed to be the holders of the stories relating to the women's business refused to participate in the inquiry. The whole story was, therefore, unable to be told. I doubt that any non-Ngarrindjerri person can know the truth about the Aboriginal heritage issues surrounding the bridge or that anyone can confidently make the right decision pertaining to the construction of the bridge based on Aboriginal heritage issues alone. I would like at this stage to express my sympathy to Mrs Sarah Miler!. Sarah is described as being 'recognised by Aboriginal people as the custodian of Kumarangk or Hindmarsh Island'. Her great grandfather, 'King' Peter Pulami, was paramount RepuUe of the mighty Ngarrindjerri nation whose people occupied the land, lakes and waterways of the lower Murray region. Sarah along with many other Ngarrindjerri women, both this. the so-called non-dissident and dissident women, have been deeply hurt and affected by the process that they were forced to go through and its effects on their people. What the whole saga has shown is that our processes to address matters of Aboriginal heritage were sadly lacking prior to the public airing of the idea to construct a bridge to Hindmarsh Island. The South Australian government moved soon after coming into office to address this problem. They have sought consultation with the Aboriginal community in order that that community will inform the government on how a more effective process could be built. The Premier himself initiated consultation with the Aboriginal community which resulted in a number of measures, including the appointment of a full-time chair of the Aboriginal Heritage Committee, the restructuring of the committee to reflect the traditional structure of the South Australian Aboriginal community and a $300,000 site protection program. The previous federal government also moved eventually to address the problems with its 1984 act through a review which was finalised in August this year by Justice Elizabeth Evatt-a review supported by the government and now under consideration, as we are expecting to introduce amendments to the act early next year. So, if nothing else comes from this debacle, at least there will more effective processes to identify matters Aboriginal heritage-and we owe the overwhelming majority of Aboriginal Australians nothing less. I believe, as I said earlier, that the behind the as yet unbuilt Hindmarsh Island Bridge holds many lessons for governments, for Aboriginal people and for those with an interest in development and environmental matters-that is, just about everyone in the Australian community. The Hindmarsh Island Bridge exposes the types of problems that caused me to seek a career in politics. There is no question that this country must further develop its unique and, indeed, its spectacular assets. We need further development to create the employment opportunities that too many people in this country so desperately need. But, in doing so, we must get it right. Getting it right means consulting with local communities and putting matters of environmental protection and Aboriginal heritage very high on the agenda indeed. We cannot afford the types of messages that debacles like the as yet unbuilt bridge send to the development community and to the many millions of people in this country who have a strong interest in environmental matters and who expect more of their governments. Therefore, I place on the record my personal sadness that the processes were either not properly in place or not properly negotiated and my sadness that the handling of the entire issue has caused grief within the wider South Australian community, and particularly amongst the Aboriginal community. It has done very little to assist with the process of reconciliation-and for that I am truly sad. Nor has it done anything to assist with the sustainable development of a very special region of South Australia in a way that protects its special resources-which are indeed its very attractions-for the use and enjoyment of future generations. If only common sense could have prevailed with all parties having got together and reached some sort of agreement. Perhaps such an agreement could have included improved access for island residents through the introduction of a second ferry for their exclusive be use. Perhaps such an agreement could have of seen Built Environs building a structure that the South Australian people actually need. Perhaps such an agreement could have seen oil poured on the troubled waters surrounding story the island and the pain felt by the Ngarrindjerri people. Sadly, however, it is probably too late, for we are stuck with the mess created for us by the previous state Labor government. It is therefore with regret that there is no other way and I support my government's need to introduce this bill into this House.",104
234,Mr LATHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"I share with the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) a certain sadness on this provision, a certain sadness about the government's decision to bring this Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill before the House. I also congratulate the member for Kingston on the tone and intent of her remarks because I think she brought a refreshing objectivity to the debate. I was quite impressed, indeed, when she spoke of learning lessons, when she spoke not of declaring right and wrong on this issue, not of declaring winners and losers but of learning lessons. She also spoke powerfully of consultation and the capacity for compromise on a question like this. I think that really is a style of debate and a way of approaching the Hindmarsh Island Bridge and associated issues that we could all learn from. I sincerely believe that this is not an issue where the government needs to declare right and wrong, where the government needs to declare winners and losers. It is an issue where the government needs to learn lessons, where the government needs to learn from the experience. Mr Ronaldson-You did all that for us.",108
235,Mr LATHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"I say for the benefit of the member for Ballarat that the Australian Labor Party also needs to learn lessons from the experience. No-one on this side of the House can pretend, or to my understanding would pretend, that our administration and carriage of the issue up until 2 March was 100 per cent perfect. I concede that. I am not here, unlike some of the government speakers, to declare right and wrong, to declare winners and losers. I speak very much in the tone expressed by the member for Kingston. The arguments she placed before the House with regard to the environmental significance of the area could be dealt with by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) if he was to exercise his responsibilities, his power, his discretion as provided for under the act. It is one of the great sadnesses of this bill that Senator Herron will not have an opportunity to consider the type of environmental issues that have been placed before the House of Representatives by the member for Kingston. If I do have one difference with her and her presentation it is the remarks she made about Robert Tickner. Being a member elected on 2 March when Robert Tickner was defeated in his seat of Hughes, she would not know him. But anyone who knows Robert Tickner well would not agree with her assessment that he would ever try to use Aboriginal issues and Aboriginal affairs for political mileage. Robert Tickner was not perfect in his administration of this matter. I think he acknowledged that himself when he appointed Senator Crowley to handle the issue at the end of last year and in the lead-up to the election. One thing about Robert Tickner was his sincerity and conviction to stand up for the best interests of Aboriginal people as he saw them. Robert Tickner was not the sort of person who would ever, under any circumstance, use Aboriginal issues and Aboriginal affairs for political mileage. He was, without doubt, a person of great compassion and a person so well motivated on these issues. I think that needs to be placed on the record in all fairness to Mr Tickner. This is an issue of some sadness. The position of the Labor Party is very clear. We believe the bridge can be built and, in fact, we want the bridge to be built but not at the expense of the Racial Discrimination Act, not at the expense of Australia's bill of rights. Our assessment, advanced so capably by the member for Banks (Mr Melham), is that the two objectives are not incompatible. We can have the bridge as well as respect for the Racial Discrimination Act. We can have the Hindmarsh Island Bridge as well as preserving the integrity of Australia's bill of rights. The two are entirely compatible. If there is one thing the government is doing through this process-and I think it is a great shame-it is declaring a vote of no confidence in Senator Herron. If the senator was allowed to exercise his power, his discretion, his responsibility under the act, there would be no need for this legislation. The government, in all its pious lecturing-we heard that last night from th!?, IDember for Barker (Mr MCLachlan)-is declaring no confidence in its own minister, Senator Herron. They are doing so, I believe, at the expense of the best interests and understanding of Aboriginal people in the community surrounding Hindmarsh Island. This has been an issue that has created division. It has been an issue that has created strongly held views both within that Aboriginal community and throughout Australia. There is one thing that I learnt in the 1980s working for some time with a New South Wales Aboriginal land council; that is, Aboriginal communities are not homogenous. Aboriginal people and Aboriginal communities never deserve to be stereotyped. We should never make the mistake in this parliament of assuming that Aboriginal people are uniform in their views, uniform in their interests, uniform in their beliefs. We should recognise and respect their diversity. Across Australia there are differences of opinion and differences of strongly held belief in their communities, not unlike the way in which non-Aboriginal communities have differences. No-one in this parliament, without a single Aboriginal member, expects us to agree. Of course we do not. On so many issues we disagree. That is the pattern of diversity that is reflected in Aboriginal communities, and we have seen it with respect to Hindmarsh Island. I do not doubt for a moment the member for Barker and his assessment of the Aboriginal women and their courage. They stood up and argued their case. They stood up and argued their beliefs. I do not doubt for a moment that, if they had in their heart a certain perspective, a certain passion, a certain set of beliefs, they demonstrated courage to stand up and argue the credibility of their case. Just as much, I do not doubt for a moment that those who disagreed with them, those who expressed a different set of beliefs, a different set of views were also courageous and remain courageous to this day. I have no doubt that there are seriously held beliefs and views on both sides of this issue. That, in many respects, demonstrates the government's folly in bringing this provision before the House. It is simply unnecessary in the resolution of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge issue. The government does not need to bring this legislation before the House to have the bridge built. But I ask this question: does it need to stand up on an issue like this to declare winners and losers as if somehow it is a game of sport? I think the speech I heard last night from the member for Barker, and today from other government members, displays the worse features of our adversarial style of parliamentary debate. It is as if on every single issue they have an instinctive need to declare winners and losers, right and wrong. There is no doubt, for the benefit of the member for Ballarat, that I engage in adversarial politics, but there are some issues-and this is onewhere there is no right and wrong, where there are no winners and losers. There are differences of opinion, differences of strongly held opinion and belief. The member for Kingston raised the point so capably that it is not a question of declaring right and wrong, winners and losers, like it is some game of sport that does not go to the heart of people's life and their beliefs. There is no need to do that on this issue. It is a matter of learning. It is about learning lessons and understanding how this issue can now be dealt with. It is about striking compromises, if they are appropriate. This legislation is not required as part of the learning process. This legislation effectively is an attempt by the government to celebrate its view that, on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge, there is nothing but winners and losers and there is nothing but right and wrong. I think the government makes a mistake in trying to dance on the grave of this issue and celebrate what it perceives to be winners and losers in the fashion that we have heard from so many government members. The truth is that there is no need for this legislation to build the bridge. There is no need for the government to declare winners and losers in a divided Aboriginal community. I believe the government is motivated by three things. First of all, the desire for the member for Barker to be vindicated. The member for Barker was humiliated in this parliament last year on the Hindmarsh Island issue. He was humiliated to the point where he had to resign from the shadow ministry. Those on the Labor side might have taken political joy from those events, but at a personal level no-one in this parliament would want to see a member so humiliated as the member for Barker was. He received correspondence that he knew was not his. He received correspondence through the systems of the Parliament House mail office that he knew did not belong to him. He then tried to come into this House-I remember the question time so well-to put questions to Mr Tickner that he knew were based on a falsehood. He knew that he should not have had access to that information. He should not have opened that mail sent to him incorrectly; he should have sent it straight on to the minister's office. Mr Ronaldson-You know that he did not see it. Be honest about it.",108
236,Mr LATHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"So the member for Barker was humiliated to the point where he had to resign as a shadow minister. Mr Ronaldson-Mark, you know",110
237,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,Order! The parliamentary secretary shall not interject.,110
238,Mr LATHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"It is almost as if this bill could be renamed the 'Ian MCLachlan vindication bill'. That is the way in which he argued his case last night. He felt an instinctive need to vindicate himself, having been humiliated in this parliament last year. He is a man of considerable ego; he is a man of considerable arrogance. It is a reflection of that ego and a reflection of the arrogance that he has argued the case as vindication for Ian MCLachlan, not necessarily as benefits for Aboriginal people associated with the Hindmarsh Island issue. The second thing that is reflected in the government's view-this idea of celebration on the issue-is that the Liberal Party believe at long last they have finally discovered for themselves a winning issue on Aboriginal politics. That is one of the reasons they have had the cheer squad in here--everyone from the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), the member for Wentworth (Mr Andrew Thomson) who was here last night, and the member for Ballarat. I am surprised that he has been caught up in this tawdry cabal of Liberal Party members not so much interested in the issue but trying to celebrate the fact that the Liberal Party at long last think they have discovered an issue that was a winner for them in terms of base politics. The third area of celebration we saw in the gallery last night: three well-known journalists, who often complain about opinion forming elites in Australia, conspiring around the idea of political correctness. But there they were, all comparing notes last night-three bigots on a stick-all here joining in the celebration of the idea that their world view has been vindicated. Again, three bigots celebrating the fact that their belief, their world view, had been vindicated-a world view that condemns political correctness and whatever that might stand for. So this really is unfortunate. Mr Ronaldson-He called them a freak show last night.",110
239,Mr LA THAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"That is untrue. The member for Ballarat is not telling the truth. Mr Ronaldson-Oh, now we hear it.",111
240,Mr LA THAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"I said that the member for Barker was using them as a freak show. Mr Ronaldson-You can give it but you can't take it, can't you?",111
241,Mr LATHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"I did not say those things and he should withdraw those things, Mr Deputy Speaker. He knows that to be untrue. Mr Ronaldson interjecting",111
242,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,Order! The parliamentary secretaryMr Ronaldson interjecting,111

253,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,Order! Order! The honourable member for Werriwa will resume his seat. This has been outrageous behaviour from the honourable member for Werriwa and the parliamentary secretary. I warn both members that if there is any further outburst of this nature I will have no option but to name them.,111
254,Mr LATHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"I praised those women in my speech earlier on. I said that I respect the view that they are courageous. If they have in their hearts and in their minds the views that they have stood up and expressed, then I praise their courage for doing so. I said that in my speech. Last night in my speech I made reference to the fact that the member for Barker uses them. He uses the issue as if it is a freak show, where he can make his own personal and political vindication at the expense of other people. And that is the truth of it. That is the absolute truth of what I said last night and what I said today. I want at the conclusion of this debate for the parliamentary secretary to withdraw those words. I would never ever say those things about Aboriginal people. I would never ever say those things about Aboriginal people, no matter the issue, no matter the passion. Let me just return to the government's credentials on this issue. I would have thought that, if the government believed sincerely that this legislation was needed to build the bridge, it would be declared as a matter of urgency through both houses of this parliament. If this was an urgent piece of legislation, it would have absolute priority through the House of Representatives and the Senate. As the government has declared its priority on this legislation, it has also declared its sinceriThis ty. When one looks at the ranking on the Senate schedule that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill has received, it is downgraded. As the government has downgraded its Senate legislative priority for this bill, it has downgraded its own sincerity on the issue. Let me just give the House, and those people interested in the issue, the sort of grading and priority the government has given this provision in the Senate. It has been allocated under time permitting-not urgent; not a first rank priority, but time permittingwhich of course is code for something that can wait till next year. As the government has downgraded its legislative priority in the Senate on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill, it has downgraded its own sincerity. It has also exposed the folly and the absolute political opportunism of the legislation itself. This bill is completely unnecessary and totally inappropriate. The government argues that the only way to ensure the Hindmarsh Island Bridge is built is to prevent a declaration being made under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 by the enactment of this bill. Yet, in the current situation, under existing legislation, no barrier exists preventing the construction of the bridge. No protection order is currently in existence. The bridge could go ahead tomorrow. This bill breaches the spirit and letter of the Racial Discrimination Act, and that is why the Labor Party is so uncomfortable with its introduction into this House of Representatives. It also contradicts the very specific commitment the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gave to respect the RDA. In question time early in this parliament the Prime Minister gave a clear commitment to respect the RDA. I am pleased to quote the words of the member for Banks in the racial tolerance resolution debated in this House last we-k when he said: This actthat is, the Racial Discrimination Actis our bill of rights. This act makes us all equal. As parliamentarians, we should at all times strive to maintain the principles behind this motion and every subsequent piece of legislation in this parliament should respect the Racial Discrimination Act. subsequent piece of legislation, this Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill, should respect the Racial Discrimination Act. That is why the government is engageu in a massive act of folly and insincerity in bringing the provision before the House. The bill is completely unnecessary to the construction of the bridge but, quite shamefully, it overrides the RDA. That is a very strong reason why no parliamentarian should support it in its current form. Why then is the government introducing legislation to override the heritage protection act when the act presents no barrier to the construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge? The issue, quite frankly, is dripping in the politics of dragging this issue out until the South Australian election next year. That is why the government has given this legislation such a low priority in the Senate. It has been ranked, in terms of priority, with the education services for overseas students bill; with the Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill about a few small alterations to the consolidated revenue fund; with the Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Codes) Bill, which I know to be a minor matter; with the Health Insurance Amendment Bill, another minor matter on immunisation registers; and, with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill, which makes small alterations to the powers of the Indigenous Land Corporation. It has been downgraded to the point where it has the same status as the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill, the Legislative Instruments Bill and the Flags Amendment Bill. It cannot even get higher on the government's legislative program than the Flags Amendment Bill, which was first introduced into this House three or four months ago. So the government is not serious in declaring this legislation as a matter of urgency. The government is not serious in getting this bill through as something that is essential to the construction of the Hindmarsh Island bridge. The government has downgraded the priority of this legislation in the Senate. It cannot be resolved until 1997. As it has downgraded the priority of the legislation, it has downgraded its own sincerity and its own credibility on this particular issue. The government, through its Senate prog-a-, concedes the bill is not necessary. The bIll a political exercise for which the government stands condemned. In terms of parliamentary standards and process, this is a sad day for the parliament for another reason. That is, this unnecessary piece of legislation is being debated in this House of Representatives at a time when the government will not give priority or debating time to the Euthanasia Laws Bill. The government has shoved away to the side chamber, the Main Committee of this House of Representatives, a matter of life and death. I would have thought the member for Ballarat would know how important euthanasia is, as I would for the same reasons. He would agree with me in saying that something that important, something that goes to the rights of terminally ill people, should not be debated in the Main Committee when we have a piece of legislation here which is a low priority on the government's Senate program. Mr Ronaldson-Who disrupted the debate last week? You were kicked out.",111
255,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,Mr Truss)Order! The parliamentary secretary shall not intervene.,113
256,Mr LATHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,That is the sadness of the parliamentary standard-a piece of legislation here used for base political opportunism for which the government has no priority.,113
257,Mr MELHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,It's not even necessary.,113
258,Mr LATHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"As the member for Banks points out, it is totally unnecessary to the building of the bridge. But, at the same time, in a side back hall of the Parliament House of Australia, a life and death issue going to the rights of terminally ill people is being debated against the express wishes of the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith). So he is one . person on their side who knows the horror, the sadness, of this day in terms of parliamentary standards. ./ The Prime Minister stands condemned for failing to lift the standards of this parliament, for getting these priorities upside down. Euthanasia should be here and, if it needs to IS be debated, Hindmarsh Island should be in the Main Committee because we all know the Senate will not deal with it until 1997. The bill should not be supported. (Time expired)",113
259,Mr TONY SMITH,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"My pupil master always told me that, when you have a hopeless case and you are addressing the jury, you remember three things: talk about anything but the facts of the case, be full of sound and fury, be unctuous. There has been a lot of that from the other side in this particular debate. It has been argued that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill breaches the Racial Discrimination Act, but nowhere in any of the speeches I have listened to have I seen particulars of that. The only particulars we have, from looking at the speeches and listening to them, is from the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) who said it discriminates against a class of people, but there are no particulars as to which class and in what way it so discriminates. The second thing I wish to observe in relation to the speakers who have gone before me is in relation to the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) who said that we needed to get a better phase in the debate and we needed to think about reconciliation. Members should remember that reconciliation involves an apology to the dissident women. That is what I am speaking about here tonight-the perils and the tyranny that the dissident women faced in this whole thing. The history of this particular saga is characterised by the following elements: conspiracy on a grand scale; deliberate denunciation and denigration of individuals, particularly the dissident women; contumelious disregard of those voices raised in support of the dissident women; a biased and partisan Australian Broadcasting Corporation; outrageous wasting of taxpayers money; and, as I said to some of the dissident women whom I met last night, a grave injustice to them. If anyone issue was capable of signing a political death warrant for a minister, this was one. I believe it fed through to the government of the day. It was another example of the failure of an ideology clouding ideas and judgment. When that occurs not only the body politic as a whole suffers but also the effect on the Australian community is profound. It brings with it a deep sense of mistrust and resentment towards Aboriginal people, thus fomenting the seeds of a racially based loathing. It makes the community angry and that anger gets in the way of the real issues that need to be addressed in this country so as to uplift its indigenous citizens. Unfortunately, the heroes of Hindmarsh-those dissident women-have largely been forgotten in the wash up of all of this. They all deserve our utmost respect and admiration. These were brave women. Bertha Gollam, Dorothy Wilson and Dulcie Wilson have been, in a sense, the leaders of the dissidents in that they spoke out first. That is not to underplay the similar courage of the other women. These women-as Bill Hayden in a broader context in his letter to the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday said-stood up to: .. the . . . bullying . . . by several, largely appointed, political elites ... determined to have us toe the line on what they state to be politically correct. They were ordinary people who were not listened to. The history of the setting up of the royal commission is quite clear. The dissident women claimed that the secret women's business was a fraud. The report was released and found that there was a fabrication of the women's business, particularly the claim that there was spiritual and cultural significance on Hindmarsh Island relating to the Aboriginal tradition of Ngarrindjeri women which was crucial for the reproduction of the Ngarrindjeri people. The cosmos which supported their existence was fabricated. The claim that the women's business required the prohibition of the construction of the bridge was fabricated. The purpose of the fabrication was to obtain a declaration from the minister pursuant to section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act to prevent the construction of the bridge. In other words, it was a monumental conspiracy-a grand false pretence-to induce a course of action. Apart from the dissident women, few anthropologists emerged from this whole sorry business unscathed. Those who did and who were prepared to stand up to the establishment are to be commended. Those who chose to get caught up in it and those who chose to be silent have done their profession no credit whatsoever. It highlights the existence of a deliberate anxiousness to get involved in creative anthropology. Does this bode well for the deluge of native title claims? Already we have seen the Century Zinc debacle, where $50 million has been squandered, where a $1 billion development has been quarantined-not one ounce of zinc, not one job and no Aboriginal has been advanced one iota. I was most impressed with an article by Dulcie Wilson, one of the dissident women, titled, 'Telling the Truth'. The building of the bridge was of no interest to this woman, yet she wanted no gross misrepresentation of her culture and origins. Let us look at the genesis selfof the conspiracy. Until 1994, there had been no indication of women's business or the fundamental cosmological importance of the region around Hindmarsh Island in the extensive literature about Ngarrindjeri. An anti-bridge coalition had been in existence and, when political and environmental objections failed, they turned to Aboriginal heritage issues, even though no concerns had been raised in the developer's earlier consultation with Ngarrindjeri representatives. This lobby led to the involvement of the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement, who were advised by ATSIC that the federal minister could have intervened if something of 'greater cultural significance' was found. At about the same time, anthropologist Lindy Warrell told two senior Ngarrindjeri activists, 'It would be nice if there was some women's business.' This anthropologist had been studying the women's business of the northern desert people. Within a few weeks, secret women's business emerged. Its key proponent was the Aboriginal activist, Doreen Kartinyeri. At one meeting in the embryonic stage of the invention, where men were in attendance, an aerial map was being considered. One of the men said, 'Doesn't that remind you of a woman's private parts?' I always wondered about this gem, since any ancient tradition would have required there to have been the presence of aeroplanes to examine an aerial view of the area. This obvious anomaly escaped the pathetic ABC but did not escape Dulcie Wilson, who said: I was dismayed that such people would cheapen and degrade Ngarrindjeri women and culture in way. How would our ancestors have known what an aerial view of Hindmarsh Island looked like Dulcie Wilson went on to talk of Doreen Kartinyeri, who was actually her second cousin. They both share the same great grandparents. Doreen Kartinyeri went to work at the Adelaide museum, where she was asked to record what she knew about Ngarrindjeri culture. In her own handwriting, she clearly said that she did not know anything about it, since she was raised in a children's home in Adelaide since the age of 10. But if she needed to know anything, she would pay Dulcie a visit. Kartinyeri's credibility was further damaged when she claimed, according to Dulcie: It was grandmother Sally who told her about women's business on Hindmarsh Island. When I pointed out to her that grandmother Sally was not a Ngarrindjeri woman but from another tribe on the west coast of South Australia, Doreen changed her story that it was really aunty Rosie who told her about women's business on Hindmarsh Island yet aunty Rosie's own step-daughter was one of the dissident women who gave evidence at the Royal Commission. She said she had never been told anything by her step-mother about such business and that she had a good relationship with her ... But creative anthropology ignored the implausibility of Kartinyeri and desperately struck out to make the facts fit the nonsense and give it the authority and presence of a study. An initial inquiry carried out by Professor Cheryl Saunders, which led to the 25-year ban of construction on Hindmarsh Island by Minister Tickner, omitted a piece of information that was absolutely ess-eqtial for any proper ministerial assessment of the claim. Saunders claimed that, in the secret oral tradition of the Ngarrindjeri women, the Hindmarsh Island region was crucial for the production of Ngarrindjeri people. The most authoritative account of the traditional culture, based on research carried out by Ronald and Catherine Berndt in the early 1940s, had specially noted that there was no evidence that Ngarrindjeri had any gender based secret domain. Saunders claimed this in her report that she had consulted Berndt's book, but she made no mention whatsoever of their finding, even though the book's index contains the entry 'secret-sacred issues, absence of. In the foreword of the same book by Professor Robert Tomkinson, this feature was also stressed. Elementary research techniques dictate that it is almost beyond comprehension that Professor Saunders would not have been aware of these matters. The inescapable conclusion is that she deliberately chose to ignore them. Saunders also noted that she did not have an anthropologist attached to her inquiry, but she made considerable use of a separate report by Dr Fergie, an anthropologist from the University of Adelaide appointed to work for the proponents of the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement. Saunders knew that Fergie had no expertise in Ngarrindjeri culture, and, indeed, at the time of the appointment Fergie had not even read the Berndt book. Fergie told the royal commission that her findings represented 'a significant anthropological discovery'. One would have thought that it was fairly basic that such discoveries, whether significant or not, be identified as such. But this was not done in Fergie's report. Thus the conspiracy firmed up and fiction assumed the respectability of an appearance of fact. When the dissident women spoke out in May last year, the major Christian churches, the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats, women's groups, green groups, Aboriginal groups and even overseas welfare groups publicly supported the conspirators. None had bothered to research the matter or speak to the dissident women. This is the part I found most offensive: nobody gave them the decency to even speak to them and deliver a bit of natural justice. The activist women who were part of the conspiracy had strong connections to the established Aboriginal power structures in Adelaide. Through the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement and ATSIC, they have had financial and legal support. They worked closely with the ABC to mount a campaign against the dissidents and the royal commission, so the ABC joined the conspiracy. The support of the fabricated claims was rock solid. It also helped Mr Tickner float his defence that the fabrication claims came from journalists, politicians, developers and complicit Aborigines for financial, political and racist aims. Stuart Littlemore, that paragon of media virtue, dedicated a whole program to run a facinorous line attempting to discredit three journalists who had investigated the fabrication. Every point Littlemore made in his program has been proved wrong by the royal commission, but he has never made an admission of this on his own program. Why did no ABC journalist, no church leader, no anthropologist, no Tickner aide or no environmentalist actually meet the dissident women to discuss the issues with them, assess their credibility and test their claim? This I find reprehensible. The two notable exceptions to the conspiracy, as far as the anthropologists were concerned, were Phillip Jones and Phillip Clarke, who knew the truth and made sure it came out and placed their careers on the line. Tickner would have portrayed these men as conservative red necks out to discredit Aboriginal culture. This was strange behaviour for people who had built careers on their understanding of that culture. Dr Clarke is married to a Ngarrindjeri woman and they have a child. It seems that the former Attorney-General did not speak to the dissident women either. Like so many others, he was drawn into the vortex with former Minister Tickner and the apparent alliance between the minister and the conspirators. In a censure motion that the former Attorney-General moved on 7 March 1995, and in inappropriately extravagant language for the first law officer of the Crown, he vilified the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), now the Minister for Defence. It is an almost delicious stroke of irony that in the penultimate paragraph of his speech on the censure motion he said, in referring to the member for Barker: He then has to answer why he completely disregarded the advice and opened the envelope which contained the material which was so sensitive to Aboriginal women. He and his entire staff knew about the entire background of the matter and the impact that it would have on Aboriginal women. But look at the truth of the matter. Now that it has been found to be a totai fabrication, a massive conspiracy, does the former Attorney General, Mr Lavarch, have any idea the impact of what he said had on the dissident women? Has he apologised to Doreen Wilson and her brave comrades for his being so insensitive to the Aboriginal women who were being truthful and faithful to their Ngarrindjeri origins? It is interesting to quote Dulcie Wilson where she pertinently observes: I read an article a few months ago which referred to the views of Marcia Langton, an Aboriginal activist with whom I don't always agree; although on this occasion, I agree with her wholeheartedly. She complained about those Australian people who will not criticise or contradict Aboriginal people in any educated discussion. Such patronising behaviour, she says, should be condemned for it is treating Aboriginal people like children on the assumption that they cannot take criticism and lack the same intellectual and emotional capacity as other human beings. I respectfully endorse those sentiments. It has saddened me over the years to see judges, magistrates and prosecutors treating Aboriginal witnesses and accused Aboriginals in this way. I regret to say that I myself have probably been guilty of this from time to time. Dulcie Wilson goes on to speak about the future of Aboriginal affairs in this country, given the fact that Aboriginal activists call the tune and expect the rest to dance to it. They have the power and authority of ATSIC behind them. She continues: I see similarities between the Aboriginal situation in this country and what is happening in third world countries. Billions of dollars are poured into various Aboriginal projects and organisations with very little return and very little accountability. The ""Aboriginal industry"", for that is precisely what it is, is one of the most sought after industries to be employed in today by both Aboriginal and nonAboriginal people. Huge sums of money are being allocated to that industry ensuring long-term employment and excellent financial remuneration for all concerned. This statement highlights the ill-directed policies towards Aboriginals in this country. These have produced a monolithic bureaucracy like ATSIC, with the chief executive on a salary package in excess of $200,000, but it continues to fail miserably to improve the lot of Aborigines and leaves the Torres Strait Islanders out in the cold. One of the most disgraceful claims in this saga was that made by the moderator of the Uniting Church in South Australia. The moderator said: I have conveyed my Willingness to meet Mrs Dulcie Wilson at any time she wishes to have an interview with me. She goes on to say: Our hope for Dulcie Wilson and others who share her dilemma is that she will know God's love for Aboriginal people and discover fully the richness for them and their Aboriginal culture. The hide of this senior church figure to refer to the honesty and decency of Dulcie, who had nothing to gain by telling the truth, as equating the telling of the truth to being in a dilemma-and this when Dulcie was an active member of the Uniting Church. Not unnaturally, Dulcie Wilson was appalled by this. At no time had any person conveyed the moderator's wishes to speak with Dulcie Wilson, but the last sentence left her speechless. She said: The very reason that I stood up to be counted was because of my love and concern for the Ngarrindjeri people who were being manipulated not only by some of their own key people but by other groups such as the CFMEU, Greenpeace and some other conservationists, the Friends of Hindmarsh Island and various others. Today I am proud of the dissident women who had the courage to tell the truth, against all odds, for secret women's business was indeed proved by the Royal Commission to be fabricated. Unfortunately, the anthropologists in favour of the proponents' position have continued to make extraordinary claims in order to justify their position. I refer honourable members to an article written by Mr Ron Brunton in relation to that particular mat._ Where does this leave the real issues confronting the Aboriginal people of Australia and the Torres Strait Islanders living in the Torres Strait and those living on the mainland? It yet again raises the question of whether ATSIC can continue to justify its existence. More than $4 million has been wasted in relation to this farce. The opposition, not content with this waste of money, seems to be saying that there should be yet another inquiry. This is absurd. When are the crucial issues affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders going to be addressed? When are we going to fulfil our obligations to those disadvantaged and culturally repressed people? The clear picture that emerged to me from a recent visit to the Torres Strait Islands was that Torres Strait Islanders would, through their island councils, prefer to deal directly with government rather than through ATSIC and the Torres Strait Regional Authority. As one of them pointed out, echoing the words of Senator Herron: We don't want a trickle coming out of the fire hose after it has been through all the commissions and bureaucracies before the money gets to us. Having observed the obscenity of 35 barristers appearing in the High Court in the recent Waanyi case, and estimating the cost of those barristers, together with their instructing solicitors, as well in excess of $1 million, I say again that there is a cry for help out there amongst Aboriginal people and there is a cry for help amongst Torres Strait Islander peopie. Are we, as legislators, in the best position to heed those cries or are we unfortunately becoming bogged down in the mire of bureaucracy and ineptitude? In relation to the Torres Strait Islanders, it not now their time to be recognised as completely independent ethnic group, yet Australians nonetheless? Why are they lumped together with Aboriginal people? Likewise, why are Aboriginal people not expired) recognised as a separate individual ethnic group of people? Why are they lumped I together with Torres Strait Islanders? It insulting and patronising in the extreme to lump them together. Does this not recognise and perpetuate the continual errors that Australians make in the area of administration for policies for indigenous Australians? Why can't we look seriously at real autonomy for these people of the Torres Strait? I think would be a tremendous thing for Torres Strait Islanders to be given a goal to aspire develop real autonomy. In my recent visit to the Torres Strait Islands I made the following note about now. autonomy: the evolution of ultimate autonomy for the Torres Strait comes from individual autonomy as per each island, for with island autonomy comes economic autonomy, which will encourage the return home from the mainland of Torres Strait Islanders. With treatment.' economic autonomy comes the capacity to integrate ideas with other islands. With the integration of other ideas with other islands comes real autonomy-that is, the be an independent territory capable of existing as a governing territory for the peace, good order and good government of the whole the relevant Torres Strait islands and their inhabitants. Likewise, I completely endorse views that there should be bottom end funding as far Aboriginal communities are concerned. For many people out there self-interest unfortuthe nately does prevail-those who only wish see the never-ending bucket of money supply for metaphysical issues that are not advancing the standards of health, education, job training and employment opportunities for any Abodo riginal or Torres Strait Islander and along way perpetuating a myth of reconciliation when there can be no reconciliation under the present entrenched bureaucracies. This bill indicates that the government, along with the people of Australia, have had is enough of what has been going on. In my a view, we should hail it as a breakthrough in this area. We should belatedly hail Bertha Gollan, Dorothy Wilson and Dulcie Wilson as heroines of the Ngarrindjeri people. (Time",113
260,Mr ALBANESE,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"Grayndler) (6.16 p.m.)am disappointed that, with the government's is last speaker on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge so Bill, we have come down to the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) outlining his conspiracy theory. Unfortunately, he left out the Communists under his bed, but everyone else was in on this grand conspiracy to stop the Hindmarsh Island Bridge going ahead. It it is interesting that that view has been put forward before the House this afternoon to, to because we all know-and the coalition knows-that there is nothing to stop the Hindmarsh Island Bridge going ahead right This is just a publicity stunt. It is part of the government's campaign of code against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country. It is part of a code which says, 'We'll single them out for special But it will not be special treatment in terms of lifting up the most discriminated group in our society. It is not about that; it is a different sort of code. It is about applying capacity to two sets of standards. The member for Dickson had the hide to raise the fact that the head of ATSIC is on of $200,000 a year. Effectively, she is the equivalent of a departmental head. Really! This week we have had questions to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) about the head as of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, who is known in my stated as 'Max Axe', who is on over $200,000 and to picking up 50 grand for a part-time job as chair of a committee in Victoria, appointed by the Victorian government. That is okay because he is part of the establishment! We not talk about excessive salaries in the the bureaucracy there. We do not talk about how much those people are earning. We have the Prime Minister standing up and saying, 'Oh, well, he can't get his super.' Then we had him coming into the House and saying, 'Well, he can get a bit of his super but he can't get all of it.' We continually hear two standards being applied on the basis of race by this government. We have already indicated that the opposition believes that this piece of legislation is completely unnecessary. If you want to achieve the coalition's objective of getting the bridge built, whatever the cost, it simply can go ahead. It is just a stunt to demonstrate to developers that they can now feel relaxed and comfortable about the prospect of future projects without having to worry about minor details such as the protection of significant Aboriginal sites. We have already spoken about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. It is very clear that the minister has discretionary power. Elizabeth Evatt noted in her review of that act: The Minister can protect the area or site by making a declaration. This is a discretionary power. Even if the area is significant according to Aboriginal tradition, the Minister has to consider the report and take account of all interests, before deciding whether or not to make a declaration to protect area or site. There is no right to a declaration protection. What is the point of this act before the House now? The government clearly has the numbers; it clearly has an overwhelming majority in the House of Representatives. The basis of putting this bill forward can be viewed only as being an ideological one. Last night the person who wrote the legislation, the former minister, Clyde Holding, indicated very clearly the history of the bill to this House. The history of the bill was that the minister did have discretion. Unfortunately, this is a stunt, but it is a stunt at the expense of the Ngarrindjeri people of South Australia. The coalition has a shameful record in relation to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge issue and with this bill is further demonstrating their commitment to disenfranchising indigenous people in this country. With this bill the Ngarrindjeri will suffer the brunt of coalition ideology, which shows no respect to the spiritual beliefs of the original peoples of this nation. The coalition is not even prepared to investigate for themselves whether or not there should be protection for the site. They are introducing this legislation to override the Commonwealth Heritage Protection Act in one specific case so that they can ensure they get the result they want. Surely the job of Senator Herron as Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs should be to protect Aboriginal heritage, not to deliberately set out to undermine it and have it destroyed. Throughout this entire affair the coalition has shown its ideological motivation again and again. I was interested to - ld, for example, a press release from the Minister for Defence, the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), last month in which he attempted to attack my colleague, the member for Banks (Mr Melham), about the opposition's position on this issue. Because it is the fashion, all the polls that the government is doing are showing that there is a political incentive to get stuck into Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people-that it is popular out there. The member for Banks has not walked away from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander the people; the Labor Party will not be walking of away either. I am proud to be associated with the member for Banks in his stance on this and on other issues. Members will no doubt recall that the member for Barker was forced to resign from the front bench last year over his involvement in copying and distributing information about the secret spiritual beliefs of Ngarrindjeri people. What a disgraceful affair that was. It is this kind of hypocrisy which marks the government's approach to indigenous affairs. The action of the South Australian Liberal government in staging the farce of a royal commission into the spiritual beliefs of a community of indigenous women, at great expense to the taxpayer, was shameful. In what other community has there been an inquiry into the community'S spiritual beliefs? What other one? Over there you have got a mob called the Lyons Forum who have a particular spiritual belief. You can imagine the reaction of people like the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) or the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) if we said, 'We're going to have a royal commission into your beliefs; into whether you can prove the Holy Trinity exists.' What if we said, 'We're going to have a royal commission into Islam,' or into any other religious or spiritual belief? It simply has not happened. There would be outrage if anyone suggested it. But, for the indigenous people of this country, it is fair game, open slather. You can accuse them of whatever you like. It is expected that it is all part of making that community accountable. Once again we see that the standard that is expected of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is a different one from that which is expected of those who have arrived in Australia, bringing their spiritual beliefs, in the last 200 years. No other section of our society has to endure the contempt for its religious beliefs that has been shown by the coalition to indigenous people. Last year, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Michael Dodson, spoke about the Liberal Party's obsession with Hindmarsh Island when he said: The right to religious freedom and respect for spiritual beliefs lies at the heart of human rights. is a right which all Australians are obliged to respect, and all Australians entitled to enjoy. And that principle holds, irrespective of whose beliefs are at issue, or on what basis those beliefs are held. What we have in [the South Australian] royal commission is the abuse of the human rights of Aboriginal people masquerading as lofty legal procedure. Pull off the mask and what you see is nothing short of state sanctioned racism. Pull off the mask and what is revealed is a royal commission which has been called at the behest of a political party with its nose out of joint. Take note of this. It is not the Labor Party he is talking about; it is the current government. He went on to say: A political party with its nose out of joint, a media industry desperate to drum up a scandal, and worse of all, that element of Australian society still determined to invalidate indigenous cultures and annihilate indigenous peoples. I find it increasingly difficult not to be cynical about the fine rhetoric of cultural diversity. We can freely sing our songs and tell our storiesespecially if those songs and stories can be marketed for a tidy profit. But the moment that the protection of those songs and stories may come into conflict with the economic interests of non-indigenous society, we are told they have no place. It is both astonishing and contemptible that in this [international year of tolerance] the right to practice one's religion and freely hold one's beliefs can be called before a royal commission. A report by Justice Jane Mathews was tabled by the current Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) in the Senate in September this year. In it, Justice Mathews referred to the sincerity of the applicants. She said: It is necessary as a preliminary matter to assess the applicants' sincerity when they say that the Hindmarsh Island area is significant for them, particularly as the dissident women in the royal commission generally disclaimed any knowledge of the island as a significant place. I must say that in general I was satisfied of the genuineness of most of the people who made oral submissions to me when they asserted the significance of this area to them. Justice Mathews went on to talk about the documentation which had been placed before the royal commission by Elizabeth-BettyFisher, who was an amateur historian. Mrs Fisher indicated to the commission that she had been told of the existence of women's business at Hindmarsh Island in the late 1960s It by a Ngarrindjeri elder, Rebecca Wilson. Mrs Wilson is now deceased, and so is obviously unable to forward any evidence. This report actually looked at the validity of the notes that were made at the time-that is, in the I 960s-by Elizabeth Fisher. The report tabled by Senator Herron in the Senate in September says: Mrs Fisher's original notes were included with the applicants' representation. At a time when it appeared that the issue of 'women's business' was still a live one, I took the step of submitting this material for scientific analysis in order to determine its age. Had the notes been written in pen, the ink could readily have been dated. However pencil is not susceptible of dating, so it was only the paper which was analysed. The analysis proved to be a time consuming affair. It was not until the last weeks of the reporting process that the results came to hand. These are set out in Appendix 12 to this Report. As the Minister will see, the results generally favour Mrs Fisher's account that she wrote these notes in the late 1960s or early 1970s. One of the two groups of pages is said to date back to at least the early 1970s. The other set was less easy to date and the findings are inconclusive. Nevertheless it appears not to be of recent origin. So I say to the member for Dickson that, when he speaks about facts being put before the parliament in this debate, there is one which has not been refuted by the other side. This bill really is typical of the coalition's approach to indigenous affairs. It is no wonder that someone with views like Pauline Hanson's could find themselves preselected by the Liberal Party. The member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), I am sure, will be voting with the government on this issue because the ... whipping up of racial hatred has been suptraditional ported, in code, by some on the other side, either by their failure to speak out against discrimination those views or by the preaching of code by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in seeking to deny Australia's history and in seeking to allege that somehow Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders did not have it all that bad and that the education system is to preaching the facts that occurred with the invasion of this country more than 200 years ago. To introduce a bill which is specifically designed to override the existing legal rights of a particular community, rights to which other Australians are entitled, and to do the way in which it has been clearly put before this parliament, this legislation not being necessary for the Hindmarsh Island Bridge to go ahead, it is little wonder that see this attack as purely ideological. I am very happy to be associated with the former minister, Robert Tickner-and we can debate which ministers' decisions were or wrong-because he worked for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders with nothing but great motivation, nothing but tions and nothing but hard work in a portfolio which no-one gets any thanks for. To suggest, as those on the other side have, that he had some ulterior motive in putting this forward and in his actions on Hindmarsh Island Bridge really is a disgrace. It is just appalling. not step away from my association with shadow Robert Tickner as a minister and as someone whom I am pleased to call a friend. It is no accident that since 2 March have seen racial intolerance increasing in society. Compare the actions or the silence of the current Prime Minister with the actions of the former Prime Minister. At the same time in his prime ministership, when this Prime Minister is talking about not talking about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history, as if everything was okay, Paul Keating was giving a speech at Redfern, the greatest speech on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs ever given by an Australian leader. In it he acknowledged the past-he did not run away from it-and he said: we took the traditional lands and smashed the way of life; we brought the diseases and the alcohol; we committed the murders; we took the children from their mothers?""e practised and exclusion. It was our ignorance and our prejudice and our failure to imagine these things being done to us. With some noble exceptions we failed to make the most basic human response and enter into their hearts and minds. We failed to ask: How would I blame for feel if this were done to me? With the bill before the House today, I ask: would the government have the courage to move a bill such as this-talking about spiritual beliefs being rubbish, the sorts of speeches that they have given-against the all Christian community, against the Islamic it in community, against the Hindu community or against any other section of our society? If there were an attempt to do this against the Christian community, all of us on this side we would have the same view we have on this issue, but we would be joined by those on the other side because it would be an outrage. It is not a legal case. Spiritual beliefs are not right something which you can simply cast an objective legal view over. That is not the way it works, and I suggest that it should not have the best intenworked in this case. Not only is this bill unnecessary to allow the building of Hindmarsh Island Bridge; it demonstrates the government's attitude, which has been pretty poor to date and shows no signs of improving in the near future. If it is I do the case that the amendments moved by the minister saying that the Racial Discrimination Act should not be overridden by the bill are unnecessary, then vote for those we amendments. This is your chance to prove this how fair dinkum you are. At worse, it is unnecessary. That is your argument. But there has been no argument that it should not go ahead. (Time expired).",118
261,Mr TUCKEY,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"I would like the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) to stay in the parliament for five minutes, if he would, because I would like to give him a little bit of history in regard to the matters that he has raised in his speech, and I do so from a very authoritative work. Firstly, I want to speak to him in answer to his statements that this legislation is not necessary. He used words such as 'giving Aboriginal people their legal rights'. This is not about people's legal rights so much as it is about people's rights to litigate. Unfortunately, as we stand here today, I have read newspaper reports referring to the legal costs that have been involved in this case. As I see it, the costs of paying the legal profession in this matter now exceed the cost of building the bridge. The purpose of this legislation is simply to do one thing: to stop the cash flow of taxpayers' money to lawyers. You mentioned that the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) has given us the benefit of his legal knowledge when he said that he could fix it. I hope on all occasions that he would be prepared and that his firm Holding Redlich, or whatever it was called, would be prepared to take both sides of any future action so that the taxpayers at least are not obliged to meet the costs on both sides, which, as I say, now exceed the cost of the bridge. This is really what I wanted the member for Grayndler to listen to for a minute. I was interested in the member's total defence of people's right to their spiritual beliefs, and I see that the shadow minister agrees. I just want to acquaint him with a little bit of history. My folks have lived in Western Australia since the first ships and they became seafaring people. I have often said that, if my grandfather had not died when my dad was six months old, I would probably be the secretary of the Seamens Union. As it so happened, I got divorced a bit from that. Having made that rather light-hearted comment, I want to come to a very serious thing. I happen to be Charles Wilson Tuckey and my great-grandfather, Charles Tuckey, rescued two survivors of a shipwreck in 1857. It was the shipwreck of the barque Stefano, which had come out of Yugoslavia and was taking coal to Hong Kong. It was shipwrecked on the North West Cape. Ten people got ashore, eight perished and the Aboriginal people, a tribe living in that area, picked up the last two, probably because that was all they could feed. And I make that as a statement of view and nothing else. They looked after these two people. The tribe knew something that the survivors did not know, that once a year my great-grandfather, on his return from Broome where he used to sail for pearling, would drop in there and drop off his surplus stores to this tribe. They knew that the time would come when he would come in and they could transfer these two Yugoslavs, one of whom was the son of the shipowning family and who later migrated to America. Anyhow, they were duly rescued and they were taken to Fremantle, got back to their native country and got hold of the village priest; and they wrote in great detail the story of their time on the cape with these Aboriginal people. The story was so authentic that, when a grandson of the shipwrecked person, now in his 80s, visited Western Australia some time ago with the decision to convert these detailed notes into a book which he called The wreck of the barque Stefano-and I have the cover sheet here-we sent him up there to this pastoral property. He said, 'If we go in here and up there according to my grandfather's notes, we will actually find a small well', and the pastoralist said, 'No well there, mate.' And they walked the distance and they found the well. I say all of that because I want to establish the authenticity of what I am going to read to you. But further, I want to say something. This is not a story about Aboriginal people. It is about two white shipwrecked men. But this is just part of the story, quoted in the first case. It tells us: I was jolted out of my meditation . . . Loud, dolorous cries arose from the midst of the tribethe cries of a poor mother who for the past few days had been watching over her sick child. The child died. It continues: Meanwhile, funeral preparations were progressing. The parents of the dead child, in what I suspect was a gesture of grief or sacrifice, threw into the sea the fish they had saved from the precious catch. Nearby, a huge fire was started and it quickly became a deep bed of glowing coals. Somehow, I sensed what was about to happen even though not a word was spoken. The child's corpse was laid atop the glowing coals. All of us gathered around the pyre. Quickly and mysteriously, I realised that this was not to be a cremation. The young one was being roasted for a gruesome meal. It began with the first portion being offered to the father who had gone alone to the top of a nearby hill. The mother was served next as we all sat around the dying embers. Then everyone else was served until the small corpse was completely consumed. After the feast, the bones were gathered with a semblance of religious ritual and devotion. I found myself participating in the ceremony without the slightest hesitation or any thought of impropriety. What I am about to say is that, when we start being so singular as to say that the religions of the past must be respected, of course they cannot. We could not possibly condone that. I am not criticising it. It was their religion and it was not their mythology. It was their genuine religion. So I ask people who stand up and make those sorts of generalisations to think again. And I can take you to other examples that have been brought to my attention by mission people. We talk of the stolen children, yet many of the old mission people told me that they frequently took the girls of the tribe to prevent infanticide because there were too many girls. Again, we know that is still practised in parts of the world. I do not stand here to criticise it, but I say to you that you cannot generalise and stand up and say, as the member for Grayndler has just done, that people have an unfettered right to practise their religious beliefs--certainly not as they reside in culture. Let me also ask, in terms of all this, that people start to separate mythology and culture. I want to address that at the moment, when in fact I proposed to address it later in my speech. Surely, there is mythology but, when it comes to the conduct of business of government, it is up to ministers, in particular when they are called upon to make decisions which have a very substantial effect on other individuals-also Australians, also protected by the Racial Discrimination Act-to ensure that those people get justice and that mythology is not allowed to override common and current scientific information. When the whole Hindmarsh Island thing blew up-whether there was a belief or otherwise is another matter, but the royal commission said there was a fabrication-one would have thought that the ministerwhether he was prepared to open those sealed envelopes is another matter as<siwould have taken account of some of the matters discussed in the press. What were those matters? A previous member made some comment on this. There was a reference to the shape of the island and its relationship with a woman's anatomy. We are not talking about today's circumstances; we are talking about culture. Where in the culture of Aboriginal people was cartography? Where was it? They, unfortunately, lacked even a written language. They were not cartographers. They did not have aeroplanes to do aerial photography. They would not have had any idea about the shape of that island 200 years ago. By the way, the situation I described in that other book was in 1857. The reality is that they would not have known. So how can that be part of their culture? There was also a suggestion that the Aboriginal women had a link with the island because they went over there to abort babies. I lived in the town of Carnarvon from 1958 to 1980 as both a hotel keeper and a local government person in various capacities, including shire president, and one-third of that town's population were of Aboriginal descent. During the time. I was there we went to the camps on all the adjoining pastoral properties. In all of my long connection with Aboriginals I was never once aware of an Aboriginal woman even seeking an abortion. The Aboriginal women became pregnant and did not seek abortions. To suggest that they did that because a white man was involved is patently ridiculous. I am yet to be told how they got to the island because the making and using of boats was something that frequently even river people did not do--though sometimes they did. The reality is that these tions, but they get worse. They said, 'If you build this bridge, all our women will cease to be able to conceive.' Modem scientific evidence says that could not be so. Consequently, it is silly. You cannot as a government or a parliament be convinced by these matters in this regard. The member for Grayndler also made the point that we have never had a royal commission into a religion. I think we had one into Scientology. Tell me it was not a religion-I think the royal commission said that. Mr Albanese-It's not.",122
262,Mr TUCKEY,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"Thank you. You have just denied a certain group of people their beliefs. Mr Albanese-No, no.",124
263,Mr TUCKEY,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"Yes, you have. That is just the point you make. This is why it is so silly. It is the same as this mythology which has been quoted in substantiating this case that convinced a minister to send a group of honest Australian people broke. We still have around the world a group of people known as the Flat Earth Society. I can concede them their beliefs, but they better not try to stop me from flying around the world in an aeroplane. They should not stand in the way of building airports. One might wonder when some minister is going to ban the construction of a new airport on the grounds that the Flat Earth Society suggests that the earth is flat and that, if planes take off from that airport, they will end up disappearing. When Robert Tickner was called into a public works project in South Australia, he allowed himself to be influenced by very silly propositions. I think he ignored the Racial Discrimination Act because his responsibility as a minister was to apply it fairly-in other words, not discriminate for any people of any race. We make a lot of the Racial Discrimination Act in these debates. We talk about it and ignore its provisions. As we know, the act is only a very brief piece of legislation, but attached to it is the United Nations convention, which forms part of the act. Article 1, paragraph 4, especially prohibits positive discrimination with some pretty tight condiare silly proposi- tions. It says: Special measures taken for the sole purpose of securing adequate advancement of certain racial or ethnic groups or individuals requiring such protection as may be necessary in order to ensure such groups or individuals equal enjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms shall not be deemed racial discrimination, provided, however, that such measures do not, as a consequence, lead to the maintenance of separate rights for different racial groups and that they shall not be continued after the objectives for which they were taken have been achieved. We have a heritage act. We have substantial legislation to protect Australia's heritage. Why then do we need an Aboriginal heritage act, other than to make money for lawyers? Why can the courts not deal with those matters as heritage matters? Of course there are items, things on the record, property, caves and other things that are of great significance, but even those issues should be taken in proper context. It is ridiculous for us to suggest that everything that some Aboriginal person says is right is right. Although Mr Dodson is extremely well paid by the government to represent Aboriginal interests, when he stood for election to ATSIC, as I recollect, he got less than 20 votes. The reality is that he is not seen by people at the grassroots of the Aboriginal community as being one who supports their views. I just want to repeat that the facts of life are that if we were to entrench every aspect of Aboriginal culture, heritage and religion we would be having some royal commissions all right. But in the case of the Hindmarsh Island matter the realities are that there is a lot of credit to be given to the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan). The member for Barker saw his responsibility as representing the interests of all the people in his electorate, not just a very special interest group which, from all the evidence we have seen, had one agenda. It was not an agenda to protect Aboriginal interests; they had taken the briefs from some people who were opposed to a public works development. The point has been made by some speakers that those women who gave all the original evidence refused point blank, on some moral platform, to attend the royal commission. I have to say that they knew very well that if they went there and restated the sorts of issues they had put up, they would have had a great chance of being charged with perjury. The royal commissioner quite properly found the whole process a fabrication. But the point I want to make about this is the grave damage that is done by processes of this nature to the genuine needs of Aboriginal people. It is always a fact that my time seems to escape very quickly-and that is a great pity. I wish we were not having this debate. I wish Hindmarsh Bridge was built and the Chapmans were profiting from it and people were able to buy nice blocks of land and enjoy the river view because I would like to be talking about what the Australian told us on 30 October when it talked about Pat 0' Shane's speech on black family violence and our inability to address that, along with the glaucoma, the alcoholism and the substance abuse. The Australian, in its editorial, says: There is compelling evidence to suggest that domestic violence and physical and sexual abuse of children is widespread among Aboriginal communities but public acknowledgment of this is rare ... There is other evidence the problem needs urgent attention. Statistics from the Northern Territory and the Kimberley region suggest that Aboriginal women are roughly 33 times more likely to die as a result of domestic violence than other Australians. The Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care has estimated up to 50 per cent of Aboriginal children are victims of family violence. And the article goes on. They are the issues for us. We still have failed to address them as a parliament and as a past government. I think there are some intentions now to try to get to those issues but we are still arguing over a bridge on the basis of what people have put forward, people who live an urban lifestyle today. Let me say that there are a few things that really start to annoy me. Fancy instituting into Aboriginal culture the word 'business'. They never did business; they were self-supporting groups. They did not trade to any extent. But all of a sudden that is a nice catchy word that the European community understandwomen's business. Let me tell you something from all my knowledge of them: women were not consulted on very much and they did not have too many secrets. It was a silly proposition and a silly proposition for a minister to use a law in the way he did. But what was the great achievement of all of that? You turned tens of thousands, if not millions, of Australians against Aboriginal people because the general population is not so silly. They know that bui1'dtng a bridge will not stop women having babies; they know that a minister, as the judge eventually told him, must open the evidence before making a decision. In the end, they took it out on the minister and his electorate and, more importantly, we hear all these other issues that are running around today. It is totally silly. When one reads the entire book The Wreck of the Barque Stefano one will get a great idea of Aboriginal life in 1857 in a remote area. I can tell you that it was very tough and very difficult, and they lived on the verge of starvation. We have given them alcoholism and some things I regret but the reality is that we have got to be a bit more sensible. (Time expired)",124
264,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (6.56 p.m.)I will sum up on the second reading. The Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill is a piece of legislation that I am carrying for the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) who clearly is in another place. I will make my comments brief and I will make a few personal comments, too. This legislation, almost by its nature, is difficult legislation because what we are talking about is the interface between an indigenous culture and beliefs, and modem society. I do know something about the act. I have watched it over a number of years and every occasion on which it has been used has been contentious. I do not believe the act is working in anybody's interest. There are times when this act needs to be used and it is clearly to the benefit of Aboriginal people. In the end, Aboriginal people have the right to have their beliefs and, in the end, broader Australian society has to say, 'Are we prepared to say that Aboriginal culture means something?' The first occasion on which it was used was on the Alice Springs dam. I have to say I think that was a legitimate use. I was shadow minister at the time and provided very little criticism. There was culture that was in danger-and that dam did not go ahead. The second case in which it was used was at Broome where there was a walking track between two sites that were used for initiation and which were still in current use. Some of my colleagues would disagree with me but my view was that it was used legitimately then. This has been very difficult and very painful and has done the whole issue of Aboriginal heritage no assistance. In the end, you either take the position that any Aboriginal person has the right to make any claim whatsoever at any time without any challenge, even if that claim is not backed up by other Aboriginal people, even if there is no historical precedent backing it up; or you say that somehow these claims must be contestable. I do not see anything in between those two positions. In the case of Alice Springs and that of Broome, they were contestable. There was independent evidence. There were things that one could look at whereby one could say, 'Okay, there's some way of looking at this and some way of saying that it's probably fair and reasonable.' Where this has been different and where it has been unique is that, in its use of the act, it has been completely incontestable. In the end, I do not think society is prepared to accept a situation whereby any person can make any claim whatsoever, without any corroborating evidence. In the end, the consequences of that would be catastrophic. I think this whole episode has probably made the Australian public less tolerant of the notion of Aboriginal culture and its preservation than would have been otherwise. I have to say I am very saddened by this whole process. The shadow minister has moved some amendments about which I think I should just put a couple of things on the record-and in this I am indebted to the minister who has given me advice on this matter. The government's legal advice is that the bill is consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. We have provided copies of this advice to the opposition on an in-confidence basis. Consequently, the government sees no need for the opposition's amendment. If the amendment were totally benign, perhaps we could look at it differently. But our first piece of advice is that agreeing to this amendment would provide grounds for a legal challenge which would have negligible chance of success and which would add further delay in terms of time and further waste of money in this case. The second thing that we are advised is that this is a precedent that has not been set and would provide a precedent for other legislation. Thirdly, if we agreed to the amendment, and in the unlikely event that our advice was incorrect and the bill was in fact in breach of the RDA, then the bill would be ineffective to close off a section 10 process in relation to Hindmarsh Island and the minister would once again have to appoint a reporter. This would only delay the whole process. This saga has to be brought to an end once and for all. The legal advice that the government has is that this is the best way to do it. So, consistent with what we have said previously, the bill will do this. We have been advised that it is consistent with the RDA. In the end, we would hope that it would be supported by the opposition if they are serious about ending this whole saga. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Melham's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided. [7.08 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr G.B. Neh!)

265,Mr MELHAM,PAIRS,"Last night I made the comment in my speech on the second reading that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996 is the bill we don't have to have. All of the debate during the second reading speech confirms that is the case. The government has not been able to refute the claims that I made during my speech on the second reading that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) has absolute discretion. There is no protection order in existence and there is nothing stopping this bridge from proceeding. The introduction of this legislation can fairly be described as the Ian MCLachlan payback bill. It should not be the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996; it should be the Ian MCLachlan payback bill. That is the real title that should be given to this bill. This bill should not be allowed a commencement date. It would be a shameful thing if there is a Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill on the statute books at the time of the Olympics. It is not necessary. This bill needs to be trashed by the government. There is no doubt that there are the numbers in the House to pass this bill. It is questionable whether there will be the numbers in the Senate. We say that there should be no commencement date for this bill. It should not receive royal assent. There is plenty of time, between the time that this House and the Senate consider the bill, for the minister to follow due process. The former minister for Aboriginal affairs, Robert Tickner, was attacked over his handling of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair. He attempted to follow due process. He was litigated against. What is the first act of this government with this new Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs? They introduce the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill that shows they have no confidence in the minister following due process. The new minister has the benefit of a number of Federal Court decisions and a number of High Court decisions. That is why this bill is not necessary. That is why the title of this bill really should not be the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996. This bill should not have a commencement date. One reason it should not receive royal assent is that it could be seen to favour side over the other. There is no need for parliament to take sides on this debate. The previous minister was criticised sides. The same argument can be levelled against the current government. What should happen is that the current minister should follow due process and he should adjudicate accordingly in exercising his discretion. If does that, the law is clear. His discretion cannot be challenged successfully in the court. I will talk about RDA matters when sidering the amendment that I will later. This bill sends the wrong message to the community. Last week we had bipartisan support for a motion to do with race relations. I said then in that debate that the Racial Discrimination Act was paramount. We do to not need the uttering of words; we need action. We need the government and the opposition banding together in a constructive fashion. That is what is so sad about a bill such as this going on the statute books. The government needs to do its homework. It has the benefit of Federal Court decisions now. It will have the cooperation of the opposition. It does not need this legislation allow the bridge to proceed. I find this legislation offensive in the extreme. If, as other speakers on our side have said, this was an attack on Christian beliefs, the Lyons Forum would be outraged. Instead, they have led the charge on this. That is why we say there should be no commencement date on this bill. That is why we say there should be no Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill. Let the minister follow due process and exercise his discretion accordingly. He can do it much quicker than the proposal-and that sends the right message. We want to put an end to this saga. We do not want division and hatred. (Time expired)",127
266,Mr KERR,PAIRS,"The truth is that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill is totally unnecessary. Its true purpose is to make a political point and to identify that political point with some suggestion that there was a failing in the previous government. In truth, what is being sought is a blame shifting exercise. There is no plausible reason to do this other than the political intention of the one government to pursue and to create a this bogeyman and to blame that bogeyman for its own failure to act decisively and to put this for taking matter behind us. It is true that the genesis of this matter was most unfortunate. I do not believe that that course of events did anything more than to reveal that Robert Tickner, a minister of great he goodwill and compassion, was confronted by a circumstance which he found difficult to resolve in a manner which made certain that conhe took into account all the very complex be moving issues that came before him. In doing so, there is no doubt, however, that the process was unduly prolonged, but what we know now is sufficient to enable us to put this behind us. The failure of the government do this-instead, it came before this parliament with quite unnecessary legislation--can only really be sourced home to the fact that they wish to make a political point. It is most unfortunate they are making a political point in an environment where people are already less than moderate in some of their expressions about this issue. The truth is we know now that on the public record, as to a result of various court cases and proceedings, there is sufficient material for the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) to be able to exercise a discretion either to proceed directly to a decision to allow the bridge to proceed or, should he wish to use a belt and braces approach, to commission a very short process to give him a formal report and then proceed to allowing the bridge to be built. Either course is open to him. However, legislation is being brought before the parliament which, on the government's own advice-as represented by the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander Affairs previously-is drafted in such a way that it will not accept a proposal by the opposition that would ensure that transparently on its face it is in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act. The government asserts that its own legal opinion is to the effect that this bill does violate the Racial Discrimination Act, yet does not have confidence in its own legal advice so that it will accept an opposition amendment which will confirm that. The whole point of this, however, is that it ought not get to this stage. We are debating an issue, again in a partisan and an unnecesand sary way, which we ought put behind us collectively and avoid this blame and tion of guilt as to whose fault it was, when truth the whole interest of this parliament should be to see that the issue is resolved a way which puts the interests of Aboriginal people and the interests of the community a whole at the front and does not subject it these kinds of quite unnecessary processes. So the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) is absolutely right in what he says. We hold advice that says this legislation is unnecessary. The minister can proceed directthe ly to the course the government wishes pursue. The minister does have a power under the act as its exists, but he chooses not to exercise it. The government has chosen to come to this parliament, and it is an abuse this parliamentary process to do so. The title of the bill should be the 'Hindmarsh Island (Shifting of Blame) Bill' where the government is trying, through this political device, to simply make a political point at expense of the time of this parliament and the possible violation of the commitment of the parliament and both sides of it to the utmost paramountcy of the Racial Discrimination Act.",128
267,Mr HOLDING,PAIRS,"I just want to enter quickly into this debate on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill. I do not want to delay the House. Last night I pointed out the damage this government by this foolish action, this unnecessary action, this unnecessary piece of legislation, was doing not to the parliament but to the and Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator HelJ<j1). In the first period of his ministry, as I have already said on a number of occasions, in the not most difficult and complex portfolio that exists in this government, it is important for the minister to establish the confidence of the not indigenous people of this country. From time it to time, he will have to make decisions which will not be popular decisions. You cannot run this portfolio on the basis of being loved by all. When he was in a situation where all he had to do was exercise his own discretionthe exercise of that discretion could have meant this bridge could have been up and on asserits way now-what was the government's in reaction? The government's reaction was to bring in legislation which takes the power in away from the minister and creates a situation where Aboriginal people around Australiaas and word travels quickly through that comto munity-are able to say in respect of one area of land which is important to them, the Boobera Lagoon, that the minister has had a report sitting on his desk since 22 April and still has not processed it. The complexity of matter was dealt with by the honourable to member for Banks (Mr Melham). The minister still has not been dealt with it. So what is the message for Aboriginal leadership in Australia? Some of those leaders of have already made some pretty heavy comtrue ments about this minister. What is the message this government delivers to Aboriginal people, whether they are in Uluru, Kakadu, Western Australia or South Australia? For the a cheap, tawdry, political exercise, the message they are sending out is this: we want you to know we don't have any confidence in this minister. We don't believe you can really trust him to exercise his discretion. We don't think he has the capacity or necessarily the ability to say, 'This bridge is going ahead. You've had your day in court, and that is finished. Any further applications will be regarded as vexatious.' Aboriginal people have had many disappointments under a whole range of ministers, but they admire honesty, integrity and, above all, strength. If this minister has any principle left, he ought to walk round to the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and put his resignation on the table. This bill and the actions of this government in order to pursue a vendetta for and on behalf of the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan), and in order to get themselves in position in respect of a forthcoming state election, uses and abuses the processes of the parliament. They are using their numbers to say to this minister, 'We don't trust you to exercise your discretion.' Consideration interrupted. NA",129
268,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",130
269,Mr ADAMS,ADJOURNMENT,"This week the Tasmanian Salmonid Growers Association has been up with another supply of salmon, and some members of this House have partaken in some of that. Members might also be aware that I have been known to cook a little salmon for members on my side of the House from time to time. Salmon is one of Tasmania's fundamental new farming products. It is a relatively new industry that is reliant on the fact that Tasmania is virtually disease free. The reason that I wish to speak tonight is that I am still very concerned about the future of this industry. We are still being held to ransom by the continued threat of imported fresh salmon from Canada. I was glad to hear the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) express his concerns on 11 September about the problems relating to cooked chicken, salmon and other such products to be imported. He understands the risks that Australia faces if such imports are permitted without very careful scrutiny. Yes, our quarantine decisions must be made on sound scientific and technical bases. Also, these decisions must flow from a proper process of risk assessment. We must have a consistent approach, as was recommended in the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. But I, like the member for Paterson, am concerned that AQIS's perception of risk management is sufficiently aware of the real risks of bringing in these other diseasesespecially to Tasmania, where even the fruit and vegetables from the mainland are brought in through strict quarantine barriers. Senator Paul Calvert was also sufficiently concerned to speak about AQIS' s findings on 31 October. He expressed the opinion: The decisions will have to be very well founded before I ever have anything to do with them or even give support to any of them. So I would like to remind honourable members that those members had those concerns, that any decision should be made on proper scientific grounds and that they should put the safety of Australia's industry first. Salmon I have heard that there is a move to trade off salmon for beef and sugar exportstherefore trading off a couple of seats in Tasmania. The honourable member for Braddon wants to be well aware of what some of his front-bench are up to. Mr Miles-I am.",130
270,Mr ADAMS,ADJOURNMENT,"I hope you playa positive role, then, on behalf of Tasmania. If that move were to happen, it would mean that Tasmania was once again going to be sacrificed. Where are our Tasmanian politicians who are protecting one of our prime industries? This is a most serious rumour. The health of our agriculture has no room for any trade-offs. We have to treat all our products with the same amount of care and caution. Australia is in the enviable position of having a relatively disease free environment. This is more than just a selling point for our produce. It means that we can keep a clean and healthy gene pool which other nations might be requiring to replace their stocks in the future. This is no accident, though. This has been brought about through careful planning and, up to now, a thorough and careful assessment of quarantine authorities and government policy not to take any unreasonable risks. That includes any deals with one product against another. Australia cannot afford it. Tasmania certainly cannot afford it. Nor can the world. There should be no risk to any of our industries diseases being introduced into Australia. Members should ensure that the quarantine regulations prevent our industries from coming decimated by disease. Tasmania leads the world in the best quality salmon produced anywhere. We are only small island down in the Southern Ocean. need some protection. We do not need those regulations to be lowered, whereby salmon from the Canadians can come in and put risk Tasmania's disease free status. Brisbane City Council",130
271,Mr HARDGRAVE,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I raise the issue of the Briscome bane City Council elections, which will be spent. held in March of next year. We know for sure it is on because the assault of the letterboxes has begun by the Labor Party. They are running so short of good things to say about their time in City Hall, Brisbane, they are writing letters to constituents in my electorate and spreading untruths. They are scarejob mongering and frightening people about matters relating to the initiatives of budget. In particular, I tum to a letter which been sent by Councillor Bailey of the rooka ward to residents in and around Toohey Forest, which is at the geographic heart Moreton electorate. It suggests, as a result of changes to training programs and funding arrangements, Toohey Forest will be badly served. Of course, this is absolute errant nonsense. Councillor Bailey does not want to acquaint himself with the facts-maybe he does not have them at his disposal. One thing I will compliment him on is the suggestion residents should write to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone)suggesting there is a job for the federal government as far as looking after the local environment is concerned. To the best of my knowledge, I do not believe any of my constituents have taken up Councillor Bailey's suggestion, proving they have seen right through his silly, scaremongering approaches. Of course, the fact is Toohey Forest is going to do far better under this government of than under the previous govetlfffient, when one looks at the proceeds which could come from the Natural Heritage Trust-a matter bebefore this place-and when one considers some of the very definite improvements which have occurred, like helping unemployed a people who are interested in working on We projects involving the environment. The failed schemes like NWOs, 10bskills and the landcare environment and action at program-LEAP, as it was known-may be gone, but taxpayers and the unemployed are certainly entitled to expect far better value for money, and they are going to get it under this Better assistance is going to for the large amount of dollars being The government has introduced a single brokered program to assist the most disadvantaged job seekers. The special employer support program will provide 20 weeks of training and work experience for disadvantaged job seekers who are unlikely to get a through participation in a training program or with the assistance of a wage subsithe federal dy. The Commonwealth Employment Service's advisory committee review of labour has market programs recommended the old Moo10bskills, LEAP and NWOs programs be amalgamated and replaced with one simpler of the and far more flexible program. When one looks at the facts, Councillor Bailey's assertion and scaremongering to the residents in and around Toohey Forest starts to fade away. Councillor Bailey's credibility on this issue is really under a great deal of pressure on another front. Students from Griffith University, which is located within Toohey Forest, were allocated to me earlier this year-the first ever political internship from Griffith University's public policy section. John Wanna, who is a prominent public policy academic at Griffith, worked with me and these students in making this project a great success. At my suggestion, they looked into the local impact of the previous government's employment programs in the electorate. It is interesting they managed to prove: while the application of local community groups and business organisations ensured local success of these programs on average was better than across the country, the Working Nation agenda was far too inflexible. In the course of their deliberations, they spoke to many people right across the community and had absolutely no problem as far as cooperation on the issue was concerneduntil they came to Councillor Bailey, who was apparently in charge of Brisbane City Council's LEAP agenda. Essentially, he was the slave master on what was essentially a slave trade of unemployed people doing work through Toohey Forest. Councillor Bailey repeatedly dismissed requests from these two students. In fact, they felt they were fobbed off on many occasions when they sought some accountability about the way the council was involved in acquitting funds from the federal government. If Councillor Bailey was so confident about the lasting success of these failed programs, why did he refuse them access to the information they were legitimately seeking? All in all, with the Brisbane City Council elections coming up in just a few months time, I can only imagine we are going to see more propaganda and more scaremongering. It makes me almost faint when I look at the expensive, full colour, 30to 40-page document the ratepayers of Brisbane have had to fund as part of the propaganda war the Labor Party is already waging in Brisbane. It is a very impressive document. It has lots of nice sentiment, but it is certainly ratepayers' going to the heart of the city council's campaign and being used and abused by the Labor Party. Dental Health Podiatry  Speaker, I do not know if you are like me and display great reluctance to go to your local dentist, but my local dentist, who is at Pendle Hill, is a very nice bloke and I have been going to him for some years. He is very polite, very helpful and very considerate, but I intensely dislike going to him. I recently went there-and I was shocked that I had not been there for some time-and copped a terrible lecture about how to clean my teeth; and I feel very chastened. The point I want to make is that in two relatively short visits I had two fillings done and an abscess attended to and the cost came to $320. I can well afford to pay that, but I am really raising this issue because of my concern for the frail aged in my community. As you know, the government is intent on abolishing-and will abolish-the dental health program as from the beginning of next year. There is no way pensioners in my electorate can afford to pay $320 to have their teeth looked at. Unfortunately, if teeth are not looked at you can contract a whole variety of diseases: halitosis, gingivitis, ulcerated mouth, abscesses, chronic infection, pain, sinus and, more particularly, the inability to chew properly, which leads to malnutrition. This program has been a very successful one. I asked a question of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) about how many clients had been able to utilise it. He told me that 140,000 utilised it in 1993-94, nearly half a million in 1994-95, and that we were expected to treat in 1996-and the minister is confident that his prediction will be met-656,000. What this means is that, with the abolition of this program, the frail aged in my community are often going to do without appropriate dental care. I do not believe that, as parliamentarians, we can feel comfortable funds about this situation. When people are old, often their gums shrink, causing problems with their dentures, and they may lose a tooth. Currently, under state run dental health programs, they may have to wait years to have this seen to. From 1997, as a result of this government, clearly things are going to get worse. I would also like to raise the issue of podiatry-that is, the care of toenails-for the frail aged. As they become infirm, they are unable to bend to reach their toenails. Currently, podiatry is not catered for under Medicare. I wish it was. I also wish dental care was. Unfortunately, there is an unwillingness by podiatrists to take up available positions because they can earn more money in private practice. We can all say, 'That is great competition policy; that is fair enough,' but unfortunately all too often the frail aged go without appropriate podiatry care. Some may feel that this is perhaps a trivial matter, but inappropriate care or a lack of care can lead to gangrene and, instead of having their nails clipped, people will have to have their toes or their feet taken off. I believe that a caring government has a responsibility to those in our society who made such a great contribution before we came here and who have made that contribution that allows us to enjoy our success. That is the definition of what the aged in our society have contributed. As a society we certainly have a responsibility to ensure that their needs, particularly their health needs, fully and adequately covered. Their care should not be an issue of whether they have sufficient money, but rather an issue of whether they have the need. United States of America",131
272,Mr ROSS CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"I note that the President of the United States has now accepted the result of the election and that Senator Bob Dole has indicated that he has conceded defeat on this occasion. I hope it is not a great breach of protocol or too great an impertinence to extend my congratulations to the President, though not as a Democrat. I have to acknowledge that had I been in the United States, were I a citizen, I would not have voted for him. I nonetheless acknowledge that as a leader of the free world, he has a critically important role to play in international affairs. While there has been something of a tradition amongst some members of this House, particularly on the other side, to rubbish the United States at every opportunity as an imperial power with no vestige of decency or principle, I am not one who ascribes to that view. I would certainly like to acknowledge the wonderful role that the United States played in providing a counterweight to what in my view was the true evil of Communism in the Eastern Bloc and the former Soviet Union. Had we not had the. Slfength of a superpower committed to democratic principles such as the United States to provide that counterweight throughout the period of the Cold War, we may be living in a quite different global environment today. I would also like to acknowledge my great satisfaction at the fact that the Republican revolution will continue and that it now seems certain that the Republicans will control both the Senate and the House of Representatives. In that context, I would like to acknowledge my debt to retiring Senator Mark Hatfield, who was the first two-term Governor of Oregon and went on to serve for over 25 years in the United States Senate, finally as Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He was the author of a book entitled are Between a rock and a hard place, in which he outlined some of his anguish at attempting to retain a sense of principle amidst the challenges and the day-today decisions of public life. That book was something of an inspiration to me as a young man. I was indebted to the senator when he was willing to give a Civics young boy from Sydney a go as a member of his staff back in 1987. That was certainly a seminal experience for me. I want to address an issue which the United States should perhaps raise in our minds-that is, the place of patriotism in the national life. There has been a view that patriotism or nationalism is a kind of social and international evil and that it can be blamed for many of the problems of the wars and the conflicts that we see in the world today. I want to take issue with that view and say that I believe that there is a proper place for an informed patriotic feeling and attachment to one's nation. One of the challenges we have to overcome as a people is that from the time of the settlement of the First Fleet there has been a tendency to denigrate, to look down upon our history and to feel some sense of inadequacy. In particular, over the past 13 years of government in this country there has been a feeling that the earliest life of this nation was something one ought to be embarrassed about. Again, it is not a view that I subscribe to. In fact, I think it is detrimental to the development of a nation, to a healthy concept of, and respect for, citizenship and for the general sense of industry, innovation and enterprise across the nation as a whole. I particularly want to draw the attention the House to the lack of a systematic attempt to train and teach young people in subjects name. such as civics in their high school so that they have a proper feeling for their national institubankruptcies tions, for the place of the rule of law and the role of a chamber such as this. In a 1993 Quadrant study of year 9 and 10 students, something like 70 per cent could not put name to the chamber in which I stand today. Concepts such as the constitutional monarchy and the relationship between the executive, the judiciary and the parliament are not well understood by Australian high school students. I would like to conclude with some comruptcies-in ments from the autobiography of Sir Garfield Barwick, one of my predecessors in the seat of Parramatta. In his autobiography, A radical tory, Sir Garfield recalls: ... at Crown Street School, I was taught a subject called ""Civics"" in which I learnt a great deal the structure of government, and that the law at its heart. I feel sure that by the time. I was I had a fair grasp of our system of parliamentary government and could understand much of the discussions in our house. Today children grow into adulthood without any proper education in governnot ment and are left to the paucity and imbalance newspaper information. Many become electors while still at school, still ignorant of the structure of the government they vote to elect. I endorse those comments. I salute the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), who set up a Council on Citizenship, and I urge reconsideration of the teaching of civics. (Time expired) Bankruptcy",133
273,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,ADJOURNMENT,"The Liberal Party talks a lot about small business, but when you get right down to it, when the mask comes off, it is after midnight, the defence has come down and the truth comes out, they always support big business. In this House I have spoken about the Federal Liberal Party's failure to protect small business retail tenants against shopping centre landlords and their failure to support Kim Beazley's private member's bill. I have spoken about the need to protect small business from the depravations of phoenix companies-people who run away from their of creditors by deliberate bankruptcies only to start up a similar enterprise under a new These failures are amongst the reasons why are soaring under this governfor ment. There were 4,000 or so per quarter or less until March this year and now they have really taken off. In the September quarter there were 5,421 bankruptcies-a disastrous result. The ABS chart shows a relatively steady number of bankruptcies from 1992 until 1996 and then the graph starts to take off straight up through the top of the page. Tonight I want to talk about the Victorian state Liberal Party's contributions to bankparticular, poker machines and open slather shop trading hours. Figures recently released show that in the city of Moreland, which I represent, the number of poker machines has just exploded-going from 4 I 0 gaming machines at 11 venues as about recently as March last year to 760 machines was at 16 venues in October of this year. This is nine fuelling bankruptcies at an alarming rate. The Premier sought to defuse this issue at the end of last year by saying that he would allow poker machines in shopping centres of and shopping complexes. Yet in Glenroy the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has given a permit to the Carlton Football Club Social Club to install 85 poker machines directly opposite and in direct competition with the Glenroy RSL. Enough is enough. I want to plead with the Liquor Licensing Commission, which is to hear this issue week, not to grant a liquor licence to this club. The Liquor Licensing Commission has a legal responsibility not to grant licences to debates. venues which are simply fronts for poker machines. It is blindingly obvious that the Carlton Football Club has simply set this venue up for the purpose of sucking money out of the Glenroy community. This is just charade. The real Carlton social club is, course, at Optus Oval. I also want to urge the state government apply a moratorium to further poker machines in Victoria. Everywhere I talk to small nesses and retailers, the damage they are focus. taking from poker machines is immense. It is time to put a stop to it. Finally, I want to express my grave disappointment with the state government's just passed legislation to deregulate shop trading hours. Open slather shop trading hours have simply two impacts. The first concentrates market share in the hands of big retailers who swallow up small retailers and small business. The second Christian forces small business and shop assistants work on Sundays and at all hours of the day or night for little or no extra reward. I would have thought that as legislators we are trying to provide social progress and trying to improve the lives of ordinary people. Surely this is just a step backwards. I know that in the city of Moreland small businesses are afraid of losing market share if they go it alone against Sunday trading. call on the chambers of commerce to get together with neighbouring chambers of the commerce, and I call on the city of Moreland to get together with neighbouring municipalia ties such as Darebin, Moonee Valley and perhaps Hume council. I call on them to look at joint action or to hold a referendum which could keep Sunday trading out of our area. That could protect family life, protect the quality of our community life and protect small businesses from rising Lyons Forum bankruptcies. Lyons Forum",134
274,Mr MILES,ADJOURNMENT,Braddon-Parliamentary purpose Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (7.55 p.m.)-Tonight I rise to speak to put on next the record a few things about the Lyons Forum. It seems to attract a lot of attention from the opposition over there in a range of Mr Andrew Thomson-And the ABC.,135
275,Mr MILES,ADJOURNMENT,"-Yes, as I am reminded by my colleague here, the member for Wentworth, it a attracts attention from the ABC from time to of time. The Lyons Forum was established by a group of people in the coalition in 1992. It has around 50 members at the moment. It was to established for one clear purpose: to support families and to provide a focus for families in busithe federal parliament. That .-s the prime Some members came in here today and talked about the spiritual beliefs of members of the Lyons Forum. I know that some people in this place are not very well informed. Obviously there are a lot on the opposition side who are not very well informed. Maybe they are talking about the Parliamentary Fellowship. I am not sure about that. to The Lyons Forum has a stated set of beliefs. I will read them out so that people are quite clear on this. Firstly, the members of the forum believe that the family is the fundamental unit of society and is the prime agency for the total development of children. You would really wonder why the Labor Party would come in here and criticise us for standing up for that belief: that we think that children ought to be nurtured and cared for in I a loving relationship. But the Labor Party come in here and try to run down members of Lyons Forum. It is just a bit strange why they want to reject the idea that the family is fundamental unit of society. Secondly, we believe that marriage provides the environment in which nurturing of children can best be undertaken. Thirdly, we believe that the well-being of the family is essential to the stability, morale, security and prosperity of the Australian nation. Fourthly, we believe that the government, through its activities, should promote the family as a fundamental unit of society. They are our beliefs. I think they very clearly state the of the forum. There is no doubt that we are active in regard to ideas in promoting those beliefs within the government. Clearly, we stand for the family as being a structure in our society; an institution which we believe is very important. There were comments made this afternoon in regard to people within the Lyons Forum having spiritual beliefs. That may well be the case. I have no doubt about that. But the group is not based on that whatsoever. To impute that to the Lyons Forum is a total misunderstanding of what the Lyons Forum is about. The forum will continue to promote the ideas about the nurturing of children and trying to provide a very positive environment for young people to grow up in. As our motto states: 'The foundation of a nation's greatness is in the homes of its people'. Another way of talking about that is to say, 'I believe that family really is the fourth tier of government.' Young people need to grow up in families learning values about society, learning to respect each other, learning to care about and to nurture each other, learning to play different roles and to work in different capacities with other people as part of a team. As we move into the broader community, we encounter the rules, regulations and laws that local, state and federal governments have tried to put in place for the betterment of the order of our society. If young people, children, have not been taught to work within a team within a family, they find it much more difficult to work within the rules which govern local, state or federal government. The family is a fundamental unit for transmitting values which are very important for a progressive society: one in which young people learn to give and take in discussion, one in which they learn that they do not always get their own way-sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. They learn that there are authority figures in our society and that there are structures in which they have to operate. The Lyons Forum is a group of people who have a very deep concern about making sure that the family remains an important structure in our society, not just in regard to moral issues. Prior to the last election we did suggest that we have a taxation system in which there was a change in the tax-free threshold as children become part of a family structure. That is part of the government's position in this budget. It is a billion-dollar program. It is an excellent program. (Time expired)",135

My starting point was other than starting point, as I have explained to many who essentially, individuals have residing within which should not be overridden by the state. relation to this matter, however, a number of upon that starting position.

And they already find within medical are willing to facilitate the execution of that choice. I understand that surveys within the Australian minority of doctors are prepared currently where they accept that the patient is suffering decision to bring their life to an end and do such doctors as murderers; our society does admittedly have carried out such procedures For example, within our own ranks, Dr Andrews bill, says that he himself has twice it be that somebody who asserts their right stands, can come before this parliament and say to patients who seek it under One of the most eloquent contributions to editorial, my own home newspaper.

This is probably correct. Loopholes will be found. But will they be any greater than the 'loophole' which euthanasia, by any other name, is now being committed, basis? That is a very compelling case.

This is a very important debate. about whether we, as Australians, accept 'actively' - and intentionally killing another to live. While public debate about this topic has is, within our community there are very widely This diversity of opinion has been reflected I have received. Our views about 'death' are it is easy to get caught up amongst the emotive responsibility as national law makers, as elected clinically and factually as possible. Firstly, the Commonwealth parliament is intentionally or not, the Northern Territory's all Australians. Attempts by Chief Minister Stone bill to Territorians are only farcical.

The most obvious eXlllYlple of that who supports the Andrews bill yet has himself and perhaps more passive instances, in the people like Margaret Tighe, who is present and and many others who I believe have come my conclusion is that this measure should be today in the national parliamentparliament-in a debate about the Euthanasia It is a debate about 'death'.

However, the Northern 1995 goes one step further by allowing a doctor to a patient with the intention of bringing about means the right to be killed on request. Experience in the Netherlands has demonstrated is profoundly corrupting and ultimately uncontrollable. in the Netherlands, but it has been openly practised act in accordance with a number of formal criteria I disagree with the previous speaker that it the doctors. We have seen in so many law something--codifying a moral issue, codifying parameters for people to argue legally in a do not believe that in this instance codification The guidelines for euthanasia are supposed physical illness and who make a voluntary evidence that these guidelines have been flouted. at Cambridge University, recently ... the Dutch experience provides weighty evidence killing without request. And that is my argument about codifying the said: The (Dutch) guidelines require a free well-considered disputed that thousands of Dutch patients have been the killing of disabled babies.
